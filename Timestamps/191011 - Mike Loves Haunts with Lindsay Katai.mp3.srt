1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
dog.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It scares. It's Mike Love's Haunts on Hauntcast The Fright.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:01:04,680
Welcome to Hauntcast The Fright, the Hauntcast about scream parks ghost-hosted by three headless

5
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:14,680
men in their 30s. I'm Rod Skardner joined by Mike Coffinson. I updated that one and Jason

6
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,680
Skeleton. Why tamper with a classic?

7
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,680
Jason Skeleton.

8
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,680
We've all been saying it all year.

9
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,680
Yeah, I was sitting over here going like, oh, I gotta make one real quick. Okay, he's gonna come to me.

10
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:35,680
Oh no, I took care of it for you. I will raise the fake names for you.

11
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:46,680
This is the first official Hauntcast The Fright. It's an abridged Hauntcast The Fright for anyone who's been asking us about programming information.

12
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,680
We got a lot of stuff going on. We got our live tour coming up, so we got those episodes to do.

13
00:01:51,680 --> 00:02:02,680
We're dying to see you. We're doing two Hauntcasts here on the main feed and two on the Patreon.

14
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Patreon.com.

15
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,680
And if I can issue a spooky correction, the Six Flags one will be out by this point.

16
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,680
It will.

17
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Yeah, I guess so. We've determined today.

18
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,680
We could also change it.

19
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,680
We could also change it.

20
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,680
My scary voice is Don Pardo. It's behind the paywall.

21
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:41,680
Well, okay, whether or not it's out, if it's out already or will be soon, behind the paywall, Mike is going to fill us in on a trip that he took to Six Flags Magic Mountains.

22
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,680
Right. Best trip that he took with a friend of the show, Anthony Geo.

23
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,680
And you put it behind the paywall.

24
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Well, you don't have to say why.

25
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,680
Well, you know, sometimes the paywall, there's a freedom you get.

26
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,680
There's a feeling of freedom you have when you're behind a paywall.

27
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,680
And then he's just, you know, this is a pretty we're pretty honest.

28
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,680
We're pretty candid on this main feed.

29
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
But you know what?

30
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,680
If you want to get a little raw, if you really want to dish it, like if you want to tell it how it is, that's where you go to the second.

31
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,680
That's where you go to the second gate for.

32
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,680
So you want to get the dirt about Six Flags Fright Fest, go to the Patreon, go to the podcast, the Ride the Second Gate.

33
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:34,680
I know that the Patreon is where we've revealed pretty like grimy truths like that marijuana will fry your brain and crack and cocaine.

34
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,680
I don't remember this was any specific warnings enough.

35
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,680
Alcohol fills your world with lies.

36
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,680
That's something that we have in the McGruff episode.

37
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,680
I think most of them fill your world with lies.

38
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,680
But alcohol, that's a main characteristic.

39
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
Sure. Yeah.

40
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:58,680
Yeah. Well, I guess if it fills your world with lies, if you're at a bar instead of home with your family or if you like said like, oh, Mom, I'm at an emergency.

41
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
And then you're actually you were actually at a bar and you're lying to your wife.

42
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,680
That would be a way alcohol fills your world with lies.

43
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,680
I guess you could also say, you know, probably you tell yourself lies to it could fill your literal world with lies.

44
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
So maybe you're saying I'm fine.

45
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,680
Everything's fine.

46
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Cocaine makes people want to start a small business or write that fucking screenplay.

47
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,680
You know, that's not in the game, man.

48
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Let's get back in the game, baby.

49
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,680
That should be in McGruff's cocaine song.

50
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Do some cocaine and get started on a screenplay.

51
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Do just enough to be industrious.

52
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,680
Make some money and give it up for good.

53
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,680
Yeah, very practical uses of drugs.

54
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,680
He knows he had screenwriter friends.

55
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Micro dosing LSD is good for your mental health.

56
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,680
Look it up.

57
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,680
It's true.

58
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,680
Give you a boost to see.

59
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,680
I expect to be doing McGruff talk, which is nice to nice to do.

60
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,680
But, you know, so subscribe to the page and you'll get that that McGruff episode, which still delights me to think about.

61
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,680
But also your your candid thoughts are what you're saying.

62
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Maybe if we had to extend the logic of what you're saying, that the freedom of the second gate is also is maybe where we eventually talk about the ride race through New York with Jimmy.

63
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Oh, you know, that's a good idea.

64
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,680
Honestly, yes.

65
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,680
Maybe applying that logic, that might be a perfect second gate episode.

66
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Just to be just to see it free.

67
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
It's just we're looser there.

68
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Yes, looser.

69
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Really?

70
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,680
We can get a little body here, you know, in that paywall.

71
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:50,680
But but anyway, we're here on the main feed with haunt cast the fright where first we want to kick things off by talking about the spookiest, the most frightening experience in all of theme park world.

72
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:58,680
The Disney Skyliner transportation, industrial transportation accidents.

73
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:05,680
Yeah, I mean, it's still unexplained power crises.

74
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,680
What happened in the Skyliners, kids?

75
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,680
It's worse than doing crack and cocaine and alcohol and marijuana and paint combined.

76
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,680
They don't got air conditioning.

77
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Number one, you're throwing three hours of your life away.

78
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,680
Test ventilation, evacuating in a cherry picker.

79
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Ain't no fun.

80
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,680
The Reedy Creek Fire Department says stay away from this airborne menace.

81
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,680
As a completist, I would like to ride in the Reedy Creek Fire Department cherry picker.

82
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Yeah.

83
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,680
Yeah, at some point in time, you might get on our trip, you might get called on as an emergency volunteer firefighter.

84
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
I possibly.

85
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,680
Yeah, you can finally use your training from childhood.

86
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
What?

87
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
I don't know. Were you a boy scout?

88
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
Oh, I was a boy scout.

89
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Yeah, yeah.

90
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
Still a leap in my book.

91
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Oh, I guess so.

92
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,680
He was.

93
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
He's Jason.

94
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Therefore, Jason's a firefighter.

95
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Yeah, I guess you're right.

96
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:09,680
But if you don't know what we're talking about, we're still we're just days away as we record this from the.

97
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Well, the grand debut and the grand undoing of Disney World's new gondola system.

98
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
Yeah.

99
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
Within the week.

100
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
Within the week.

101
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
Of its official opening.

102
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:33,680
Yeah, I literally had like I subscribed to like four or five different theme park newsletters and I still had unread ones in my inbox saying the skylighter is open.

103
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,680
As I was getting the ones that said Skyliner accident, Skyliner closed indefinitely.

104
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,680
So now let's let's be clear.

105
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
Let's rule some if you don't know about the story.

106
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
I haven't read about it already.

107
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,680
Let's rule some things out.

108
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Had did a full car or two fall off the wire into the lake?

109
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
No.

110
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Did one go flying into the pop century hotel?

111
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
No, no.

112
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Was there a was there a fire?

113
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
No, no.

114
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,680
Was there a crash?

115
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
Yes.

116
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
Sort of.

117
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
Yeah.

118
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Yeah.

119
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,680
Here's one thing I can definitely confirm from on Twitter.

120
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,680
Local Orlando news reporter Greg Angel said, just heard from Disney spokesman.

121
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:27,680
They tell us there has not been an accident and there's a quote unexpected doubt time on the Skyliner gondolas.

122
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,680
And that's all they could say at that time.

123
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,680
So your eyes and ears deceive you, ladies and gentlemen.

124
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:44,680
If you ever thought a major corporation in a day and age where everyone has a very good camera in their pocket to display this.

125
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,680
What I see.

126
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,680
Line up of.

127
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,680
This is a five.

128
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,680
This is a five Skyliner pile of.

129
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,680
This is a Skyliner fuck up.

130
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,680
They're going to need to devote a roving helicopter reporter to give hourly updates.

131
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,680
Skyliner traffic updates on the fives so that we know whether we can get on this damn thing or not.

132
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
Yeah.

133
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,680
So here's what we do know.

134
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,680
It was confirmed there was not a power issue.

135
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,680
Oh, OK.

136
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
So what?

137
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,680
Who confirmed that?

138
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,680
Can we trust the source?

139
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:23,680
Disney tweeted out no accident accident in all caps and seven exclamation points.

140
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,680
They consulted Trump on how to do it.

141
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,680
The crooked WDWNT media.

142
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,680
It's nothing but lies.

143
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:40,680
Cobbling together from Screamscape, Theme Park Insider, Disney tourist blog and Inside the Magic.

144
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:47,680
Here's what seems to be the verdict that at the Riviera station, a station at a yet to open hotel.

145
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
What's that say?

146
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,680
What the hell is Riviera?

147
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,680
Yeah, that is the new DVC hotel opening in December.

148
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,680
I believe it also services Caribbean.

149
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:07,680
There's technically considered one of two at Caribbean Beach, not the main Caribbean Beach one that is sort of like the dispatch center where you change lines.

150
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,680
So this is the one on the far side, but is called the Riviera station.

151
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,680
A aqua colored gondola cabin did not attach to the cable.

152
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,680
So this is a cable car system.

153
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
The cable is constantly moving.

154
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:32,680
And then when it gets into the station, they get off the cable and onto a track where they can control like the speed of that.

155
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,680
And then it can get back on the cable when it gets sent out.

156
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,680
So it did not correctly get back on the cable, causing multiple yellow gondolas to pile up behind it.

157
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,680
Crunching, crushing, shattering, plexiglass.

158
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,680
I bet Disney would not approve of any of those words.

159
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,680
Hugging, caressing, showing physical affection towards.

160
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Hundreds of people stuck in a non moving skyliner for hours.

161
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,680
Also seems to be unclear what they were given.

162
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:15,680
It seems like two park tickets, taxi vouchers, and either a $100 gift card or a $200 gift card.

163
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
Conflicting reports are out there.

164
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,680
I do feel like there's probably a negotiation that happened.

165
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
Some people just wanted to get out of there.

166
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
They probably took the first offer.

167
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,680
Maybe they complained and some other people complained and then they got the $200.

168
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,680
I mean, I might complain at my hotel if this major transportation system is not running.

169
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Well, yeah. So let's talk about that.

170
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Let's make let's talk about how this affects us.

171
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
Yeah, I think we wanted to experience that.

172
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
Jason, you've been talking about this forever.

173
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
You were so excited about the Skyliner.

174
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,680
I love it because it hits up.

175
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,680
It stops at hotels that I can afford to stay at.

176
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,680
And the bus system, notably kind of slow.

177
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,680
I mean, I honestly haven't had terrible experiences with a bus system.

178
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:08,680
But if you can ride a boat or a monorail or a out to a brand new view with your favorite characters painted on it.

179
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,680
The problem with, of course, the characters is those you don't want to get on because you can't see outside the wrap.

180
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,680
You want to be behind one with characters that you like.

181
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,680
You want to see Coco going on a journey in front of you.

182
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,680
Right. But you don't want to be in one that has Coco behind you.

183
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
Well, there's an exchange, though.

184
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,680
If you are in a clear, regular gondola, you get really good pictures.

185
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,680
But if your other gondola, it's slightly cooler due to the wrap.

186
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
Oh, interesting.

187
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
The wrap blocks out some sun.

188
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,680
It's like the UV on the sunglass.

189
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,680
It's like an extra on your car.

190
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
Right.

191
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,680
This has been a whole thing because there's no air conditioning in there.

192
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,680
And this is a CHEPAC cost cutting measure, is it not?

193
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
Well, I looked up that, too.

194
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,680
So this gondola, the company who makes these gondolas, I believe it's pronounced Doppelmeyer,

195
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,680
they've installed, they say, thousands of these around the world.

196
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,680
The only one that is air conditioned is at a wind resort in Macau.

197
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:13,680
Now, Macau also notorious for pulling in seven times the money Vegas does.

198
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
Wow, really?

199
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,680
It's like also seven times the humidity is the joke I read about it.

200
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,680
We have to do a Macau episode.

201
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,680
Or episodes.

202
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,680
Macau is an interesting place.

203
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,680
We got to get much nicer suits to even walk around.

204
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,680
Yeah.

205
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,680
Yeah, we got to dress and grow a little thin.

206
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,680
We got to look like dirty rotten scoundrels.

207
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,680
Oh, yeah. That's doable.

208
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
Cool hats.

209
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
Interesting.

210
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
So what's the climate there?

211
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,680
I think it's very, I think not dissimilar to Orlando, but everyone is hyper rich.

212
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
So it is.

213
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,680
So it's a luxury.

214
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,680
So it is a CHEPAC cost cutting.

215
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:00,680
But in other parts of Asia, they have these with the same cooling system as this.

216
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,680
Which is just like, it's open at the top.

217
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,680
A fan.

218
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
Openings, yeah.

219
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,680
And you pick up, you get a cool breeze as it moves.

220
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,680
CHEPAC also cut the improvisers, droids, and pop-up stunt shows from each cabin.

221
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
Skyliner, yeah.

222
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,680
Yeah, son of a bitch.

223
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,680
And the rescue Bontas.

224
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,680
Yeah, Bonta just stuck at the end of a cherry picker.

225
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
Just screaming at you.

226
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,680
He raises his tongue and you climb aboard.

227
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,680
Oh, man.

228
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,680
So yeah, Skyliner incident.

229
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
They can't deny the term incident.

230
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,680
It's certainly an incident.

231
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,680
I don't think they can.

232
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
No.

233
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,680
It seems like today, it's Tuesday as we record this, they were running.

234
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,680
Not letting people on, but they were moving, like they were testing it.

235
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,680
So people stuck for three hours.

236
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,680
People described it as a traumatic experience.

237
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:04,680
And what I'm driving towards is that Jason and I, you were so excited about all this.

238
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,680
We're going to Orlando soon, as the listener knows, and please go see us.

239
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,680
And we like, I had a different hotel and you were so excited.

240
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,680
And I was like, I do want to be at an official Disney hotel.

241
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:21,680
Your excitement convinced me also to get, we should be on a hotel along the Skyliner line.

242
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,680
And it occurs to me that I have not told Erin about this story.

243
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,680
And this is how she's finding out about it right now.

244
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,680
So Erin, if you're listening, that gondola thing, people did get stuck for three hours.

245
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,680
And how much do we want to risk it and get on this thing?

246
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:42,680
I also looked up what had been recently refurbished in the more value to moderate,

247
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,680
what had been refurbished, what was well reviewed,

248
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,680
what had solid amenities for kind of a run and gun sort of trip.

249
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,680
And that affected my decision.

250
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,680
You're staying in the 1880s wing of the centuries.

251
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,680
I wish. I wish art of animation had indeed been, I think it was supposed to be 1910,

252
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,680
or 1900 to 1940 or 1910 to 1940.

253
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Can you imagine like the pop culture, like the yellow kid walking around?

254
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Oh my God.

255
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
What even is?

256
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,680
Can I flip a switch so she'll be coming around the mountain plays before I go to sleep?

257
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680
Yeah, I don't even know.

258
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,680
That encamped on races.

259
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,680
Yeah.

260
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,680
So yeah.

261
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,680
So what do you think? Are you going to get on it?

262
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,680
Oh, I'm a hundred percent.

263
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,680
This just makes me want to ride it more.

264
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,680
I am not a dare.

265
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,680
I don't take a lot of chances in my life.

266
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:46,680
So riding the crunch machine at Disney World, this is like living on the edge for me.

267
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,680
It feels like when you're as a vending machine and all like the bags back up

268
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,680
and like start crunching together because like the things unfurl in a bad way.

269
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,680
I was already because I don't like the thing I don't like is like slow dangling that it does.

270
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,680
Like that's a fear of heights thing.

271
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:10,680
We did the Ferris wheel and I had a little bit of a panic attack and I was having the feeling like,

272
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,680
oh, maybe I'm going to do this, but maybe I'm going to have the panic attack.

273
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,680
Then I saw that apparently the thing shoots you up.

274
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,680
People were saying you got to pick up speed.

275
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,680
You pick up. You shoot.

276
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,680
You like have a launch.

277
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,680
Oh, yeah.

278
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:30,680
It's like 15 miles an hour, maybe 15 to 20 miles an hour launch up.

279
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,680
Which is a fine speed, but to suddenly be at the speed.

280
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,680
Yeah. So like with no restraints, I feel like, oh, that's going to freak me out.

281
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,680
And then potentially you're going at zero miles per hour for three hours.

282
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,680
Yes, that is. Yeah, that's true.

283
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,680
So I mean, they could be looking already.

284
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:59,680
I think there's a lot of people speculating that like they might start retrofitting these with air conditioners because like thankfully this incident happened between 8 and 9 p.m.

285
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,680
So it was at least a little cooler in that sense.

286
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:08,680
But at a certain point they did tell people lift up the seats, crack open those emergency kits.

287
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
People had to go to the emergency.

288
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,680
We've seen pictures of them as bags of water.

289
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:22,680
And there was a oddly a note a note pad laid that with on the front to write down when you start calling lawyers office to write down who you like.

290
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,680
The big word on the front of the notepad was universal.

291
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:33,680
Really? Really? It was the brand of it's not like it was affiliated with Universal Studios, but just they oddly bought universal brand.

292
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
That's wild. Notebooks.

293
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:41,680
I did not find I checked eBay as soon as I read about the emergency kits did not find any on eBay.

294
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:50,680
But Jenny Nicholson had a very funny tweet about a certain blog cracking open an emergency kit a few days before.

295
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:56,680
Like not just during like the regular operation to go like here's to do it.

296
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,680
To do an unboxing video is what she said.

297
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,680
Yes. Let me ask.

298
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,680
Can I throw a few scenarios out for doing this?

299
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,680
Say the thing opens the day where they reopened the day were there.

300
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,680
Do you get on it right away?

301
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Yeah.

302
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,680
OK.

303
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,680
Say it might go down again.

304
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,680
Say it opens tomorrow and there's another accident in a week and then it's open the day were there.

305
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,680
Do you go on it again?

306
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,680
I think yes.

307
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,680
Just because like at this point I just have to know.

308
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
I just have to know.

309
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:41,680
I mean I was at I was at universal the month after Gringotts opened and that broke down so much.

310
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:49,680
And I finally got on it like the very last day like with hours left of the park being open and wait at like three three and a half hours.

311
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
I see.

312
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,680
My answer is I'm going to play it by ear.

313
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,680
We'll see what's happening.

314
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,680
That's very reasonable.

315
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,680
I would not if anyone was skeptical of this.

316
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:04,680
I'll say this if there's still issues with it when I check in those resort fees are gone.

317
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Like that is the first thing.

318
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:12,680
Oh yeah because you get excited to have any reason to say get those resort fees out.

319
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,680
I would prefer nothing go wrong and I have a great experience.

320
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,680
So you're going to argue that you came to Disney World to do the skyline.

321
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:31,680
I'm going to argue that I booked a Skyliner specific hotel which its historic people have been tracking hotel prices and they clearly bumped up the rates at Skyliner hotels.

322
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Oh interesting.

323
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
Yeah.

324
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,680
OK well I guess you probably have a little bit of a case there.

325
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
Yeah.

326
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
So I mean we'll see.

327
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:47,680
In one scenario a fun ride in one scenario and another you lose an entire day because there aren't enough cherry pickers to do.

328
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,680
But can you it's got.

329
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,680
Can you imagine the content I would get out of getting stuck on the skyline.

330
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,680
You would have to do suffer for my art.

331
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
You would have to do what we talked about.

332
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,680
I forget if we talked about this on the show or not but you and I were on Jordan Jesse go.

333
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,680
Yes.

334
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:15,680
And they record in an older office building where there was a big like thump and we could not get any of the buttons to work or a door to the elevator.

335
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:27,680
Yes we got stuck in the elevator for a little while and it didn't it didn't take that long but there was a moment where you said like well you were almost like well this is our night.

336
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,680
Nobody was there.

337
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,680
It was like it could have taken like hours and hours to get us out of there.

338
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,680
We talked about how we I think we would have thought all right let's who can we call.

339
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,680
How do we get somebody here.

340
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,680
I'm thought to let's start recording a podcast right now.

341
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,680
Jason and I stuck in an elevator.

342
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:47,680
So if you get stuck on the skyliner you have to immediately begin record just a voice.

343
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,680
I hope everyone forgive me.

344
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,680
But yeah or I mean Instagram live Twitter live.

345
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,680
Yeah yeah yeah.

346
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
Yeah yeah.

347
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,680
And you can be you should commit to as long as you can before the battery runs out.

348
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
Oh absolutely.

349
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,680
I guess with the live broadcast that's going to be toast in like 15 minutes.

350
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Well I always carry like a charging battery.

351
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,680
So I will smart I will keep everything like I will.

352
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:21,680
And you can maybe hotwire some of the power assuming the power isn't gone just to try to reroute something from your gondola car into your phone.

353
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,680
I mean start yanking shit and playing up plug it in like crack a window open.

354
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,680
Slide a door open.

355
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,680
Dangle my feet out.

356
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:34,680
I have a feeling it's only a matter of time before doors start just opening on this thing like the monorail in Florida.

357
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Yeah that's the other thing the monorail has had so many like odd incidents of like stopping between stuff or power failures in the last couple of years.

358
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
Crashes.

359
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
Yeah.

360
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
Yeah.

361
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,680
The fatality.

362
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
Terrible ones.

363
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Yeah.

364
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,680
But so far only one accident in the first week of the skyliner.

365
00:22:53,680 --> 00:23:00,680
Let's see if not only if there are more but if we are part of the short incident number two or three or four.

366
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,680
I would not I would not hold it against you guys to not go anywhere near this thing.

367
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,680
I'm probably going to do it but I'm going to be a little fearful.

368
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,680
I volunteers tribute.

369
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,680
I volunteer to be to the capital.

370
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,680
This is the bravest I've ever seen you.

371
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:22,680
I like a new transportation system and it's high up.

372
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,680
I mean you know I got to be up there maybe.

373
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,680
And you might get quoted in the Orlando Sentinel.

374
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,680
Yeah and I might get quoted and I might get a three hundred dollar gift card because I put my foot.

375
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,680
Yeah.

376
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
Yeah.

377
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
Well I hope so.

378
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:39,680
Mike if you were to do it that would make sense because you've been on a bit of a bravery streak.

379
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Yeah sure.

380
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
You may love it.

381
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,680
It remains to be seen whether you love getting trapped in skyliners.

382
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:56,680
But one thing we do know and I forget if we've talked about this or not on the podcast but apparently I what I'm seeing in my notes is you love haunts.

383
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,680
Yeah I feel like I mentioned it like a year ago maybe.

384
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Sure.

385
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Also I mean we talked about Buffett's plane the hemisphere dancer which Bono was in to make a mistake.

386
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,680
I just have like a checklist of like when are we going to get to that on the podcast.

387
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,680
Yeah I mean we're going to do like a full episode.

388
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,680
I feel like it's one of those things where I feel like I've mentioned it but I probably haven't just because.

389
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,680
Maybe.

390
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,680
Yeah so yeah just in case you guys didn't know I love haunts and Jamaica Mistake was written about the hemisphere dancer.

391
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,680
Oh my god.

392
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,680
Jenny Buffett's plane that's parked outside of Margarita Valley Orlando.

393
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,680
And you're clearly not prepared.

394
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,680
I can't believe I'm asking you this but talk about haunts Mike.

395
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
Yeah fine fine.

396
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,680
Talk about haunts unless you need a minute which case I have two Skyliner maps that I didn't even get around to.

397
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,680
Describe a map.

398
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
Describe a map.

399
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
Let's keep this episode rolling.

400
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,680
Alright you went to you've been to two haunts well three six nights which you're about on the Patreon.

401
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,680
Yes there's too much too many haunts to contain in one episode.

402
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,680
I was going to say you've been a big brave boy.

403
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:10,680
Yes I continue my streak of being big and brave and as I said on the Patreon I've had to enlist new podcast partners in order to go to these haunts.

404
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Mike not Mike that's you.

405
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,680
Scott and Jason nowhere to be seen.

406
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,680
Nowhere to be seen not even not even a chance.

407
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,680
I feel like there's not even a chance.

408
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Maybe I'll go to one of those.

409
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,680
No I think we're talking like we don't even respond to the texts.

410
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
We're out we're hard out.

411
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,680
Yes hard out.

412
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,680
It's not just me don't you feel like I think this is a bonding between you and I Jason.

413
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,680
I think so.

414
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,680
These same attitude.

415
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:43,680
After last year I was like maybe next year and I just I just wasn't feeling it.

416
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,680
I just wasn't ready this time around.

417
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Well look you know in my defense there's so many great entertainment options at home.

418
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,680
Pluto TV has an all American gladiators channel.

419
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,680
Really.

420
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:04,680
Adams Family channel and all Baywatch channel not to keep bringing that up but with a myriad of entertainment options at home.

421
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,680
Why would I yet let teenagers scream at me.

422
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
Yeah why.

423
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,680
Now Mike can you tell us.

424
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,680
We actually walked the dog and we talked about Pluto TV for a while.

425
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
Pluto TV.

426
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,680
Yeah Pluto's on the brain.

427
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,680
What is Adams Family all the different the cartoon version the original version and the movies.

428
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,680
No no no John Astin.

429
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
It's just the original version.

430
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,680
Yeah it's just yeah.

431
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
That's fun though.

432
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:31,680
They just like randomize episode they go in and I think it's because of because it's October they put on a spooky channel.

433
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,680
There does seem to be year round an all wall burgers channel.

434
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:47,680
It is becoming like people's parody of what people where people we thought cable was going that there is you can you're skimming through like 153 wall burgers.

435
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
That's it.

436
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,680
So is there ever like wall burgers behind the scenes commentaries wall burgers the movie.

437
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,680
It's no it's only the show wall burgers over and over again.

438
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,680
So Pluto TV is truly the future.

439
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:07,680
I would have to say so sort of the future we all envision depending on how much wall burgers you wanted in your future.

440
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,680
Then yeah the future is now.

441
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
Well that sounds fun.

442
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:16,680
I'm glad you were having a good time while I was at these haunts watching great television.

443
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,680
So yes let's start with horror nights.

444
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,680
There's a lot to get through so I'll just try to hit universal universal Hollywood horror nights.

445
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:32,680
Now I am going we're going to do Lindsay and I are going to do Orlando Horror Nights which I was under the impression was more hardcore than the one in Los Angeles.

446
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:44,680
But I don't think you'll mind me saying this guest friend of the show Zach Ryder went to Horror Nights for two hours out here and he had already done Orlando and he said scarier out here.

447
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,680
Everything was scarier out here.

448
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,680
Really?

449
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,680
He said the scare actors were much more intense.

450
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,680
He felt like it was more hardcore so I was wrong about that.

451
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,680
So I guess I'm going into some sort of a lightweight scare zone in Orlando.

452
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,680
So anyway Jason and Scott are not.

453
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,680
We will do something else.

454
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,680
Maybe that's our night to get stuck in the Skyliner.

455
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
Oh maybe.

456
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Yeah that's yes I mean you get stuck somewhere.

457
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,680
You could get stuck in the hemisphere.

458
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,680
Dinner takes too long at Cal Fish.

459
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,680
You could get in the hemisphere.

460
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,680
You could get stuck in the hemisphere.

461
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,680
We could get stuck in the hemisphere.

462
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,680
While it's flying over Jamaica.

463
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,680
It's really the original.

464
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,680
The original airborne trapped story.

465
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
Yeah.

466
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,680
So I got this very nicely invited by universal.

467
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,680
There was a red carpet for Horror Nights.

468
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Oh right.

469
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,680
Immediately excited because who did I spot on the red carpet but Mr. Dan Aykroyd.

470
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,680
One of my favorite.

471
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Not playing the blues but wearing an outfit he would play the blues in.

472
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:53,680
A vest a purple dress shirt being interviewed because of course Ghostbusters is making its premiere at Horror Nights.

473
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,680
And which comes up just a couple of times.

474
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:05,680
I am pretty sure part of the deal of getting Ghostbusters was having the Crystal Head Vodka be an unofficial drink of Horror Nights.

475
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,680
Because I had it at Ante...

476
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Anahitos.

477
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,680
Is it Anahitos that's how you pronounce it.

478
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,680
And then I also had it at the actual event.

479
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:24,680
So he must have he's wheeling and dealing and he's trying to get that pure Crystal Head Vodka which is he said on Joe Rogan you know you can have you have six shots of it no hangover.

480
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:35,680
Like he's very clear it's pure and it's also poured over like mythical stones like there's magic stones they pour the vodka over and it's a whole thing and it's.

481
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
What where.

482
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,680
That's going to another we'll do a whole Patreon on the Crystal Head Vodka and Dan Aykroyd.

483
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,680
And I would be interested in the mysticization process.

484
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,680
Yeah I'm interested in the stones.

485
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,680
Yeah but I can't I should have written it down but anyway go to the Joe Rogan podcast.

486
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:56,680
We always recommend Joe Rogan's podcast on this podcast but I would go to listen to Dan Aykroyd's interview.

487
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:01,680
Also it'll be the day when we have a guest who has also been on the Joe Rogan podcast.

488
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,680
There's no crossover in that Vendetta.

489
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,680
Joe has an interview with Tony Baxter.

490
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,680
I don't believe so.

491
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Okay.

492
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,680
No no no.

493
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,680
We have Garland did it.

494
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,680
Garland did it?

495
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,680
Yeah yeah.

496
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,680
Oh no shit alright one wow.

497
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,680
One unifying element.

498
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,680
Wow well I'm proud of that.

499
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,680
Yeah so we do have a crossover.

500
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,680
Next stop Bernie Sanders.

501
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,680
Yeah we've got Sanders lined up for end of October to talk about Coney Island.

502
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
I didn't like it.

503
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,680
Too silly.

504
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
Don't look at it.

505
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
Unpleasant.

506
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Distracted from work.

507
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:41,680
So also on the red carpet you know Jason Blum and just a random Jabberwocky.

508
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,680
Now just one Jabberwocky.

509
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,680
I ran out of time to do both the shows at these both places.

510
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
I didn't see the Jabberwockys.

511
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,680
I did not see Brian Henson's Puppet Up.

512
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,680
Oh I have seen that before.

513
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,680
And people rave about it but we did not have time to do all of it.

514
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:05,680
I think I've talked about one of my first jobs was like an intern PA at the HBO Comedy

515
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,680
Festival and Puppet Up was like one of the big shows that year.

516
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:17,680
And so I had to help them pack up their like trunks of piles of puppets.

517
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Just piles of loose puppets in the trunks and stuff.

518
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,680
Wow then they weren't in there saying like watch it mister.

519
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,680
Nope.

520
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,680
It was just piles of muppet-y kind of puppets.

521
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
But everyone was really nice.

522
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Well that's good.

523
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:38,680
Anyway I think I'm going to go back to not so I'm going to do another scary forum night

524
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,680
before the season is over so I will see Puppet Up.

525
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,680
I will give a report.

526
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:48,680
So anyway so I went there with my buddy Horonites excuse me with my buddy Luke my childhood

527
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,680
friend.

528
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,680
He'll be on the show.

529
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,680
I think he should probably do the Tommy Bartlett's Robot World.

530
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,680
Wisconsin Dells episode.

531
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,680
Just calling that shot now.

532
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,680
Any time whenever we get to that.

533
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,680
And he is like a recent scare.

534
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,680
He was sort of a scaredy cat like I was.

535
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,680
We both grew up similar scaredy cat situations.

536
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,680
So we met up with Carly and eventually.

537
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Carly Weisel you're saying.

538
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,680
Carly Weisel and eventually Todd Martins from LA Times.

539
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
So we're a little.

540
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,680
She's a little theme park people know each other.

541
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,680
Yeah.

542
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
We're in a little group going.

543
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,680
And he is not a scare guy.

544
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,680
And neither is Carly.

545
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,680
So we went we immediately.

546
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:34,680
So the thing with Horonites in LA like a lot of the rides is you know it's about 20 minutes

547
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,680
plus to walk to the front to the downstairs area.

548
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
So we want to do good.

549
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,680
They were saying basically we're going to do Ghostbusters first maybe killer clowns.

550
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
And that's it.

551
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,680
We're out.

552
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,680
So we all walked down to Ghostbusters.

553
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Now Ghostbusters is the farthest away it possibly could be.

554
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
Is it on this back lot?

555
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
Yes.

556
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,680
So you have to walk all the way through the park down the the star.

557
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
Excuse me the.

558
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,680
Oh yeah.

559
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
The star way.

560
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
Oh motherfucker.

561
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Yeah.

562
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,680
And he goes no smoking on the star way.

563
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,680
That includes weed.

564
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,680
Don't sit on my stair edge.

565
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,680
I'll slice your butt.

566
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,680
I'm coughing now from doing that.

567
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,680
I wanted to do more.

568
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,680
There was McGruff earlier.

569
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
We got to be careful with the instruments.

570
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
Yeah.

571
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,680
So so so I went down the star way.

572
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
Don't do it.

573
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,680
Don't try doing Jimmy Durante.

574
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,680
I leave that to Jason.

575
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,680
So I also silenced everyone so we could hear the announcement say weed.

576
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,680
I was like weed.

577
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,680
And then it said weed and I was very excited.

578
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,680
So we did Jurassic World.

579
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,680
I didn't know that that IREX is gone.

580
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,680
There's just a blanket up where it should be on Jurassic World.

581
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,680
IREX.

582
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,680
Whatever it's called.

583
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,680
Indominus World.

584
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
Indominus Rex.

585
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,680
What's it called?

586
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
Oh yes.

587
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
Indominus Rex.

588
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Yeah.

589
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,680
It's just it's there's a there's it's like I suppose they're going to put the real version in.

590
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,680
But IREX that Owen Grady and Claire Dearing are trying to avoid.

591
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Yes.

592
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,680
And that T-Rex saves you from.

593
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,680
So that's hopefully going to get installed anyway.

594
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,680
So then at this point I didn't know where any of these mazes were.

595
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:15,680
So you go down by Transformers and then take a right and then you have to walk forever into a tunnel which is a scare tunnel.

596
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,680
Yeah.

597
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,680
Toxic Tunnel Scare Zone.

598
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,680
Right.

599
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,680
Toxic Tunnel Scare Zone.

600
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,680
Yes.

601
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,680
Now I know about this from friends of the show.

602
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,680
Mr. Strickland, Justin Michael clown on this.

603
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,680
They have made fun of the toxic tunnel to me.

604
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,680
And even the copy on the website says yes.

605
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:37,680
If you wish to experience the mazes on our Metro lots you'll have to go through the tunnel once again.

606
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:41,680
Like toxic tunnel alternate name for Twitter.

607
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,680
I got him.

608
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,680
Brackham.

609
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,680
Brackham.

610
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,680
I guess I'll just say it now.

611
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,680
I got hit with a pipe in the toxic tunnel.

612
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,680
What the fuck?

613
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,680
So this happened on both.

614
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,680
I didn't get hit with a pipe.

615
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
I actually kind of get hit by a giant foam hand though.

616
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,680
It nuts.

617
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,680
So we're walking through the tunnel.

618
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:10,680
We're walking through the tunnel and Luke, he was like he was starting to get scared because like it is kind of scary in there.

619
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,680
Like the atmosphere is scary.

620
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:17,680
And he kind of tried to like add a performer and then the performer was like irritated by it.

621
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,680
You could tell.

622
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,680
I was like don't do that.

623
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,680
You're like egging him on now.

624
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:29,680
And I swear he like kind of ran at us and I think it got loose and his pipe like flew out of his hand and hit me in the like the calf.

625
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,680
And I was like that's a real pipe.

626
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,680
That's not a plastic pipe.

627
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,680
And I guess I could have sued.

628
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,680
I guess I still can.

629
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,680
But I was like well that's that's a little bit of extra horror for me.

630
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,680
And this pipe ain't filled with weed.

631
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,680
No it's not a bong.

632
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,680
Oh my throat hurts again.

633
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,680
No yeah stay away.

634
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,680
No I got to stay away.

635
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,680
So anyway so that was a yeah I got scared when I got hit.

636
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,680
So anyway so we went to Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters have you watched videos of these?

637
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,680
I've watched most of the maze walkthroughs.

638
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,680
Have you watched anything?

639
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,680
No.

640
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,680
Okay I don't know.

641
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,680
I'm too scared to do that.

642
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,680
Is that true?

643
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,680
No.

644
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,680
That's not true.

645
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,680
I did not watch after watching like eight of these in a row I was like I don't feel great.

646
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,680
Like I don't really.

647
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,680
You were spooked.

648
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
I felt unnerved more than anything else.

649
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
Also because I was watching.

650
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,680
Hold on.

651
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,680
Let me give them a shout out officially.

652
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,680
Sharp Productions has very good walkthroughs of all of this and I think I just felt bad

653
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,680
that this one woman at Horror Night she had a friend with her but like they let her and

654
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,680
her cameraman go through by themselves.

655
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,680
You got every scare and it's a little draining after a while because all these mazes take

656
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,680
like five minutes to go through.

657
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,680
Like halfway through I was like I can't.

658
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,680
This would be the time to stop but there's still three minutes left to the video.

659
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,680
So you've watched a lot of these.

660
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,680
I watched a lot of them.

661
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,680
I'm trying to like maybe next year.

662
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,680
So you think maybe you're easing yourself in.

663
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,680
Well because watching the Ghostbusters one I really was sad I was not there because I

664
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,680
was like.

665
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,680
I have the Ghostbusters here just so you can have a little frame of Reverend Scott.

666
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,680
The Ghostbusters one I think easily is like the least scary.

667
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,680
They've got a Louis Tully one running around outside which is really fun.

668
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,680
There's a Janine.

669
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,680
All the sound cues.

670
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,680
They're blasting Ray Parker Jr.'s Ghostbusters outside.

671
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,680
It's very fun.

672
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,680
The sound cues from the movies were really like oh god I really do like these movies.

673
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:34,680
There's a weird fan culture around these movies but I was just like oh the movies themselves

674
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,680
are so nice.

675
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,680
So nice.

676
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,680
Oh from 2?

677
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,680
Noah for yeah.

678
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,680
Yeah no it's only one.

679
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,680
No maybe next year it will be two.

680
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,680
That would be fun.

681
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,680
Yeah.

682
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,680
And apparently there's only a firehouse in Hollywood.

683
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,680
There is not one in Orlando.

684
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,680
It's just a different exterior.

685
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,680
I mean we got all the set houses here.

686
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,680
We got all the prop houses, makeup, the litany of actors in LA.

687
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,680
So we do have advantages in that sense.

688
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,680
So maybe they just had a firehouse in LA.

689
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,680
Yeah.

690
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,680
So this maze probably I think like this is like a big crowd pleasing maze because you're

691
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,680
trying to judge like a maze on its theming and like you know scares but there's not a

692
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,680
lot of scares except for like the demon which pops out at you.

693
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,680
And what Universal does which is different than I think all the other haunts is they

694
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,680
have these sound cues that even though you can go like oh I see Slimers about to come

695
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,680
out of the darkness you walk in there and then it's just the loudest thing in the world.

696
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,680
So yeah here you go Janine.

697
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,680
There's a fun this guy playing Egon back there.

698
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,680
Paul Rusty and Egon.

699
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,680
Doing like a very Paul Rust exaggerated like flailing with the trap and then going through

700
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,680
another door.

701
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:46,680
So we went through this and this is a very good first one because like again like very

702
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,680
light on scares, cool effects.

703
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:55,680
You know you got no themed Ghostbusters experiences these days without the Florida show anymore

704
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,680
and so nice to see this all physicalized.

705
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,680
Yes so that that yes it was fun and it kind of makes you wish there was like a full on

706
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,680
ride and that the scope like the scope is already pretty good for a maze but it's like

707
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,680
you know you could imagine what the full like I mean I guess that's a little scary.

708
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,680
We're looking at a ghost just like flailing his head around.

709
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,680
A clown ghost.

710
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,680
A clown ghost which you'll see in of course the clown killer clowns a little bit later.

711
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,680
So yeah they and they have like a big stay puff that comes up at the end here.

712
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,680
I was trying to fast forward it but I feel like my computer is being stupid.

713
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:32,680
Oh yeah there there's a great effect of Slimer getting shot by a proton pack gun.

714
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,680
What do you call the gun?

715
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,680
Proton packs what they were in the back.

716
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,680
Oh I don't know.

717
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
Good question.

718
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,680
Someone's mad.

719
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
Someone's really mad.

720
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
I'm sorry.

721
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,680
Zach Ryder probably mad at us.

722
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,680
So yeah and there's Slimer he's coming down the hall so like you get all your.

723
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,680
It's cool.

724
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:53,680
So that one especially I think like would have been worth it to go and then you could

725
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,680
just go on the ride.

726
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,680
So anyway so we did that.

727
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,680
We did.

728
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,680
And so at that point Carly and Todd they're out.

729
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,680
They go yeah.

730
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,680
Carly and Todd my VIPs.

731
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,680
You've got to go through the scare zone.

732
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,680
You have to.

733
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,680
Yes.

734
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,680
First off you're very far.

735
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,680
Yes.

736
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,680
Like we've all done worked or at least done runs on the Universal lot.

737
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,680
It is a huge it is an incorporated city.

738
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,680
It's sizable.

739
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,680
I walked we walked so much.

740
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,680
Yeah.

741
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,680
As much as Six Flags though.

742
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,680
Yeah.

743
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
We talked about that.

744
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,680
So yeah.

745
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,680
So we so they they actually ended up going to killer clowns right after this and then

746
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,680
leaving.

747
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,680
That would be the one I'm like oh no no thanks.

748
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,680
Like I'm not that scared of clowns but killer clowns.

749
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,680
No thank you.

750
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,680
That one though I will say is lit well.

751
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,680
OK.

752
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,680
It's still scary but that one's lit well as opposed to a lot of the ones I've seen in

753
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,680
the dark.

754
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,680
You can see it coming.

755
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:53,680
You can see the creepy clowns coming and it's got a little bit of a sense of humor.

756
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,680
If I can say as I was watching all those sharp production walkthroughs they had some of out

757
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,680
of state haunts and in at the Kentucky Kingdom Park there is a haunt maze just called Clowns

758
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,680
Funeral.

759
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,680
I just thought that was really odd.

760
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,680
I like look I like I like that.

761
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,680
Yeah I like.

762
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,680
I'm being honest with you I like the premise of that.

763
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,680
Yeah.

764
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,680
So yeah then Lucas so basically Luke and I going in and we're both like we didn't end

765
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,680
up doing everything because we kind of dawdled.

766
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,680
We should have.

767
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,680
Lindsay and I did like everything.

768
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,680
We did not dawdle.

769
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:37,680
Which so so we went on the Frankenstein versus Wolfman universal one and that was fun.

770
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,680
That I thought the theming was real.

771
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,680
I thought that was really neat.

772
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,680
Yes.

773
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,680
That one was very neat.

774
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:50,680
And then a trick I saw at a lot of the universal houses that end off like a property like with

775
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,680
a movie poster at the end and then the guy jumps out of the poster.

776
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,680
It's a curtain.

777
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,680
When we did what's it called the Blue Blade Delirium.

778
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,680
Yeah.

779
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,680
Is that what it's called.

780
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,680
There was a great effect of coming through a screen.

781
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,680
Yeah.

782
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,680
That works every time.

783
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,680
So then we did Stranger Things.

784
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,680
Huge bust.

785
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,680
Boy.

786
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,680
Everyone who I think I talked to said boring and the one in Orlando is better too.

787
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,680
But like this one just felt very flat.

788
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,680
There was a few like a big monster on the field.

789
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,680
But like I don't know.

790
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,680
And I'm also I don't watch the show.

791
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,680
So I guess I shouldn't comment completely on the Duffer Brothers.

792
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,680
Duff it.

793
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,680
How long seasons they did try to do two seasons in one maybe over overreached.

794
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,680
So anyway then we did Killer Clowns which this is how Killer Clowns looks.

795
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,680
It's neon.

796
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,680
It's lit very well.

797
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,680
So it's cool and fun.

798
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,680
And it is still scared like Luke and I both think now there you go.

799
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,680
It's not.

800
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,680
Yeah.

801
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680
It's not without it scares.

802
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,680
Jason did you watch this.

803
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,680
Just a surprise clown.

804
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
You didn't know.

805
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,680
Yeah.

806
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,680
But it's like doing OK.

807
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,680
Yeah.

808
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:01,680
I couldn't tell if that was a statue or these are these big.

809
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,680
Oh God.

810
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,680
What do we got here.

811
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,680
There's like there's like my I think they're eggs with the clowns inside of them which

812
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,680
is like all you know they're going to hatch.

813
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,680
Yeah.

814
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,680
They're going to hatch clowns.

815
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,680
I actually never seen this movie.

816
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,680
I feel like maybe I need to see it now.

817
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,680
I don't really need to see it but I'll I'll I'm trying to branch out to I watched Hell

818
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,680
Raiser a month ago because I never watched these.

819
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,680
Yeah.

820
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,680
These movies as a kid because I was too scared.

821
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,680
So now I'm you know finally getting brave in my mid 30s.

822
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,680
So we did this.

823
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,680
I did not get hit by a pipe.

824
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,680
Thank goodness.

825
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,680
And this one I would say is one of more one of my favorites.

826
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,680
And then we went we did the mummy which is the same old mummy.

827
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,680
And then we ran into we were just saying Justin Michael and he was there and we finally ran

828
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:51,680
into him and Betsy Sadaro who will be a future guest on the show.

829
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,680
And we were out braved like by so much.

830
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,680
They were like pros of this.

831
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,680
So Luke and I after feeling like we were like kind of brave we were we started going in

832
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,680
with Betsy and Justin and they as you were saying with these people that went in alone

833
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,680
they wanted all the scares.

834
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,680
My tactic is follow behind another group.

835
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,680
They get the scares and I get to see what's coming.

836
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,680
That is not and you love haunts you're saying.

837
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,680
I do.

838
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,680
That's you.

839
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,680
I do love haunts but that's part of it is part of it is the fear you know because you're

840
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,680
trying to be scared.

841
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,680
But that's my way.

842
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,680
Everyone does their haunts differently.

843
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,680
You know sure.

844
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,680
Yeah.

845
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,680
So but they Betsy did this thing which is she would when we were about to go in she

846
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,680
held she put her arms out to hold us.

847
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,680
So the group in front would just like have a nice 30 second buffer.

848
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,680
Geez caught onto your scheme.

849
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,680
Yeah I mean I get those scares.

850
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,680
I don't think she caught into my scheme.

851
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,680
I think that's just what they were doing all night.

852
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,680
So there was and they would also like if they missed a scare they would still like we would

853
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,680
run into people a little bit.

854
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,680
If they missed the scare they would just sit in front of it and wait.

855
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,680
Yeah.

856
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,680
They come out every like these are scare pros.

857
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,680
So these are obviously they've been doing this for years.

858
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,680
They're like way into it.

859
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,680
And then we went to Pandora's Box and that was cool.

860
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,680
And I'm just trying to breeze through some of this.

861
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,680
So I was into Pandora's Box on holidays and held two original mazes.

862
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:25,680
I feel like yes Hollywood Horror Nights usually got the reputation of like all licensed all

863
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,680
licensed ones which they do a very good job at.

864
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,680
Oh yeah.

865
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:35,680
It's crazy that for like two months of the year there's like eight brand new attractions

866
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,680
sets actors.

867
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,680
Yes it's crazy that they put these things up.

868
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,680
The puppets are really wild too.

869
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,680
I wish more attractions had puppets.

870
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,680
I guess then you need a puppeteer.

871
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,680
Yeah I mean like especially at Knotts they have those and you saw them when we went on

872
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,680
the tour last year.

873
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,680
They have these giant puppets like aliens and sharks.

874
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,680
Yeah like they're huge and terrifying and like there's a demon.

875
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,680
It's cool to see.

876
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,680
I guess it makes it so that you can go see these like big puppets in person because like

877
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,680
movies don't do these.

878
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,680
Yes.

879
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,680
Deploy puppets as much so like and with seeing a practical slimer even just in that video

880
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,680
was exciting you know because I don't need to complain about digital effects.

881
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,680
Plenty of podcasts have done that but still just like it's cool to know this is a place

882
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,680
you can go when somebody's operating a big puppet.

883
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,680
You can see puppets and you can see puppets doing improv too.

884
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,680
That's not scary for them.

885
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,680
Saying naughty words.

886
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,680
How many of the puppets a puppet up say weed every night?

887
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,680
I bet half.

888
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:44,680
If a puppet opened their mouth and then a puff of smoke came out I go am I in hell?

889
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,680
How messed up can you be?

890
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,680
That would be totally twisted if a puppet smoked weed.

891
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:58,680
So we did yeah so we did holidays from hell too which is very I will say that's a fun concept

892
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,680
of every you go through every holiday and it is twisted in there.

893
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,680
There's like a person stuffed on the Thanksgiving table.

894
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,680
That's very gross.

895
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,680
Santa Claus is like some pervert guy.

896
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,680
He's wandering around.

897
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:13,680
Big boner.

898
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,680
I don't think he had a boner.

899
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,680
I think the universe would not.

900
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,680
That would only be like a Bill and Ted.

901
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,680
Maybe a Bill and Ted show they would have a boner.

902
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,680
Santa's boner?

903
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:28,680
I saw on the Save Bill and Ted Facebook group which I am a part of because I join all these

904
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,680
things right before we do an episode.

905
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,680
Somebody was like I heard from a cast or whatever they call a cast member that Bill and Ted's

906
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,680
coming back.

907
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,680
The film is coming back.

908
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,680
The film is coming back.

909
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,680
So Bill and Ted might not be gone forever.

910
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,680
We'll see.

911
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,680
If Bill and Ted comes back you have to go to Horror Nights.

912
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:56,680
This is the bet we can make is in 2020 or I guess no in 2021 will we be able to see Bill and Ted say

913
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,680
President Elizabeth Warren?

914
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,680
President Seth Bullock?

915
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,680
That's a guy.

916
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,680
I just learned about that guy today.

917
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,680
I don't know.

918
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,680
I just know the name.

919
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,680
I don't know what it's deal is.

920
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,680
Of course the answer is President Donald Trump.

921
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:28,680
Convicted felon Donald Trump rotting in prison due to Ukraine which unfolded very felon since 2019.

922
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,680
Donald Trump.

923
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,680
I'll take the bet now that that's going to happen.

924
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,680
See you in jail sucker.

925
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,680
So we got to us.

926
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,680
I liked us the movie.

927
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,680
I enjoyed it.

928
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,680
I haven't seen it but the trailer scared me.

929
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,680
People didn't like it as much as get out but I liked it.

930
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:58,680
I read about what it's about and I think I think I want to try the movie but the trailer I mean the

931
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,680
walkthrough on this is terrible.

932
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:06,680
Tim Heidecker fantastic rolling it and there's a Heidecker lookalike in the maze here.

933
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,680
And it's fantastic.

934
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,680
That's neat.

935
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,680
And they have the music playing outside.

936
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,680
I will say this is my favorite of all the horror nights.

937
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,680
Santa Cruz boardwalk.

938
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,680
Santa Cruz boardwalk.

939
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,680
You're going through the trees here.

940
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:24,680
There are there are mirrors to like funhouse mirrors that literally every time I saw myself I thought it

941
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,680
was a stranger.

942
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,680
I thought it was a scary actor.

943
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,680
They fooled me almost every time.

944
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,680
I go oh it's me.

945
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,680
They just set him up where you like turn and there's a reflection.

946
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,680
You don't know.

947
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,680
Wow.

948
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,680
Yes.

949
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,680
And it's just yeah because that's in the movie.

950
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,680
So they go through like all the things all the pieces of the movie.

951
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:46,680
I don't want to spoil the movie but there's yeah the Santa Cruz boardwalk where you see your doppelganger

952
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:54,680
and then they go through the different the vacation house that the main family has and then the bougie

953
00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:03,680
house that Tim Heidecker and his family have and like the perfect combination of like I recognize this

954
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,680
very well themed and scaring the shit out of me.

955
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,680
That was the first thing when I asked you how it was.

956
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:14,680
Hopefully they have the same guy because it might be a different person or no no that's the original family.

957
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,680
The family from the film.

958
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,680
That's the family from the film.

959
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:24,680
And there's one and I will say I think I've said this before my my maybe most scared is when they have like a

960
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,680
dummy setup and you know one is a human.

961
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,680
But you don't know which one.

962
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,680
But you know what you know the setup.

963
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:34,680
So I walk into the room and I'm like one of these are human but I don't know which you're not scared of the surprise.

964
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,680
You're scared of like oh god it's coming.

965
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,680
It's like guessing which one it is.

966
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,680
So like for whatever reason that gets me every time.

967
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:48,680
So yeah so you go into their house here and as soon as all four of us were alone stepped into this living room

968
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,680
which is perfectly recreated and like looks just like a living room.

969
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,680
It's the same size as a living room.

970
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:02,680
We all four went like we all four made that noise because it's just a living room.

971
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,680
Yeah.

972
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:09,680
And there's something so unnerving about recreating like just normal life that like for whatever reason of all of the things

973
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,680
that horror nights just recreating a living room freaked us out.

974
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:21,680
When I asked you how it was this was the first thing you told me about is like we got freaked out by the living room.

975
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,680
Yeah.

976
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:23,680
I don't know.

977
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,680
I think that's I'm trying to psychologically I'm analyzing it but we got freaked out by the living room.

978
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,680
And then yeah this is also something where like there's so many different sets.

979
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,680
I was pretty impressed.

980
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,680
So I'm hoping we get to the high decker look alike in one second here.

981
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,680
Also all these we'll post like links to all of these walkthroughs.

982
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,680
I did not take these walkthroughs because I was too scared.

983
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,680
Although I do have a walkthrough of killer clowns that Luke took of me now that I think about it.

984
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,680
Oh boy yes.

985
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,680
Which is just.

986
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,680
I mean that's a full sized fake car.

987
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,680
Like that is.

988
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,680
Yeah the scope of this.

989
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,680
The scope of this is so.

990
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,680
Yeah.

991
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,680
Impressive.

992
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,680
Yes.

993
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,680
Find all the space.

994
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,680
It's all like so it's all taking over a few areas.

995
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,680
And yeah it's like how how.

996
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,680
So this is the high decker house.

997
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,680
Oh yeah.

998
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,680
And there he is.

999
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,680
Oh my god.

1000
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,680
Like pretty close.

1001
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,680
Wow.

1002
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,680
And Elizabeth Moss.

1003
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,680
Fake Elizabeth Moss.

1004
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,680
Yeah.

1005
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:19,680
So we go in there and then the whole thing ends like sort of in this creepy I don't want to spoil the movie but this creepy underground thing.

1006
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:25,680
And another thing where you're like all of a sudden you're in the middle of this movie and you're like oh we made another noise.

1007
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,680
We're like.

1008
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,680
And just really great.

1009
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,680
Well so this bloom connection is pretty huge.

1010
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,680
I mean it seems like this is very successful that it's getting very recent.

1011
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,680
Well like fan beloved properties into the park.

1012
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,680
Two twin little girls just popped out of doors.

1013
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,680
Yeah.

1014
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,680
And then you go back to the boardwalk and you go underground.

1015
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,680
Yes the bloom connection is strong with the movies.

1016
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,680
It feels like he's he's.

1017
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,680
Don't we read he's getting involved in the Universal Monsters now.

1018
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,680
Yeah.

1019
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,680
So he's into this.

1020
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,680
I think he was nice to get involved.

1021
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,680
Jordan Peele was also on the red carpet.

1022
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,680
Yeah.

1023
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,680
And I'm sure he's into this.

1024
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,680
I'm sure he had a lot to do with this.

1025
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:11,680
Obviously two halves of the best comedy duo's are he and Peele and the Blues Brothers.

1026
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,680
Good point.

1027
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,680
The one and two.

1028
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,680
I would be very interested in this.

1029
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:29,680
Maybe we should think about this for next Halloween is like the tricks like the stagecraft and stuff because what I noticed a lot in watching these walkthroughs is a thing that is unnerving but it's so simple.

1030
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:41,680
It's just people banging on the walls like they just pick up when they jump out at you or if it seems like they're just going to walk by you then they smack the wall and it makes a horrifying noise and it works every time.

1031
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,680
It's very scary.

1032
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:49,680
And yeah so this was we actually did the holidays one last but this was second to last and this was my favorite.

1033
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,680
Did you do House of a Thousand Corpses?

1034
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,680
We did not make it to Creepshow or House of a Thousand Corpses.

1035
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,680
It was our we were you know it was the first haunt of the season.

1036
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:04,680
I wasn't we were a little scared still and also I woke up with a night terror this night after doing this.

1037
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,680
Jesus.

1038
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:06,680
I didn't remember it though.

1039
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,680
Lindsay was like you remember you just woke up in the middle of the night and didn't know where you were.

1040
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,680
But you do that a lot is what you've said.

1041
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:19,680
I do it depends if the room is very dark I tend to do it but for whatever reason I think I was just like tense.

1042
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,680
Oh yeah here you go.

1043
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,680
There's a bunch of dummies.

1044
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,680
And yeah very scary.

1045
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,680
So yeah we did Horror Nights very fun.

1046
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,680
How was the waits?

1047
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,680
You were at a preview night kind of thing.

1048
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,680
Yeah we had I look I don't want to brag we had the front of the line.

1049
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,680
Yeah the front of the line.

1050
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,680
Although Betsy and Justin had those as well so you can you know buy them.

1051
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:51,680
That is a tip if you're going to Horror Nights to any of these haunts they say if you really want to do the whole thing splurge for the front of the line.

1052
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,680
Passes.

1053
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,680
Yes I would say.

1054
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,680
For Faslane they called it knots.

1055
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:05,680
Yeah because for knots it's like maybe actually both especially but like knots it's like it's 45 minutes in line and we got to knots a little after it started.

1056
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,680
Yeah.

1057
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,680
We still barely did everything.

1058
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,680
Nine houses there.

1059
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,680
Nine mazes.

1060
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:15,680
Yes and if there's two shows there's like actually three shows they burn a witch apparently somewhere.

1061
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,680
At the hanging.

1062
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,680
Yeah the hanging we were talking to a performer there and we'll talk about that in a second.

1063
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,680
Sure.

1064
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:26,680
And there's puppets cursing and smoking weed and like you know there's so much stuff so yeah.

1065
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,680
And a conjurer.

1066
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,680
Yes.

1067
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,680
There's a conjurer show.

1068
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,680
There's a lot of stuff going on at knots.

1069
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,680
I guess we will let's transition to knots.

1070
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,680
Yeah scary farm.

1071
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,680
We'll take a we'll take a brief break and we'll be right back.

1072
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,680
A spooky break.

1073
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,680
Knotts.

1074
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:48,680
Alright we are back on podcast the ride.

1075
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,680
No.

1076
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,680
Haunt cast the fright.

1077
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,680
Oh man I did this.

1078
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,680
You're going to hear me do this a couple times this month.

1079
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,680
It's hard to adjust.

1080
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,680
It's like switching time zones.

1081
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,680
It's crazy.

1082
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,680
I'm so sorry.

1083
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,680
What was my name again?

1084
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,680
You're Mike Coffinson.

1085
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,680
Okay.

1086
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,680
And that's Jason Skeleton.

1087
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,680
Rod Skardner and oh oh.

1088
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,680
Do you have a name?

1089
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,680
No I don't.

1090
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,680
I just realized we probably should have that.

1091
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,680
Feel free to invent your own.

1092
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,680
Jason's got one.

1093
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,680
Introducer.

1094
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,680
Introducer.

1095
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,680
It's returning guests.

1096
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,680
Laceration kill tie.

1097
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,680
Kill tie?

1098
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,680
Pretty good right?

1099
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,680
What is the tie?

1100
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,680
Like your serial killer.

1101
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,680
What is the tie?

1102
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,680
Huh?

1103
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,680
It's the end of her regular day.

1104
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,680
I was going to say.

1105
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,680
What is it?

1106
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,680
Lindsay kill tie.

1107
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,680
It's just jammed like any of these.

1108
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,680
It's just jammed in there.

1109
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,680
Skardner isn't anything.

1110
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,680
The only thing that works is Skardner.

1111
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,680
Of the three you just said.

1112
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,680
Skardner is the only one that makes any sense.

1113
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,680
It works the hardest because it was my name.

1114
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,680
How about like gouge eye?

1115
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,680
Like you're gouging out an eye.

1116
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,680
But then it's still AI.

1117
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,680
Well but it's silent.

1118
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,680
It's like at least that's a thing.

1119
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,680
What about black cat tie?

1120
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,680
Black cat tie.

1121
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,680
Black cat tie.

1122
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,680
Black cat tie.

1123
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,680
Black cat tie.

1124
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,680
Black cat tie.

1125
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,680
Black cat tie.

1126
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,680
Black cat tie.

1127
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,680
Black cat tie.

1128
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,680
Black cat tie.

1129
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,680
Black cat tie.

1130
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,680
Black cat tie.

1131
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,680
Black cat tie.

1132
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,680
Black cat tie.

1133
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,680
Black cat tie.

1134
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,680
Black cat tie.

1135
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,320
I don't think it has to actually be a full word.

1136
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,800
It just has to kind of sound.

1137
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,800
If you had sound.

1138
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,800
I like the cleanliness of it though.

1139
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:12,480
If you had actually done the creep show maze you could have gotten tips from the creep.

1140
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:17,160
An original character not at all like the creep keeper.

1141
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:21,000
Word of warning you're probably gonna lose me for the next half hour while I try to crack

1142
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
this.

1143
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Lindsay cat's eye.

1144
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Sorry.

1145
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Wait nevermind you got it.

1146
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Lindsay cat's eye.

1147
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Oh yeah that's good.

1148
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,320
Thanks guys.

1149
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,320
I just needed a minute.

1150
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,320
Yeah.

1151
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,320
Alright.

1152
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,320
Well welcome Lindsay cat's eye.

1153
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,480
Thank you for having me whatever your names were.

1154
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,680
Yeah it's hard to remember.

1155
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,560
The only nickname I've ever had for Jason.

1156
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,840
I mean there's nicknames but like the only one that's a play on your last name is Jason

1157
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,200
shareable.

1158
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,200
Why is that?

1159
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,200
Like sharing apps.

1160
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,200
Like apps.

1161
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,200
Shareable apps.

1162
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,680
Like that's a word they use on a menu.

1163
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,680
So at a certain point.

1164
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,480
And also you know I don't it's funny because you know I don't want to share them.

1165
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,040
I was gonna say yeah Jason's not sharing apps.

1166
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,740
That's a good point.

1167
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:08,200
Also somebody who doesn't like to share as far as food is concerned either.

1168
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,280
The lady Jason Sheridan.

1169
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:13,960
Yeah everyone gets their own right then everyone's happy.

1170
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,960
Yep.

1171
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,400
I don't I don't want to share.

1172
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,400
Maybe a taste.

1173
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,400
That's mine.

1174
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,400
So you know for next time.

1175
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,400
Fair enough.

1176
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,400
But do you want to share.

1177
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,400
If you want a couple fries.

1178
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,400
Sure.

1179
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,320
But let's not go there.

1180
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,320
You're not getting half of the thing.

1181
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,320
No.

1182
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:33,240
Would you like to share your thoughts about nuts scary fun.

1183
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,840
Which you were made to visit by your boyfriend.

1184
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:42,640
So yes I asked some other people first because you initially turned it down.

1185
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,680
You turned down horror nights.

1186
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:49,480
You don't love the scary stuff yet.

1187
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,480
So then I said.

1188
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,680
I'm getting there.

1189
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:56,680
So then I said after after a couple rounds of people saying they couldn't make this night

1190
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:02,000
I threw it back to you and you reluctantly said you wanted to go.

1191
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:08,240
And what was my main motivating factor in that.

1192
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,400
That you I think this is what you're gonna say.

1193
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,040
You wanted to be braver than Jason and Scott.

1194
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,040
Correct.

1195
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:18,920
I went through the maids going I'm cooler than Scott and Jason.

1196
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:25,840
She was in the middle of screaming screaming her head off in terror and clutching into

1197
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,520
my back with her fingers.

1198
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,520
She kept being like I'm cooler than Jason and Scott.

1199
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:35,520
I wasn't screaming my head off in the mazes themselves.

1200
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,720
I just love it when someone says about me.

1201
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:42,880
I felt like an insane person when that scare actor jumped at me.

1202
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,320
The reason I think there's such an intensity about it is because of you were literally

1203
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,320
clutching me.

1204
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:55,000
In a way that was really alarming me and that thought maybe I had made a big mistake.

1205
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
It was just the first one.

1206
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
No, no, of course.

1207
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,040
But I'm just saying like I thought oh you know you're gonna yell a little bit and then

1208
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,040
you'll get used to it.

1209
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:06,280
But you were like the first maze was so intense I was worried.

1210
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,280
I was a bit worried.

1211
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,640
You thought I was gonna be a night ruiner.

1212
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:13,160
Well not that night I just didn't like I was like oh I'm traumatizing.

1213
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,840
I'm like legit traumatizing you.

1214
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,600
You said it was like with Luke you could just sort of laugh and be like hahaha Luke is

1215
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,720
scared but you didn't want to do that to me.

1216
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,720
Yes, that is a good point.

1217
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,120
I felt a different feeling.

1218
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,120
I guess it's love.

1219
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,120
Love Michael.

1220
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,120
I guess it's caring.

1221
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:36,920
I mean Luke I've been friends with since they're great and I'll say love.

1222
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,720
I probably would look but it's love.

1223
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,040
I'll say it's a different type of love.

1224
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,040
Love Michael.

1225
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,840
Last year when we walked through the scare zones at Nauts I definitely did some light

1226
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,840
clutching.

1227
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,400
Oh yeah no you did a full on arm clutch.

1228
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,880
Yeah I did a full on.

1229
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:52,880
You remember that.

1230
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,880
I don't know.

1231
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:54,880
We're going to a cattillion.

1232
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,880
You held on to that one.

1233
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,360
No I think you say it on the last episode.

1234
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,840
I think you brought it up.

1235
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:05,200
Because Jason when the scare actor comes at us in the Calico town Jason turns and just

1236
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,200
clutches in my arm.

1237
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,960
Because it's so dark and it's so foggy.

1238
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,480
The wandering scare actors were the scariest part for me.

1239
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,800
Because they're yeah so they're right.

1240
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:15,960
So we get there.

1241
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:20,840
We got there a little bit after it opens at like seven o'clock and the scare actors are

1242
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,320
right up on you.

1243
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,800
Because last time when we did it we went in like we were you know in a room back room

1244
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:30,360
for six hours and then we went in the side but we went in the official entrance and they

1245
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:34,200
don't give you any breathing room for it.

1246
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,640
There is no like you're put you're trying to get your stuff back in your bag from the

1247
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:41,880
bag check and they are right there ready to fuck with you.

1248
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,480
Oh man you try to delay.

1249
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:48,200
I didn't know they existed.

1250
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,560
I didn't warn you about it.

1251
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,880
I didn't know there were just free floating scare actors.

1252
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,840
I thought it was just in the damn mazes.

1253
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,960
That is what makes me not want to be there.

1254
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:01,320
You don't get a break every fucking second.

1255
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,800
You're just like there's nobody in the bathrooms.

1256
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:07,360
You get breaks but then suddenly you'll be like oh we need to get to this spot and there

1257
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:12,360
will be 20 of them just wandering around.

1258
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,800
It was so intense.

1259
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,880
We had pockets where there were very few people around and then all of a sudden they'd run

1260
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,880
in a tent of them.

1261
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:21,040
And there was that one where it was like intense fog and you truly didn't know where they were

1262
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,240
lurking.

1263
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:30,280
And my being afraid apart from that first scare actor who yelled and then I just like

1264
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:36,520
screamed in his face, his or her face.

1265
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:42,600
Mostly my fear was manifesting as extreme defensiveness and a challenging nature to

1266
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,800
the scare actors.

1267
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,540
You did the same thing that I talked about this.

1268
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:50,320
I got hit with a pipe because Luke tried to challenge a scare actor at Horror Nights.

1269
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:54,240
And you were doing the same thing which is like you were trying to kind of get ahead

1270
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,080
of it and like almost like like tough guy.

1271
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:04,640
I was trying to project like a safety sphere, like an invisible safety sphere around myself.

1272
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:09,480
So I just like kept my eye on the scare actors like I know where you are.

1273
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,480
I know where you are so don't come at me.

1274
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,920
But that just made them want to come at me.

1275
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:19,320
They started following me a couple of them because I had made such intense eye contact

1276
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,880
and it was one of those sliders.

1277
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,560
The sliders were the worst ones with the sparking knee pads.

1278
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:29,120
I was freaking out at the possibility that they would catch me off guard.

1279
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,520
They would catch you on fire.

1280
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,520
It's going to be a spark.

1281
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,520
The big old spark.

1282
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,520
Lights up your pants.

1283
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,520
It's scary.

1284
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,520
Yes.

1285
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,520
I hate all of this.

1286
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,720
There were so many of them.

1287
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:44,240
I figured out my, I think I'm sure I talked about this last year, but I was surprised

1288
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:49,760
to find this come back when we did, I figured out my move, how I deal with these people

1289
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:55,520
is that I didn't even know, this wasn't even a plan, but it's what came out of me.

1290
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:59,760
It's me just going, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1291
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,920
And I didn't even, it's like I don't even know it's coming out of me, but it came back

1292
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,720
when we just went and did this thing that we haven't talked about that I think we had

1293
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,720
a pretty good time at.

1294
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,760
This sandbox VR.

1295
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,800
We got to try a new VR experience and this was a surprisingly scary thing where there

1296
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,440
were big bug creatures in your face.

1297
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,400
And I once again, and there's very pathetic video of us all in a green screen environment

1298
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:26,520
and me going up to nothing and going, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1299
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:31,960
we got hit with giant bugs, like eight foot tall bugs were attacking us and the haptic

1300
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,280
feedback on the vests was very aggressive.

1301
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,000
I kind of liked it.

1302
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
You like the haptic feedback?

1303
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,560
I like the haptic feedback because like I think what for me that like I love haunted

1304
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:51,160
houses when it's just robots, when it's just animatronics, when it's just hinges, you know,

1305
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:55,400
when it's just that I love it.

1306
01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:01,880
But when it's even as a kid, like I went through one or two with like actors and I did not

1307
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,120
like it at all.

1308
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:09,920
Like the human actor element, although last year that was kind of deescalated by week

1309
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:15,600
after recording, both saw scare actors using the same restroom as we had been and then

1310
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,800
also saw them eating lunch.

1311
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,080
So we kind of got a little deescalation going in.

1312
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,200
So they were just people like us.

1313
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,200
Yeah, they were waving.

1314
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,200
They were saying hi.

1315
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,280
You guys, you got through the turnstiles.

1316
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,120
You just got sliders right at you.

1317
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:37,040
And truly I didn't know that they that that was a role that got played.

1318
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:41,680
We were trying to take a photo of us and I feel like we didn't have enough time because

1319
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,840
we were like, oh, there's one coming around the bank.

1320
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:44,840
Yeah, any second now.

1321
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,840
And then you went to the bathroom.

1322
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,360
And they're right outside the bathrooms.

1323
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:52,320
We both went to the bathroom and then I came out right as one chased like seven 13 year

1324
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,160
old girls up into the bathroom area.

1325
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:59,360
And they obviously had they had they couldn't go past into the bathroom to scare actors

1326
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:02,520
are not allowed to scare you in the bathroom.

1327
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:05,200
That would be unacceptable.

1328
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,600
People be like peeing everywhere.

1329
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,560
It was a thing I already knew.

1330
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,960
I knew that they can't touch you.

1331
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,960
I knew that.

1332
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,320
But you did.

1333
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,920
You reminded me like they can't touch you.

1334
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,000
And then I was walking.

1335
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,920
I was so I was saying one or one of two things out loud.

1336
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,720
I'm cooler than Scott and Jason.

1337
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,720
Yes.

1338
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,720
Yeah, that's fine.

1339
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,720
They can't touch me.

1340
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,720
They can't touch me.

1341
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:28,720
Those were her mantras all night.

1342
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:34,440
And I yes, she yes, you were like quietly muttering it during the mazes.

1343
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,640
Let me test your bravery, though.

1344
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,560
You know about the Skyliner accident.

1345
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:43,360
And I did not know what your level of willingness to go on the Skyliner, know the new gondolas

1346
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,360
at Disney World, knowing that there was an accident.

1347
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,680
OK, what happened?

1348
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,840
A minor crunching situation.

1349
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:54,000
Well, they're one of the gondolas did not get correctly.

1350
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,160
He kept the cable.

1351
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,160
It was still on the track in the station.

1352
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,400
So then it caused a backup to crunch.

1353
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,400
These were unoccupied.

1354
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:04,160
But it stopped the whole system for about two to three hours.

1355
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,400
So people just dangling and gondolas.

1356
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:11,440
And when I was in the rest room, when I was in cleaning my bathroom upstairs just now,

1357
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,160
I did hear you say that you would still go on it.

1358
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,160
Mm hmm.

1359
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,040
And you would welcome the accident.

1360
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,040
I didn't say welcome the accident.

1361
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,880
You would welcome the sweet embrace of death is what I think you said.

1362
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:27,360
I'd make lemonade out of lemons and make content out of the axe.

1363
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,840
I'd make heaven lemonade out of death lemons.

1364
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,160
He just wants to be stranded in the air for six to eight hours.

1365
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:33,880
That's all he wants.

1366
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:37,000
Bring a lemon and make lemonade out of the emergency bag water.

1367
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,200
That is true.

1368
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,680
Well, if I bring country time powder.

1369
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,960
Would you by the way, bring it everywhere anyway?

1370
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:43,800
Sure.

1371
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,880
Emergency bag.

1372
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,840
Jason Country Time Sharables.

1373
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:55,400
That is what will kill me is getting apps as my meal and too much sugar.

1374
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,120
Jason it with lemonade.

1375
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:00,480
That's your name during like the Boysenberry Festival coverage, I guess.

1376
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:03,040
Or I guess. Or there has to be some sort of a lemonade.

1377
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,480
The scary the scares from that come.

1378
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,160
Jason, they run out of boys.

1379
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,240
Yeah. Jason Country Time.

1380
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,960
Baradun.

1381
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,840
Wow.

1382
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,000
Oh, that's good. And that's also a rhymeable name.

1383
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:16,360
Thank you.

1384
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:20,840
Barry Tales character to the nuts, old nuts, dark ride.

1385
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,640
So you're upset before even going in a thing.

1386
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:29,280
So, yeah, you are. Yeah, I was immediately accosted by the scare actors.

1387
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:31,760
And then I true. I really was for a bit.

1388
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:34,040
Oh, don't pet him while he's under the.

1389
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,040
Oh, no. Speaking of rates.

1390
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,720
I'm surprised Edwin from under a blanket.

1391
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:43,160
He's become a little bit crankier when it comes to being touched

1392
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:47,560
while he's under a blanket or something like he won't let me pet him

1393
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,920
when he's in his little deep dish cuddler at night now.

1394
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:54,200
He only lets me touch him in the cuddler for whatever reason.

1395
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,200
It's special.

1396
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:55,720
Talk him back.

1397
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:57,240
ET and Ellie. Yeah.

1398
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,440
Ram, Ram, Ram. Sorry.

1399
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,240
So that scare actor coming up.

1400
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:02,080
Oh, my God.

1401
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:02,760
Scared dog.

1402
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:07,000
I would never forgive you if you like hit a scare actor in the scare.

1403
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,080
Well, don't know how in the apartment.

1404
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,480
You should never go on Ellen then, because she always has like a guy.

1405
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:13,760
That's true. Box.

1406
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:14,920
That's true.

1407
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:15,880
Yeah. Scare you.

1408
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,240
She's in the box, too, with a fucking war criminal.

1409
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:23,200
She loves being in boxes with devious figures.

1410
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,960
Lives. Look, it takes all kinds.

1411
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,760
And that's why I am friends with Satan.

1412
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,680
We have we go to soccer games together.

1413
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:34,680
It's fun. Yeah.

1414
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:37,200
It's subtle differences in political beliefs.

1415
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,960
OK, so bathrooms.

1416
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,080
Where did you guys go from there?

1417
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,040
So there's so bathrooms.

1418
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,240
Where did you go?

1419
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:48,560
We did hit up the bathrooms first.

1420
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,720
And then we took a photo in front of the scary farm.

1421
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:53,720
The sign.

1422
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:57,440
Yes. So at this point, we walk over.

1423
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,400
So we when we toured last year, we toured the depths and we toured dark entities.

1424
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:04,480
So we went over to that zone because there's four mazes that way,

1425
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,240
which is by Ghost Rider.

1426
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,440
Oh, we haven't eaten.

1427
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,440
We haven't eaten pizza.

1428
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,800
We both got disgustingly large pieces of pizza.

1429
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,320
Which I had like just didn't have the stomach for it

1430
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,480
because I'd been sick all that week because of that oat milk.

1431
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,160
Right. Oh, yes.

1432
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:23,000
Hey, spoiler. Oat milk talk.

1433
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,720
Oat milk talk with Lindsay coming next month.

1434
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,120
Yeah, that's all we'll say.

1435
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,680
Stay tuned. So I and we were like,

1436
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:35,160
I was like wanting to hide out from the slider for a while.

1437
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,360
Yes, because we were right.

1438
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,080
Like the pizza area was right in slider country.

1439
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:43,040
Yeah, I was like, there was a guy sliding up and down outside of this little window

1440
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,880
where you'd buy this pizza, this cafeteria.

1441
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,320
It was like they can't scare you while you're eating. Right.

1442
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,520
Well, they I mean, I don't think they can.

1443
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:54,880
They can. I think maybe they're supposed to like if you're holding a drink,

1444
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,960
they wouldn't know that.

1445
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,920
And so I was not about to be walking around with a drink.

1446
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:03,640
Yes, we drank our boys and Barry beers on a crate

1447
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:06,440
and we waited to enter the scare zone before.

1448
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,800
Oh, yeah. Wait, excuse me, to finish our drink before entering the scare zone.

1449
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:15,120
And then I most of your pizza and mine very fast.

1450
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,360
And sweet night for Mike.

1451
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:20,160
So I was getting scared on an empty stomach in two beers.

1452
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,040
Yeah, that pizza became a shareable.

1453
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,880
It did a non shareable, a rare share.

1454
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,720
Forced. So, yeah.

1455
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,320
So then at that point, I go, are we ready?

1456
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,480
Are we ready to do this?

1457
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:36,560
And the first maze we went is paranormal Inc., which is

1458
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:41,040
it was maybe the worst one, because the thing I'm afraid of most is ghosts.

1459
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,640
Because you were in the supernatural.

1460
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,760
I know this about you, but you reiterated to me afterward

1461
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,000
that a big part of your being scared is because it involved ghosts.

1462
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,760
And you're not scared of aliens.

1463
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,160
You're not scared of sea monsters.

1464
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,520
No, you're scared of ghosts because they're real.

1465
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,400
Yeah. Right. Yeah.

1466
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,600
So I just started reading The Haunting of Hill House.

1467
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,240
Have you read that? Yeah, it's one of my favorite books. OK.

1468
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,280
She just dated an unpleasant diner.

1469
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,560
So that was scary to me because she got rude service.

1470
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:11,880
She got rude service.

1471
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:14,040
You mean the Cup of Stars scene? Huh?

1472
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,080
No, that was fun. That was delightful.

1473
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,640
No, she goes to a not in the town.

1474
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,960
There's like a weird, creepy diner.

1475
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,160
And everyone's like, stay away from my house.

1476
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,640
That was what I right before I came here, I got to that.

1477
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:28,560
I was like, well, when I get back home to pick this book back up,

1478
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,560
she will be at the house.

1479
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,640
So but that book is fantastic.

1480
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:38,320
I I created an LLC like for in like independent.

1481
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,040
Congratulations.

1482
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,680
Oh, thank you so much.

1483
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:42,600
I shouldn't have opened it.

1484
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,640
Now I have to pay taxes on it. That was very stupid.

1485
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,200
But I named it Cup of Stars because of that.

1486
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,880
That's charming. Yeah, that's a very charming moment.

1487
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,200
Because I figure it's it's like me.

1488
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,000
It's like sweet, but creepy.

1489
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:00,600
That is how that's how I described you to my parents when I started dating.

1490
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,520
She's sweet, but she's creepy.

1491
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:07,720
But the opening of that book, when they talk about the house is not sane,

1492
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:13,800
the house is or the house is the fear comes from absolute sanity.

1493
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,200
The inability to dream.

1494
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,320
I was like reality.

1495
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,480
Absolute reality. Yeah.

1496
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,320
Yeah.

1497
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,120
Is is so unnerving to me.

1498
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,400
And as you're saying that about the paranormal ink, like ghosts and stuff.

1499
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,200
Yeah.

1500
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,360
The best thing about that book is that the book makes you feel like you're

1501
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,560
the one being haunted.

1502
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,480
Oh, it's completely disorienting.

1503
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,080
I love it. It's so good.

1504
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,800
It's so good. And she's not even at the house yet.

1505
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,040
It's very. Yeah.

1506
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,520
Which is, yeah, haunted.

1507
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,000
There's a Grant Morrison haunted comic, which is cool, too.

1508
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,240
And you feel like you're being haunted by a ghost while you're reading it.

1509
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,160
Anyway, so Paranormal Inc.

1510
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,080
is the start. And basically, if you don't know what this is, it's like a fake

1511
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,960
reality ghost hunting show.

1512
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,880
And all of a sudden, this like dummy pulls a lever and releases this scary ghost

1513
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:59,240
who tells everyone I would like to talk to Greg about why he pulled that lever.

1514
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,560
They really don't make it clear.

1515
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,560
Greg, he doesn't.

1516
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,040
He's like, fuck this.

1517
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,600
And then he flips a switch for no reason.

1518
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,160
I was like, you've been watching that house.

1519
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:12,520
This ghost forms above you, which is very cool and scary.

1520
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,000
And she says, we're all going to die.

1521
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,240
And then I told you this was happening.

1522
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,800
A woman flies out. You showed this to me a year ago.

1523
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,760
Yes. And I still forgot.

1524
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:23,720
So you forgot.

1525
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:27,120
But so a long story short, we did this twice.

1526
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:32,680
And what was very funny about this is that you kept asking if things were different,

1527
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:37,000
because I didn't realize that your eyes were literally closed the whole time

1528
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,840
you were doing this at your first maze.

1529
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:41,120
I didn't realize until we went back through.

1530
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,040
That's what's even crazier to me.

1531
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,960
I was unconsciously closing my eyes.

1532
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,840
Right. But you had like had a memory of all of it, but it was inaccurate.

1533
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,000
Yes. Yeah.

1534
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,560
So the whole thing is like you're going through like this like fucked up old house

1535
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,000
and then you end up in hell.

1536
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,960
And then at the end, you end up in a hospital, which is this one.

1537
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,200
Yeah, which is the one I was raving about last year.

1538
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:06,360
And yet the effect.

1539
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,080
So I was trying to point out the effect to you.

1540
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:12,120
And you just kind of were like yelling and were irritated, I feel like.

1541
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,360
And I thought you saw it and you were just unimpressed.

1542
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,480
That was my feeling when the first time we went through it.

1543
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,240
No, I was yelling because a demon was there, but I didn't know where the demon came

1544
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:24,280
from, because apparently I was looking down so intensely.

1545
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:28,040
All of a sudden you show up in here and there's a woman who's a nurse.

1546
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:32,200
She's got creepy eye like white contacts.

1547
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:35,040
And this is the effect. There's a giant demon puppet.

1548
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,640
You can't see it. And all of a sudden, like it'll short out.

1549
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:40,480
And then you can see it just eating something.

1550
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,120
Scrim situation, which is very cool.

1551
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,240
It was really cool.

1552
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,760
And I did not see it the first time.

1553
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:46,760
And you did not see the first time.

1554
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:49,520
And to your credit, you said, oh, yeah.

1555
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,960
And then there it is again.

1556
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,120
Yeah, like T.

1557
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:54,360
Rexie. And it's huge.

1558
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,800
And it is huge. This puppet, this demon puppet.

1559
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,560
And to your credit, after we had done a couple of mazes, you said,

1560
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,920
I want to do paranormal ink again.

1561
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,240
Well, I didn't see it because I didn't see it.

1562
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,000
And I wanted to experience it.

1563
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,120
What was that hospital different?

1564
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,840
I thought I thought the first time that the lights were not turned on.

1565
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:17,280
Right. Right. I was convinced that it was not bright like that.

1566
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:20,560
And it turned out that I didn't even realize

1567
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,080
how little I was looking at my surroundings.

1568
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,080
And yes, as I said, I was just holding on to your shirt.

1569
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:30,840
You were just like digging your fingers into my sides,

1570
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,480
like in just in a way where I was like, truly, I was like concerned.

1571
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,760
I was worried. I was not enjoying myself at all.

1572
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,400
Sweet. No, it was just the first one, though.

1573
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,400
It was just the first one.

1574
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,920
I'm just saying that's where my mind was like, oh, but that is the difference

1575
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,680
where it's like, oh, you love and care about your friend who you've known

1576
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,280
a long time, but when you're in a relationship,

1577
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:52,960
there's a protective feeling that you don't have with other friends.

1578
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,920
Yes, I'm trying to think if I was going through the maze with Luke

1579
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,960
and he was digging his fingers into my back, you'd probably just be annoyed.

1580
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,840
I'd probably be like, the hell of me.

1581
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,960
Get the fuck over it, Luke.

1582
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,680
Look, I was your best man at your wedding.

1583
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:08,120
But this isn't come on.

1584
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,840
I draw a line at me.

1585
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,400
Rib digging. No rib.

1586
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,600
Ow, my ribs.

1587
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,920
Ow, my ribs. My ribs. Comedy theater.

1588
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:17,040
So, yeah. So then we did.

1589
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:21,200
We did those dark entities, which is the alien when we walked through last year.

1590
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,280
Very similar.

1591
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:28,080
We did the depths, which is the sea monster with that shark.

1592
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,800
Remember that shark? Yeah.

1593
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,480
I will. You in these tours of these mazes.

1594
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,720
And I could not wait to not go on them for real.

1595
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,640
I sure didn't. What did you think?

1596
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,920
I thought it was cool. I.

1597
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,760
I really only liked the water effect.

1598
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,080
OK, I don't remember.

1599
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,280
You were still adjusting.

1600
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:54,040
I feel like these first four was that whole little area.

1601
01:17:54,560 --> 01:18:00,040
I think it wasn't until Waxworks, probably, where I was like, OK,

1602
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,160
I think I can get into this a little.

1603
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,080
Yes. So we did. Yeah, we did that.

1604
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:04,800
And there's that effect.

1605
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,960
I'm sure I said it last year, but there's the effect where it's just a bunch of fog

1606
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,240
and then lasers to make it look like it's maybe water.

1607
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:15,720
Yeah. And that's when like the sea creatures hands are like fins are popping up,

1608
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,160
which is very cool.

1609
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,720
But yeah. And then dark entities, which has a couple of robots.

1610
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:23,440
Remember, we saw those robots and those are fun.

1611
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,560
Not worth it.

1612
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,840
I don't remember dark entities very well.

1613
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,880
The robot was performing surgery and was doing a bad job.

1614
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,760
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1615
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:38,480
What's interesting to me is that a lot of these houses are like some.

1616
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,360
It's a recognizable place where something goes wrong.

1617
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:46,560
So the animatronics can be really simple and purposely malfunctioning,

1618
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,680
purposely kind of like shitty or hitting stuff like Dark Ride.

1619
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,640
The walkthrough of Dark Ride was another one where I was like,

1620
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:57,160
I kind of wish I saw this like in this this

1621
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,120
woman went through Dark Ride.

1622
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,680
There's like a it's a fake Dark Ride.

1623
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,760
So there's a track on the ground, right?

1624
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,080
Like you follow a track.

1625
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,320
Yes. It's like a broken down haunted ride.

1626
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:08,200
A carnival ride.

1627
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,880
That was the concept of that.

1628
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:12,920
Yeah. Yeah. I think that one's lost on me.

1629
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,160
I was not impressed.

1630
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:18,680
And I am more afraid of clowns than anything else I'm afraid of.

1631
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:21,920
We there was a listener who tweeted at me.

1632
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,960
I think they were working Dark Ride, but we they were on their break when we did it.

1633
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,600
Sadly, there was a very funny moment I saw in the video of this,

1634
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:33,400
where there was a large man in a top hat who like follows the person going through it

1635
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:37,600
and then tells her to push a button and a button makes a siren goes off.

1636
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:41,640
And then a man pops out and starts yelling at her that she pushed the button.

1637
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,000
And I think that's such a funny guy.

1638
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,760
Like that's such a funny moment.

1639
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,480
That's the most interactive thing I've heard of.

1640
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,680
I was not that impressed by Dark Ride.

1641
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:52,480
Yeah, that was not one of my favorites.

1642
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,200
She was cool. Well, no, this isn't Dark Ride.

1643
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,160
This is Waxworks. Oh, yeah.

1644
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,520
Waxworks is very cool.

1645
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,560
The premise of Waxworks.

1646
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,120
So Waxworks is mysterious.

1647
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:03,840
Like some strange noises have begun to emanate from the eerie abandoned Wax

1648
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,120
Museum, the once prominent plastic surgeon, Dr.

1649
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,760
Augustus Scratch, original knots.

1650
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:09,920
Original knots.

1651
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,840
Has been seen tinkering at night and is now ready to show off his beautifully

1652
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:17,400
a terrifying, lifelike masterpieces of hot molten wax and bloody flesh.

1653
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:22,920
So basically he is just experiment, experimenting on humans with wax.

1654
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,720
So look at she's got a wax face.

1655
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,840
It's a creepy Marilyn kind of freak.

1656
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:29,120
We watched the trailer

1657
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:32,120
on the knots website and it was terrifying.

1658
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,960
It's a woman's face trapped in wax.

1659
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,240
And this is I love this.

1660
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,760
This is like scary founding fathers.

1661
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,160
Yes. Great. Melting founding fathers.

1662
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,640
They melted Ben Franklin's face on some guy and they dressed him up

1663
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:47,080
because that was a scene in this wax museum at one point, which.

1664
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,200
Cool. Like this.

1665
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:51,280
Yeah. So this one this one is the first one you were like, I think you maybe

1666
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:56,120
you had all your bearings and were like impressed by appreciating the.

1667
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,720
And there's just this corpse.

1668
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:58,880
You have to push your way.

1669
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,160
There's a corpse hanging.

1670
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,240
Yeah. Just push the body to the side when you walk by it,

1671
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,040
which is, of course, terrifying.

1672
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,720
And like there's a lot of good like this.

1673
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:12,920
I will say a very tasteful use of water in this a couple of times

1674
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,720
when they simulate the boiling wax.

1675
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,720
Oh, yeah. And when like what do they dump wax out of like these big?

1676
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,560
I don't know what you call them, cauldrons or something.

1677
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:26,040
I also liked this one more because instead of just wearing a monster mask,

1678
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:30,680
which looks like the fakest thing possible in the waxworks,

1679
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,960
it's like humans have been experiencing it on.

1680
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:37,880
So everybody wearing a creepy doll mask or a melty mask.

1681
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:40,560
Yeah. Really fit the story very well.

1682
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:44,960
And they looked like the true horror of the story.

1683
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:48,360
So, yeah, as opposed to like, oh, it's supposed to be a wolf man.

1684
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,640
But you're like, it's just a wolf man rubber mask.

1685
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1686
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,360
This one seems like, oh, I could see how the what the horror that these people

1687
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:58,560
may have actually gone through to make them crazy.

1688
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,440
Like all disfigured and crazy.

1689
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,840
Yeah. So basically, long story short,

1690
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:06,800
this was the first time when you had like maybe a bit of enjoyment.

1691
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:09,960
And then at the end, which we don't have to watch all this,

1692
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:13,760
but at the end, as you're leaving, they're dripping water on you

1693
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,840
in this like very narrow hallway.

1694
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:19,000
And yeah, it it smells weird and you feel like it's wax.

1695
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:22,880
So, you know, you're going to get the wax face as well.

1696
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,040
That's what's going to happen.

1697
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:27,200
I like the stuff where it's like there was something earlier

1698
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,520
that was clearly under a sheet and you think it's going to move,

1699
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,760
but it's a trick. Nothing happens.

1700
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:37,360
And it's to draw your attention to and really something's coming at you

1701
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,440
from the other direction.

1702
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:42,280
There's this giant, terrifying Kronenberg puppet.

1703
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,960
Yes. Like body horror thing, which is very impressive.

1704
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,360
And they have so many puppets.

1705
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,280
There's so many great puppets at Knott's.

1706
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,160
Hopefully Six Flags doesn't buy Knott's,

1707
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,560
which is a rumor we haven't talked about.

1708
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,800
No, they turned down the bid. Oh, they did.

1709
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,920
Cedar Fair turned down the bid. They said four billion.

1710
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:01,800
It was too cheap. So six for sale.

1711
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:05,680
Four billion they offered to buy all Cedar Fair, which is interesting

1712
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:09,400
because that's the water, the wax effects, which do drip

1713
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:12,640
and like get close to your legs, which are very cool.

1714
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:17,560
Six Flags and Knott's are like they are.

1715
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:20,840
Six Flags has like over twice as many parks as Knott's.

1716
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,640
But in terms of valuations,

1717
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:27,080
it wouldn't Six Flags worth a little more, but it's not worth a lot more.

1718
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,680
Yeah. Cedar Fair like probably the right move.

1719
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:32,200
There are some reasons in the Patreon.

1720
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,000
There will be a...

1721
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,360
The Friday Fest episode of Patreon.com, which I guess we just agreed

1722
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:39,920
during the break, which has not come out yet.

1723
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,440
It's not. It's not come out yet.

1724
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:42,400
It's coming out.

1725
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,840
Determined the timeline that you're on listener.

1726
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Yeah. But please do subscribe to Patreon.com slash podcast

1727
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,280
right here about Six Flags Friday Fest.

1728
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,800
But for now, what else is Knott's?

1729
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,800
So yeah, so so we did waxworks.

1730
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,240
Then we I think had another boysenberry beer.

1731
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:01,880
Oh, I wanted to say that something funny you did a couple of times,

1732
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:05,400
definitely in the alien one is when

1733
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:09,040
we'd come across somebody who'd been infected.

1734
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:13,840
You just he went, I'm so sorry, there's nothing we can do for you.

1735
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,640
And the guy went,

1736
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,680
I feel like I get less nervous if I say stuff.

1737
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:23,760
Yeah. So I definitely breaks the tension.

1738
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,000
I think I did that in the zombie.

1739
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,400
It's another fast forward.

1740
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,240
A couple of times.

1741
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:30,680
Yeah. If there's a one where it's like zombies or aliens,

1742
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,480
where it's like these people are infected,

1743
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,040
I guess I should have done in waxworks.

1744
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,840
I mean, you did apologize.

1745
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,200
So sorry, I can't help.

1746
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,160
You were like me once.

1747
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:41,960
Yeah. Like, oh, there, but for the grace of God.

1748
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,440
Bye.

1749
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:50,280
So we got we collect you were very I feel like we were like we chilled out.

1750
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:54,040
We had the boysenberry beer and you were like, I can do this.

1751
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:56,200
I feel like you said I can do this.

1752
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,440
A very dramatic way.

1753
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:02,640
I went through the mazes like stiff as a board with my hands at my side.

1754
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:06,120
Just ready as opposed to arms closed.

1755
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:09,600
Fine as opposed to like gripping Mike or even holding his shirt.

1756
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,680
I was just like, yeah, you were.

1757
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,560
Yes, you were very brave.

1758
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,800
Were you sore the next day?

1759
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:22,440
Going to sleep that night was a little difficult because I still felt on guard.

1760
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:25,720
Your norphans still still up.

1761
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:27,560
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

1762
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:29,800
So it's like a book had fallen in the bedroom.

1763
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:30,600
Yeah.

1764
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:31,280
All right.

1765
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:34,600
What I kept saying is it's like it doesn't matter

1766
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,720
that you know why you're getting scared.

1767
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:39,120
Your body doesn't know why you're getting scared.

1768
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:44,960
Your body just thinks there's a threat and there's been a threat for four hours straight.

1769
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,800
Yes, that's true.

1770
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,720
I think one of the things that might what the fuck.

1771
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:53,320
I want to keep reading about like the science behind all this,

1772
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:59,640
because I think that can help me demystify it a little like your brain science,

1773
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:05,240
like like why we react to like this startling version and this startling thing.

1774
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:09,040
And I know people have talked about before,

1775
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:14,600
like fear and laughter are two like just reactions you have.

1776
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:15,400
Involuntary.

1777
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:17,520
They're involuntary.

1778
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,000
So, yeah.

1779
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,880
Well, the best research you can do is by seeing Joker in theaters now.

1780
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:25,560
Fear and laughter clashing.

1781
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:29,160
You got to. They made a Joker movie and there's no Batman.

1782
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,120
There's no Batman to save us.

1783
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,320
It's pretty bald.

1784
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,440
It's pretty experimental.

1785
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:37,760
But the public went for it and it goes to show experimental films can work these days.

1786
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,840
Sure.

1787
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:41,280
It's a big risk. The studio took a big risk.

1788
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:47,080
These artists and they they fought the woke culture and they won.

1789
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,360
We're talking about the clown prince of crime.

1790
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:54,000
Like this guy thinks crime is funny.

1791
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:55,640
I don't know.

1792
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,880
There's some sounds like a not scary farm idea.

1793
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,000
Yeah, it sounds like you would be like Dr.

1794
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,520
Augustus scratch, you know, as twisted as his brain.

1795
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,160
Where's his origin story?

1796
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:11,800
We're putting Dr. Augustus scratch in mean streets.

1797
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:14,240
Todd Phillips presents.

1798
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:18,080
Oh, also, I figured out one of these parks could make the bathroom scary

1799
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,920
if they theme it to Chuck Berry's old restaurant.

1800
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,120
What's that sound?

1801
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:24,960
What's that?

1802
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:29,280
Recording sound because he hit cameras in a restaurant.

1803
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,200
Oh, of course.

1804
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:31,880
So I avoided jail time in the bathroom.

1805
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:32,400
Yeah, in the bathroom.

1806
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,080
Man, was I confused just then.

1807
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:36,400
I was like, I'm sure it'll be clear in a second.

1808
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,640
Classic reaches.

1809
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:40,440
There's some weird job very footage out there.

1810
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,480
Just Google. We won't talk about it.

1811
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,240
For sure.

1812
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:47,320
So let's talk about what's a manufactured scary thing.

1813
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:48,520
I don't know.

1814
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,520
No, no, that's not what you mean.

1815
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,760
It's a different thing.

1816
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,040
And I don't even want to say it later.

1817
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:55,360
I'll say it later.

1818
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,080
It's disturbing.

1819
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:02,080
Anyway, so then we did the two things that you guys did last year,

1820
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:04,560
which, of course, are always delightful.

1821
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,880
The Timber Mountain Log Rides.

1822
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:09,680
Oh, you were going to say a maze.

1823
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:10,920
Oh, no, no, no.

1824
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,920
This is a legitimate the dark.

1825
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,040
The dark.

1826
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:17,800
OK, no, the mine cart and the Timber Mountain Log Ride.

1827
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:20,400
Halloween, which is the Halloween Hootenain.

1828
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,800
The band which and the bear that says

1829
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,760
trick or treat. Yeah.

1830
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:26,840
What a fall.

1831
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:30,440
Really? I wish we had more time to do it again, because it's so fun.

1832
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,000
It goes so fast.

1833
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,160
It's just rocketing through there.

1834
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,600
And there's an original song mountain does better.

1835
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:38,880
Yeah. Well, it's to have a slow and it's very long.

1836
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,920
Yeah. There's an original song in there.

1837
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:46,040
Yeah. And I can't find a version of it, but it's just to this ride.

1838
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,240
And it's about like a Halloween Hootenain.

1839
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,960
And that's who the and the band.

1840
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:52,440
I wrote the name of the band down.

1841
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,240
They are. Where is it?

1842
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,000
Oh, shit. Michael.

1843
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,080
Well, formerly Billy Hill and the Hillbillies at Disneyland.

1844
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,520
Well, no, no, the band on the ride. Yeah.

1845
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:03,400
What a fake band.

1846
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:05,680
I'm talking about the band with the like swamp monster.

1847
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,800
Oh, I sorry. I meant the record.

1848
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,640
The people who record the song.

1849
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:12,240
Oh, the people who perform at knots now that used to perform.

1850
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,480
Yes. I'm just talking about the name of crazy.

1851
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:17,080
Right, right, right, right, right. Yes.

1852
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:21,320
It is the Calico Coffin Creepers.

1853
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:22,760
Delightful.

1854
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:25,520
And it's like there's an alien, there's a swamp monster.

1855
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:26,560
And they're playing a band.

1856
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,120
I just that is the one part.

1857
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:30,720
The alien's involvement is the funniest part to me.

1858
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,520
Yeah, yeah. Because yes, the grab bag.

1859
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:35,720
An alien has crash landed in the Timber Mountain Log ride,

1860
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:39,320
and he's joined up in a band because it happens to be Halloween.

1861
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:40,760
Because it's Halloween.

1862
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:43,000
And he's just a gray. It's just a gray.

1863
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,800
He's not really adored or anything.

1864
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,480
No, he's not like a monster.

1865
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,000
And it is so fun.

1866
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,760
That's the one scene I wish was slower when the bear goes to her treat.

1867
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,560
And then you go around and you see the band.

1868
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,880
I wish we could stop there for like a minute.

1869
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,000
But that was great.

1870
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,880
The lighting around there is really great.

1871
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:02,480
And anyway, that's yeah, you got to do that.

1872
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,920
Any thoughts on?

1873
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,520
Just the minor ride.

1874
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:11,560
The pressing was so disturbing without being in the Halloween theme.

1875
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,480
They're just sad.

1876
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,360
They're just creepy and sad.

1877
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,360
Yes. They've all.

1878
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,320
Our lives.

1879
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,440
Yeah, they've all gone mad from being in this mine.

1880
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:25,440
And is that an intended story?

1881
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:29,680
Because it certainly felt like they had designed it that way.

1882
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:33,720
It's a they were disturbing miners.

1883
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,920
If Walter, Walter not probably was like these men got what they deserve.

1884
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,040
They work for a big corporation.

1885
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,760
Get yourself out of the working class.

1886
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:43,920
Yeah, I want to be out of it.

1887
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,240
Bootstraps, pull yourself up by them.

1888
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:48,200
Yeah, it's a good question.

1889
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:51,960
I assume that I assume part of it is like it was tough work,

1890
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:56,640
but also another part of it was like rubber faced robot creeps.

1891
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:58,760
Just like that's just there's they're only going to look

1892
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:01,120
they're going to look like that, unfortunately, and that especially.

1893
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,600
They've renovated them, but like the year that we're built,

1894
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,280
it just felt purposeful.

1895
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:08,960
That's when we do the episode, maybe we'll look into that.

1896
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:10,640
That is a good point, because it does.

1897
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:13,360
It's like it's like the further.

1898
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:17,360
So like Disneyland has Big Thunder Mountain, it's like,

1899
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:19,000
yeah, you're a miner.

1900
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,320
And then Orlando has the like

1901
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,880
song 16 tons where it's just like a mining company

1902
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,400
owns your soul and you are indebted to them forever.

1903
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,840
And at the end of the day, there will be shakedowns

1904
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:35,680
to make sure you're not hiding any gold on you.

1905
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,800
And then this one is just like the miners have gone mad

1906
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,960
and they're like bordering zombies.

1907
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,480
Mm hmm. Yeah, that's a good point.

1908
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:43,960
It's a progression. Right.

1909
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:45,680
Those are all like they're all of a piece.

1910
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,880
Yeah, maybe. Yeah.

1911
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:49,560
Uh, yeah, we'll look into that.

1912
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,200
We'll look at interpretation.

1913
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:52,800
I'm trying to the one it did open the 60s.

1914
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,560
That opened in the 60s. Yeah.

1915
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,600
So do not Walter not have something to do with it?

1916
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:58,520
Yeah. Well, when did he die?

1917
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:00,600
When did he die? Yeah. Yeah.

1918
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:05,880
I saw his wife, a clip of his wife with the Nats, the Bears,

1919
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:09,120
the Berry Tales Bears on Instagram the other day.

1920
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,280
Anyway, so we did those two.

1921
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,680
Then we did Dark Ride, which is like fine.

1922
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:14,800
It was fine. Fine.

1923
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,920
And I'm really scared of clowns. Yeah.

1924
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,240
I have a history with clowns.

1925
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,560
You have a history with clowns.

1926
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:23,760
They did that it mays last year at that Warner Brothers thing,

1927
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,080
which I wanted to do.

1928
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:26,640
No fucking way. Yeah.

1929
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:29,120
No, not even after this.

1930
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:33,040
I will never do an it themed clown

1931
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,560
because that is the source of my clown fear.

1932
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:40,120
Oh, oh, the original direct, like the original TV movie Tim

1933
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:41,200
Curry clown.

1934
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:45,720
I wouldn't shower without someone else in the room with me for three years

1935
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:49,760
because I was convinced a clown was going to come up out of the shower drain.

1936
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:53,840
Or actually, I say that, but it's not that I was convinced.

1937
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:55,960
I knew it would not happen.

1938
01:32:56,240 --> 01:33:00,680
But when I got in the shower, I would have a panic attack as though it might.

1939
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,240
I couldn't get it out of my mind.

1940
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:06,000
So I said, OK, let's go on Dark Ride full of clowns.

1941
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:09,720
Oh, my God. But it was like, OK.

1942
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:11,840
Yeah. So you were. Yes, I was a little.

1943
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,800
I felt pretty blah about it.

1944
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:17,160
Yeah, I was a little worried going in like, OK, maybe this will not be good.

1945
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:18,720
But yeah, you were like, I think you cut.

1946
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,280
We were like, even like kind of like none of them were Tim Curry.

1947
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,920
So it was fine.

1948
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:26,000
If by heaven's stands, Tim Curry was working that night.

1949
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,680
It would have been trouble. Yeah. Yeah.

1950
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:31,560
So we did that. Then we did Shadowlands.

1951
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,280
I liked Shadowlands.

1952
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:37,440
Shadowlands is like a like a samurai kind of a theme.

1953
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:41,280
Like you're going to like Japanese house.

1954
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:46,040
Yes. And there's like undead demon warriors.

1955
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:50,240
And there's like a rope effect, not unlike the delirium delirium thing

1956
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:53,560
we did where a guy got attacked by a rock monster and pulled back.

1957
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,960
Oh, great. They got like one of those.

1958
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:56,760
That's really fun.

1959
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:58,640
I got a giant demon.

1960
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:04,480
I saw it was there, but I didn't expect it to come out of the wall at me.

1961
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,600
Oh, yeah. Yeah. There's like a clap, like a clapping

1962
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:09,560
and his arms are out.

1963
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:13,280
Yeah. And I saw it there and it was like had its arms out.

1964
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:17,040
But then it came out of the wall, which I didn't expect.

1965
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:21,600
So that was one of the only times I actually yelled in one of the mazes.

1966
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,760
But you're being very brave. Thank you.

1967
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:28,080
And then we walked and we did Pumpkin Eater.

1968
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:32,120
But this is the section of scare actors where we were alone.

1969
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:35,360
Yeah. And there were just so many of them, 15 of them.

1970
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:38,200
Yeah. And it was really foggy.

1971
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:40,400
No, it got foggy in a different spot.

1972
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:45,200
But those scare actors were also had the more interesting costumes.

1973
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:48,280
Like there was that one person with the shawl over them

1974
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:50,800
and the lantern and the tiny little skull face.

1975
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,480
Oh, and I like that. I kept going.

1976
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,680
I like this one because you did that.

1977
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,160
He followed us around.

1978
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:58,080
He just followed us around.

1979
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,360
But he wasn't a jump out scare actor.

1980
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:05,200
He was just like creepy guy, like swinging his lantern around as he went.

1981
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:09,360
And like his true his true the performers face is like hidden under a shawl.

1982
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:12,680
And there's like a face, a fake tiny skull face

1983
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:16,200
like coming out of the top of the performers had, I would guess. Great.

1984
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,960
And and you just went, oh, I like this guy.

1985
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:22,680
And then he was just the third member of our party for a while.

1986
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:25,440
Yeah. And then there were other people joined.

1987
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:28,320
There was like a man who tried to get us to see the witch burning.

1988
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:32,640
That was happening to all the other guys, the right fans.

1989
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:33,400
There was a listener.

1990
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,600
But yeah, somebody listens to you.

1991
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,760
I think they listen to both of our podcasts.

1992
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,800
I think so. I believe so.

1993
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,160
They're like, oh, Lindsey, I listen to your podcast as well.

1994
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:45,160
I think I only remember, oh, and Lindsey, which typically happens.

1995
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:48,440
Yes, I think we've talked about we've talked about this.

1996
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:50,240
Or maybe we're going to talk about it.

1997
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:52,360
It's your aunt.

1998
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:56,600
You were recognized as as the in the podcast, the right universe, as opposed to it.

1999
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,800
As a primary in their own universe. Yeah.

2000
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:03,000
I'm not recognized for the Teen Creeps universe, but you're right.

2001
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,680
They may have said something about Teen Creeps as well. Right.

2002
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:07,600
It's like as if Dr.

2003
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,600
Strange, when you'd be like, oh, Dr.

2004
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:13,520
Strange, you're from Thor, Ragnarok, not your own movie, Dr.

2005
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,960
Strange. You know, I'm a Thor fan, but I know Dr.

2006
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,880
Strange is from Thor, not from. Yeah.

2007
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:21,040
So you're like, that would be the same thing.

2008
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,120
Jason, have you been recognized for being part of the Duncan verse?

2009
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:31,000
Oh, I've been recognized for being part of the Allstate verse.

2010
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:33,240
Well, you're a major part of the Allstate.

2011
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:35,480
So you're the primary member of the Allstate.

2012
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:36,840
Yeah, you are the Allstate.

2013
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:41,360
I was I was on a CVS on Wilshire and a guy was like, hey,

2014
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:44,120
you're in that Allstate commercial.

2015
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:45,080
And I went, oh, yeah.

2016
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:48,440
And he goes, that's really good work.

2017
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:49,520
And I was like, oh, thank you.

2018
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:50,520
I mean, I was very impressed.

2019
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:54,040
Like he was like so complimentary of like the performance in the commercial.

2020
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:57,080
I don't know if he had something to do with the business or anyway.

2021
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:00,560
My craziest recognizing, let me say really fast, is that I have this whole

2022
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:04,120
fair. I've talked about in the podcast, I have this whole history with The Room,

2023
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:05,080
the bad movie, The Room.

2024
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:09,240
Yes, I was so and I saw it a lot of my mind was blown when I was like,

2025
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,760
it's in my Wikipedia even. I'm happy.

2026
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:14,400
I was like one of the first people to see the thing amazingly.

2027
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:18,200
And there was like a this DVD that the room people put out.

2028
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:20,400
There was an audience reactions DVD.

2029
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:23,000
And it's me in 2004 as a dopey,

2030
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,880
wormy little bad improviser in college,

2031
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:29,560
just like clearly sarcastically going on and on about the movie.

2032
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:32,320
Although I love it very, very, very much anyway.

2033
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,560
So this is DVD where you can watch me and a bunch of my friends,

2034
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:36,560
you know, rambling about The Room.

2035
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:39,640
I shared an office with

2036
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:43,200
Oz Rodriguez at Funny or Die for a long time.

2037
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:46,240
And I finally started talking about like, yeah, that's the thing with The Room.

2038
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,640
And he was like, that's where I know you from.

2039
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:51,280
I had that DVD for so long and I was like,

2040
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:53,320
who are these fucking dweebs going on?

2041
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:58,280
It was like six months of sharing an office with somebody.

2042
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,880
And he was like, man, he's like this dork.

2043
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:04,160
You're that fucking dork.

2044
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:08,320
I was proud, but also like, oh, no, I was so dweeby in this.

2045
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:10,600
I lodged myself in your brain.

2046
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:13,320
And he thought that you were sincere.

2047
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:14,600
Yeah, or just let her know.

2048
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:18,520
I knew when he's like, who are these hipsters going on about this movie?

2049
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,840
Anyway, I do love The Room very much.

2050
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:23,520
I'm proud of my association with it anyway.

2051
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:24,160
And you're in the room.

2052
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:25,360
Happy to be in the room averse.

2053
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:26,600
Wow. I'm in the book.

2054
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:28,040
The Disaster Artist, right?

2055
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:29,040
Photo of me.

2056
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:32,360
If you're at the bookstore and you see the book, The Disaster Artist, pick it up.

2057
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:35,000
And there's a picture of me in the book.

2058
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:35,920
All right. So let's do that.

2059
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,720
Take a picture in the movie.

2060
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,040
Jason played Scott in the movie.

2061
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:40,840
Take a picture.

2062
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:42,920
If you own a Barnes and Noble, pick up the book.

2063
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:43,720
Oh, yeah, I do.

2064
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:44,400
I know.

2065
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,920
Scott, I'm really proud of it.

2066
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:46,760
Like, why else would I?

2067
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:48,360
I don't have a picture in a book.

2068
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:49,360
You haven't written a book.

2069
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:50,320
So open the book.

2070
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:53,040
Take a selfie with you and Scott in the book.

2071
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:56,600
A photo taken by Aaron, my now wife, who was my friend back then.

2072
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:58,760
Hashtag, wow.

2073
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:01,400
Scott and Scott Roomverse.

2074
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:03,960
Hashtag Scott, those were the days.

2075
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:06,160
Hashtag Scott, those were the days.

2076
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:06,960
And if you find pictures.

2077
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,400
Oh, actually, let's keep it.

2078
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,360
Hashtag, oh, hi, Scott.

2079
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:12,240
Oh, yeah. OK. OK, great.

2080
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:14,280
Oh, hashtag. Oh, hi, Scott.

2081
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:16,480
OK, great. That's a new meme now.

2082
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,240
Anyway, sorry. No, no, no.

2083
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:19,920
So we did. Yeah, Shadowlands.

2084
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:20,800
Very cool.

2085
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:21,760
Mm hmm.

2086
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:24,680
Shadowlands was interesting last year was one of the first ones I did.

2087
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,520
And I was still in the fog of being terrified.

2088
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:30,160
So I didn't like it back then, but now I did like it.

2089
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,800
So I knew it was kind of a paranormal ink for you.

2090
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:36,080
Yes. So it lifted.

2091
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:39,720
And then, you know, we walked through this so many different scare actors.

2092
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:43,040
My favorite one of my favorite things was that there was a scare actor

2093
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:47,800
literally just hiding like a cartoon character behind a light post.

2094
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:49,440
Like just like this.

2095
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,960
And then, oh, yeah, he got everybody.

2096
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,960
It was wild. Except for us.

2097
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:57,080
Except for us, because we were just lingering with with those people,

2098
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:59,920
the listeners and then some performers that came up

2099
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,600
and tried to get us to watch a witch burning,

2100
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:06,600
which you poke some holes, I believe, in the logic of what he was saying.

2101
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:09,240
Remember, he said, I forget you broke.

2102
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:15,360
Yeah, well, possibly, at least in regards to the movie, The Wicker Man.

2103
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:18,280
They were like, we're putting all the witches inside a wicker man.

2104
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:21,440
I was like, I thought that was the witch's job to do to you guys.

2105
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:25,440
I thought the men go in the wicker man.

2106
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:28,480
I was looking for lore and I couldn't really find anything definitive

2107
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:31,960
because it's all like it was, I guess, just a way for Christians

2108
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:33,480
to scare people about druids.

2109
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:35,720
They were like, and they burn people in a wicker man.

2110
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:38,400
Everybody's like, whoa, OK, Jesus.

2111
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:39,400
And that looked really cool.

2112
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:42,320
Well, we had a dog to take out and amazes to finish.

2113
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,720
So we wanted to see the burn, a witch burning.

2114
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:48,200
Oh, yeah. And we we were going to watch Puppet up

2115
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:50,680
because you were sort of morbidly curious.

2116
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:54,000
And the second we sat down, I went, I don't want to spend

2117
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,280
20 minutes of the night watching.

2118
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:59,600
I've seen Roshi Puppets before. I know what's coming.

2119
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:02,600
Yeah, you sat down and then you were like, I don't want to watch this.

2120
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:05,280
And I was like, all right, you're right. Fair enough.

2121
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,720
Yeah, you are cool.

2122
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:11,720
We only had so much time, though.

2123
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:14,080
Yes, we had a dog take out and we wanted to do all the mazes.

2124
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:18,680
Look, I had very, you know, not too long ago, saw my friend Nate's show

2125
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:21,400
where it was like raunchy puppet lame is.

2126
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,640
So I'm good for a while.

2127
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:25,720
That's going to last me like five years, maybe.

2128
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:27,800
Yeah. And raunchy puppets. Yeah.

2129
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:30,160
I mean, obviously, I prefer clean puppets.

2130
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:33,680
I like a clean Robin the Frog puppet

2131
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:36,400
singing about sitting on stairs.

2132
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,560
Robin's about the most pure puppet.

2133
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,080
So pure and divisive is for some reason.

2134
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:43,240
I was just about to say very divisive.

2135
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:47,080
Me and Maddie at work love Robin and Justin and Justin Michael,

2136
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:50,040
who just Michael thinks Robin is lame because Justin Michael

2137
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:52,160
also writes for Infinity Train. Right.

2138
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:54,640
And we get in fights about it.

2139
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:59,920
Yes, I don't know why Robin Robin is just Michael of all people.

2140
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,920
That's actually the joke that he makes.

2141
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,560
He's like, I feel like he's always about to be like, huh.

2142
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:07,320
He tiny.

2143
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:11,000
There's a reality where Tiny Tim dies and it's Robin dies.

2144
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,320
I know that scar.

2145
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:15,040
Justin thinks he sucks.

2146
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,760
He take it up with Justin Michael.

2147
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:19,840
I think he's wonderful.

2148
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:22,480
I like every Christmas Eve and I fast forward through the

2149
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:26,000
through the coast of Christmas future because I can't handle it.

2150
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:29,080
It's not like I'm like, oh, Walter's my favorite muppet.

2151
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:31,520
Well, he's cool. Robin is good.

2152
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:35,400
Well, do you like Robin or not, listener?

2153
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:37,480
Let us know.

2154
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:39,440
Hashtag Robin. Yes. Hashtag Robin.

2155
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:41,720
I got a nice feeling when you mentioned Robin.

2156
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:44,320
I like Robin, but he is divisive for whatever reason.

2157
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,240
I don't know why. Is Bean Bunny divisive?

2158
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:49,280
I don't think so. I think everybody likes him.

2159
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:52,160
No, I thought we didn't in our episode were like,

2160
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:54,320
I think we were even sure if we like Bean Bunny.

2161
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,760
Oh, really? I said I liked Bean, didn't I?

2162
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,560
I don't know if I like Bean.

2163
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,960
So we're covering him.

2164
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,680
He certainly can be a bit much a Muppet Vision 3D.

2165
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:06,120
You know, he wants to help.

2166
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:08,480
But he Bean was being positioned, I think we were talking about

2167
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,920
he was being positioned as like a big player.

2168
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,840
Yeah, that's true.

2169
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:15,160
And the film is an odd remnant of any we've done.

2170
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:16,680
Yeah, what else we got here?

2171
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:17,840
We'll do it and we'll do it again.

2172
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,640
No special ops. Skip special ops.

2173
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:21,160
You had done that before. We did not do special ops.

2174
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:22,600
And that was my least favorite.

2175
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:27,600
And it's the gimmick of the gimmick of shooting was not satisfying.

2176
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,880
I don't want to be mass shooting scared.

2177
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:34,960
Yeah. Not scary for him.

2178
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:37,240
I think that I want to be ghost scared.

2179
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:39,920
I wasn't even really into the aliens.

2180
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:41,400
Right.

2181
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:42,760
Or sea creatures.

2182
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:44,720
I want ghosts to scare yourself.

2183
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:46,120
You don't like being scared by aliens.

2184
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:46,880
You want to be scared by ghosts.

2185
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:51,280
I don't want to be scared by real world things like sea creatures and aliens.

2186
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:54,400
You just want to be scared.

2187
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:57,800
I mean, there is some comfort in knowing that it's, you know,

2188
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:01,080
people dressing up in costumes scaring you, because in reality,

2189
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:06,160
real ghosts are residual memories and the residual memories that haunt places

2190
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,040
we can never abandon.

2191
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:10,400
I was just talking about this last night.

2192
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:13,080
Yeah. I honestly I was talking about this on a podcast last night.

2193
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:14,560
That will come out soon.

2194
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:17,280
I was talking about this at a completely separate location last night.

2195
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:18,800
It was time to ghost some podcasts.

2196
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,560
Hmm. It's October.

2197
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:21,480
Yeah, it's October.

2198
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:22,400
Although this is a...

2199
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,440
Tis the season.

2200
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:24,600
This podcast, I don't know.

2201
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:25,920
I think it's coming out next week.

2202
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:30,240
It's called Bigfoot Collectors Club, which I think we'll both do it soon too.

2203
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:32,360
I told them. Yeah, I would do that.

2204
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:35,040
Yeah. So anyway, we talked about that.

2205
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,840
Anyway. So yeah, no special ops.

2206
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:38,520
No special ops.

2207
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,480
So yeah, we did Pumpkin Eater, which...

2208
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:41,880
Pumpkin Eater was great.

2209
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:43,960
Pumpkin Eater, very scary.

2210
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:45,840
Very cool. Very claustrophobic.

2211
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:49,760
But like there's big goopy seeds hanging down the ceiling.

2212
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:52,480
Is there's goopy, like as if you're in a giant pumpkin.

2213
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:57,240
Is it like the seeds hanging from goopy like pumpkin strings?

2214
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:59,440
And like when you're carving out a pumpkin, you know what I'm talking about?

2215
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:01,080
Yeah, we were talking pumpkin.

2216
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:03,240
We were talking Peter Peter.

2217
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:05,160
Peter Peter was bad.

2218
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:06,360
Maybe. Oh, OK.

2219
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:08,080
It's a dark Peter Peter.

2220
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:11,240
If Peter became the pumpkin and ate you.

2221
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:15,520
But I didn't like the inclusion of aliens in Pumpkin Eater.

2222
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:19,800
I was like, no, I just want an evil possessed by a demon.

2223
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:22,320
I want demons, not aliens.

2224
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,080
This is my stance on scares.

2225
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:26,560
I mean, I respectfully disagree.

2226
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:28,000
I mean, it's a matter of taste.

2227
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,120
A lot of I like aliens.

2228
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:31,920
I don't it doesn't need to be everywhere.

2229
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,200
The aliens don't need to be everywhere.

2230
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:35,080
Demons need to be everywhere.

2231
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:37,560
Yeah. All demons all the time.

2232
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:39,600
I didn't mind the aliens here.

2233
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,760
I going through that like corn maze kind of a thing was scary.

2234
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,120
Yeah. A lot of what's also a good trick is when it's open air.

2235
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:48,600
Like, yeah. And I felt like I was going to start sneezing any second.

2236
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,040
So, yeah, it'll fuck with your sinuses.

2237
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:53,320
So that's another plus.

2238
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:58,040
And then we did the last maze, which is I'm trying to find.

2239
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:00,560
I'm going to put the video up, which is new.

2240
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:03,440
Origins, Cozart, yeah, it was great.

2241
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:07,120
And this one, I'm very excited because I kind of realized what was happening.

2242
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:10,360
I didn't really read too much about it is that this is a maze

2243
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:12,680
that gives you the origin of the entire haunt.

2244
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:16,080
So this explains while you're walking through it

2245
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,520
why there are monsters everywhere in Ghost Town.

2246
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,520
What's going on? Yeah, it was cool. Why is that?

2247
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:23,640
Long switch with the witch.

2248
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,800
Oh, so yeah, there's a witch.

2249
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:28,320
So it starts out in like the courthouse.

2250
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:31,720
You got a crazy old like judge who pokes his head out here.

2251
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:34,240
Although now he's apparently not in the video I've picked.

2252
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:36,880
No, there's a judge shouting at us. Yeah.

2253
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:39,240
And he's called that was broken that night.

2254
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:41,000
Also a tit. Well, no, it wasn't a robot.

2255
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,640
It was a man. I didn't remember. Yeah.

2256
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:46,440
Well, he's on a break. This is also just a bad video.

2257
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:49,920
It is a bad video. You go through like, you know, the whole ghost town

2258
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:54,680
and they like kill this woman and burn like they think they burn her in there.

2259
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:57,880
Yeah, I think. Yeah.

2260
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,320
Well, I thought it was an animatronic a second ago.

2261
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:02,720
I can't be trusted. That's fair.

2262
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:05,440
And all the sets I'm trying to go to curses the town, right?

2263
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:08,680
Yeah. Yeah. So she curses them because they killed her.

2264
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:13,800
Yes. And there's like a classic tale and the tale is all this time.

2265
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:14,880
She raises.

2266
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:21,240
She says all these scare actors will scare teens from far and wide.

2267
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:23,560
It not scary for them.

2268
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,680
Yeah, here's a better video.

2269
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:27,960
So you're going in like old timey schoolhouses.

2270
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:29,920
This was one of my favorites.

2271
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:32,600
Yeah. So you're going in like the whole like fucked up.

2272
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:34,840
I mean, that's all the ghost town stuff.

2273
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:37,360
But you get to walk through it and it's all scarified.

2274
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:40,360
Yes. But I love a creepy old schoolhouse.

2275
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:42,720
And it's great because like we've talked about this many times,

2276
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:46,200
not expanding sort of the Calico, the ghost town stuff.

2277
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:49,320
And this just adds a little bit more mythology to it.

2278
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:57,240
And yeah, and this is also coming up is where I got hit with a giant foam hand,

2279
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:59,520
which was another accident that happened.

2280
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:03,800
Scared the shit out of me.

2281
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:04,560
Which is a good thing.

2282
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:08,120
Those were foam because I would have probably been knocked out.

2283
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:10,680
That's why they make them foam. I'm sure.

2284
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:12,680
Yeah, they're not supposed to do that.

2285
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:13,720
We're just watching this.

2286
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:16,200
So there's a place that goes outdoors, which is really fun.

2287
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:21,280
And then the big the big sort of ending is that we go to the end.

2288
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,560
And Jason, did you watch this already?

2289
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:27,000
Yeah, I can't remember how it ends.

2290
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:31,000
There is a spooky lady, very Wizard of Oz style

2291
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,640
witch that is finally revealed, like sort of it's her origin story.

2292
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:37,560
I think to that's the hand I got hit with. Oh, yeah.

2293
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:41,600
Oh, that is a huge, giant, giant hand.

2294
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:43,520
I was pictured a lot smaller than that.

2295
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:47,120
Yeah. And they obviously honestly, in my memory, my memory,

2296
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:49,280
it was smaller than that, too.

2297
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:53,600
It's crazy to think that Knott's is the more like homegrown smaller part,

2298
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:57,360
because I mean, Universal has a full movie studio at its beck and call.

2299
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,160
So the production values are very high.

2300
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:03,240
But Knott's has almost like equally high production values.

2301
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:08,360
It's like very dedicated to its scary farm premise.

2302
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:10,400
Yeah. Yes. And they're the original haunt.

2303
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:13,600
Yeah, I'm sure that that's why they really.

2304
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:16,560
But yeah, when you look at all this stuff, it is easy to take it

2305
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:20,160
like for granted how much work, big pain in the ass.

2306
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:22,680
It's got to be to set this like 10 of these things up.

2307
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,440
Yeah, all temporary. That's really good.

2308
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:28,160
Come up with the story and map it out so that it's not the same as every other one.

2309
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:32,720
But it is cool, like that Cedar Fair still lets them do all this stuff.

2310
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:36,160
And, you know, six flags, six flags by that buys it.

2311
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:39,640
I don't know if we're in for like a doesn't seem like they're going to come

2312
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:42,200
with this doesn't seem like it.

2313
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:43,480
I don't know. OK, so here.

2314
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:45,960
Yeah, here's the reveal. And we'll post all these links.

2315
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:47,960
There's just a witch flying around.

2316
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:51,080
Oh, god damn it. This video is not going to even show you the witch.

2317
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,440
Stop showing your dumb friend.

2318
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:56,840
It's a what she dressed like the wicked witch of the West from from.

2319
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:58,000
Oh, here we go.

2320
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,320
There's a link.

2321
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:02,160
It's like she's flying around, which looks like a lot of fun.

2322
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:04,880
She's on this like circular around for hours.

2323
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:08,280
Very fun. Very cool.

2324
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:10,920
And we were and then we were like, well, we've got to go.

2325
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:11,960
Oh, we also did.

2326
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:14,840
You have to go into like the depths of hell through.

2327
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:17,320
Yes. Vinyl siding.

2328
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:19,320
Yes. Like squishes you.

2329
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:21,640
Hell's walls are vinyl siding.

2330
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:22,480
Oh, boy.

2331
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,360
It's a better bet it smells.

2332
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:27,760
It's like being birthed through a black canal into hell.

2333
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:32,600
While there are all these like screens made to look like mirrors

2334
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:35,880
or something where the calico witch is screaming at you.

2335
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:37,960
Yeah, yeah. Like she's appearing in a mirror.

2336
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:40,120
Very cool effects. Very cool.

2337
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:43,320
I could have done with like less neon green and more.

2338
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:47,360
Neon, you know, neon feels like a more modern color.

2339
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:48,720
A little modern. Yeah.

2340
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:50,320
So this is this was supposed to be a little old.

2341
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:51,320
It should have been maybe like.

2342
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:55,400
Yeah, that like neon blues and greens feel too new.

2343
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:57,680
So but very good.

2344
01:50:57,680 --> 01:50:59,600
So, Lindsey, where do you land?

2345
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:01,000
Would you do this again?

2346
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,400
I would do it again. OK. I would.

2347
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:06,400
So there's a gradient by the midway through you're on board.

2348
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:11,240
Yeah. And definitely looking back, I'm remembering it more fondly

2349
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,200
because I keep saying like, oh, yeah, it was great.

2350
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:18,960
But keep in mind that when I was experiencing it, I was still going

2351
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:24,840
Yes. You ground your teeth down to a nub.

2352
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:27,200
Just a low moan the whole time.

2353
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:30,560
Like any of us need another reason to grind our teeth.

2354
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,760
Yeah, I know. I know.

2355
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:34,680
That's where all the anxiety lives asleep. Yeah.

2356
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:38,080
Or lack of it. Do you think we need to

2357
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:41,200
would you go so far as to saying Jason and I need to get off our asses

2358
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:44,320
and do this? I think you should do at least two.

2359
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:47,640
Two mazes or two mazes? Two mazes.

2360
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:50,120
Two mazes. At not. At a haunt.

2361
01:51:50,240 --> 01:51:51,400
Which oh, you just.

2362
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:52,640
Are we calling a haunt?

2363
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:53,960
And what is a maze?

2364
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:55,280
A maze is like a single.

2365
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:56,520
It's like waxworks.

2366
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:58,280
But a haunt is the whole thing.

2367
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:00,600
Yeah. This whole time we've been saying you love haunts.

2368
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:02,760
I thought they were the individual mazes.

2369
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:03,640
No, they aren't.

2370
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:06,000
Well, he does love them, but he also loves the forest.

2371
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,840
Was wrong. And the trees.

2372
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:10,040
Two mazes. Two mazes.

2373
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:10,880
Two mazes.

2374
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:16,200
Just because of my experience where I was like black out, nervous.

2375
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:20,200
And it took me a second one to go, OK, I get this.

2376
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:22,800
I would say it's like it does take three or four.

2377
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:27,440
I would say give it to, but probably it's going to take four.

2378
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:33,280
I wonder if you think after after two, if you're truly like, no,

2379
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:36,840
I cannot handle this, then at least you tried a couple of times.

2380
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,320
Two boysenberry beers.

2381
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:39,480
And then you start. Yeah.

2382
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:40,320
Is also a good.

2383
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,880
I really liked that boysenberry beer, too.

2384
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:45,440
But I am wondering if I was thrown off a little last year

2385
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:48,000
because not this kind of unfamiliar to me.

2386
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,200
But like, I've never been to Hollywood.

2387
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:52,200
I've never been to nots.

2388
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:57,160
But I think like if I universal Hollywood in the back lot, I know pretty well.

2389
01:52:57,160 --> 01:52:59,920
So I'm like, oh, I'm wondering if there would be a slight comfort,

2390
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:02,720
a slight more knowing that the set of the voice is right.

2391
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,360
Just steps away. Yeah.

2392
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:05,920
The chairs are right there.

2393
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:06,680
This is the voice.

2394
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:09,120
Can come save me with a Patronus.

2395
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:10,040
Yeah.

2396
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:12,240
Except the part that part of the park is closed.

2397
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:14,240
What? Yeah.

2398
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:16,320
But Diagon Alley is open during.

2399
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:17,880
Right. And they do that like fun show.

2400
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:18,560
Is that right?

2401
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:21,520
They're doing a show in Orlando during like at night.

2402
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:23,680
So they're doing the dark arts show.

2403
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:25,640
There's a different one with like different shows.

2404
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:28,880
Death Eaters coming out at night in Orlando, which is fun.

2405
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:32,360
The hanging.

2406
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:34,040
I thought it was going to be fun and creepy.

2407
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:35,280
Do you guys know what it's like?

2408
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:36,800
Because Justin Michael told me about it.

2409
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:37,880
It's like Bill and Ted.

2410
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:39,600
Yeah. What the fuck is that about?

2411
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:42,000
I don't want a fun, goofy.

2412
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:45,120
I want more ghost hangings.

2413
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:47,240
I want it to be a creepy show.

2414
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:50,560
Why would you have a funny show at not scary farm?

2415
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,760
Everything there should be creepy.

2416
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:56,240
Well, because you can get a little body or like the starway tells you

2417
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,840
don't smoke. Well, let Pub It Up do that.

2418
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:01,960
Alvira was that contained to a single room.

2419
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:03,840
But you were and I told you

2420
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:05,760
Alvira had done a show there for like 30 years.

2421
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:08,120
You like that? That's different.

2422
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:08,880
Because she's body.

2423
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:10,120
It's a brand you trust.

2424
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:11,120
She's.

2425
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:14,880
Her own special thing,

2426
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:19,680
but if you're just throwing yet another pop culture, a reference

2427
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:24,000
joke show at the audience, I find that unacceptable.

2428
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
I see. Well, I have to say.

2429
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:32,800
On like a Halloween tradition of like herself, a crypt keeper and

2430
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:34,640
all the classic horror.

2431
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:38,000
Whereas if you're just going to do like which Bill and Ted?

2432
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:39,800
No, boo. I see.

2433
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:41,200
Well, even doing the show for a long time.

2434
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:42,760
I know. Justin told me that.

2435
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:44,760
And again, unacceptable.

2436
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:46,520
It's been longer than I'm sure.

2437
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:48,240
So Bill and Ted ripped it off.

2438
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:51,320
So cool. And the set looks so cool.

2439
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:52,600
The set is very impressive.

2440
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:54,480
And then it's not scary.

2441
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,600
Yeah. No, boo.

2442
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:59,000
Well, turned into a not scary farm.

2443
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:03,880
Maybe there's cool effects in the middle of their pop culture jokes.

2444
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:05,680
I don't care. OK.

2445
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:08,040
So it's down.

2446
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:09,320
We're down on the hanging.

2447
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:12,520
Yeah. I'm glad we didn't take the time to watch it now.

2448
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:16,120
I probably would have Mike, you go see it after you go back.

2449
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:18,360
I do want to go back this year.

2450
01:55:19,240 --> 01:55:22,000
And maybe it's all shows this time.

2451
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:25,000
I have the hanging and then pop conjures.

2452
01:55:25,120 --> 01:55:28,320
Yeah, I have less of a stomach for.

2453
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:31,480
Terrible campy things.

2454
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:35,920
Interesting. I like just campy, but not like I really

2455
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:38,880
gnarled your teeth is awful.

2456
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:43,320
I like not pop culture.

2457
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:50,240
Lazy pop culture pun and references is not camp to me.

2458
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:55,480
So I like camp, not this is bad and I'm going to laugh at it as much.

2459
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:57,080
I don't have as much of a stomach for it.

2460
01:55:57,080 --> 01:56:00,560
I think I said the thing with Bill and Ted seemed like it was camp

2461
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:02,920
made entirely by heterosexuals.

2462
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:06,400
That just doesn't seem to click.

2463
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:10,400
Which Bill and Ted are the ultimate no homo characters.

2464
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:12,960
I think they yelled that in the show.

2465
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:14,240
Oh, do that in the movie.

2466
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:16,800
Those horrific movies. Yes.

2467
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:19,680
Man, can't wait for the third one.

2468
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:21,160
I have a feeling.

2469
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:22,800
I have never seen.

2470
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:25,160
I'm sure it's fine now.

2471
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:30,760
Apparently Keanu Reeves is a special angel sent to us from heaven.

2472
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:32,640
He's such a good person.

2473
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:34,720
Seemingly. Yeah, that's what everyone says.

2474
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:38,000
Yes. I have a quick pitch for for the hanging.

2475
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:41,120
The actor, I forget the gentleman's name, who played Jeannie

2476
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:43,920
in the California Adventure Show, put him in the hanging.

2477
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:47,760
Yeah, if you're going to do it to pop culture jokes there.

2478
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:50,240
So we have the ultimate version of it.

2479
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:52,800
Yeah. And also take the Bill and Ted actors and put them down there, too.

2480
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:57,000
So like have a whole team up of all of the best pop culture theme park shows.

2481
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:02,120
I'd watch that. I'd watch Avengers Infinity War.

2482
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:04,840
All the theme park.

2483
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:06,680
What a dream that would be.

2484
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:11,080
And then like the donkey cart, the donkey universal cart is on stage as well.

2485
01:57:12,280 --> 01:57:15,040
And then it really is the scariest thing.

2486
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:18,840
Yeah. Well, audience of four by end of show.

2487
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:20,640
Nuts try.

2488
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:24,120
And it's you three and someone else who's been on the podcast.

2489
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:30,240
Six Flags, if you're listening and you've bought Cedar Fair by this point,

2490
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:31,240
that's what we want.

2491
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:34,600
So anyway, that's it.

2492
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:36,760
We did it. Yeah, I love it.

2493
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:38,800
So we still love Hanson. Lindsey loves Hans, too.

2494
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,320
Now she loves him as much as I do.

2495
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:43,280
I am warming up to see.

2496
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:47,240
Yeah, I love seeing the look on your face and say it loves.

2497
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:49,680
I read horror, no problem.

2498
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:54,280
But experiencing it or watching horror movies is harder because it's

2499
01:57:54,760 --> 01:57:56,560
not just in my head.

2500
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:59,120
Yeah. And yet through all of this terror.

2501
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:00,120
I am. I am.

2502
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:01,920
And Edwin's person out of the blanket.

2503
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:04,160
Whoa, a scaracter coming right at you.

2504
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:05,920
Oh, no. He's shaking.

2505
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:08,200
And this is part of this dog shakes around.

2506
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:11,680
And then he's fucking adorable.

2507
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:14,160
Adorable as Robin.

2508
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:18,000
Lindsay Cat's Eye, you survived the haunt test, the fright.

2509
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:21,160
Thank you. Thank you for having me.

2510
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:24,360
Is there anything you I can't scarify?

2511
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:26,280
Is there anything you'd like to?

2512
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:27,520
Just the usual.

2513
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:31,640
My podcast team creeps and my.

2514
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:36,240
Show that I write on infinity train on Cartoon Network.

01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:47,360

So go check it out.

2520
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:55,200
Come see us in Chicago and Orlando, guys.

2521
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:56,760
It's so soon. Yeah, really.

2522
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:57,960
We're almost there.

2523
01:58:57,960 --> 01:58:59,120
I'm so excited.

2524
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:01,280
Two weeks away or half week and a half. Yeah.

2525
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,040
We have some work to do.

2526
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:08,040
And for regular podcasts, there are stuff follows on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

2527
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:11,880
I didn't scarify any of those names because you have to know the genuine.

2528
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:13,920
Yeah, you have to know the real names.

2529
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:19,080
But Instagram October 16th, Wednesday, October 16th.

2530
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:22,200
I was going to cast the fright begins on the Patreon.

2531
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:26,280
And we'll save the scary name for that for your listening experience.
