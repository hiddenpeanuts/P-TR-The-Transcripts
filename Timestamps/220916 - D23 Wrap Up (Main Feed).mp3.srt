1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,840
Warning, the following podcast contains boundless ambiguity,

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,000
a wholehearted endorsement for a beloved

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,840
Southern California business,

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,280
and cheering, cheering, cheering.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,600
We take a look at all the Disney Parks

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,680
announcements, air quotes, in our D23 wrap up

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,880
today on Podcast The Ride.

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,880
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a celebration of stories,

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,520
storytelling, stories about storytelling,

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,480
and the storytellers who tell our story to storytelling stories.

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,960
I'm Story Gardener joined by Mike Carl Story.

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,840
I'm here, yes, and I'm full of stories.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,480
I'm bursting with stories.

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,360
I hate to be so vulgar, but when I go to the bathroom,

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,960
I make stories.

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,880
That's just how many stories are inside of me.

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,240
That's what we bond over, is our shared love of stories

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,040
and of eating stories and peeing out stories.

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,160
And having excess stories, wasteful stories.

22
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,320
Always better to have too many than too few.

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,960
Too many stories. Stories, that is.

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,560
Jason Story didn't see that.

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,600
Oh, and there's nothing, there's nothing quite like stories

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,840
and we're bringing them back.

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,480
We're looking into it very strongly.

28
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,480
We're bringing stories back and what better place to do it

29
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,160
than the boundless future that is this episode.

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,480
Oh, yeah.

31
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,640
A grim start.

32
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,040
Yeah, the chills just hit me.

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,080
If you don't know why all this is happening,

34
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,440
this is at least my, all of our general impression

35
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,280
of the D23 Parks panel,

36
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,080
which is the main thing we're focusing on.

37
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,000
But we're doing sort of a roundup of all of the Parks news,

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,200
the thrilling Parks news that came down the pike this week

39
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,960
that we've been looking forward to hearing at the D23 Expo.

40
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,040
We're so happy that everyone was back.

41
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,560
We weren't, we weren't back,

42
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,360
but we were back with our friends.

43
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,000
We were watching people be back with their friends.

44
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,720
For the first time in three years and what a thrill it was.

45
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,360
And we've got a language professor coming in

46
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,360
to tell us about the boundaries of stretching the phrase news

47
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,120
to fit what occurred the other day.

48
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,120
Which, yeah, maybe, maybe we'll learn that the,

49
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,120
it is, if technically, if new information of any kind

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,640
is presented, it might count as news

51
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,800
or that linguistics professor might teach us

52
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,800
that jack shit was announced this week.

53
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,720
We'll be debating that.

54
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,880
But besides that, also stay tuned because,

55
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,840
hey, it's the D23 spirit.

56
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,080
That means we have to get in the PTR 23 spirit,

57
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,400
our personal convention.

58
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,120
And while we wish we could be back with you in person,

59
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,160
we didn't figure that out.

60
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,720
We didn't rent a ballroom this time.

61
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,640
But what we can do is for the first time in three years

62
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,400
at the end of this episode, induct new PTR legends.

63
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,240
Get ready.

64
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,440
Will it be you?

65
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,840
Keep listening to find out.

66
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,320
I did think about inducting you as a PTR legend,

67
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,160
but then I guess I'm ruining now what you just said.

68
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,000
So I ruined the T's.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,120
So the answer is not you.

70
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,160
You did not, at least, you're not inducted by me.

71
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,000
It's not the general you,

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,640
but someone could be listening to this who is a PTR.

73
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,440
That's how Griffin Newman found out.

74
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,560
He was just in a store or something.

75
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,960
And then he was like, wait a minute,

76
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,040
I got accidentally inducted as a PTR legend.

77
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,120
That's right.

78
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,640
Look, we don't necessarily invite everyone.

79
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,240
There's no luncheon.

80
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,720
We don't really provide you anything

81
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,880
other than being able to sleep at night

82
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,080
knowing you achieved something on this earth.

83
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,920
Yeah.

84
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
Which is a strange thing to say

85
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,600
because some of the previous inductees

86
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,680
have been milkshakes.

87
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,440
So probably a milkshake is not listening to the show

88
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,040
and does not need to care about sleep.

89
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,280
Jason talks about milkshakes so much.

90
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,200
I think there might be a few milkshakes that do tune in.

91
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,680
12% of our listeners are milkshakes.

92
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,640
I was thinking about inducting Papa Steve again,

93
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,920
just because there's some changes going on

94
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,760
that part of the book.

95
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,960
We'll have to see what happens to Papa Steve.

97
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,800
Well, that's one of the things.

98
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,360
Can I, I want to propose an idea.

99
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,720
Because we said we would do PTR legends at the end

100
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,280
to end on a fun note, positive note.

101
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,640
Do we want to start on a positive note too

102
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,960
and touch on fun things?

103
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,800
Negative note.

104
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,640
Okay, good.

105
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,480
I'm negative.

106
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,160
Brother, that's my instinct.

107
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,880
That's my instinct too.

108
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,400
I'm just trying something different.

109
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,760
And if I'm wrong, fair enough,

110
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,600
trying something different.

111
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,800
Whatever you want to do is fine.

112
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,920
Oh yeah, absolutely.

113
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,120
I was just joking there.

114
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,080
No, well, let's, I think let's try it.

115
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,560
Let's start positive, why not?

116
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,640
Yeah, go for it.

117
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,680
Do we have the materials to start positive?

118
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,840
I have a couple of things.

119
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
You go, you go, you have an idea.

120
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,240
Well, I think the one, I mean,

121
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,400
we were all tweeting as this was happening.

122
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,160
And I think, Scott, I think it was you tweeted,

123
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,160
like the Pacific Wharf redo into San Fransokyo

124
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,920
from Big Hero 6.

125
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,000
No complaints.

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,920
Yeah. It's fun.

127
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,880
I think that's neat.

128
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,680
I was saying to you guys,

129
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,680
I like a redo that doesn't desperately need to happen.

130
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,040
One that's just like a fun,

131
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,040
let's plus it up because we can.

132
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,320
I do like that.

133
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,640
And by the way, just in general,

134
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,640
I did this, you can watch this panel on YouTube still,

135
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,560
I would imagine.

136
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,920
We're mainly referring to the parks panel

137
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,480
that occurred on Sunday,

138
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,760
which was earlier in the week as you hear this,

139
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,320
in the morning hours of September 11th.

140
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,640
Don't forget, never forget the news that occurred that day.

141
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,040
So yes, that's a pretty good one.

142
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,720
That's California Adventure.

143
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,680
Yeah.

144
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
Turning the Pacific Wharf area

145
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,040
into a Big Hero 6 themed area.

146
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,960
And the Pacific Wharf area, by the way,

147
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,520
we've touched on some of this stuff.

148
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,520
It's where Ghirardelli is, the former tortilla factory,

149
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,280
the current bread factory, the bakery,

150
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,920
where you meet Papa Steve,

151
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,960
who we've been obsessed with for a little while.

152
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,800
Is it correct?

153
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,920
It's kind of a Papa Steve episode,

154
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,880
but not a bakery episode, right?

155
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,840
Correct.

156
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,560
Still haven't, we parsed those out.

157
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,120
Clock is ticking though on this place.

158
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,240
So we gotta get to these places

159
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,200
before they transform into Big Hero 6 stuff.

160
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,320
Yeah, yeah, geez, God.

161
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,880
They may no longer be playing those

162
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,920
Whoopi Goldberg, Colin Mochrie videos to no one

163
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,920
as they sprint as fast as they can through the,

164
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,120
like, how fast can we get through this

165
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,360
having already received our free morsel of bread?

166
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,200
Yes.

167
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,480
The Karl Strauss cart, will it be there?

168
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,560
Will it remain?

169
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,480
That was my biggest concern

170
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,160
because that is one of my favorite alcohol locations

171
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,280
in the park.

172
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,440
I don't see why.

173
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,840
My beloved big fishnet photo opportunity,

174
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,960
which the last few years I've just been delighted by.

175
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,360
That has been there for 21 years now.

176
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,960
Yeah, that was an opening day fixture.

177
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,680
Yeah, if you stand far away from it,

178
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,800
it looks like you are in a net, not just meant for fish,

179
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
but just, but swarming with fish.

180
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,640
Yeah.

181
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,120
Hundreds and hundreds of fish in it.

182
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,520
And you are the catch of the day.

183
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,400
I, yeah, I don't know.

184
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,480
Do those things have to go, is there enough,

185
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,280
if it's San Francisco, maybe it already

186
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,520
is San Francisco feeling.

187
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,520
So do they, is it now just a matter

188
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,160
of injecting the Okio part?

189
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah.

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,360
Maybe they just have to up the Tokyo portion,

191
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,840
which is, which I, you know, from the concept art

192
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,440
they showed, it's glowy and futuristic.

193
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,000
And, you know, just like strap some new lights on stuff.

194
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,440
And I'm always happy.

195
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,280
It seems like they're going to do that.

196
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,520
And it's, it is interesting that it's like, all right,

197
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,920
it's a CG animated movie in between two Pixar things.

198
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,520
It's a Disney animation movie.

199
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,920
It's also a Marvel property.

200
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,880
Oh, right.

201
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
Oh yeah, I forgot that.

202
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,720
But it's not connected to the Avengers campus.

203
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,560
Yes.

204
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,400
Maybe, but it's near.

205
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,240
Kind of near.

206
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,080
Right, it's near.

207
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,920
It's near.

208
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,760
Oh, that is confusing.

209
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,600
I forgot the Marvel connection with that.

210
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,760
Baymax has not yet been folded into the MCU.

211
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,120
Somebody on Twitter pointed out,

212
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,880
and forgive me for not knowing who pointed it out on Twitter,

213
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,880
that they got rid of the Golden Gate Bridge

214
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,480
at this front of California Adventure,

215
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,160
but now they will be adding the futuristic

216
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,320
Golden Gate Bridge to this area.

217
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,160
Is that right?

218
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,240
So the bridge, because that's one of the entrances

219
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,080
is a bridge.

220
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,960
So that's becoming, wow.

221
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,520
So the bridge was considered too tacky before,

222
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,360
the one that they have.

223
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,120
And now we're getting a new one.

224
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,760
And I wonder if it'll be more nuanced,

225
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,080
because I didn't like that Monorail Golden Gate Bridge.

226
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,920
It felt silly.

227
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,800
It looked like a Lego set.

228
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,040
So maybe it will be a little more textured ornate,

229
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,760
plus the future side of it.

230
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,160
I'm excited to see this bridge.

231
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,400
Yeah, so the bridge, this is all, yeah, this is all good.

232
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,680
This feels, the whole thing feels like,

233
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,440
and this is the best description I can think of,

234
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,840
is when I, I would try to pretend I was playing soccer

235
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,120
and I would head toward the ball.

236
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,920
This is the closest, one of the closest things

237
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,080
they got to actually like something that feels like

238
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,560
impactful, this announcement is what I'm saying.

239
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,400
Yes, yeah.

240
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,680
Like they were trying to present many things

241
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,200
as if there were big things coming,

242
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,600
but they were avoiding the ball,

243
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,320
like I did as a kindergartener in soccer.

244
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,920
Now, if I, I don't wanna put negativity

245
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,600
on our attempt at positivity, but isn't it positive?

246
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,960
I actually, I think that maybe most of the good news

247
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,080
at this panel, we are lighting up at,

248
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,800
because we are SoCal residents.

249
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,640
Yes.

250
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,920
And we go down there a lot and a lot of our concern

251
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,240
is eating and drinking down there.

252
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,680
So a lot of it feels like good news for us,

253
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,880
but if you're say in Florida or the half of the country

254
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,880
where Florida is your destination,

255
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,000
maybe you're less psyched because,

256
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,440
the hell did Florida even?

257
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,600
I don't wanna jump around,

258
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,440
feel free to keep saying positive stuff.

259
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,720
I'm just saying like, I'm like, yeah,

260
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,920
wharf and downtown Disney restaurants that we'll get to.

261
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,720
But I bet somebody in South Carolina could give a shit

262
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,360
about what's happening to the wharf.

263
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,000
Well, cause yeah, I was looking,

264
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,120
mice chat very helpfully divided up all of this

265
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,240
into different articles, one for Disneyland,

266
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,040
one for Disney World and one for the international parks.

267
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,680
So I could review it because by the end,

268
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,840
I was a little like spacey

269
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,320
and they were doing this blue sky thing

270
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,160
where they were like teasing things they might never do

271
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,440
and that was bizarre.

272
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,600
But there is a graphic that shows each year

273
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,960
stuff that's opening around the world.

274
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,160
And it's like the center of Epcot,

275
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,800
the world celebration with the commuter core building

276
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,280
and then the Moana journey of water,

277
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,280
that's not opening until later in 2023.

278
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,600
And the Tiana Redos for both Splash Mountains in America,

279
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,320
that's not until 2024.

280
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,400
Late 2024 was on the graphic.

281
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,200
And in 2025, again, this has been said a lot of times

282
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,120
by a lot of people,

283
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,880
Universal is opening the first new gate,

284
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,280
theme park gate in Orlando

285
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,160
since the last time they opened a new gate in Orlando in 99.

286
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,440
After a streak of pretty good rides and expansions,

287
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,000
they now are opening a new park,

288
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,440
which seems massive in scope.

289
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,440
It includes Mario Brothers, it includes monsters,

290
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,080
the classic monsters.

291
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,240
There were monster leaks.

292
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,360
We haven't even talked about this.

293
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,320
I said, did we talk about it maybe?

294
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,400
There were in our private life, did we talk about it?

295
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,520
Did we privately talk about monster leaks?

296
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,360
There were monster leaks about-

297
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,760
Well, Park Stop had a lot of-

298
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,680
Yeah, oh, the monster stuff is so good.

299
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,520
It is, yeah.

300
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,360
What are the leaks?

301
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,200
Pretty good.

302
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,520
So there's a concept that at first,

303
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,640
I was a little bit like, I don't know,

304
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,360
but the concept is sort of in its modern day.

305
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,160
And there's like, they've turned like,

306
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,120
say like an old time monster village into a tourist trap.

307
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Yeah, it's like the heir to the Frankenstein family.

308
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,120
And they've turned it all into a tourist trap,

309
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,640
but the basement of the castle is filled with the monsters.

310
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,480
And they-

311
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,320
They're still there.

312
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,160
They're still there.

313
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,240
Oh, interesting.

314
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,440
And there's like a new Elvira type character,

315
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,440
like a sexy lady monster.

316
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,280
She's not a monster.

317
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,120
I think she's like a-

318
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
She's a scientist?

319
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,960
Something.

320
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,800
Yeah.

321
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
But she's sort of like presenting all of this stuff.

322
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,440
And then the big ride is that thing

323
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,280
we've talked about forever,

324
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,680
which is like a Kuka arm type thing,

325
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,760
which is a crazy ticket through every universal monster

326
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,400
who's like living in the basement of like,

327
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,240
Frankenstein's castle, I think?

328
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,440
Frankenstein's castle, yeah.

329
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,240
And they don't separate them, like all the monsters.

330
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,400
There's one ride that's the monsters ride.

331
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,240
All the monsters are on a ride.

332
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,160
I think they're all, I think it's a roller coaster track

333
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,400
with a Kuka arm.

334
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,520
Yes, it's like a crazy new version of the Kuka arm.

335
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,080
Like it's, this is the greatest,

336
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,320
this sounds like the greatest thing ever.

337
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Yeah, and it seems like they've scrapped the show,

338
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,800
but it might've been replaced with a spinning roller coaster.

339
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,880
There might be a new ride also.

340
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,960
There's gonna be two rides in there

341
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,920
in addition to like just an old time Frankenstein-y village.

342
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,440
And this is also the closest thing we get to like non-IP,

343
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,280
even though it is IP,

344
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,600
where it feels like it's old stuff at the very least.

345
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,800
It won't be based on like,

346
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,920
it feels more in the Spider-Man spirit,

347
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,520
the way that the Duns and Adventures Spider-Man ride

348
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,640
is like the spirit of Spider-Man

349
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,400
more than any specific Spider-Man.

350
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,600
So it'll make it feel like original,

351
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,560
so like whatever this monster take is will feel kind of new.

352
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,880
Version of the classic monsters basically,

353
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,120
I'm assuming, because it's not the monster version.

354
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,480
They're not so precious with the monsters

355
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,120
because they're just so ubiquitous.

356
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,600
I think they feel like they can have multiple versions

357
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,560
going at one time.

358
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,600
Yeah, needless to say,

359
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,120
that's the most excited I am about anything

360
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,960
theme park-wise in the next few years.

361
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,880
And then in 2023 in Hollywood, we get Nintendo,

362
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,880
the beloved multi-generation, beloved video game company

363
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,200
shows up here.

364
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,600
Oh, you mean, yes, which you're a new addition to the park

365
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,160
that we are as excited about as current six-year-olds

366
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,400
will be excited about.

367
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,520
Like he has perfectly caked in interest

368
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,360
for many different types of audience.

369
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,400
Yeah, sure.

370
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,360
Well, there's all that.

371
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,360
But did you know that the projection show

372
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,440
Wishful Magic Kings, which was already announced

373
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,680
that we got new art that shows you what the colors

374
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,400
of the spires are going to be.

375
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,560
And it will only be delayed by eight more months.

376
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,160
Yes, I did know that.

377
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,400
I saw the presentation and I know that very well.

378
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,280
And I got very excited about it.

379
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,400
Yeah, people were shrieking about it in the hall.

380
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,640
That's the one, boy, it must be nice to be in these,

381
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,320
Pam, must be nice because we're at home snarking

382
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,040
and then we're watching a feed of it.

383
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,920
And they say like, hey everyone, you're getting a donut.

384
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,520
And everybody like, ah!

385
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,680
It is the great, it is pandemonium for all these

386
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,800
kind of nothing announced.

387
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,480
I mean, I'd be excited to be getting the,

388
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,320
that's a bad example.

389
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,160
We'd all like to get that.

390
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,360
Gordos cheese roll, oh.

391
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,280
Is that what it was?

392
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,320
That's the one that I.

393
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
It showed the picture.

394
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,640
Wait, did you say you don't like the cheese roll?

395
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,480
No, I did.

396
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,320
I love it.

397
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,680
That's a fantastic, yes.

398
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,280
My question on that is that cheese roll

399
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,000
they were giving out, I went to the Porto's website.

400
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,440
Those cheese rolls retail for $1.05.

401
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,080
What will the Disney market be for these?

402
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,360
Oh my God.

403
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,600
Massively baked, like baked in the biggest batches

404
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,680
you have ever seen.

405
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,040
Porto's is literally right around the corner over here

406
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,080
and it is pretty cheap compared to,

407
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,120
for like a good meal.

408
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,160
It's great. In general,

409
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,200
a pretty cheap everything.

410
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,320
It was a godsend during the pandemic

411
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,280
because they were doing like curbside pickup.

412
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,120
Yes, I did.

413
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,880
Just a little taste of like a fun,

414
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,240
like a Cuban sandwich.

415
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,920
Banana chips.

416
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,160
Yeah, those are good.

417
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah. Those are good.

418
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,840
But yeah, no, it's like,

419
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,000
there's no way at downtown Disney,

420
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,640
like everyone will go there if it's the same exact,

421
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,680
like prices it is up here.

422
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,640
It's gonna have to be more competitive

423
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,240
with whatever, Black Tap or whatever.

424
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,080
Yeah, it's also a few miles away in Buena Park.

425
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,920
Yes.

426
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,720
Where it will be cheaper, presumably.

427
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
So if you're a local,

428
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,160
you're probably not dealing with the hassle of

429
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,040
that it's $10 parking and then that's,

430
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,760
those cheese rolls are $10 each.

431
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,760
And then, so when you add all that up.

432
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,560
Yeah, that in general here, if we're getting into that,

433
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,640
some of the, amazingly,

434
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,000
some of the bigger announcements were new restaurants

435
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
at downtown Disney, as if geared to us specifically,

436
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,200
who spent time going through every restaurant

437
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,040
at downtown Disney.

438
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,280
I felt crazy when they announced it because I go,

439
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,800
why is this being presented in front of

440
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,880
To this crowd?

441
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,160
An international audience of people?

442
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,000
Cause like,

443
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,400
Porto's present, like the logo reveal

444
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,320
as if it's Dr. Strange or something.

445
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,920
Like, like seeing, I did like seeing the name

446
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,560
of good local restaurant chain, Porto's.

447
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,480
Family owned business for decades.

448
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,320
Oh, that's good.

449
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,160
Oh, great, great.

450
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,200
It's as if like, but it felt as if like,

451
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,320
Josh Tomorrow was like,

452
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,520
and now we're going to bring out Joey Kramer

453
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,320
to talk about what's happening to the Rock and Roll.

454
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,040
Like it felt so specific to me and us.

455
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,880
Yeah.

456
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,840
That I was like, what is going on here?

457
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,280
Like, this is bizarre.

458
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,600
And I'm happy it happened,

459
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,440
but I guess they were so low on announcements.

460
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,040
They're like, I guess throw Porto's on there.

461
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,400
You have to really puff up.

462
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
That's big now.

463
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,160
Din Tai Fung is big.

464
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,840
That's a more well known, I feel like, even in Porto's.

465
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,360
That is an international, it's in Taiwan

466
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,440
and it's in Las Vegas and California.

467
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,160
But how do you describe the, it's like,

468
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,160
it's like a like smaller bites kind of restaurant.

469
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah. Oh, sure, sure.

470
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,080
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

471
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
And there's a rendering of what that building's

472
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,920
going to look like.

473
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,640
And it does look beautiful.

474
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,600
It's great. Yeah.

475
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,000
It's fine with the great.

476
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,680
Yeah. We got some better aesthetics

477
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,240
coming to downtown Disney.

478
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,840
It's almost a little surreal.

479
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,040
Cause it's like, they're getting real,

480
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,200
like this is both these places are amazing food.

481
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,520
Like this is great food.

482
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,080
This isn't just great for theme park food.

483
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,720
This is like real deal food.

484
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,560
Yeah.

485
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,320
And I kind of couldn't understand.

486
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,480
It's like, wait, it's going to downtown Disney?

487
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,440
Okay.

488
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,000
Doesn't make sense.

489
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You're saying doesn't add up.

490
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,840
Yeah.

491
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Not Tapp and Palace Point are like both good, but like,

492
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,960
I mean, Brewpub is its own sort of thing.

493
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,360
I mean, it's been slowly,

494
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,120
quality has been slowly ticking out for years.

495
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,400
You know what a lot of them aren't though, is like,

496
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,440
the place is famous for the good food.

497
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,280
Like Palace Point is like, I wonder if the food's good.

498
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,000
You go when it is okay, great.

499
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,560
But like these are, you know, famously solid restaurants.

500
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,960
Yes.

501
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,880
Well, it's just how people feel about Salt and Straw,

502
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,320
even though you despise it Jason Fudge.

503
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,040
I just think it's a little overblown.

504
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,320
And I got really, I, any, anyone I found I like of the like

505
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,040
newer fancy ice cream parlor,

506
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,680
like there used to be a sweet cream,

507
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,640
there's sweet rose creamery by me that closed down.

508
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,720
And then the, what is it?

509
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,120
What was the one at Disney?

510
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,960
They used to be Los Feliz.

511
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,120
Oh, that was in-

512
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,520
It's still in Brooklyn, but it closed a lot of them.

513
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,360
It was in the house.

514
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,760
It was in the like Heidi Fleiss's

515
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,360
Dr. Fathers old practice.

516
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,200
Yes, it's in the old place.

517
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
What, really?

518
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,040
Yeah.

519
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,600
Yes, that beautiful craftsman house.

520
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,440
I think that's an interesting fact that could be wrong

521
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,760
if Eva's listening right now.

522
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,000
Did you tell me that?

523
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I hope that's correct.

524
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,680
And Eiger had invested in it.

525
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,200
Oh my God, what is it?

526
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,280
It's two words, some Ample Hills.

527
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,120
Ample Hills.

528
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,080
I believe this is, wait, you forgot,

529
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,680
didn't you do a Doughboys about it?

530
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,320
I did do a Doughboys about it.

531
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,840
You forgot the name of an ice cream place.

532
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,680
It's been gone.

533
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,240
COVID haze is real.

534
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,560
Look at poor Jason.

535
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,080
I, yeah.

536
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,040
Brain fog is mostly pushed out

537
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,160
to the name of different ice cream houses.

538
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,240
I am shocked by that.

539
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,680
That is also like post COVID world,

540
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,760
like it closed like a.

541
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,600
It was a nice spot.

542
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,440
Another world to go.

543
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,280
It was a great spot.

544
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,120
You could sort of chill out on the lawn after you got it.

545
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,760
It was always busy, yeah.

546
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,120
And then it closed like,

547
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,400
it announced it was closing two days later.

548
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,720
Geo texted us and was like,

549
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,760
it's closing, there's giving away ice cream.

550
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,400
And we were just like, get over there.

551
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,280
It was like right at the,

552
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,320
it was like right before COVID maybe or right there.

553
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,440
Did you go to some sort of ice cream looting type?

554
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,280
I didn't go.

555
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,120
Okay, okay.

556
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,320
We were made aware of it.

557
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,840
So, so yeah, it's like all these,

558
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,440
again, all this is good, but this is, okay.

559
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,720
D23 they do every other year.

560
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,640
And now it's been three years since they've done it.

561
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,840
What are some of the, that's sorry to interrupt.

562
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,160
What, what, what has been announced at these previously?

563
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,080
I've been, okay, let me say this.

564
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,760
I am, look, do I make snarky snark comments all the time?

565
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,600
Sure I do.

566
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,000
But do I want to go into these big halls

567
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,280
and cheer and celebrate?

568
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,080
Which I've done a few times for different things.

569
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,520
Yes, I've been there.

570
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,360
It's fun.

571
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,800
I was not at last year's D23

572
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,560
because we were not invited, of course.

573
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,520
I made that very public when we were at our own convention.

574
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,640
But I was there two years prior

575
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,600
and I was there when they announced Star Wars land.

576
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,440
So I was there.

577
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,160
Oh, so that got an, oh, the whole land about Star Wars

578
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,560
was once the bar and now it's a nice,

579
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,280
tasty dumplings restaurant.

580
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,160
Here's our like little photo collage from 2019.

581
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,840
What was announced.

582
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,680
That big E ticket Avengers ride, which has now shifted

583
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,560
that the Epcot, some of the Epcot redo

584
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,960
also now scaled back.

585
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,120
Spaceship Earth out.

586
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,960
Yeah, Spaceship Earth.

587
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,800
There's a little more of like Avengers,

588
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,880
they had sort of, I forget if they had alluded

589
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,680
to Avengers campus four years ago.

590
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,880
And then they were, showed it off two years ago more.

591
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,440
And then here's the private island lighthouse point,

592
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,480
which if you recall during this battle,

593
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,920
Josh tomorrow was standing on this deserted island

594
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,960
filled with palm trees and scrub grass

595
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,680
and nothing had been built there.

596
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,920
Oh my God.

597
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,520
I don't recall because I walked out of the room

598
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,160
at the cruise part.

599
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,160
I check out that's that's seven thing.

600
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,720
That's seventh inning stretch for me.

601
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,240
I go pee, I go stretch.

602
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,760
They do a lot of cruise during these panels.

603
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,600
Yeah.

604
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,640
And I guess obviously they're very popular.

605
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,960
I just, I've never been on one.

606
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,400
I'm not against going on one.

607
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,240
No.

608
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,080
I don't care.

609
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,200
I don't care that the new ship is named.

610
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,040
What is it?

611
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,860
Treasure.

612
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,700
Treasure.

613
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,080
Treasure, Peter Pan and Tinkerbell.

614
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,360
Do you want to hear the name of the new ship?

615
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,960
And then like everybody goes, yeah.

616
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,640
Ah, I want to hear a word.

617
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,440
Oh my God.

618
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,440
They showed the word portos up on a big screen.

619
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,520
And then they showed the word treasure up on a big screen.

620
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,960
This panel was epic.

621
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,800
Yeah.

622
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,480
But I mean, three years ago,

623
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,440
there was more along the lines of like actual announces.

624
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,880
This year it's more, we're hedging our bets.

625
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,320
Well, in a lot of we have announced this

626
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,880
and here is a little more about it.

627
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,720
Yeah.

628
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,480
Those, that stuff was a little more hopeful

629
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,320
and a little more fruitful.

630
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,640
For example, they put a lot of eggs into the basket

631
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,480
of new splash mountain Tiana's Bayou Adventure, correct?

632
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,320
Yes.

633
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,520
Yes.

634
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,080
Which looks great.

635
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,400
Every little bit that they show looks awesome,

636
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,240
but it, boy, you feel that like they had to pass the ball

637
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,920
to that, that attraction had to do a lot of heavy lifting

638
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,840
in the lack of brand new things.

639
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,160
And I hate to be negative, but in that,

640
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,040
that I'm a little already worried about,

641
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,400
everything I'm worried about budget.

642
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,080
I'm worried about the budget and everything.

643
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,920
Yes.

644
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,760
Yeah.

645
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,240
Cause it's like, I'm sorry, splash mountain, a long ride,

646
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,400
a lot of space to fill.

647
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,760
A lot of space.

648
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,080
And I'm a little worried.

649
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,600
Even the idea that there's a bunch of mist.

650
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,720
Well, this is the thing.

651
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,640
Could be good, but what if the mist ain't working?

652
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,800
What's in the room?

653
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,320
They say mist.

654
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,760
And the first thing I think of, so to explain,

655
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,480
they kind of talk about how there's gonna be like

656
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,280
some sort of mist in the ride,

657
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,720
and there's gonna maybe project things on the mist,

658
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,480
which to me means we're not gonna do as many robots.

659
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,600
We're gonna do a lot of mist.

660
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,920
Now, maybe that's gonna look really cool

661
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,680
and I'm gonna look like a fool.

662
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,920
Hopefully that's the case.

663
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,040
I bet it's good mist.

664
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
I don't doubt it's good mist.

665
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,320
But the first thing I think of is Nintendo 64 and fog.

666
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,760
And if you know what I'm talking about is that

667
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,800
Nintendo 64 famously in games,

668
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,280
when they weren't able to render like levels

669
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,920
fully in the distance, we just throw up a lot of fog.

670
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,200
So Superman 64 is one of the most notoriously bad

671
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,560
Nintendo 64 games and it's filled with Superman

672
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,040
flying around in like foggy metropolis.

673
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,680
And you see it in a lot of different Nintendo 64 games

674
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,880
because that was the easiest fix to just not have to render

675
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,520
that far into the distance.

676
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,440
So the first thing when they said mist, I go, uh-oh.

677
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,120
We don't want to, we can't render.

678
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,040
And I'm like, okay, all right.

679
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,720
I mean, they showed like some sort of a woodland creature

680
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,000
playing a banjo and I think there's still gonna be

681
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,200
maybe the celebration at the end.

682
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,200
So hopefully, but the outside and the initial promo art

683
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,600
looked a little bit more like they had changed

684
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,840
the whole mountain versus what the model looks like.

685
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,400
The model looks like basically they took out the spikes

686
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,080
and they threw out the hill.

687
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,960
Yeah, the briars, yes, which are good.

688
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,800
Don't throw me in the spike patch.

689
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,200
Yeah, but then they just threw up the cool.

690
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,160
I like the water tower.

691
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,520
There's like the water tower that's fun.

692
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,800
It says Tiana's.

693
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,640
And the general, like the night vibe,

694
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,000
which Splash Mountain doesn't particularly have now.

695
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,920
They've made it, it looks like Pandora now.

696
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,120
We're getting a little mini Pandora here.

697
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,200
Seems like they're doing a lot of research.

698
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
They got a lot of the voice actors back.

699
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,080
Music's great.

700
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,160
Anika Noni-Rose, great performer.

701
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,360
Felt a little bit, she did a great performance,

702
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,520
but I felt a little bad because it's like,

703
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,800
well, I think true quality will be reached

704
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,000
when she just gets to walk out in a blazer

705
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,560
and a baseball cap and wave.

706
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,200
Like she doesn't have to do a show.

707
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,120
She doesn't have to do a shift of her job, you know?

708
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,000
You were just thinking about how hard she was working.

709
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,400
She had to do like a whole thing.

710
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,240
And like she didn't get to,

711
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,360
like other people are just coming out, hi, bye.

712
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,920
But she did like a great show.

713
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,720
Ruffalo phones it in is what you're saying.

714
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,560
Ruffalo literally skifed it in.

715
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,280
He doesn't have to come in dressed in green

716
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,640
and do a whole thing.

717
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,160
Hey, Kevin Feige had to act and emote

718
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,040
next to a bizarre giant Hulk suit.

719
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,880
Well, yeah, we got to.

720
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,680
That was heavy lifting acting wise.

721
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,080
Real quick, I like all like the Tiana's restaurant.

722
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,440
That's come, that seems real fun.

723
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,280
Oh yeah, that'd be great.

724
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,640
And it seems like I'm interested,

725
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,680
let's talk about this real quick too.

726
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,120
I'm interested, are we going to,

727
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,120
is Critter Country going to go away?

728
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,640
That's an interesting thought because-

729
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,080
Well, you can't get rid of poo.

730
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,880
Splash Mountain is not going to be in Critter Country

731
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,160
anymore because it's going to be New Orleans Square.

732
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,480
Is it annexed?

733
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,560
It has to be because we're in New Orleans

734
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,040
and that's where Tiana's, the restaurant is going to be.

735
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,440
And that's where this ride takes place.

736
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,800
So it's going to all be New Orleans Square.

737
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,120
But is Tiana's taking over the French market

738
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,960
or the Hungry Bear?

739
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,800
Unclear.

740
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,480
I don't think it's, no, I think it's, yeah, yeah.

741
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,880
I think it's in New Orleans Square.

742
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,720
But it's in New Orleans Square, so.

743
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,880
So, and I don't think they're going to,

744
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,520
they're not just going to get rid of Hungry Bear

745
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,920
for no reason or poo.

746
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,400
So I think Critter Country is just cut in half.

747
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,960
It has one, exactly one ride and it's a little kid ride.

748
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,920
It's like Paradise Gardens Park, still lingering.

749
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,920
Awkward little redistra, gerrymandered.

750
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,040
Slither.

751
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,880
Where they are going to add back in, right?

752
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,360
They're adding in that exclusive entrance

753
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,240
for the Pixar Place Hotel.

754
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,800
Oh yeah, there was an entrance there.

755
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,680
That used to be there in the early days

756
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,520
is coming back, I think.

757
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,360
Yeah. That's good.

758
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,200
So I think Critter Country then will be saved for now

759
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,800
just because they're not ambitious at all

760
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
in doing anything.

761
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,720
Like, I'm sure they have it in the back of their mind

762
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,240
that we should just make this fully New Orleans Square

763
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,440
and put a different ride or put a different theme back there.

764
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,160
I bet they don't though, because we need to put,

765
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,720
that's like where they make their poo books.

766
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,560
That is where they make their poo books.

767
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,760
And then meet and greets, like that whole center zone,

768
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,800
the trail that you, I'm a little swayed

769
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,600
by having done this with a kid once,

770
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,120
like the little trail where you meet Tigger and poo

771
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,960
and Eeyore and everything.

772
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,040
I don't think they're getting rid of that

773
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,240
unless they got something really solid.

774
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
Well, is there any land,

775
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,280
is that going to be the smallest land in any park?

776
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,120
Could be.

777
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,040
Maybe.

778
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,480
It just feels like they might have an idea for it,

779
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,680
but that we'll get it to a 25.

780
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,640
It's an awkward, it's like,

781
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,600
what's that area, what's the little mini fantasy land

782
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,320
in front of the castle where Figaro is?

783
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,360
Oh, the fantasy fair?

784
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,200
Yeah, it's like that.

785
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,520
It's like a little,

786
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,520
or even a little more substantial because there's one ride.

787
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,360
Yeah.

788
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,120
Maybe I'm a critter, maybe I'm a critter country defender.

789
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,240
It's so like gentle and brown back there.

790
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,680
I don't want anything to happen to it.

791
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,600
I'm not saying I want it.

792
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,840
I'm just saying that it makes,

793
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,720
it would make sense then to just sort of make that

794
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,560
all New Orleans Square somehow.

795
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,400
I suppose so.

796
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,240
Just from a space.

797
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,280
Well then what are they doing with poo?

798
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,120
I don't know.

799
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,040
You need poo in the park.

800
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,880
People want some.

801
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,320
I'm not saying get rid of poo.

802
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,880
Any criticism I have is leveled by just the sheer,

803
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,080
like look, Ewer's out.

804
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,200
Get a picture of me.

805
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,280
Yes, yeah, yeah.

806
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,120
That does a lot of heavy lifting for sure.

807
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,240
So I mean, look.

808
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,120
We gotta get,

809
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,800
they have to look into all of their great

810
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,040
New Orleans properties.

811
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,280
Have they ended up owning like the big easy?

812
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,360
What does Disney own that's set in New Orleans?

813
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,520
Yeah, Justin.

814
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,000
Can we get Raylan Givens?

815
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,160
Well, there's a walk around Raylan Givens

816
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,480
from justified face character.

817
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,760
He has to end up in New Orleans tracking somewhat

818
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,920
at some point, right?

819
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,720
No, Raylan, you stumped me with that reference.

820
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,280
Oh, that's Raylan Givens.

821
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,200
Oliphant's character.

822
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,480
Oh, that's the name of the main character of justified.

823
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,320
Okay, I have not watched justified.

824
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,720
Elmore Leonard creation.

825
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,720
Oliphant will probably,

826
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,160
the way they're adding new characters to Galaxy's Edge,

827
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,000
Timmy the Oliphant's character will be there

828
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,800
in about 2042, I bet.

829
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,640
The Mandalorian, yeah.

830
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,920
For Mandalorian, right.

831
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,120
The pace they're going.

832
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,000
Do we transition with that into

833
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,880
some of what they top loaded it with?

834
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,880
The big announcements at the top.

835
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,080
They bring out Favre.

836
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,240
They bring out the creator of Star Wars,

837
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,440
Jon Favreau,

838
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,600
to showcase the new,

839
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,720
and look who's here.

840
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,280
Oh my God, it's the Mandalorian and Grogu.

841
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,160
And he's got Grogu.

842
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,200
And I'm like, wow.

843
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,480
So that means Baby Yoda and the Mandalorian are coming to,

844
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,640
oh, this got announced already.

845
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,720
I forgot this got announced.

846
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,360
That what they are doing is showing us

847
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,040
that they didn't stop making it.

848
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,040
Right. Right.

849
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,880
And they're, and they said,

850
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,320
and now you'll be able to see him.

851
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,720
And I'm like, oh, they're going to say like,

852
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,720
he's there today.

853
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,280
And they're going in November.

854
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,040
And I'm like, he's there, look at him.

855
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,880
He's good.

856
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,720
He's ready to go.

857
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,560
Send him in.

858
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,560
Holiday rush.

859
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,400
Have him walk up hard.

860
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,120
Walk across the street in the costume.

861
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,960
Let's do it.

862
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,800
Why do we, what?

863
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,200
November.

864
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,040
And then they're like,

865
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,400
well, we've been working on this since before the pandemic.

866
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,560
We had to get it just right.

867
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,880
And I'm like, what do you mean just right?

868
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,280
I've had the suit from the show be in another place.

869
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,120
Yeah.

870
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,680
His Grogu head, I guess, probably is a robot of some kind.

871
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,120
So I guess you got to get some of that.

872
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,960
Right.

873
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,040
He kind of looks upset to be in that bag.

874
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,880
Yeah.

875
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,600
It looks a little, little cranky.

876
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,440
When he's covered,

877
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,880
I guess that's helpful if you're trying to smuggle him

878
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,760
somewhere, but like,

879
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,360
I think he's among friends at hall D23.

880
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,880
Why put a drape over him?

881
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,360
I thought this was also going to be like the start of,

882
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,560
I was like, okay, I'll go like, they got Favro out here.

883
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,520
I go, okay, they're bringing the Mandalorian.

884
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,960
I go, this is going to be a big announcement sort of about

885
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,920
what they've announced about adding other characters.

886
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,520
We're going to see like,

887
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,040
and also that's not it.

888
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,000
And then they bring out like all the Mandalorian characters

889
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,600
or you see Babu Frick or whatever,

890
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,080
and there's going to be a big cavalcade.

891
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,320
No, it was just him.

892
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,600
And then Favro left.

893
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,440
That was it.

894
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,280
Bye.

895
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,120
I was like, why do they have him for just for that?

896
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,440
Like, obviously I want like,

897
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,440
I wanted like the whole hyperspace Hoopla clan to come out

898
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,080
and drop it like it's hot to play in.

899
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,920
Yeah.

900
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,640
Do you think, well,

901
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,320
that audience probably freaks out for that.

902
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:00,320
I think, I think people at home are blinking audibly, but.

903
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,240
Maybe.

904
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,160
If they say hyperspace Hoopla,

905
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,960
yes, maybe the people at home are a little confused,

906
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,320
but on the stage,

907
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,960
if all the Star Wars characters came out and they danced,

908
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,120
yeah, people go nuts.

909
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,080
When was the last time something that fun happened?

910
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,800
Since the last hyperspace Hoopla.

911
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,640
Mm-hmm.

912
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,480
That was it.

913
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,480
It died with Snig and Goopla.

914
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,320
What were their names?

915
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,520
Yeah, something like that.

916
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,840
Yeah, that's it.

917
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,120
Snig and Goopla.

918
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,320
So yeah, Favro was out.

919
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,520
He had been there already for the day before

920
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,200
to talk about the new Star Wars stuff.

921
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,120
So I guess he was still down.

922
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,320
He always, he's one of the guys who you always see,

923
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,960
he goes into the park after this.

924
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,160
So he's always like spotted.

925
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,960
You always see him hanging out

926
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,120
because I think he's a big parks guy.

927
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,960
Sure.

928
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
So, I mean, yeah, if you go,

929
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,720
he probably gets that extra two days free Disney

930
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,240
with a guide trip when he's down there.

931
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,920
We're starting through if, like,

932
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,360
do they comp the meals or does he still have to pay for those?

933
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,200
I think.

934
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,440
What's a John Favro trip to Disneyland like?

935
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,520
Well, I think I'm just saying, like, they were like,

936
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,600
well, you can stick around the next day

937
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,080
to show off the Mandalorian

938
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,960
and he probably gets a second day on the trip.

939
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,400
Not that he couldn't get it regular

940
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,560
because he's pretty high up at the company at this point.

941
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,920
And do you think Per Diems,

942
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,040
does he park somewhere special?

943
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,320
I know, look, there's the, you get the guide for free,

944
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,640
but you have to pay.

945
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,480
Generally, I think if you're on like the Disney plan,

946
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,920
you're like, you know, you do something there.

947
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,840
Shonda Rhimes, I mean, they shafted her.

948
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,680
That's true.

949
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,760
So bad on the park tickets,

950
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,960
she jumped to Netflix.

951
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,160
Right, that's true.

952
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,520
That was because of parks tickets.

953
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,880
Well, it was like the final like indignity, I think.

954
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,360
I think it was like her relatives were going

955
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,000
and she was like, oh, I have these extra passes,

956
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,840
go use them.

957
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,160
And they were like, they're not good today.

958
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,760
And it's like, God, no, don't give the TV.

959
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,240
This person created like three hits for you.

960
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,560
You have the money that's been put.

961
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,840
And you gave them blackout tickets?

962
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,000
Tony Baxter was aghast when I asked him

963
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,600
if he just had to like make a quick call

964
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,240
to get like tickets to Tokyo Disney.

965
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,520
He was like horrified that I thought

966
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,760
it would be that easy for him.

967
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,080
Wow, not if he doesn't, wow.

968
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,840
Yeah, he was making it seem like there's no,

969
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,080
he has to pay for everything.

970
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,920
It's bizarre.

971
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,320
This is like the most powerful,

972
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,600
one of the most powerful media companies in the world.

973
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,760
There's so much about it that's like so weird.

974
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,840
If you don't think about it.

975
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,240
Such petty nickel and dime.

976
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,720
I mean, as evidenced by like, you know,

977
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,480
I mean, JPEG's had worse things to overcome PR wise,

978
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,800
but that Scarlett Johansson thing was so bizarre.

979
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,360
So why?

980
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,640
This is your enemy is Scarlett Johansson.

981
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,480
Yeah.

982
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,080
Constant unforced errors.

983
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,760
But now he's back and he looks so fucking rad.

984
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,760
His silver Fox Lincoln, his bald Lincoln look.

985
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,600
JPEG?

986
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,440
Yeah.

987
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,760
I, him with the beard does kind of look like those renderings

988
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,920
that people online go like,

989
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,080
oh, if Mr. Trump grew a beard, he'd look so cool.

990
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,520
And it's like, I guess what he'd look like.

991
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,480
Is that a gross, that bizarre sect of things

992
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,200
that like draws Trump as super cut and ripped.

993
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,000
They also like, I bet he'd look sharp in a beard.

994
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,840
Oh yeah.

995
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,720
Wow.

996
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,240
He'd come back stronger than ever.

997
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,360
Whatever the guys, Robert McNaughton or whatever,

998
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,320
he was always painting like presidents with shotguns

999
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,200
playing poker, whatever.

1000
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,280
Republican presidents, excuse me.

1001
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,120
Yeah.

1002
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,640
He had the weirdest beard.

1003
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,000
There's no way if it was like his top hair

1004
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,600
would just be like dripping down like a wet dog.

1005
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,840
I think the beard, I'll say this unobjectively,

1006
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,040
I do think the beard looks good.

1007
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,400
I think I would encourage him to keep it.

1008
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,960
I think it looks good versus-

1009
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,520
You like JPEG's beard?

1010
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,360
Yeah.

1011
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,200
I, well would you-

1012
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,520
It's like the Triple H beard,

1013
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,720
the bald on top beard on the-

1014
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,600
Yeah, I think that's a cool look, honestly.

1015
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,880
I don't think it's usually a bad look,

1016
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,360
but I didn't really, I think I was watching

1017
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,160
like a grainy video of one of the JPEG things.

1018
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,040
I couldn't really see it from like

1019
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,680
wherever the person was in the back of the hall.

1020
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,840
Yeah, no, I think it's a good look.

1021
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,840
Mike's looked, he's checked that high res

1022
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,400
JPEG beard shots.

1023
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,400
Yeah, I was watching the presentation of 4K.

1024
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,120
I paid for that.

1025
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,560
Is this just, are you just so stuck in the pattern

1026
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,280
of thinking that all of the CEOs can get it?

1027
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,120
We've gone into this so many times

1028
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,920
that look how handsome Card Walker is.

1029
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,600
Are you just so mired in this

1030
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,760
that you have to accept JPEG's beard as handsome?

1031
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,040
It's possible, I mean we are not always aware

1032
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,280
of our own biases.

1033
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,560
You're not attracted to the man,

1034
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,000
you're attracted to the chair, to the office of Disney CEO.

1035
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
The idea of a CEO as the president's-

1036
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,480
Exactly, you drop, Trump hostile takes over Disney

1037
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,160
and suddenly you're like, you know, kind of sharp,

1038
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,480
but he'd especially look good with a beard.

1039
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,000
Wow, that's a guy who's been to the Aspen Ideas Festival.

1040
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,360
Nice.

1041
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,280
I think, look, there's also like,

1042
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,360
there was a new, we're jumping all around,

1043
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,640
there was a new beard also on a different character too,

1044
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,840
which I think-

1045
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,680
Oh, King Thanos.

1046
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,240
We can jump to that, yeah, King Thanos.

1047
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,080
Let's look through the Marvel real quick

1048
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,120
because we alluded to the Ruffalo and Feige already.

1049
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,960
Sure.

1050
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,520
So it starts with Feige coming out

1051
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,240
and they're doing a little bit of back and forth,

1052
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,320
Josh Demaro and Feige, classic comedy bits.

1053
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,880
And Feige is a big, it is interesting.

1054
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,160
A lot of these guys, I do feel are true blue parks guys,

1055
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,000
parks people.

1056
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,480
So let's get them on and off.

1057
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,320
They cannot linger.

1058
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,600
So they get in and out, yeah.

1059
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,720
And then they're talking about Avengers Campus

1060
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,200
and I thought, you know, they had a pretty,

1061
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,600
for D23, the comedy of showing Loki three times was good

1062
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
because they were showing all the different characters

1063
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,960
and they said, and we have in the park,

1064
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,400
we have Loki and then Black Widow and then Loki

1065
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,640
and it was him in the different costume

1066
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,360
and then a different character than Loki who was-

1067
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,600
Yeah, that was genuine comedy rhythm.

1068
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,440
Yeah, yeah.

1069
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,440
Yeah, so they were hyping all the stuff that they do

1070
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,360
and I was like, yes, okay, I approve of all of this.

1071
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:02,240
And then I'm trying to remember the way that it played out

1072
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,520
is that I think Ruffalo interrupts.

1073
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,640
He's in like a hotel room somewhere and he sends a video in

1074
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,560
and he wants Hulk to be in the parks.

1075
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,400
So I'm like, okay, that's good.

1076
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,640
I'd like to see the Hulk, sure.

1077
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,600
And then a really funny giant, I don't even know how,

1078
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,440
what is it?

1079
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,640
Like it's a person in there, obviously.

1080
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,080
We were trying to figure that out and I think, you know,

1081
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,320
Jane had seen some stuff like that when she worked

1082
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,440
at Universal and there's probably a person in there

1083
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,000
but the hands are like grabbers, you know,

1084
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,360
they're controlling the hands.

1085
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,920
They're probably on small stilts, small raised stilts.

1086
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,760
Yeah, sure, sure.

1087
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,080
And then they're also firing off the voices

1088
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,360
on the like controls.

1089
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,560
It seemed like a lot.

1090
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,760
Yeah. And it's a big, it's like double the size of a person,

1091
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,280
triple the size of a person.

1092
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,920
The shot that followed him out did not provide the context

1093
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,160
of another person.

1094
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,920
So the suit comes out and like cool suit

1095
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,240
and then he lands by Feige in tomorrow.

1096
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,600
Like, oh God, he is twice their size.

1097
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1098
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,800
And it's funny because the Hulk is wearing his

1099
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,280
time suit from Endgame.

1100
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,120
Yeah.

1101
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,960
And his famous helmet, the Hulk's famous helmet.

1102
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,360
I know it so well.

1103
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:19,080
So bizarre, a giant green creature wearing ripped jeans

1104
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,880
and they're like, put him in a space suit.

1105
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,080
Well, it's obviously done because.

1106
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,560
His lip flap can't.

1107
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,080
Yeah, they can't.

1108
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,240
They didn't get it to look right with him shirtless

1109
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,480
and with the mouth.

1110
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,120
Right. And he talks now, he's smart now.

1111
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,000
It's smart Hulk from Endgame.

1112
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,640
And he's been smart ever since Endgame.

1113
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,040
Just in case, Scott, I want to catch you up.

1114
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,280
Hulk is smart now.

1115
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,320
No, I did not know that.

1116
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,160
Yeah.

1117
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,320
I did think he was oddly like,

1118
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,720
why is he just like mumbling here?

1119
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,240
This is not Hulk smash.

1120
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,600
No, yeah, he's just Ruffalo, smart Ruffalo Hulk.

1121
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,440
So.

1122
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,480
I was a little surprised.

1123
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,960
I thought he was going to say,

1124
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,400
let's get some Hulk in the parks.

1125
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,720
And it was going to be she Hulk

1126
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,120
because the show is running right now.

1127
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,600
It's getting a lot of good reviews.

1128
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,280
Well, they should put her in a big white suit too, I guess.

1129
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,800
And roll her out.

1130
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,080
Well, let's do the she Hulk.

1131
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,480
Well, she'll be in the.

1132
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,520
She's in the art.

1133
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,360
Okay.

1134
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,320
Yeah, everyone's kinda.

1135
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,760
It's not.

1136
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,840
So the ride, they re-announced the Avengers ride.

1137
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,040
It's no longer you're gone to Wakanda and aliens attack.

1138
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,720
It's a multiverse thing.

1139
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,640
Yeah.

1140
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,840
And it also, there'd been,

1141
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,760
it'd been alluded to a little bit in concept art

1142
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,320
that you are flying on your own somehow.

1143
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,520
Like you're on a.

1144
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,360
Yeah.

1145
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,280
Quinjet and then suddenly you're flying solo.

1146
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,360
And I don't think any of us knew exactly

1147
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,040
how that ride mechanism was going to work.

1148
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,480
But now they very distinctly show just a car.

1149
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,320
You're in a car.

1150
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,280
You're in a Transformers car.

1151
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,240
Which like, and that's,

1152
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,160
so we're using the greatest ride system ever.

1153
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,000
Well, if we do.

1154
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,160
Yeah, if we use the greatest ride system, then okay, good.

1155
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:04,160
But the old art made it seem, oh my God, what is this?

1156
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,840
Yeah, we're maybe no longer in the territory

1157
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,280
of new type of ride.

1158
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,840
Yeah, cause the old one, there were enough,

1159
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,720
the promo art or whatever you call it,

1160
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,440
the concept art is like you were in a Quinjet

1161
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,240
and then somehow you got out of the Quinjet.

1162
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,760
Like you just plunged down,

1163
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,040
like you were skydiving or something.

1164
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,960
And then you were in little chairs

1165
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,440
in like a 360 degree theater of some kind

1166
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,160
watching an insane battle happen around you.

1167
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,520
Which sounds amazing.

1168
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,920
Sounds like a crazy new thing you've never been,

1169
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,240
like you're in little like bungee chairs or something, maybe.

1170
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,160
That's been replaced with cameos.

1171
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,800
And that now, yeah.

1172
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,880
Cameos of every possible character.

1173
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,840
I think that this was a budget concern,

1174
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,320
like many things that happened in the Disney company

1175
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,480
in the last few years,

1176
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,040
including not paying Mindy Kaling and Bill Hader

1177
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,680
to reprise their roles in Inside Out 2.

1178
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,960
Announcing Inside Out 2, but not.

1179
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,920
Lowballing them and forcing them out

1180
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,200
because they're not going to pay actors as much anymore,

1181
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,880
even actors that are famous.

1182
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,720
Wow, yeah.

1183
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,000
So I think that this, whatever they figured out

1184
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,800
is that we will just have screens with characters on them

1185
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,760
and not pay the money for the new crazy cool ride system.

1186
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,600
That's a guess.

1187
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,280
I again, hope to be wrong.

1188
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,720
I hope to be proven wrong.

1189
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,800
And that this thing will be amazing.

1190
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,000
But we know what we're looking at.

1191
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,480
We know that it's a, and it'll probably,

1192
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,240
look, there's plenty of great rides

1193
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,920
where you are sitting in a car.

1194
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,480
But just when you're coming down from the possibility

1195
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,760
of a crazy new type of ride.

1196
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,040
And the, yeah, it's got all the,

1197
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,480
it's got like an animated Spider-Man in the promo art.

1198
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,320
It's got Tom Holland's Spider-Man.

1199
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,040
It's got Daredevil.

1200
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,880
It's got She-Hulk.

1201
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,200
It's got a good variety of characters.

1202
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,200
Does it have Megan Thee Stallion twerking?

1203
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,480
It does not have Megan Thee Stallion.

1204
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,200
I want to say I am pro Megan Thee Stallion

1205
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
twerking on She-Hulk.

1206
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,800
Yeah, I'm pro as well.

1207
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,760
Unusually current reference for a Disney prop today.

1208
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,760
It's a little, yeah, it's already a year or two

1209
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,400
maybe behind, but still.

1210
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,480
I feel like she's just gotten bigger

1211
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,720
in the last year or two.

1212
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,560
That's true.

1213
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,380
No, you're right.

1214
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,720
But it's not, yeah, it's not at the,

1215
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,560
I don't know, maybe what,

1216
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,480
I don't know what years are anymore.

1217
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,640
I feel like. Yes, that's true.

1218
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,520
Yeah, it would have been like exactly.

1219
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,560
She featured on a lot of big songs during the pandemic.

1220
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1221
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,040
So, look, if Megan Thee Stallion,

1222
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,320
if they want to put her on the ride,

1223
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,360
I think that's awesome.

1224
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,920
I guess that you would so with that, yes.

1225
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,240
If all of a sudden she's like punching Thanos in the face.

1226
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,360
King Thanos.

1227
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,120
Oh yeah, so did we explain King Thanos who has a beard?

1228
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,080
What's different about him besides that he has a beard?

1229
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,480
Well, they said he won.

1230
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,320
Oh, he won, that's what they said.

1231
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,360
But he also kind of won in the movie too.

1232
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,200
He did win in the movie.

1233
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,560
He kept winning.

1234
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,600
I think that's version.

1235
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,960
He was winning so much he got so sick of winning.

1236
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,160
Yeah, we're all gonna be,

1237
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,040
we all ended up so tired of winning.

1238
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,040
Yeah, he won in Infinity War and which famously Jason,

1239
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,680
when we saw it in the theater,

1240
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,520
Jason was upset by the end of Infinity War.

1241
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,160
Real sad, kind of sad to watch Spider-Man dissolve into dust.

1242
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,160
I said, oh, that was actually one of the better Marvel movies.

1243
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,120
I really enjoyed that.

1244
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,240
I thought that was like, it was a dark ending and it was cool.

1245
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,320
And Jason was like,

1246
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,160
but think of all the kids who will be upset by it.

1247
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,680
Well, I also didn't know the second part

1248
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,920
was coming one year later.

1249
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,040
I thought it was gonna be another three or four years

1250
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,360
in between movies.

1251
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,760
So you thought that was too long of a wait

1252
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,600
for kids to be sad.

1253
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,420
So I thought that was gonna be like,

1254
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,080
well, a lot of kids think Spider-Man's dead for a few years.

1255
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,120
So yeah, Thanos wins in Infinity War.

1256
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,760
Then he goes and retires.

1257
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,520
And then at the start of Endgame,

1258
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,200
the remaining Avengers go and find him retired.

1259
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,440
And even though he's not a threat anymore,

1260
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,480
Thor chops his head off.

1261
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,320
He mercs him.

1262
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,160
He mercs him.

1263
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,920
Yeah, just to be safe, yeah.

1264
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,560
And so yeah, but he won.

1265
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,640
I mean, Thanos won ultimately.

1266
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,760
He got his way.

1267
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,160
And then the Thanos they fight at the end of Endgame

1268
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,200
is a different, is the past Thanos basically.

1269
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,040
Right.

1270
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,160
It's like a different Thanos

1271
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,880
because they go back in time.

1272
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,720
So this is a multiverse, a different Thanos

1273
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,680
from a different multiverse.

1274
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,880
They haven't explained which one.

1275
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,400
So it's not Thanos.

1276
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,480
I've been saying Thanos my whole life.

1277
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,480
Look, I've been confused actually

1278
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,920
as long as I've been reading comics

1279
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,880
about exactly how to say it.

1280
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,840
So whatever the last person who said it is how I say it.

1281
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,680
Okay.

1282
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,520
There's probably podcasts that rise

1283
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,640
where I say Thanos, honestly.

1284
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,840
But so-

1285
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,680
Just jumped out.

1286
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,200
I feel like it was like, that was like,

1287
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,960
and then King Thanos was just different

1288
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,120
than Thanos in Thanos one.

1289
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,320
Yeah, no, it says nothing.

1290
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,120
I'm just whatever, whoever said it last

1291
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,480
is how I say it.

1292
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,600
There is, like, there's definitely weird comic stuff

1293
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:57,600
like Ra's al Ghul is Batman villain who is pronounced-

1294
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,440
Ra's?

1295
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,520
Ra's al Ghul is pronounced, on the animated series

1296
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,840
that's what they say.

1297
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,320
In the 90s, that's how they pronounce his name.

1298
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,840
And then in the movies they call him Ra's al Ghul.

1299
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,920
So I don't know.

1300
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,920
I don't know if I have a good answer for any of this.

1301
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,080
Anyway, he's got a beard now

1302
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,320
and I have no other information

1303
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,640
about what makes him different.

1304
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,480
But he's-

1305
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,920
Is he only in this ride, this version of Thanos?

1306
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,560
He's exclusive to this ride.

1307
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,000
It says first time they've rolled out a new version

1308
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,280
of a character.

1309
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,120
Okay, yeah.

1310
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:24,960
Just in a ride.

1311
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,800
That's something, yeah, yeah.

1312
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,240
I kind of thought the way they were leading up to it,

1313
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,920
I was like, they're gonna announce a big, scary villain

1314
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,000
from the comics and it's just getting rolled out

1315
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,360
in this ride.

1316
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,840
That was not the case.

1317
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,680
Okay, okay.

1318
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,080
It was the one people recognize, which, hey, fair enough.

1319
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:43,920
It's a theme park.

1320
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,840
Yeah, you gotta go where people know.

1321
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,760
If I could amend a Simpsons quote,

1322
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,240
Malibu Stacey has a new hat.

1323
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,080
Yeah, absolutely.

1324
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:51,920
That's the good one.

1325
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,760
Very much.

1326
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,080
New hat, new beard.

1327
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,120
People are gonna be excited.

1328
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,160
Hey, wait, speaking of hats, big hat,

1329
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,240
related news and parks and characters,

1330
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,600
the Hat Box Ghost is coming to Disney World.

1331
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,720
Don't care for it.

1332
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,680
Oh, you feel edged in on-

1333
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,800
Give him a new ghost.

1334
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,000
Keep the Hat Box Ghost exclusive to here as well.

1335
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,560
What if you live there, wouldn't you be like,

1336
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,680
I want the Hat Box Ghost?

1337
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,280
I bet that is how I would feel.

1338
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,120
Well, there we go.

1339
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,160
I don't care, I live here.

1340
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,200
Crack that puzzle.

1341
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,720
I don't want them to have it.

1342
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,160
I want us to have it.

1343
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,200
They can have a different ghost.

1344
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,040
Give them a different ghost.

1345
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,360
There's no legend at that haunted mansion

1346
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,680
about the Hat Box Ghost.

1347
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,520
Mm-hmm.

1348
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,360
That's the whole point.

1349
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,200
That's what I'm saying.

1350
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,840
The reason the Hat Box Ghost is special out here

1351
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,400
because it's a specific legend to here,

1352
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,440
to Southern California, to Disneyland.

1353
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,960
You can make up legends and put them anywhere.

1354
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,800
Sure.

1355
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,480
The power of storytelling, anything can be a legend.

1356
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,040
Make up a Orlando legend of a different ghost

1357
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,440
that maybe was on the ride the first week of opening.

1358
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,320
You know what I'm saying?

1359
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,160
I guess so.

1360
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:58,280
I understand that, look, Leto is the Hat Box Ghost.

1361
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,120
And they're gonna have to have-

1362
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,120
Is that right?

1363
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:00,960
Isn't that right?

1364
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,040
I didn't make that up right, yeah.

1365
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:02,880
Oh, I forgot about that.

1366
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,680
Jamie Lee Curtis is Madame Leota.

1367
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,960
Oh, I missed that one, really.

1368
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,800
And she came out in the Doombuggy.

1369
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,120
Oh, she came out in the Doombuggy.

1370
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,760
She was revealed at D23.

1371
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,720
Oh, that's why I saw her in the Doombuggy.

1372
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,080
I didn't catch that announcement.

1373
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:13,920
Okay, interesting.

1374
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,120
So Leto is the Hat Box.

1375
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,480
So I understand he's gonna be a popular character

1376
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,320
and they want him on both.

1377
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:22,600
In case, that's Jared Leto, not Leno, just to be clear.

1378
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,440
If you were mishearing it.

1379
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,520
Who'd go either way with us?

1380
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,680
Who'd go either way?

1381
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,760
Thank you, yeah, thank you for clarifying.

1382
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,320
So yeah, no, I feel they should have their own unique ghost

1383
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,680
to that ghost.

1384
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,400
Do you feel like anyone,

1385
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,720
have people in Florida been jealous of us having it?

1386
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,760
Because you seem like, I don't want them to have it.

1387
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,840
Do you think on the other side,

1388
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,840
has ever been like those smug bastards in California?

1389
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,600
Yeah, I think it has probably been like,

1390
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,840
this is not the same as me not wanting like people's

1391
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,360
student loans forgiven because I paid my student loans.

1392
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,280
That's not what this is.

1393
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,240
I'm not trying to punish them.

1394
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,800
You want some forgiveness.

1395
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,560
So you want, and then so would you be okay

1396
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,400
with some Hat Box ghost?

1397
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,260
Hat Box ghost, but he's smaller or he's harder to see.

1398
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,400
They put in a lot of mist.

1399
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,400
I want a means tested Hat Box ghost.

1400
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,920
That's what I want.

1401
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,400
If somebody is worthy enough of seeing the Hat Box ghost

1402
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,720
in Florida, they are allowed to see it.

1403
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,960
No, but I just, I feel like it's fun.

1404
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,000
It was a special thing because of it being to Disneyland

1405
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,160
and the legend of it.

1406
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,920
So when it finally appeared here.

1407
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:33,000
So I'm not that mad, but I don't think honestly,

1408
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,440
but I still don't think it should be there.

1409
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,520
I don't think they should have it.

1410
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,120
I'm not that mad.

1411
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,600
You could rearrange that sentence to be, I'm mad.

1412
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,800
You could if you wanted to, but it's fascinating.

1413
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,800
You need ghosts, put a unique ghost there.

1414
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,840
That's what I think.

1415
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,960
I can't argue with that, but it's gotta be,

1416
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,000
there has to be the like inherent clever.

1417
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,480
You have to like give them something as cool

1418
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,640
as the Hat Box ghost effect.

1419
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,480
Well, as long as there's a need.

1420
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,120
Use the same effect and it's a different ghost

1421
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,760
and his head is going into a different type of

1422
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,040
like carrying case of some kind.

1423
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,360
So you're okay with still.

1424
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,560
Suit Box ghost, suitcase ghost.

1425
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:16,480
Orange man ghost, this guy used to sell oranges

1426
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,320
door to door.

1427
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,120
No, not, no, no, we've got to take the phrase

1428
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,160
orange man back, an orange salesman.

1429
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,040
And he got lost at the haunted mansion.

1430
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,560
Fine, yeah, great.

1431
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:29,640
So wait, sorry, his head goes into his box,

1432
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,000
which is otherwise full of oranges.

1433
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,200
Is his head a big orange?

1434
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,400
Oh, well, maybe his head disappears

1435
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:41,080
and a bunch of heads appear on the oranges in his box.

1436
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,000
His oranges that he's selling.

1437
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,880
That he's selling.

1438
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,720
By the way, so he got lost and ended up in an old manor,

1439
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,760
him being a citrus salesman.

1440
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,880
He thought it's like a mansion.

1441
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,680
I bet there's a lot of money here.

1442
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,400
They'll buy a bunch of oranges.

1443
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,880
I'm gonna move so many oranges today.

1444
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,480
Yeah, it's okay.

1445
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,040
That's, I'm for that.

1446
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,440
I'm for all of these ideas.

1447
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,160
I just think that it's special.

1448
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,640
It's not special anymore here.

1449
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,480
So you're, so are you now gonna go on the haunted mansion

1450
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,280
and be like, ah, he'll do like a big sigh

1451
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,160
when you pass that box.

1452
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,640
I don't know that I'll exhale aggressively,

1453
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,480
but it just, I like your little like little treats

1454
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,680
on the different coasts with the different rides.

1455
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,240
And it will feel a little less special.

1456
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,840
Unless they do, maybe they'll do something different

1457
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,480
with him in Orlando.

1458
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,560
Because all they did was show his head.

1459
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,800
And who knows with the way they roll stuff out,

1460
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,760
maybe we're waiting till 2030 to see him.

1461
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,400
They didn't give a date, I don't think.

1462
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,240
No, they did.

1463
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,080
That was on the timeline.

1464
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,680
Cause they had to flesh out that timeline.

1465
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,960
They had to like, how many logos can we populate this with

1466
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,080
to make it look like something?

1467
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,960
The one year, I guess it's 2024,

1468
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,880
had the Tiana logo on it twice.

1469
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,480
And then underneath real small, it said Disneyland,

1470
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,320
Disney World.

1471
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,920
And I'm like, well, no, that's cheating.

1472
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,560
Those aren't different things.

1473
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,360
That's like when you make your font,

1474
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,000
when you had to write a paper in school and it's like,

1475
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,160
okay, I'm making it 13 point.

1476
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,760
I'm making the margins really small.

1477
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,120
They must have been really big.

1478
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:12,080
Everybody got like Marvel,

1479
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,320
Marvel like TV and movie pills.

1480
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,720
So they're like, we should do that too with the rides.

1481
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,560
It's fun to show the big graphic of all this stuff.

1482
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,560
It must be so fun.

1483
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,720
And then they all reveal and fade up.

1484
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,160
And then people are staring at 50 logos.

1485
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,840
We gotta give them 50 logos or it's not a panel.

1486
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,560
So somebody threw that idea out and they were like,

1487
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,400
yeah, let's do that.

1488
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,360
And then they were like, oh shit.

1489
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,360
Oh, it can't be a year with like little ones coming out.

1490
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,280
Okay, switch it, switch the access.

1491
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,720
Okay, yeah, now they're all this.

1492
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,880
So the year is this way and the years are stacked.

1493
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,720
So it looks busy.

1494
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,360
It's a little Jenga tower.

1495
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,680
It's not a timeline because we don't know what the hell's,

1496
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,320
we might not have any money by 2036.

1497
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,640
Well, so one of those would just said Cotino.

1498
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,160
It's like, that's just a housing development.

1499
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,680
Oh, did it say Cotino one?

1500
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,360
Yeah, I was on there.

1501
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,640
Yeah, it's just a housing development for millionaires.

1502
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,080
That doesn't count on this.

1503
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,040
No, no, you could tell they like, but you know,

1504
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,120
you could sense them like trying out the material.

1505
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,960
Like if Cotino got a cheer in the room

1506
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,640
where it's the easiest ever to make people cheer,

1507
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,080
then maybe they'd keep pushing Cotino a little harder,

1508
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,720
but it managed to not get a cheer in a room where people,

1509
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,280
it was like, and the boat will be going to Australia.

1510
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,400
Holy shit.

1511
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,240
Oh yeah.

1512
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,120
People were removed on stretchers,

1513
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,240
like at an old Rolling Stones concert.

1514
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,080
Elvis.

1515
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,840
Women passing.

1516
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,400
All right, we got 10 faints.

1517
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,480
It happened again.

1518
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,720
A boat has a new place to go.

1519
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,080
Josh Demaro is like Elvis in a lot of ways.

1520
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,280
Do we still have the fond feelings for Demaro

1521
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,440
after watching a whole parade of,

1522
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,040
because we were texting about how like,

1523
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,840
now there's a lot of like,

1524
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,240
he knows that people like him

1525
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,360
and we're all going to do run Disney

1526
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,200
and I'll be there running.

1527
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,440
I run, you know that I run anyway.

1528
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,400
He's self aware now.

1529
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,240
I think so.

1530
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,120
I think we figured it out.

1531
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,240
We got to see him ride Tron.

1532
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,680
I mean, we're not going to be able to ride Tron for a while,

1533
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,000
especially there's a virtual queue.

1534
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,080
Those things are always fucked,

1535
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,200
but he got to ride it.

1536
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,200
So we got to see his home movies.

1537
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,560
Ha ha ha, yay, whoosh, whoo, wow.

1538
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,960
Oh, the wind and his perfect silver hair.

1539
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,800
So it's done.

1540
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,800
So you're saying it's done.

1541
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,360
So you could open this because it's done.

1542
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,200
Well, a little more.

1543
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,200
Well, there's a, we got to pour some asphalt first.

1544
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,640
Why is that going to happen?

1545
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,480
What did they say?

1546
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,080
Spring 2023.

1547
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,720
So five years since groundbreaking.

1548
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,800
Six more months.

1549
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,640
Yes.

1550
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,480
Why?

1551
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,520
Open the ride.

1552
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,560
I don't know.

1553
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,920
I don't know.

1554
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,560
Universal opens the rides two years too early.

1555
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,320
Hadwards opened two years too early.

1556
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,960
Secret Life of Pets still breaks every time you ride it,

1557
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:52,800
but it's open.

1558
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,640
You get to go.

1559
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,760
As soon as it's legally allowed, they open the ride,

1560
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,680
whether it's been tested thoroughly or not.

1561
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,640
Yeah, I was at a food festival riding Secret Lives of Pets

1562
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,760
and everything else was like, half the rides are open.

1563
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,280
And it's like, oh, okay.

1564
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,120
It's all willy nilly there.

1565
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,280
We got one shot of the vaccine.

1566
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,840
I guess that's good enough to go inside

1567
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,600
and ride these rides.

1568
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,440
Yeah, so.

1569
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,520
Well, speaking of getting a little too ahead of it,

1570
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,480
let's talk about what so much of this panel was.

1571
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,920
Musical performances.

1572
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,560
Which was, well, that, okay, yes.

1573
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,800
Very talented performers, but again,

1574
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,840
we know what you're doing.

1575
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,520
You're filling for time.

1576
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,080
Great singers, dancers, musicians.

1577
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,200
They hired great people.

1578
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,680
But again, weren't you supposed to announce

1579
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,040
theme park rides?

1580
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,080
Yeah, yeah.

1581
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,360
So what a ton of it ended up being

1582
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:45,440
was this odd scenario of, and we have some ideas.

1583
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,760
Well, I don't know if we should say.

1584
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,160
I should, oh, don't make me.

1585
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,480
Hey, in front of all these people,

1586
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,960
you're gonna make me say,

1587
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,720
yeah, I guess you want a man up.

1588
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,240
Do you have balls or not?

1589
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,320
Do you have the nuts to show a slide

1590
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,520
that for sure was loaded up on the screen

1591
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,080
ready to go before this panel began?

1592
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,680
There was so much weird.

1593
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,760
So what we got was like the suggestion of a shape

1594
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,560
of what a ride could maybe be

1595
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,160
if they do have the funding for it.

1596
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,120
This was the weirdest possible way to do this.

1597
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,040
Edging.

1598
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:19,880
Edging.

1599
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,760
This is like, this comes about,

1600
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,800
the panel was actually, I think,

1601
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,320
scheduled only 90 minutes.

1602
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,120
They went about two hours, 15 minutes.

1603
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,240
Maybe it was scheduled for two hours

1604
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,600
and I read this thing wrong.

1605
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:34,600
But 90 minutes in, they bring out like a line of Lena Bell,

1606
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,480
Duffy's friend Lena Bell.

1607
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,360
And you're like, this is like 100 minutes in.

1608
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,000
And they real quick go like,

1609
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,800
and there's gonna be a stop motion Duffy series

1610
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,760
on Disney Plus.

1611
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,560
Moving on, like, wait, what?

1612
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,840
Yeah, so they're like doing it.

1613
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,960
And you're like, okay, all right.

1614
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,520
And you're waiting for the big thing.

1615
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,360
Yeah.

1616
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,200
We're all waiting for something.

1617
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,400
We're like, even though if they did all this stuff

1618
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,040
and then at the end they went in New Tomorrowland,

1619
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:57,920
I think we'd all been like,

1620
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,120
well, at least that's a pretty big deal.

1621
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:00,960
Worth it.

1622
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,840
So, okay.

1623
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,800
So like, he starts talking about, listen,

1624
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,200
like a way of like a little cheeky,

1625
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,960
like this is gonna be,

1626
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,840
we're talking about some big stuff.

1627
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,160
I remember going, okay, wait a minute.

1628
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,280
Maybe we've been, maybe we're wrong.

1629
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,440
Maybe they're about to give us some big stuff.

1630
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,720
This is like how, you know,

1631
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,520
like the buildup of Alien is kind of slow,

1632
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,240
but it's on purpose because the shit goes down.

1633
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,080
Yes.

1634
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:25,920
And it lures you in.

1635
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,040
You got tricked.

1636
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,480
And then this is, as you were saying,

1637
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:33,680
the most confusing little play that they put on.

1638
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,320
Where it's two, it's a Disney film person.

1639
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,960
So the person they'd have to work with

1640
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,480
to bring some of the more recent properties to life.

1641
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,000
And then I forget who the other guy was.

1642
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,240
He was Imagineering.

1643
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,080
Okay.

1644
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,040
So then they do this little play

1645
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,000
where they're not supposed to say this stuff

1646
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,880
because they say like,

1647
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,680
oh, we're really thinking about doing this.

1648
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,480
They're both trying to say,

1649
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,880
these are like, we're really planning

1650
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,120
and thinking about these things,

1651
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,440
but also this is 10 years away if we do it.

1652
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,080
They're saying both things at the same time

1653
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,280
where it's like, this isn't just,

1654
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,760
Beluse, this isn't just like a thought.

1655
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,760
We really would like to do some of this stuff.

1656
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,200
We have a really fuzzy watercolor of it.

1657
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,240
Two fuzzy watercolors.

1658
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,000
One for Animal Kingdom, one for Magic Kingdom.

1659
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,400
But also it's not happening anytime soon.

1660
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,800
Which he also says, which is so bizarre.

1661
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,240
Like, so my reading of it is that

1662
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,920
somebody looked at this presentation and said,

1663
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,000
this is a little thin.

1664
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,120
Like we've waited three years.

1665
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,160
These maniacs in the audience would maybe like a ride,

1666
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,320
maybe like a ride announcement

1667
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,760
for one of the domestic parks.

1668
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,600
And they went, oh God, what are we gonna do?

1669
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,400
Okay, well, let's share some like possible things

1670
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,240
we could do.

1671
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,600
But this is not, these aren't green lit.

1672
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,440
No.

1673
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,840
These aren't, these are not maybe that fleshed out.

1674
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,720
It felt like them feeling the audience out.

1675
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,760
Like whatever wins on the cheer meter,

1676
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,760
maybe they will sort of fast track to presenting it

1677
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,840
to Mr. Baldbeard to see if he'll cough up ill,

1678
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,640
if he'll move some of the lounge money over to.

1679
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:17,280
It really seemed like kind of, they rushed through it.

1680
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,480
It's like, oh, animal kingdom.

1681
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,520
They didn't even say.

1682
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,760
Dino land, it's gonna become Zootopia and Moana.

1683
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,480
And then in the magic kingdom, we'll do Coco and Enchant,

1684
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,240
or not Enchant, what's it called?

1685
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,080
Encanto.

1686
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,440
Encanto, and we'll do all the Disney villains.

1687
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,280
And they'll all be neighbors.

1688
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,400
They'll all be in a row.

1689
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,240
And it's like, what the fuck?

1690
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,240
It's like all of it.

1691
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,280
How could all of that be in those places?

1692
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,640
That seems like too many things.

1693
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,800
It seems like they called an audible

1694
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,000
like halfway through the thing.

1695
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
And they were like, hey, get the Imagineering.

1696
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,520
The director of, I forget which movie she directed.

1697
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,840
She produces a lot of them.

1698
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,000
Yeah, she produces a lot.

1699
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:49,960
She's been there for a long time.

1700
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:50,800
What's her name?

1701
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,880
Jennifer Lee.

1702
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:52,720
Jennifer Lee, thank you.

1703
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,640
I think she was a fixer on Zootopia.

1704
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:55,480
Okay.

1705
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,440
Which I say fixer, but like every Disney movie,

1706
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,880
the last 10, 15 years are always like, and it was a mess.

1707
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,800
So we threw everything in the garbage

1708
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,120
and started back at one.

1709
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:06,960
Yeah.

1710
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,080
And 30 people worked on the story.

1711
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,480
And I was like, why do you guys always say this

1712
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,480
as the narrative?

1713
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,480
Like that this is a new thing you've hit upon.

1714
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,880
Well, cause that's Toy Story 2.

1715
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,000
It's Toy Story 1.

1716
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,520
It's like everything has that point, you know,

1717
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,520
that one where Sting got screwed

1718
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,400
and they threw all his songs away.

1719
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,680
It's like, I think it's every Disney anime movie.

1720
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,200
It is the behind the scenes drama,

1721
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,240
but it's just so funny when they're like,

1722
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,320
and Imagineering's hitting 70 years,

1723
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,840
the company's hitting a hundred years.

1724
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,560
And it's like, okay.

1725
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,800
I mean, you're still doing everything ad hoc.

1726
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,640
I guess that's just the industry at large.

1727
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:42,480
Chaos.

1728
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,320
Everything is chaos.

1729
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,160
Movies and Imagineering.

1730
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,000
Everything is chaos.

1731
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,520
Yeah.

1732
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,920
But yeah, it felt like,

1733
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,440
cause they already had talked about Zootopia in Shanghai,

1734
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,440
which has been announced and like they showed some of the,

1735
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,200
they showed some of the puppet stuff outside,

1736
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,800
which looked cool.

1737
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,560
Like I liked the idea they were using like puppets

1738
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,400
on the streets.

1739
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,800
Oh yeah. They'll sort of flesh out the street scenes

1740
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:02,640
and environments with puppets.

1741
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,720
That's fun and animatronic looked good.

1742
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,560
Yeah.

1743
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,240
But then like, this was 20 minutes ago.

1744
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,400
And then they're like, and maybe we'll,

1745
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,960
they're like, how about they,

1746
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,880
which I thought was weird.

1747
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,840
They say, but like Dino land.

1748
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,920
And then they were like, we're going to bulldoze.

1749
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,200
Like it's so funny.

1750
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,640
Cause they usually don't say like,

1751
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,520
we're getting rid of this to do this.

1752
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,040
They'll say like, oh, we're going to do this.

1753
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,560
And then later you put it together like,

1754
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,080
oh, they're getting rid of that.

1755
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:27,920
Yeah. Yeah.

1756
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,960
You do that part, but they like said really front and center.

1757
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,040
Dino land.

1758
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,000
Like we're going to bulldoze Dino land.

1759
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,080
Maybe.

1760
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,520
Which is again, why it felt like they called an audible

1761
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,120
backstage to just send them out.

1762
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,000
And this part wasn't so polished.

1763
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,960
Yeah. Yeah.

1764
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,640
So, and I don't think that's what happened,

1765
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,240
but it felt late in the process.

1766
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,920
Cause it didn't, this part felt a lot more,

1767
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:51,840
a lot less smooth as the rest of the presentation did.

1768
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,680
Yes. Yeah.

1769
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,520
So yeah, they like threw all this stuff out just to make

1770
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,880
people think maybe we're going to get a ride here.

1771
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,320
And yeah, they threw up some concept art,

1772
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,040
which would be great if it happened.

1773
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:08,560
But then it just looked like the spinner ride triceratops spin

1774
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,240
just becomes Moana spin.

1775
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,680
It's Maui spin now.

1776
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,480
Didn't seem like it was anything amazing.

1777
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,320
Yeah.

1778
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,480
Rodie was commenting on it too on Twitter.

1779
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,360
Well, he had, it was a couple of years ago.

1780
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,200
That was an old post.

1781
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,040
Oh, was that old?

1782
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:22,880
Yeah.

1783
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,880
Cause he would just that his theory of like about, you know,

1784
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,360
we're not rushing Zootopia in there.

1785
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,040
Cause that's animals telling human stories.

1786
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,960
We're trying to let the animals speak for themselves

1787
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,600
with nature conservation.

1788
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,520
I'm like, that's very nice, but I want some fucking rides.

1789
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,560
I don't give a shit.

1790
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,080
Whatever it is, zoos in the name.

1791
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,840
Just put it, I know it's,

1792
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,920
they haven't used not a zoo in a long time.

1793
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,000
It can be a zoo.

1794
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,640
It could be a Zootopia now.

1795
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:47,640
He's just there now.

1796
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,840
He was just there hanging out.

1797
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:49,680
Yeah.

1798
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,600
He was chilling at his old, you know, alumni.

1799
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,960
Yeah. All the greats were wandering around.

1800
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,800
That's a, that's a fun part of it.

1801
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,280
This D23, when we were at Star Wars celebration,

1802
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,360
they were pop-up bars.

1803
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:02,560
Like every 20 feet, you could get like a canned cocktail.

1804
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,480
I wonder if they were at D23 too.

1805
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,600
Maybe. I don't know what the, yeah. Anaheim.

1806
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,560
Anaheim's loose.

1807
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:08,640
San Diego is not like that.

1808
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,680
We've talked about that before.

1809
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,520
You cannot get a drink.

1810
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,080
San Diego would be lawless if they did that.

1811
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,320
Yeah. But yeah, in Anaheim,

1812
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,280
you can get a beer in the convention center.

1813
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,480
Yeah.

1814
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:21,480
So all this stuff, that's lawless by the way.

1815
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,480
You get a beer in the convention center.

1816
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,040
No, I'm just saying cause here,

1817
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,720
I'm just saying the vibes are a little more agitated

1818
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,560
at San Diego.

1819
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,880
I feel like the vibes are not as good

1820
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,520
at the San Diego convention center.

1821
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,960
The Anaheim convention center always feels more chill

1822
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:36,800
whenever I've been there.

1823
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,880
You can go to Rockin' Baja and get hammered

1824
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,960
and go back to the- You can, yeah.

1825
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,960
But you gotta, you gotta walk the mile.

1826
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:42,800
Or you gotta walk the half a mile.

1827
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,960
We've been to the Wired Lounge

1828
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,520
and you put back a drink or two and head back to the floor.

1829
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,520
You got a Rockin' Baja at the Wired Lounge.

1830
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,480
Yeah. Well, if you're, look, Rockin' Baja,

1831
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,800
you have to go if you're a San Diego main,

1832
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,680
Comic Con mainstay like we are.

1833
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:55,560
Sure.

1834
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,840
What's the, what's the, what do you recommend

1835
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:57,680
at Rockin' Baja?

1836
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,400
Some sort of fried fish.

1837
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,240
Yeah.

1838
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,800
Big bucket of fried something.

1839
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,840
So you can get hammered.

1840
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:03,680
Margarita. You can get hammered

1841
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:04,760
on those fried fish.

1842
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:05,600
That's right. Yeah.

1843
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,120
You can get a big margar, big gross margarita

1844
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,360
and a big, big thing.

1845
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,440
We're more Joe's people. It's one of the closest one.

1846
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,040
Get the shark bite.

1847
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,840
Well, of course we love Joe's Crab Shack

1848
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,080
as far as the San Diego place.

1849
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,680
And I went there, I didn't go to Comic Con

1850
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,160
cause it would have been irresponsible to.

1851
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,680
The way to a child, yes.

1852
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,120
Lindsay, you go into labor during Comic Con

1853
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,560
and I'm down at Joe's Crab Shack drinking the shark bite.

1854
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,400
Hang on, almost done with my shark bite.

1855
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,240
Yeah.

1856
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,080
Labor takes a while, right?

1857
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:31,920
I'll get, I'll hit the road now.

1858
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,760
You are like two miles from anywhere

1859
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,480
that you could call a Lyft.

1860
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,400
I would have had to get in a.

1861
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,400
I have to close the bill.

1862
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,080
I have to close the tab at Joe's Crab Shack.

1863
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,920
It would have been faster if I got in a boat

1864
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,440
and headed back to Los Angeles.

1865
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,560
Yeah.

1866
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,920
With that location of Joe's.

1867
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,440
Just start swimming.

1868
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,840
So yeah, but no, oh, there's a lot of, yeah.

1869
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:53,440
Rockin' Baja is an almost annual tradition.

1870
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,000
As far as a Comic Con.

1871
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,240
Well, look for Mike there, maybe next Comic Con.

1872
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,880
Yeah, I'll be there next year.

1873
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,680
So now the stuff looks cool.

1874
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,000
I don't know, Coco and.

1875
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,840
Yeah, it'd be great.

1876
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,240
And Contest, yeah, it'll be.

1877
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,440
But Disneyland Forward looked great

1878
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,840
and there was no mention of it.

1879
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,720
Yeah, yeah.

1880
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,520
Yeah, the last I checked on that,

1881
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:15,000
cause I signed up for the email updates

1882
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,320
and they were showing the first episode

1883
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:20,320
of the Imagineering story on Zoom.

1884
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,680
And that was the last I heard.

1885
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,560
The first thing you've seen already.

1886
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,400
If you don't know what we're talking about,

1887
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,240
Disneyland Forward, they presented this huge piece

1888
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:32,840
of promo art that showed them adding 10 rides, 12 rides,

1889
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,760
big lands to both parks in California.

1890
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,800
And what it probably really is,

1891
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,600
is a scam to fool Anaheim into thinking

1892
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,360
they were building that when instead they just wanted

1893
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,640
to be able to build more restaurants and hotels.

1894
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,480
Yeah.

1895
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:46,320
On the land.

1896
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:49,800
It's probably a big con for the city of Anaheim.

1897
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,360
And that's what I'm guessing ultimately,

1898
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,240
because you would think they would at least,

1899
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,760
if they were gonna tease more stuff that maybe

1900
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:59,200
will be built, they would have gone to the art

1901
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,440
that they already had from 2020?

1902
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,280
Yeah.

1903
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,520
Two years ago at this point.

1904
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,240
That's not happening.

1905
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,920
But it's not, that's not happening.

1906
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:08,760
Yeah.

1907
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:12,560
You know what is happening and this maybe this is,

1908
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,440
in our world is the biggest thing to an hour.

1909
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,880
This wasn't even part of the panel.

1910
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,760
This was a detail in a model of the previously announced

1911
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,320
Mickey's Toon Town.

1912
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,640
And if you didn't already see this,

1913
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,800
we have not publicly commented on this.

1914
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:30,040
And I think now is the time that there is a new

1915
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,960
food establishment coming to Mickey's Toon Town.

1916
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,800
Yes.

1917
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,840
And now forgive me.

1918
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:37,040
I actually forget the, is it, let's,

1919
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,720
does anyone know the exact names?

1920
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:39,880
You should reveal it if you know the,

1921
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,480
I forget what the last word is.

1922
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,040
Good boy grocers.

1923
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,040
Good boy grocers.

1924
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,120
Good boy.

1925
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:51,680
There is a, now Disneyland will have a food stop

1926
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:54,280
with the phrase good boy in it.

1927
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,120
Yes.

1928
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:55,960
What happened here?

1929
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,720
Pluto is in the logo.

1930
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:58,560
Right.

1931
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:02,440
But also we like it cause it's our thing.

1932
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,600
We're going to be down there.

1933
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,920
We're all going to, we're all going to meet down there

1934
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,720
when it opens so we can get a picture under it.

1935
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,880
And Mike is going to miss his daughter's first steps.

1936
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,080
Like that.

1937
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,720
You again, he will be in the farthest part back.

1938
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,080
You were in the Joe's Crab Shack of Disneyland,

1939
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,520
the furthest part away.

1940
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:23,200
This will be, look, I'll be,

1941
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,560
it'll be more like a 1950s dad who missed all sorts of things

1942
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,720
about their kids cause they were busy at the office

1943
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,560
or something.

1944
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,000
The office for me.

1945
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,040
Yeah. The office for me though, will be Mickey's Toontown.

1946
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:38,080
Good boy grocers or Baja.

1947
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:38,920
Rockin' Baja.

1948
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,760
Rockin' Baja.

1949
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:40,600
Comic-Con.

1950
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,520
Right.

1951
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,560
These are my places of business.

1952
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,080
This is where I work.

1953
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,480
I work in these arenas.

1954
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,400
Like, oh, I'd love to, I'd love to come home.

1955
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,600
Your voice becomes that.

1956
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,840
You become a cigar chomper.

1957
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:55,520
Things are going all crazy at good boy grocers.

1958
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,880
No, no, I don't work there.

1959
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,720
It's, I take pictures under the sign.

1960
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:02,920
I sign autographs or podcast fans, you see.

1961
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:03,760
Yeah. Yeah.

1962
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,720
We get like one every six days.

1963
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,880
It's been a madhouse.

1964
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,040
Oh yeah.

1965
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,640
I'm getting swarmed here.

1966
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,920
The Disney photographer is annoyed

1967
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,440
cause we keep pulling them away from taking pictures

1968
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:17,280
of Goofy and we're like,

1969
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:20,000
can you take a picture of us under this sign?

1970
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:21,640
It's a thing on our show.

1971
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,600
It's Weet Say, but now it's up here now.

1972
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,440
Yeah.

1973
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,320
No, it's probably a coincidence,

1974
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:28,040
but it's more fun to think that they dropped it in there

1975
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,200
as a reference to us.

1976
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,360
Yeah.

1977
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:34,440
I do like also that the Toontown models looked cool.

1978
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,680
I also liked that a lot of the signs

1979
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,920
appear to be using the bad tea party font.

1980
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:43,080
Like it's just a little of that, like kind of kooky.

1981
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:43,920
A little twisted.

1982
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,760
A little twisted.

1983
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,680
The two, I'll say this Toontown, they're really,

1984
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:51,400
it feels like they're adding back in the sort of like

1985
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,200
little kid play areas, which I'm happy about.

1986
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,040
Yeah.

1987
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,080
It feels like there's going to be a lot of space

1988
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,280
for kids to run around.

1989
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,120
That was the point of it, I think.

1990
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:58,960
Yeah.

1991
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,720
To kind of reclaim all this space.

1992
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,560
Yeah.

1993
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:02,380
So that's good.

1994
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:03,220
Yeah.

1995
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:04,880
All that Toontown stuff will be nice.

1996
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,240
And I'm excited cause I get to, by the time that's open,

1997
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,280
I'm taking like a three year old there.

1998
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,120
Oh great.

1999
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:10,960
He's in the prime.

2000
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:11,800
Yeah.

2001
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:15,040
Am I going to force a six month old to try to do it?

2002
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:15,880
Yes.

2003
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,160
The answer is yes.

2004
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,320
Do you want to be at daddy's office or not?

2005
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,940
Runaway Railway is pretty smooth, Mike.

2006
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:25,320
So I don't know if you want to even print like,

2007
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,400
an eight month old on it.

2008
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,520
Some of that stuff in there.

2009
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,360
Yeah.

2010
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,200
Sure.

2011
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,400
They just, there's like a window that you have, I think,

2012
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,160
where like, because she's currently in the window

2013
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,840
where she just doesn't know what anything is.

2014
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:36,680
Yeah.

2015
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:40,120
But then if they, when they learn fear at all,

2016
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:43,560
because I've tried to do, I had one successful run at this,

2017
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,840
but my son, the second one was a lot less successful.

2018
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,400
We went on the oft broken pets ride.

2019
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,840
Not broken, like it's not running.

2020
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,320
They run it and it is broken.

2021
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,160
Right.

2022
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,460
Always slows down and stuffs.

2023
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:55,720
Which gave me a panic because like,

2024
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:59,400
he is really afraid of, as you might be,

2025
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,320
like the bar is coming down on you.

2026
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,160
Yeah, yeah.

2027
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:07,320
And he just does this very sad, like, no, no.

2028
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,040
And I'm like, uh oh, we got 10 minutes

2029
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,320
of this thing on you, buddy.

2030
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,040
Let's, look, there's a dog.

2031
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:13,880
Is a dog, you like dogs?

2032
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:14,700
There's dogs.

2033
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:17,420
You can be cool for 10, possibly 12 minutes

2034
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,140
if it breaks and it will.

2035
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:20,240
Yeah.

2036
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,860
Oh right, if you get stuck.

2037
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:22,700
Ooh.

2038
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:23,520
Yeah, yeah.

2039
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,360
That was a bit of a fear.

2040
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,180
We made it out okay.

2041
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,060
It was all right.

2042
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:28,040
But that's what Jason's onto something.

2043
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,980
You probably, you want to take her in the window

2044
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:32,860
before she understands what any objects are.

2045
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:33,700
Yeah.

2046
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:36,860
Because maybe you lose some rides from one and a half.

2047
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:38,060
Who knows?

2048
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,420
I'm not out of the window yet.

2049
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,420
But then I was afraid, I, when we went to Disney World

2050
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:45,740
for the first time, I was like five or six

2051
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:48,020
and my sister was three and she was fine on all the rides

2052
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:49,020
and I was scared.

2053
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:49,860
Yeah.

2054
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,840
So you never know.

2055
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,680
Yeah.

2056
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:53,500
How that's gonna work.

2057
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,580
Yeah, yeah.

2058
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:58,620
Your kid can be really wimpy at any age.

2059
01:11:58,620 --> 01:11:59,460
That's true.

2060
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:01,220
I can attest, you can attest.

2061
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:03,060
Sounds like Jason can't attest.

2062
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,380
No, we can't all be Jason.

2063
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:05,220
I'm a hero.

2064
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:11,180
I did, recently I was watching some old footage

2065
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:14,420
for something I was looking up for the show

2066
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:18,900
and I saw like shaky camera footage of a place

2067
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:21,820
that is like a very clear memory of my mind

2068
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:23,260
where I met Belle and the Beast

2069
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:26,860
and it was like high, very tall ceilings and stuff

2070
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:28,660
and it turned out to be like the entryway

2071
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:31,220
of the Soundstage restaurant.

2072
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:33,380
Yeah, I have a lot of hazy memories of the Sound.

2073
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:34,500
That's in Florida, you mean?

2074
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:39,500
Yeah, at MGM Studios and it was right by the stairs

2075
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:42,420
that would go to the short-lived catwalk bar.

2076
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,540
Where everything was upside down or something

2077
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:47,420
or there was like a bunch of bullshit up on the catwalk.

2078
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:49,780
Yeah, it was as if they built a bar

2079
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,220
and they're like up, you know,

2080
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:54,260
the lighting rigs and stuff of a Soundstage.

2081
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:57,620
That may have been a fully Aladdin overlaid restaurant

2082
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:59,700
for some, for an amount of time.

2083
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:00,940
I just remember, my trips,

2084
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:03,180
I remember we were there a lot, oddly.

2085
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:04,340
Yeah.

2086
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:05,620
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

2087
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:08,700
Someone did a big blog post about like the history

2088
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,500
of the short-lived catwalk bar

2089
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,740
and that was very fun to comb through.

2090
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,220
Well, episode coming.

2091
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:16,900
So yeah, so there will be a walk-around figment.

2092
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,940
Again, date to be determined,

2093
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:20,660
another one of these things where it's like,

2094
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:22,420
don't you have the puppet lying around?

2095
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:23,900
Isn't it just a person with a puppet?

2096
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,060
That's what Dreamfinder,

2097
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:27,420
the walk-around character used to be.

2098
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:30,380
So they did this whole big like,

2099
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:32,220
oh, you know that little character

2100
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:33,980
that y'all like so much from Epic?

2101
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:37,020
I feel like, yeah, we love the character.

2102
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:39,340
It's like, well, you'll get to take a picture

2103
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:40,340
with a puppet of it.

2104
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:43,100
Here's shots of merch of it

2105
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:46,420
that proves that it is financially viable

2106
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:47,500
to do something with it.

2107
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:48,340
Yes.

2108
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,900
Speaking of Epcot, another thing they announced,

2109
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:53,900
like for Disney's 100th anniversary,

2110
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:56,020
you've all been enjoying Harmonious?

2111
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:58,380
Well, we're putting something out

2112
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:01,900
and Jane was like, no, it just opened.

2113
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:02,900
Why are you closing it?

2114
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:05,700
You were the only people that gave it a good review,

2115
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:06,540
I think.

2116
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,060
I guess, but it was packed.

2117
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:09,860
And you can't really watch it was packed.

2118
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:12,020
But I think it was a problem from the start.

2119
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:13,500
I suppose, yeah.

2120
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,340
So yeah.

2121
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:16,100
This is where I have to, I'm like,

2122
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:17,780
the very first thing I think was,

2123
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:20,420
and we know that you love Happily Ever After,

2124
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:22,180
and that is why now it will be,

2125
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:23,980
and I'm looking at Twitter and Carly's like,

2126
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:25,580
Happily Ever After, and I'm like,

2127
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:27,140
I don't know what the fuck it is.

2128
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:29,620
I have no idea what's being, I'm sorry.

2129
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:31,300
If you haven't figured out by now,

2130
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:34,100
my interests are selective, all of ours are.

2131
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:35,300
I'm sorry, I don't know what it is.

2132
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:37,980
I'm happy everyone will be happy that there is more of it.

2133
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:39,780
Those shows and then the new one,

2134
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:41,420
Wonder, was it Wondrous?

2135
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:43,260
Wondrous Journeys.

2136
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:46,060
With the Hey Ho song, the Lumineers song.

2137
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:48,580
I'm begging for that Al Citty,

2138
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:50,180
paint the next song to come back.

2139
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:51,260
Begging for Al Citty.

2140
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:54,060
Look, I like, the Happily Ever After,

2141
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:55,740
like fine, I like some of that,

2142
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:56,860
I like watching those things.

2143
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:59,900
I'm not particularly like enamored with that.

2144
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,940
I do like a Mickey's Mix Magic,

2145
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:04,500
which is different than those shows,

2146
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:08,100
which are very much like what you expect with Disney.

2147
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:11,500
And then the Hopes are on the wings of dreams.

2148
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:12,820
And that's what it's like.

2149
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:17,140
It's all that same nonsense, empty stuff.

2150
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:19,660
And then, you know, songs and fireworks, which are cool.

2151
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:21,420
And the projections are cool.

2152
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:24,620
But for me, I like the stuff that's a little otter,

2153
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:27,340
like Mickey's Mix Magic, that's a lot weirder.

2154
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:30,140
It's a little more of a party on Main Street.

2155
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:31,220
Havant Gard.

2156
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:32,900
Havant Gard, Mad Tea Party.

2157
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:38,740
So yeah, I can't keep track of some of that stuff either.

2158
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,620
But yeah, there was a lot of that

2159
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,980
where I kind of glaze over and go, okay, sure.

2160
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,620
What else did we miss though?

2161
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:45,820
What was the other big one?

2162
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:47,180
Or did we just say it somehow?

2163
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:49,620
Oh, no, Absence of Tomorrowland.

2164
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:50,460
Well, yeah, of course.

2165
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:52,340
There have been a lot of rumblings.

2166
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,740
That's the football, Lucy, the football here,

2167
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:57,340
where it's like, that was three years ago,

2168
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,540
I remember everybody going,

2169
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:00,100
and they're gonna do the tomorrow,

2170
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:01,020
that's gonna be the thing.

2171
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:04,620
They're gonna say, finally, Tomorrowland redo, no.

2172
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:07,540
And that ain't happening for Disney,

2173
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:10,780
like 70th anniversary of Disneyland's coming quick.

2174
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:13,380
Nothing's gonna happen except for, I guess,

2175
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:17,300
we'll have Runaway Railway and the Tiana ride.

2176
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,260
Yeah, things we know about.

2177
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:22,180
But yeah, Tomorrowland, they gotta start that now

2178
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:23,340
if they were gonna do it for that.

2179
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:25,460
And they are not, it is not happening.

2180
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:27,300
Yeah, hey, exciting year or two

2181
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:28,660
coming up for us out in California.

2182
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:31,780
We get Nintendo and we get Runaway Railway.

2183
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:32,620
It's fun for us.

2184
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:34,300
Sure, yeah, sure.

2185
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:35,140
That'll be fine.

2186
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:38,940
All right, so I guess there's stuff to look forward to.

2187
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:42,700
And there is, there are good things.

2188
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:45,620
It's just, we just want a little more.

2189
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:48,060
We just wanted it to get pushed a little bit.

2190
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:51,060
But let's not dwell on that.

2191
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:55,260
Let's be positive and let's honor some greats

2192
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:58,460
because we haven't gotten to do this in a minute.

2193
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:01,780
And I know people are similar to that.

2194
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,980
People are trembling with anticipation

2195
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:08,980
of who will be named the 2022 PTR legends.

2196
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:10,660
Does anybody wanna go first?

2197
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,180
I'm gonna propose maybe I go last

2198
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:16,380
because mine, like tomorrow's presentation,

2199
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:17,380
mine involves a song.

2200
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:18,660
I think you gotta close out on a song.

2201
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:19,620
Of course, yes.

2202
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:21,900
Well, I will go first.

2203
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:24,980
Although I think my choice is a bit of a dark horse candidate.

2204
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:25,820
Great.

2205
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:28,700
And I'm sure people might have been expecting

2206
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:32,020
when we were teasing this that I would select a treat.

2207
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:35,700
But for the first and maybe last time in my life,

2208
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:38,260
I've picked something relatively healthy.

2209
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:40,900
And I'm of course referring to the humble

2210
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,100
Cuties brand mandarin oranges.

2211
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:49,340
Recently, a recent replacement of the disgusting apples

2212
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:53,220
with no skin on them in a wasteful plastic bag.

2213
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:56,460
Cuties brand oranges have shot to the top

2214
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:00,140
of your obligatory side choice

2215
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:03,060
when ordering advanced ordering on the app.

2216
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:07,020
But for PTR listeners who may well remember

2217
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,540
these Cuties brand oranges,

2218
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:12,220
probably the only things that kept us from keeling over

2219
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:13,900
during our hot dog hullabaloo,

2220
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:17,660
like a pirate or sailor warding off scurvy,

2221
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:19,780
chomping into a bitter lime.

2222
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:21,380
We of course spent the day

2223
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:26,260
supping upon the delicious Cuties brand mandarin oranges.

2224
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:28,300
And they were a delightful treat

2225
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:30,580
and gave us some actual nutrients

2226
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:34,580
in between bacon and cheese covered hot dogs.

2227
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:36,380
The tiniest items,

2228
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:39,780
like as healthy as they might be,

2229
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:43,340
which might be, they might be like paper and water

2230
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,700
for all I know.

2231
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,500
But even if they were extremely healthy,

2232
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:50,260
the smallest amount of healthiness you could get.

2233
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:51,220
Yes.

2234
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,140
And also get prevented,

2235
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:55,780
I'm sure it's prevented someone from getting scurvy.

2236
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:56,780
Yeah.

2237
01:18:56,780 --> 01:18:57,620
So, no.

2238
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:58,460
Could have been us.

2239
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:01,100
I don't know what's in all of those hot dogs,

2240
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,580
but there could have been the materials

2241
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,740
for us to get scurvy.

2242
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,140
I wouldn't put it past whatever they're made of.

2243
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:12,140
So you Jason, officially induct PTR legend Cuties.

2244
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:13,820
Cuties brand mandarin oranges.

2245
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,020
You know, I thought about doing the fishnet,

2246
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:19,060
but it's a more recent obsession.

2247
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:19,900
And I thought like.

2248
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:20,740
Give it time to linger.

2249
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:23,620
Give it time to linger in my mind.

2250
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:26,700
And some pictures of me with different glasses

2251
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:29,340
and different haircuts and different Phillies caps,

2252
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,380
you know, allow some time to pass.

2253
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:32,380
Well, that's beautiful.

2254
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:34,380
Wow. Congratulations to Cuties.

2255
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:35,220
You made it.

2256
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:36,100
PTR legend.

2257
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:38,580
Not the movie Cuties, the orange.

2258
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:41,420
Just want to clarify.

2259
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:42,260
Sure.

2260
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:43,700
But you never know what mine is.

2261
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:44,780
That's a good point.

2262
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,100
Now I won't, okay.

2263
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:48,900
I'll do mine now and I don't want to step.

2264
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:51,940
Hopefully yours is not going to step in any way on mine

2265
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:53,340
because mine is a little, I don't know.

2266
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:55,340
It's a little bit outside the box.

2267
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:59,460
I would like to induct into the PTR legends hall.

2268
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:00,540
Hall of legendary.

2269
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:01,780
Hall of legendary.

2270
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:06,380
Any hard to get guest that we've been wanting

2271
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:07,940
on the show for many years.

2272
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:08,820
Ah.

2273
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:12,820
This is a blanket PTR legend status

2274
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:15,980
that can apply to Michael Eisner, Jay Leno

2275
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:18,780
or anyone else that we've for long, many years said,

2276
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:21,020
we've got to get so and so on the show.

2277
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:21,860
Breck Eisner.

2278
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:22,700
Breck Eisner.

2279
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:23,980
PTR legend.

2280
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:27,540
So this extends to anyone that we have said over and over again

2281
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:30,740
we need to get on the show because we would like to trick them

2282
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:34,580
into coming on with an honor because people love being honored.

2283
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:35,420
Yeah.

2284
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:36,260
Yes.

2285
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:38,180
So this can, and there were probably people we've forgotten

2286
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:39,460
that we've said we wanted on the show.

2287
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,860
We've done this dumb podcast so long.

2288
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:45,500
Who knows what we said, but they are a PTR legend as well.

2289
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,580
So we can apply this blanket.

2290
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:49,420
This is like one of those blanket pardons

2291
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:50,460
that people were looking for.

2292
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,420
I don't know why we've talked about Trump today for so much,

2293
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:53,260
but this is one of those,

2294
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:56,180
a lot of his cronies were looking for like blanket pardons.

2295
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:59,900
This is a blanket PTR legend status applied

2296
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:03,500
to anyone that seems hard to get that could be swayed

2297
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:06,220
with some sort of a status, some sort of a title,

2298
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:07,300
some sort of an award.

2299
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,140
Yeah.

2300
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:09,860
The visual representation of this

2301
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:12,420
can just be that silhouette on websites

2302
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:14,700
when they don't have a person's picture to use.

2303
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:17,540
They just use that black and a lime.

2304
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,860
I'm using my induction for, as a bribe.

2305
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:21,700
Sure.

2306
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:25,780
And you know, we run the PTR hall of legendary

2307
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:29,220
and it's not dictated by,

2308
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:32,380
it's not governed by any other sort of entity.

2309
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:35,740
So it's legal if we say it is.

2310
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:36,700
That's exactly right.

2311
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:37,540
Yeah.

2312
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:38,380
So there you go.

2313
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:39,220
Great.

2314
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:41,020
So, you know, take some of that,

2315
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:43,260
just edit out the part where we said it's a trick.

2316
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:46,580
If there's somebody you think you have a connection to,

2317
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:51,340
we want you to come get this very legitimate honor.

2318
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:52,180
That's right.

2319
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:53,100
We can promise you a banquet,

2320
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:58,100
which may or may not have Cuties brand Mandarin oranges.

2321
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:03,180
Also among the PTR legends that you will join.

2322
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:07,260
It's funny, I guess Cuties could be the contents

2323
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:09,740
of the orange box ghosts.

2324
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:10,660
Yeah.

2325
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:11,500
Wow.

2326
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,340
That's great.

2327
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,580
Great tie in.

2328
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:14,820
Well, that's what you've talked,

2329
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:18,740
you were talking about how you want like a legend to their,

2330
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:21,700
well, we just went and tied up that plot, didn't we?

2331
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:24,060
You want Florida to get their own legend.

2332
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:25,700
Cuties are now a legend.

2333
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:29,020
So a guy selling a box full of Cuties.

2334
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:29,860
That's correct.

2335
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:30,700
Little Lado heads.

2336
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:34,020
One Lado head becomes lots of little Lado heads.

2337
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:34,860
Lado?

2338
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:37,100
Is it Jerry Lado?

2339
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:37,940
Oh, is it Lado?

2340
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:38,780
Oh yeah.

2341
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:39,600
Oh, okay. Excuse me.

2342
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:40,500
Oh, well, Lado.

2343
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:41,340
Oh, okay.

2344
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:42,340
Lado.

2345
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:43,180
All right.

2346
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:46,660
So Inductees, Cuties and you, like you said,

2347
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:49,780
but not, it's not all of you.

2348
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:50,620
Not all of you.

2349
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:51,540
No, no.

2350
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:53,420
But that's saying if any of the people I just mentioned

2351
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:54,260
are listening.

2352
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:55,820
Then it is you.

2353
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:56,660
Yeah.

2354
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:57,500
Yeah.

2355
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,780
And if so otherwise it's not you.

2356
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:02,820
And if you are an accidental PTR legend who was hoping

2357
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:06,220
this would be the year that you became a purposeful PTR legend,

2358
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,060
this is not your year.

2359
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:08,100
No, not happening.

2360
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,500
Look to the future for any change on that,

2361
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,180
much like the panel.

2362
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:15,900
Okay.

2363
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:20,380
So, you know, I think we can all agree that music

2364
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:23,340
is the magic passport that we stamp when we land

2365
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:26,540
from a flight in a place called Disney Magic.

2366
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:30,180
And there is one musician synonymous with Disney

2367
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:33,540
whose music transports us to a whole new world.

2368
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:36,580
His songs are as fun as a trip under the sea

2369
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:39,260
and he paints musical pictures more evocative

2370
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:41,380
than the colors of the wind.

2371
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:45,220
Sir, your music allows us to be part of your world.

2372
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:48,180
And so we invite you to be our guest

2373
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:50,260
in the hall of PTR legends.

2374
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:52,940
I'm talking of course about J Bigga.

2375
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:55,740
J Bigga, this is your year.

2376
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:57,580
It had to be 2022.

2377
01:23:57,580 --> 01:24:01,140
You kicked off the year, J Bigga.

2378
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:05,260
And ever since a censored cover of one of your songs

2379
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:07,700
played in that one Incredibles ice show,

2380
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:09,660
your music has captured the hearts

2381
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:12,500
of some of the hosts of this podcast.

2382
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,620
Your songs make us want to go the distance

2383
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:18,420
and kiss the girl on her pink chocolate.

2384
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:24,340
So what better way to pay tribute to a great artist

2385
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:28,340
and now a PTR legend than to play a different J Bigga song

2386
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:31,340
that was not played the last time that this came up?

2387
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:32,180
Great.

2388
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:35,740
And so here now from the album Laced Me Up,

2389
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:37,740
as all his other classics were,

2390
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:41,660
is a stirring anthem about giving a lot of notes

2391
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:44,580
to a beautiful woman who is trying to fuck you.

2392
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:45,420
Oh wow.

2393
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:47,580
The song is called Use Your Tongue.

2394
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:52,580
And here it is from non-accidental PTR legend, J Bigga.

2395
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:58,460
I wish I could say

2396
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:01,580
You always use your tongue

2397
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:04,220
Cause that's what I'm all about

2398
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:06,620
But you're doing me wrong

2399
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:08,980
Now you don't know how to do it

2400
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:11,460
My instructions were clear

2401
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:13,540
Don't you care

2402
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:15,220
I just want you to

2403
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:17,860
He gave instructions and she's not following.

2404
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:19,460
I just want you to

2405
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:21,260
Don't you care

2406
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:22,620
I just want you to

2407
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:23,460
More chorus.

2408
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:25,180
We can all sing if you want.

2409
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:26,740
Just want your tongue

2410
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:31,100
I just want your tongue

2411
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:32,740
Use your tongue

2412
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:35,620
I'm not down with your technique

2413
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:38,420
It ain't kicking, it's a matter of bigger

2414
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:40,460
Tongue is the problem, girl

2415
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:42,860
It ain't making, I'm a do-me-do

2416
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:44,620
Sexuality

2417
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:47,460
I'm not too self-aware of it in a way.

2418
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:50,420
Yeah, it might be a little bit.

2419
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:52,100
But it's, you know, that's, I think,

2420
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:54,900
haven't we all been in that position where

2421
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,780
the day worked out great for me,

2422
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:58,780
a beautiful woman is having sex with me,

2423
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:01,980
but she's not doing any of the specific instructions

2424
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:03,220
that I gave.

2425
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:05,020
Let me clarify this through music.

2426
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:08,060
And worst of all, my beat machine is broken.

2427
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:10,140
It's slowly dying.

2428
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:11,740
It's sputtering out.

2429
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:12,700
Sputtering out.

2430
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,500
Well, he fights through it and he makes music anyway

2431
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:19,100
and his resilience, that's why we salute you, J Bigga,

2432
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:24,100
as do we cuties and open-ended high status possible guests.

2433
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,140
Well, what a closer.

2434
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:30,940
And I'm just so happy that we could do this again

2435
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:32,660
and we're all in this together.

2436
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:36,900
And we're not doing any more rides for the rest of the year.

2437
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:37,740
Okay, so,

2438
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,140

2447
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:01,500
and I think it's just a few days from this,

2448
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:04,340
the good boys, not the grocery good boys,

2449
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:08,220
but us, the good boys, all appearing on Blank Check

2450
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:09,580
with Griffin and David,

2451
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:15,180
with continuing to be accidental PTR legend Griffin Newman,

2452
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:17,420
talking Pinocchio, that comes out very soon.

2453
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:21,540
So there's a little bit of bonus,

2454
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,020
we're going to another podcast,

2455
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:24,580
that's as exciting as the Disney,

2456
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:27,980
it's not the treasure,

2457
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:29,820
the Disney boat that's going to Australia.

2458
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:30,820
It is the treasure.

2459
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:32,260
No, the treasure's not built yet.

2460
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:33,100
The treasure's not built yet,

2461
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:36,540
no, a currently existing boat is going to Australia.

2462
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:39,220
