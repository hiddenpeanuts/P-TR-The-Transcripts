1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,860
Alright, we're high rolling here on Club 3 Sin City style, the VIP lounge with my boys

2
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,320
Mike and Jason.

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,520
Hell yeah, what's up?

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,520
What's up, you guys?

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,420
What boys do is elongate H's.

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,920
Yeah, Jason, my man.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,320
What the fuck is up?

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,520
Hey, what's up, brother?

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,820
Hell is happening.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,520
Hey.

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,420
Are you rising and grinding like always?

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,720
I'm rising and grinding.

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,220
I am ruined.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,720
I bet everything on the...

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,020
I bet everything on black and it landed on red.

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,220
Oh gosh, story of my life, bro.

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:53,920
Yeah.

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,420
That's what I do every day.

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,120
I lose all my money.

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,620
This is such realistic, you know, like with this AI battle that's going on, you need human

21
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,620
dialogue to feel lived in and real.

22
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:12,420
And you think an AI could spit out accurate casino VIP lounge dialogue like that?

23
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,620
Absolutely not.

24
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,220
That's right.

25
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,220
Yeah, this is just like authentic man talk and it feels good, doesn't it?

26
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:19,820
Yeah, it does.

27
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,320
To finally talk like men.

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,220
Absolutely.

29
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,920
Yeah.

30
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,820
It's good on the club three is where when we can do it.

31
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,120
That's what's behind the paywall.

32
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,320
Our guest is perplexed.

33
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,020
Fairly.

34
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,420
Girls come in with cookies and lemonade.

35
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,420
So many boys.

36
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,620
No, you can do man talk with us.

37
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,620
Don't ruin our man talk time.

38
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,320
Time to put our asses in place.

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,520
Mom's in the clubhouse.

40
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:54,320
Okay, I get you can stay just for an hour and a half, but only if we talk about the MGM

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,920
Grand Wizard of Oz walkthrough.

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,520
Okay.

43
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,120
Okay.

44
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,220
Hey, that is the voice of our guest of the Rare Club 3 guest.

45
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:03,520
Yeah.

46
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,920
And so happy to have her.

47
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,120
She is the designer of all of our logos.

48
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,120
But importantly at this point in time, the very snazzy Sin City Knights logo.

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
Thank you for that.

50
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,820
I love it.

51
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,020
Aaron Gardner is here.

52
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,420
Hi.

53
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,120
Hi, I'm so happy to be here.

54
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,420
Thank you for letting me crash the clubhouse for real.

55
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,820
Even though I live in the clubhouse.

56
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,220
Yes, but sometimes, but this is a section of the clubhouse where sometimes you have to

57
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,320
go busy yourself and you know, get a little laundry done while the boys do their thing.

58
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,520
As women do.

59
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,420
But you're, but you look, it's you're good for more than laundry.

60
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,620
Let's make that clear.

61
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,520
One or two things.

62
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,220
Credibility we're providing you.

63
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,920
You're being on this episode is because of well, where the Club 3 die landed.

64
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,920
Thanks to our listeners.

65
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,020
This was a tight battle.

66
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,520
This is a really close race.

67
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,820
One of the closest that we've had.

68
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,920
You know, it's one of those anybody wins no matter what because the two main

69
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,220
competitors became 90s built animatronic shows at casinos.

70
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,920
So you can't go wrong either way.

71
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,620
Fall of Atlantis at Caesar's Forum shops ultimately fell to I'll read

72
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,820
Benjamin T's description of it.

73
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,120
The Wizard of Oz theming at the MGM Grand Casino in Las Vegas in the early 90s,

74
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,620
including a walkthrough attraction featuring the Oz characters and animatronics.

75
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,020
This was also suggested by Ryan Schieffer who said some of that stuff and added and

76
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,020
ended with a magic show inside the gates of Oz.

77
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,120
All sounds great.

78
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:57,620
And then and mainly as we're seeing like, okay, MGM Grand peripheral nonsense.

79
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:03,320
I thought well, I know an MGM Grand super fan of fans specifically of the

80
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,520
peripheral nonsense and that is you Erin.

81
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
Absolutely.

82
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,120
I've been I actually tried to do a count.

83
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:17,120
I wasn't totally successful, but I've stayed at the MGM Grand since 1997 at

84
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,620
least 15 times.

85
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,220
Wow.

86
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,220
And I've been to Las Vegas in general.

87
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,520
The count is either 23 or 24 times.

88
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,520
I've been many, many, many super fan.

89
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,920
You're like better than Gabris.

90
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,620
Thank you.

91
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,420
Highlighter.

92
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,220
Spoiler guest spoiler.

93
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,420
Oh yeah.

94
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:38,920
Shit.

95
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,320
I've done this already on the show.

96
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,120
I was to say he's a guest.

97
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,420
Maybe he I don't know.

98
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,420
That's just something we talked about him in general.

99
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,920
Yeah, I was just thinking a lot of a guy.

100
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,820
I know goes to Vegas and I was just thinking better than him.

101
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,020
Yeah, you are coming to Vegas with us.

102
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,320
So this will be the probably my 25th time.

103
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:54,920
Wow.

104
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,620
Probably.

105
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,320
What an achievement.

106
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,120
I didn't know it was like round anniversary number.

107
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,020
That's so great.

108
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,220
And those stats are very impressive.

109
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:08,020
Even though there's been a big break in that because of I haven't been in four

110
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,420
years.

111
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,220
We went with 2019.

112
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:16,120
Yeah, this pandemic and kid era has slowed down the Vegas going and I'm so

113
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,120
happy that you're you're doing it again and joining us and breaking the

114
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,520
streak.

115
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,420
Can I ask some general Vegas questions because you've been so many times like

116
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,420
do you have a top trip that you've gone on?

117
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,320
Is there a top show?

118
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,920
Like what are your faves and faves?

119
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,320
Yeah.

120
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,220
Scott and I in 2016.

121
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,820
It was I think it was New Year's 2016.

122
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,520
We did a trip called Divas weekend.

123
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,120
Yeah, where we saw was that when we saw Britney Spears and Olivia Newton,

124
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,420
John.

125
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,920
Yes, it was fantastic.

126
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,020
That was one of my favorites and same show.

127
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,720
No, we saw them two separate nights.

128
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,220
I would love to see it go out between the two of them.

129
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,720
Unfortunately, we can't do that anymore.

130
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,020
Yeah.

131
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,320
All right.

132
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,520
Pete.

133
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,220
I'm so happy.

134
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:56,620
We saw her.

135
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,320
She was incredible.

136
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,620
Yeah.

137
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,120
Yeah, that was a delightful show and you wonder as you head into that.

138
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,520
Are we going to shy away from Xanadu?

139
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,720
And then when we're going to lean in.

140
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,820
Yeah, biggest wind up of where you're going to live in Xanadu for a little bit.

141
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,420
I was we were we were literally in Xanadu.

142
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,620
It was wonderful.

143
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,520
And Britney was amazing too.

144
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,020
Yeah.

145
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,420
What a hell of a show.

146
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,120
That was great.

147
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,720
So good.

148
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,220
And then we did Divas weekend to the next year or the year after I forget.

149
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,020
We maybe like broke the definition of diva a little bit because we see them.

150
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,020
That was Katy Perry with opening act Carly Rae Jepsen.

151
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,820
All right.

152
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,620
And then David Copperfield.

153
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,920
The biggest diva of them all.

154
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,720
Oh, yeah.

155
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,820
Counts right.

156
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,620
Absolutely.

157
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:48,220
So yeah, that was probably my favorite show trip that we saw.

158
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,120
But so many of the trips blend together because I've been so many times.

159
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,420
And starting from when you were a kid with the family to family.

160
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:01,120
So growing up my family did two vacations, Las Vegas and Hawaii.

161
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,920
Once we went to New York, once we went to Orlando and once we went to Tahoe.

162
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,720
But other than that, my entire life, Las Vegas and Hawaii.

163
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,420
The end.

164
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,420
Not bad places to go.

165
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,920
But my dad's a real creature of habit.

166
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,920
So it was like, but we know we like Las Vegas.

167
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
We know we like Hawaii.

168
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,420
Why would we go anywhere else?

169
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:19,720
Right.

170
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,320
You know, great places, great vacation destinations, very a lot of stuff to do.

171
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,520
You can do different trips every time, especially in a city like Las Vegas that morphs every year you go.

172
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:30,920
Yes.

173
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,020
It never looks the same two years in a row.

174
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,420
Yeah.

175
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,820
I mean, I've always heard Los Angeles is a city.

176
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,920
That's constantly destroying itself and rebuilding itself.

177
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,020
But Vegas even more so.

178
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,520
Oh, yeah, it's amped up.

179
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,920
It's exponential.

180
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,720
And it's like Los Angeles, true.

181
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:54,120
But sometimes that'll be something that has been around for more than three years as opposed to like the Vegas.

182
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,120
The turnaround is nuts, including what we're talking about today.

183
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,620
Yeah.

184
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,120
Yeah.

185
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,920
And unfortunately, my first visit to the MGM Grand was 1997.

186
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,120
So I did miss a lot of the things that technically, you know, we're supposed to be talking about today.

187
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,320
But there were still remnants of Oz the first couple of years that I was there.

188
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,820
Okay.

189
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,220
Yeah, that was sort of the thought as we were talking about because we okay.

190
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:21,120
Main feed was MGM Grand Adventures, which I've been to many times and for a while I thought,

191
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,020
oh, that would be a great thing for me to talk about.

192
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,320
But I don't know.

193
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,520
I my memories aren't as strong from the theme park itself because it's kind of boring.

194
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,620
Honestly.

195
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,520
Yeah, this is what we figured out as we were talking about.

196
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,820
Like, was that something you want to talk about?

197
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,020
And then it became like, well, yeah, it's what people say on lies.

198
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,820
We're doing that episode.

199
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,920
It seemed like that thing looms so large and then people sort of, yeah, I don't know.

200
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,720
I don't remember this.

201
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,320
I don't remember that.

202
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,620
Yeah.

203
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,720
And also the other thing we're having when we're talking about it is I would bring up.

204
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,520
Well, yeah, did you ever do that that ride where you go deep under the earth?

205
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,020
No.

206
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,120
What the hell are you talking about?

207
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,620
Yeah.

208
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,420
Did you ever do the ride where it's like a it's a back clock tour, but it's a river and then a creature jumps.

209
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,120
Yes, because and I don't think you realized until we were doing this timeline math that you were there.

210
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,320
The first time you were there was post the 40% blow up of that park.

211
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,620
Right.

212
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,620
You only did these 60% of what it was.

213
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,920
Let me ask though.

214
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,320
I feel like we were maybe a little hard on the putt.

215
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,920
Did we did we miss anything?

216
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,420
Was there anything that you could speak to that you would rep in terms of MGM Grand?

217
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,220
The bumper cars.

218
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
We didn't talk about the bumper.

219
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,920
We did not talk about that.

220
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,320
Totally unmentioned actually.

221
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,520
Oh, the bumper cars were part of a it was like a European area.

222
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:38,920
Yeah.

223
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,920
By theming, I mean very lightly themed, but the bumper cars was like Parisian.

224
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,120
It was like a Parisian taxi, I think.

225
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,320
So there was a bunch of like I liked it because I was a Francophile when I was a teenager.

226
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:58,320
So like and I was like the French Club, but you know, like like ooh la la like like little Lisa Simpson.

227
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,720
You recognize the words that were painted in cursive on the wall?

228
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,020
I knew the mild French swears that were on the wall with people bumping into each other.

229
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,120
Oh, is that what it was?

230
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,520
Yeah.

231
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,120
It's what road rage would be.

232
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,920
Yeah, really mild though.

233
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,520
Yeah.

234
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,720
So, you know, I really enjoyed the bumper cars.

235
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,320
I thought that they were well done.

236
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,420
You also wait, it's in a plastic bag on our table under some other books.

237
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,220
You had a couple of pictures from this trip.

238
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:34,520
You had a really weird one that was like there was some attraction we definitely missed which was just by attraction.

239
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,420
I mean to like water wars.

240
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,820
Yeah, what was it?

241
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:49,120
Okay, there were two kiosks that were like there was like a walkway and two like wooden like lemonade stands with like a roof basically.

242
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:57,020
And they gave you a bucket of water balloons and there was a little hole in the ceiling and you launched water balloons out of your bucket through a little hole in the roof.

243
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,220
To get the people on the other side and it was called water wars.

244
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,020
Wow, really?

245
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,320
So there was a essentially like a summer camp activity.

246
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,620
The whole place felt very summer camp.

247
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,920
Especially I was the right age for it and it was the place that you know, my parents would dump us for the day.

248
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:21,320
Well, yeah, that's the question because we were wondering and we were talking about like, you know, what do kids do?

249
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,220
Like is Vegas a viable destination for kids today?

250
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,720
In the 90s, yes.

251
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,220
Sure.

252
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,520
Now probably not.

253
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,220
No, maybe not.

254
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,320
Yeah, I don't know what you do.

255
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,020
But yeah, you started going in this age where you couldn't drink.

256
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,320
You couldn't gamble.

257
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:43,320
So you did like is that where the MGM Grand fondness comes from because you I don't know if you're skeptical when you were a kid.

258
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,020
What am I going to do all day?

259
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,320
And then you did a thousand things.

260
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,920
I think the first trip erased that fear if I had it at all just because well, actually I should back up.

261
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
My first trip to Vegas was in 1996.

262
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,020
I was 12 years old and I went with my friend whose grandparents lived in Las Vegas.

263
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:06,820
Okay, so I went and stayed in an old couple's house in Henderson for a couple of nights and it was awkward.

264
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,120
I don't like being a house guest.

265
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:17,420
So it was awkward and all we did we went to the strip once to go to a buffet like, you know, 499, you know, Shrimp and Steak Buffet.

266
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,420
And we did go to the Grand Canyon.

267
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,020
What's adventure dome?

268
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,520
What that?

269
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,620
Oh, yes, it's adventure dome today.

270
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,520
But I love that.

271
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:38,720
Yeah, wait, it used to be could you guys know that that is that adventure dome in circus circus the creepily pink tinted theme park was once called Grand Canyon Grand Slam Canyon.

272
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,420
I didn't know that the dumbest 90s name ever.

273
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,520
So I did go there.

274
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,020
So I knew that there were glimmers of kid things, but I knew we weren't going to be staying anywhere near there.

275
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,820
Right.

276
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,720
So that's true.

277
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,820
You don't like being a house guest, which is what you I don't know if you clocked that we did not.

278
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:01,120
I forget if you offered or not, but we did not stay in your parents house in Schomburg when we came to visit Schomburg Jason did.

279
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,620
Oh, I did.

280
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,120
Jason did.

281
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
Jason insisted.

282
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,620
He slept like a baby.

283
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,920
Yeah, he would not have it any other way.

284
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,620
This has no problem with mom coming in with snacks.

285
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,120
He was a little disappointed in the service, quite frankly, for my mother.

286
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,420
He was expecting that a little more on the clock.

287
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,320
Look, I still left a good Yelp review, but I mean it was specific and I had some qualms.

288
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:34,820
But so that's the that's the first trip with friends, grandparents, and then you start doing these constant trips with your folks.

289
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,720
Annual.

290
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,120
Yeah.

291
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,720
And we always stayed at the MGM Grand.

292
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:45,920
So is that just like it's it's a comfort zone for them for your dad, I guess.

293
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,720
Just like shout, shall we delve into the privilege of my upbringing?

294
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,420
I guess that's good of you to get to get ahead of it to.

295
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,920
I don't know how crazy.

296
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,020
Look, it's Club 3.

297
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,220
I feel like maybe the listeners will be a little won't be too hard on me.

298
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,020
VIP to the high roller tier.

299
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,520
Let's talk about how you rolled.

300
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,920
Pretty high.

301
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:15,120
So I grew up in an entertainment industry family and my dad got comped rooms at the MGM Grand because of his job.

302
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,220
You know, friends at MGM, which involved the show West Convention, if any, but right.

303
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,420
Is that is that the right thing?

304
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,620
Yeah, I think it's called CinemaCon for anybody else.

305
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:31,020
You read Entertainment Weekly or Premiere magazine in the nineties like me and knew what these only I could go to show West.

306
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,620
I think show us was pretty boring.

307
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,520
They'd show like the heater for Batman and Robin.

308
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,920
You think my dad cared about that?

309
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,620
I mean, it was wasted on him.

310
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,520
Why weren't more kids allowed to go to show West?

311
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,320
I've heard you talk about this before and it is not the you're not a Zaslav.

312
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,920
You know, you know, you know, kind of a more logistical.

313
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:08,020
Yeah, I understand the privilege is relative, but like I did have many, many bizarre privileges growing up that I didn't think were strange at the time.

314
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:17,320
But now that I'm an adult and I could look back and be like, jeez Louise, like I went to so many movie premieres like the movie premieres are nuts.

315
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,420
You were at the you were at the premiere.

316
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,720
I'm sorry. Is this correct of all three mummies?

317
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Really?

318
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,520
Wow. Even Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.

319
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,620
I was in that one.

320
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:34,420
That's straddles the yeah, what you're you're a young teen and then we're we're dating by Dragon Emperor.

321
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,820
Yeah, we so he had snuck down to the tram area.

322
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,420
Just like the first time we hung out.

323
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,920
This is my only move.

324
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,020
Sneak into the tram.

325
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,120
I have a place.

326
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,020
It's important to have a move.

327
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,220
Yeah, going and seeing it.

328
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:56,120
Well, like, yeah, I don't know if you're into this, but like if you want to see a Billy Bush standee, I can hook you up.

329
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,720
Nancy Odell, too.

330
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:05,620
This is the shop where they have last season's merchandise and it's a little markdown on top of my employee desk.

331
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,020
We're talking 12 percent.

332
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:17,520
Anyways, anyway, so point is that was one of the reasons that we went to Las Vegas every year and stayed at the MGM Grand every year because the whole trip was comped.

333
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,920
I'm talking food, too.

334
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,620
And like the phase and pay-per-view movies.

335
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:31,520
So like I would we would watch my sister and I each got to take a friend and the four of us would share a room and my parents would have their own room.

336
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:40,920
And at night, my parents would go down to gamble and set us up with, you know, pizza and Sundays and like all the room service that we wanted.

337
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,720
And we would just watch every pay-per-view movie.

338
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,020
Oh, wow.

339
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,420
Do you have is there a strong memory of one of those?

340
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,020
Yes, actually one pay-per-view movie.

341
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,520
Have you ever heard of the movie A Feast at Midnight?

342
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,220
Stumped?

343
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,820
No, I think we're all stumped.

344
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,720
Okay.

345
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,820
It was it was a British movie.

346
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,320
This was Bottom of the Barrel.

347
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,620
We had already watched like Meet the Deedles and like whatever else was out there.

348
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:12,820
All the movies you've heard of we watched and then we were like, what's a feast at midnight?

349
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:28,720
And it's a really boring film about a boarding school where like a hot teacher comes in and all the boys are like that she rocks their worlds because she's slightly younger than like your traditional headmistress.

350
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,220
That's my memory of it.

351
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,420
Who was in it?

352
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,320
No idea.

353
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,720
Christopher Lee.

354
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,520
Really?

355
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,220
Legendary.

356
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,620
He acted.

357
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:44,420
It's notable for being the feature film debut of future conservative politician Michael Gove as the chaplain.

358
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,820
Oh, all right.

359
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,920
Early Michael Gove work.

360
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,520
I think you gotta be a real Brit to know.

361
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,220
I don't know about Michael Gove.

362
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,920
So you remember liking this movie a lot?

363
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
Not so much.

364
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:07,020
There was one part of the movie that my sister and I quoted for a long time, which is like all the boys are like really like gently talking about being horny.

365
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:18,320
And when they're referring to the teacher, it's like a Wayne's World one-off where they go, show Wang, show Wang.

366
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,920
And that's like my only memory of a feast at midnight.

367
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,320
I've never revisited this film.

368
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,820
We watched it like three times.

369
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,120
We were in Vegas.

370
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,120
Wait, you haven't shot a take yet.

371
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,520
Have you?

372
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,720
We just got the we just got the facts from Paramount Pictures.

373
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,320
Do not say swing.

374
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,320
Whatever you do.

375
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,320
Show Wang.

376
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,120
Show Wang.

377
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,720
We can't.

378
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,320
We have to.

379
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,920
Sorry.

380
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,520
We have to say, do I make you angry, baby?

381
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,620
It's copier.

382
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,720
Fucking Myers.

383
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
Locks it all down.

384
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:56,420
Empire magazine said of this film, nothing about it suggests that it should have been made for the big screen.

385
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,020
So modest is its scope.

386
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,520
Oh, wow.

387
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,220
It's a damning thing.

388
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,420
Nice way of saying boring and that's accurate.

389
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:12,120
You got to live it up such that you would like that you're scraping the bottom of the British barrel of pay-per-view movies.

390
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,320
Well, no wonder.

391
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,920
Okay, so that's a big that's a huge aspect of loving MGM Grand.

392
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,120
But then you and theme park still open smaller, but still open so you can go have some fun there.

393
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:31,420
But like, okay, I think you know, because I started getting in on the I've stayed at the MGM Grand with you a bunch too.

394
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,320
And I think slowly we've watched the transition into like today.

395
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,620
There's a lot of generic stuff there.

396
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,320
Now.

397
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:47,520
It's a lot of like every every available space becomes a nightclub or like kind of an anonymous gastropub type thing.

398
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:56,220
It doesn't quite have the silly magic that I think it used to have that it still had in the 90s even as the theme park went away.

399
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:07,520
So what like let me can I throw out a couple of things that I wonder if these factored into your shirt or if you have any, you know, and then we'll get into the Wizard of Oz thing.

400
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,220
But the okay, what was going on with arcades?

401
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,120
How the arcades in the oh, the arcade was incredible.

402
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,020
Are you kidding me?

403
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:20,520
You if you guys stayed at the MGM Grand before I've never stayed there.

404
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,120
Okay, I spent time there.

405
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,220
I have not either.

406
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,920
Okay, but you're familiar with the lay of the land kind of you've been in there before.

407
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,520
Some three.

408
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:37,720
Okay, so near the the garden arena, they had this thing that maybe you saw while you were there called the CSI experience.

409
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:49,620
Okay, it's it you go down a pair of escalators into this giant bottom floor that you can't see from anywhere like you have to go down the escalators to see what's down there.

410
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,920
And that's where the arcade was.

411
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,120
They turned it into the CSI experience.

412
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,620
Yeah, I don't but the arcade maybe the should we do it?

413
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,320
Maybe we should do it.

414
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:58,920
Oh, maybe we should.

415
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,820
Are they going now?

416
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,120
Is it really I looked it up?

417
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,920
I think I'm pretty sure it's gone now.

418
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,520
Huh?

419
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:10,520
But that's what it ended up being for anyone who's listening who has been to the MGM Grand and has seen that before that's where the arcade was.

420
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,620
Okay, and it was magnificent.

421
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,520
It was huge.

422
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,020
Wow.

423
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,420
Under a little escalator.

424
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:19,520
Yeah, you had to go down an escalator into this little it felt like going into a private club.

425
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,220
Wow, that's kind of like the Excalibur one too.

426
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,320
I think yeah, that one is also a bottom floor.

427
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,320
I feel special when you're a kid is like going to your little place.

428
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:36,820
Purposefully hide it because you don't want it to be on the casino floor because if you're you don't want to see a bunch of kids doing kid gambling.

429
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,620
Well, you're trying to do real.

430
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:44,120
It's kind of like that in the Luxor like there's it's like a little tucked away.

431
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,820
Yeah, the luck of that my or is Excalibur has the little maybe both area.

432
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,220
I think is is in New York, New York.

433
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,620
It's on the second floor.

434
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,120
It's my roller coaster.

435
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,620
Oh, right.

436
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,220
We've been up there.

437
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,920
Yeah, which one has the Dairy Queen?

438
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,420
Which one has Excalibur Luxor?

439
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,020
I don't know.

440
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,120
There's like a Dairy Queen right outside the arcade in one of them or there was at least eight years.

441
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,220
Smart design.

442
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,120
Smart design for Occupy if you've brought children.

443
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,820
He's changing his reservation right now.

444
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,920
Oh, we've had we we're not big Excalibur fans.

445
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:24,820
Dana and I we just very weird vibes anytime we've been in there and like very weird people.

446
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:47,620
We saw like a much older woman like we were in line for the the loyalty card thing because I think we were getting like free play or something and there was like a an older woman with like very tight bleach blonde and purple braids and a much younger man and they were all over each other.

447
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,320
Cool.

448
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,620
That sounds nice.

449
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,020
No, it was not.

450
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,320
It was really smoky wherever we were.

451
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,220
It was just like I don't I don't need to gamble here.

452
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,920
Yes, Scott and I stayed there once.

453
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,020
We did Excalibur once.

454
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,620
Yeah.

455
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,420
I didn't like it.

456
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,220
Yeah, no, not really.

457
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,020
No, you only go there out of like perverse fascination.

458
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,820
I feel you don't want to plant there.

459
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,920
Is Dix there?

460
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,520
Dix is there.

461
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
I don't know if it's still there.

462
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,820
Yeah, I'm not sure.

463
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,020
We've had that discussion.

464
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,120
Do we do?

465
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,620
Listeners can weigh in on.

466
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,220
Wait, no, no, no, it'll be too late by that.

467
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:21,820
Never mind.

468
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,420
Yeah, you still can.

469
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,120
Should we have done Dix?

470
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,820
I'll weigh in and say no.

471
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,920
Jason and I have been.

472
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,520
Is that based solely on the ugliness of that cartoon that you don't want to go first of all?

473
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,220
Because I'm part of this trip too.

474
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,520
I have every time something comes up.

475
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,820
I'm like Jane and Aaron are going to be to that so fast.

476
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,020
It's going to be so funny.

477
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,020
Jason and I have been to the San Diego location before it closed.

478
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,120
No, we haven't.

479
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,520
You've never been there?

480
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,520
I've never been there.

481
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,020
Oh my God.

482
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,420
Well, then I've been there like three times with other people.

483
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,520
So I saw you.

484
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,220
So you're covered on Dix.

485
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:56,820
You're a Dix expert.

486
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,820
I could do the whole Dix.

487
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,020
Yeah, all the characters.

488
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,820
We've talked a little bit about the characters before.

489
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,520
Oh, yeah, that's right.

490
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,620
It's original mythology.

491
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:02,720
Yeah.

492
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,820
Did you know the dog from Dix last resort is named Assbite?

493
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,720
Why don't you want to go, Aaron?

494
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,920
No, that sounds really funny.

495
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,520
Here's how funny you're in person.

496
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,120
Yeah, if you're laughing now.

497
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,520
I'm laughing really hard.

498
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,320
But in 2013, the big joke was that they will call you gay.

499
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,920
So I'm interested to know what they're doing in 2023.

500
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,720
I'll bet it's still that and I'll bet it's still very funny.

501
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,420
You might be right.

502
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,820
But we might all need to go to find out.

503
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,720
That's the thing.

504
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Imagine if someone was gay.

505
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,420
Yeah.

506
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,520
This is the right thing.

507
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,920
It resonates through the decades.

508
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,720
They're right on your big hat.

509
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,420
They make a big paper hat for you and they write like this guy's gay.

510
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,320
And then that's it.

511
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,820
That's the joke.

512
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:52,920
It's funny that we're saying this because I saw a Vegas Twitter account I follow yesterday.

513
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:59,120
It was pouring rain and hailing and 114 at the same time in Henderson.

514
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,620
So it's like just imagining being soaking wet and trudging into Dix last resort.

515
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,820
And all of a sudden you're gay.

516
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,720
Like how many ungos you got with you today?

517
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,120
I want to find out I'm gay.

518
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,520
Yeah.

519
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,920
How my wet hair is melting my paper hat.

520
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,820
I'm not ready for this life change.

521
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,820
I just want to dry off a little first.

522
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,220
Okay.

523
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,420
Other MGM grand silliness.

524
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,520
Rainforest Cafe.

525
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,020
Oh, yeah.

526
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,620
Did you do it?

527
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,320
Fond memories of it?

528
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:27,720
Of course.

529
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,820
Yeah, we went there for breakfast a lot actually.

530
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,020
I remember you saying the breakfast was actually surprisingly solid.

531
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,820
It's hard to screw up breakfast.

532
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,820
That's a good point.

533
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,620
You have a good point.

534
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,520
It's not that hard to make a waffle, you know.

535
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,020
That's true.

536
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,420
Yeah.

537
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,620
What were your...

538
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,520
I used to do that in the college dining hall.

539
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,420
Just make waffles?

540
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:51,620
I was on the Saturday morning shift and I was on the whole bar for a full semester.

541
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,020
What?

542
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,320
Yeah, I was a waffle maker.

543
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,320
Wow.

544
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,520
How have we not learned this before?

545
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,720
I don't know.

546
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,320
And I...

547
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,120
You were on the waffle shift in the morning?

548
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:08,020
I did not burn myself, but there was like two or three regular size ones and then a pan.

549
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,320
The one that was for mini waffles.

550
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,120
And they were just like, just keep it going.

551
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,420
It's so busy here Saturday.

552
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,420
Just keep making them.

553
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,520
So you were on like a Lucy style assembly line?

554
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,720
I was a Lucy style assembly guy.

555
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,020
Yeah.

556
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,620
Oh my God.

557
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,620
This is insane that we don't know this.

558
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,420
I would ruin people's morning because I'd be giving them the four mini ones.

559
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,720
They're like, can I wait for a big one?

560
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,720
I'm like, oh yeah, fine.

561
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,820
Same one, one mini ones.

562
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,620
They told me I had to do this.

563
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,420
They were making you move mini ones?

564
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,820
They were just like, just keep filling the batter.

565
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,720
Just keep and flag one of us down when you need more batter.

566
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,020
It was not super well run.

567
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,220
We have a hundred questions, but we have to get to the MGM grand.

568
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,220
Sorry, I mean, it's sidetracked.

569
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,820
I'll just pick one.

570
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,320
Pick one.

571
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,020
Good one.

572
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,420
Okay.

573
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,920
What time did the shift start?

574
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,620
Did you say?

575
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,720
Oh, good question.

576
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,620
Yeah, it sucked.

577
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,920
It was like 8 a.m.

578
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,220
Gosh.

579
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,520
7.30, 8 a.m.

580
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,120
Who is this guy?

581
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,520
I don't know.

582
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,020
That's what I mean.

583
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,720
That's okay.

584
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,220
That seems late to me.

585
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,120
But only in, well, you've been an early riser for a long time.

586
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,620
Yeah, when you're 18.

587
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,520
One more question.

588
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:08,920
Yeah.

589
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,920
Did you have to wear an outfit or like a little hat?

590
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:17,120
It was just like a denim or blue dress shirt.

591
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,520
And yeah, I did have to wear a little hat.

592
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,320
I had to wear a little hat to keep my hair and a black apron.

593
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,320
Do we have a photo of this?

594
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,320
Every day I would end up like, or every time I worked, I would end up

595
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,920
inevitably collected a lot of stray silverware because I would like,

596
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,620
people would forget stuff or I would use the fork to scrape off the

597
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,220
excess cooked batter.

598
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,720
And then at the end of the shit, like stuff, I would just, so by the

599
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,120
end of the semester, I had a bunch of cups and forks and stuff.

600
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,720
So you would just take them back to your dorm with you?

601
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,820
I was so tired.

602
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,920
I was so out of it.

603
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,220
Not purposefully.

604
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,020
I'm imagining forks just like sticking out of your hat.

605
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,320
Yeah, that's not an easy.

606
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,120
Everyone who worked in the dining halls, you would go to their

607
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,920
dorms and you're just like, is that dining hall silverware and cups on

608
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,320
your table?

609
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,120
Yeah, I had it.

610
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,720
My apron.

611
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,920
I forgot about it.

612
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,920
Every day you'd come home with seven stray forks and knives and

613
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,420
pockets full of batter.

614
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,120
Yeah.

615
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:16,820
Yeah.

616
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,820
Oh, covered in batter.

617
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,120
I had to wash that stuff so much.

618
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,720
The uniform and the apron just covered in dried batter.

619
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,720
This feels like the AI is creating new stories.

620
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,720
Again, this has been happening a lot lately.

621
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,820
Please prompt.

622
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:35,920
Please tell me a Jason story that is exactly up my Jason story alley.

623
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,820
Right, that I've never heard before in decades.

624
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,320
A year ago, a year later, I worked in the dish room.

625
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,720
Oh, so you were washing dishes?

626
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
A million degree.

627
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,820
Why were you doing this again?

628
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,320
Uh-huh.

629
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,320
Why did you have to do this?

630
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,220
I had a work study.

631
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,320
I had a work study credit and then eventually I transferred to the,

632
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:57,420
I think the higher paying jobs on campus, which was calling alums and

633
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,520
parents and asking them for money.

634
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,820
Phone calls where no one is happy to talk to you.

635
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,420
No, and you're not happy to do the talking.

636
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,020
I can't imagine.

637
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,320
No, you are seeing you do any of this stuff right now.

638
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,420
You would be the most stressed out person.

639
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:17,020
I tried so many times to get in the computer lab or the library because

640
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:22,320
library people just sat at the checkout counters and just dicked around on the internet.

641
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,320
I'm sorry to tell you.

642
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
That's what I got.

643
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,120
I got it.

644
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,420
Yeah.

645
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:30,420
I worked at the video rental place in the library where the main thing was,

646
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,620
it was so far in the bowels of it that nobody made it up.

647
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,120
And if they did, they'd say they'd get, take a, they'd take a video and then

648
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,720
say, uh, and then start leaving with it.

649
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,820
And I'm like, no, no, no, the videos must be watched in the library on the big blocky.

650
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,320
So people, and some of them are real movies.

651
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,120
Like I, so I can't take diehard back to my, nope, library only.

652
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:57,620
So, which, uh, you know, it caused a wave of, uh, no one ever wanting to be up there for any reason.

653
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,220
I'm really sorry to tell you that that was my call.

654
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,120
Did you, Scott, do you have to wear an outfit of any kind of little outfit?

655
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,220
I did still have to wear a black apron.

656
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:11,520
In case any stray tapes getting rewound spit out at me.

657
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,720
And did you go home with a bunch of just tapes in your pockets?

658
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,620
And I get all these tapes, our buttons.

659
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,120
Ah, how did I end up with the fast forward?

660
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,520
Uh, well, Aaron, I'm so glad you said waffle.

661
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:31,320
Thank God you really say we're inspiring words.

662
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:38,020
Uh, I, I, Mike, I think you get one more question at the end of the episode, but just to make it a go, just like, think while other things are.

663
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,820
I'll think about it.

664
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:48,120
Um, one, one more big one as we're talking about, uh, sillier things in the MGM grant, uh, and this is gone now, but I'm sure I remember passing by this with you.

665
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,220
This is a big facet for a long time.

666
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,120
Lions.

667
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,320
I knew that's where we're going.

668
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,220
Lions and not just the big lion used to enter through the statues.

669
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:03,120
There were lions, real lions, uh, in the MGM grant, uh, feelings, experience with those.

670
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:03,820
Yeah.

671
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:11,620
The first year I went, they had a brand new lion cub that you could take a photo with, with your hands on its.

672
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,520
Hind.

673
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,620
Whoa.

674
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:18,920
Like you would line up and they had a, um, you know, like a professional photographer.

675
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,920
And, um, um, you would, you would go up behind the lion.

676
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:33,120
So the lion couldn't see you and the trainer distracted it with like a big, like ball and, uh, whatever to get the lion to look up.

677
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,820
And you would go behind it and just like touch its back legs, hold for a quick photo and then get the hell out.

678
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,420
Um, and in between photos, they were feeding it out of like a big bottle.

679
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,520
Wow.

680
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,020
Yeah.

681
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,820
Um, it was magical or seed.

682
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,320
What is it?

683
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:47,820
Yeah.

684
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,020
Magical through the eyes of a 13 year old in hindsight, CD as shit.

685
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,920
They should not be making lion cubs.

686
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,420
Yeah.

687
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:02,720
If we saw many stranger, many young people to or even less.

688
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,820
It seems like a liability nightmare to, to have, just regular people touching lions.

689
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,420
In like 22, there's footage in 2012.

690
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:16,320
I think they, uh, closed the lion habitat in the mid 2010s.

691
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:21,520
There's footage around 2012 or so of a lion, like beating the shit out of it.

692
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,320
Of a trainer.

693
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,320
I'm sure.

694
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,020
Pouncing on a train clear footage.

695
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,220
It's not even one camcorder.

696
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,020
I know it's pretty, it's nicely shot.

697
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,520
Yeah.

698
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,120
They were moved many, many times too.

699
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,920
They moved to that habitat, like all around the casino.

700
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,620
It wasn't always in the same place.

701
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,120
Oh really?

702
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,520
From my memory.

703
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,920
Cause I can't tell you exactly where it was.

704
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,220
Um, but, uh, I know one of the locations is where.

705
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,020
The wizard of Oz thing ended up, but that wasn't the only one.

706
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,420
Is that the big one in the center?

707
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:55,520
Like, well that, well that would have been, but that's by the strip entrance.

708
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,320
I get, but I didn't, yeah, I don't think there were, yeah, I think it's still multiple.

709
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,620
My memory is that they were moved around a couple of times.

710
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,620
Like the lions were in different places every time.

711
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,620
Like while they were building that big habitat, that was probably the final one.

712
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,520
There were lots of weird construction things.

713
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,220
The pool.

714
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,020
Oh yeah.

715
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,320
Crazy construction too.

716
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,120
Oh, because yes, we were talking in the MGM Grand about like now there's this

717
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,220
massive pool facility with a lazy river and stuff, but that replaced some of the

718
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:21,820
theme park.

719
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,720
So first time you went smaller pool, crappier pool.

720
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,320
Yeah, it was a sand bottom pool.

721
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:27,920
I hate those.

722
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,620
Um, they had a really small pool that, uh, the only access to this pool was through

723
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,420
the fourth floor.

724
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,820
So you know how there's like five or six elevator bays in the MGM Grand?

725
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,820
Every single bay had access to the fourth floor.

726
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,020
And this was for years after that pool had closed, but that's the reason you

727
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:50,720
would walk through rooms just like regular hallway with hotel rooms on the

728
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:57,320
fourth floor to go through this janky entrance to the, the pool that they had

729
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,320
set up for the time being while they were building the giant pool that they

730
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,820
have now.

731
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,820
We've got a lovely room for you on the fourth floor.

732
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:08,220
I mean, I don't know if maybe when it was max capacity, people were staying in

733
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:08,820
those rooms.

734
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,920
Could you imagine?

735
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,420
Oh God.

736
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:14,820
Just constant carpet on the, on that floor too, was just like wrecked to shit

737
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,320
because you have everybody walking like two and from the pool.

738
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,820
So it's like reeks of sunblock and sweat and chlorine and sand and sand

739
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,820
and toes because it was a sand pool.

740
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:31,120
So let me ask, uh, are you, have you ridden the Vegas monorail very much?

741
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,520
Yes.

742
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,220
Which one?

743
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,420
The, not the people movers on the other side of the strip.

744
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:39,420
The one that you pay for the one you pay for that goes like MGM Grand

745
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,020
to strat.

746
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,220
Yeah.

747
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,220
I was there when they built it.

748
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:41,520
Yeah.

749
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,220
Yeah.

750
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,520
Thoughts?

751
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,120
Do you like it?

752
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,120
I do.

753
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:47,620
I do.

754
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:51,520
I like, I can't, I feel like there was a time that you didn't have to pay for it,

755
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,220
but maybe I was just a teenager and didn't pay for anything.

756
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,420
But yeah, I, uh, that monorail, the entrance moved for it a few times

757
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,320
actually from the MGM Grand where you loaded.

758
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,620
But, uh, yes, I love that monorail.

759
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:11,220
I was really excited when they built it because it really opened up access.

760
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,820
You know, we saw a lot more hotels that way when it's like, oh, we could take

761
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:19,120
the monorail all the way up and see, you know, that takes it to the Hilton

762
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,220
or Westgate or whatever.

763
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:25,320
That one is a nice memory to our first vacation together, uh, to the

764
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,920
Las Vegas Hilton while Star Trek was still open.

765
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,120
Didn't do it.

766
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,820
Didn't do it.

767
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,320
I was there when it wasn't.

768
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,020
Yeah.

769
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,620
One of my biggest regrets of my life.

770
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,220
Yeah.

771
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:34,620
Yeah.

772
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:34,920
Yeah.

773
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,920
Star Trek experience.

774
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:40,820
Uh, um, I, uh, I, I, we did though, I'm sure I've said this before, but

775
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:44,420
that I do strongly remember getting on the elevator with just married,

776
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,120
fully decked out Star Trek.

777
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:46,720
Yes.

778
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,120
Yeah.

779
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,820
It was a just married couple who did a full Star Trek wedding.

780
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,220
Am I, am I making up that they had personal pan pizzas?

781
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,020
No, I completely remember personal.

782
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,420
Whoa.

783
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,120
You, oh, I'm sorry.

784
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,920
I, I remembered that you, I remember eating personal pan pizzas in the hotel.

785
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,120
You're saying that the wedding dinner of these two going up, these two

786
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,920
Klingons going up to their room.

787
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,220
They were also holding their personal pan pizzas.

788
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,320
Whatever the, the people who work on the ship.

789
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,920
Oh, they were like humans within the regular like regulation outfits.

790
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,520
I feel like in my memory, there's one Klingon, but maybe that's wishful

791
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,120
thinking, maybe that's me just leaping to the cartoon version.

792
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,520
I think we're both creating a scenario that didn't exactly.

793
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,720
I really want Klingon forehead wrinkles and you really want them to eat

794
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,520
personal pan pizzas to be their wedding dinner.

795
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:33,920
Yeah.

796
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,920
These memories are like beautiful scenes from like a Cirque du Soleil.

797
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:44,620
This is straight out of MGM Grand's Ka show, which is read seemingly forever.

798
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,820
Uh, when you set those up, yeah, they were at boy, there's, there's

799
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,520
something really wrong if you ever end a Cirque du Soleil show.

800
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:51,920
Yeah.

801
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,220
Yeah.

802
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,320
Uh, the Vegas monorail, by the way, I believe now goes by the sphere.

803
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,020
Oh, right.

804
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,420
A way to get a view.

805
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,920
You can see the sphere.

806
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,020
People are getting sphere-pilled left and right online.

807
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,020
And I couldn't be more excited about it.

808
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,320
I've been sphere-pilled for months.

809
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:14,320
Someone pointed out the, the win, the very open to anyone, but pretty

810
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,520
expensive, the very exclusive win golf course, a very nicely been here.

811
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,020
Golf course.

812
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,220
Now you can be on the golf course and just be staring at a giant eyeball.

813
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,120
I love it.

814
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,520
You look at video of it.

815
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
Like surely this is doctored.

816
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,220
That's this crazy.

817
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:37,120
Any photo or video of the sphere you assume is a Photoshop.

818
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:37,520
Yeah.

819
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,020
It looks fake.

820
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:43,420
It looks like somebody inserted a bunch of stuff onto a bubble, but in

821
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,020
fact, so they built something that always looks fake.

822
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,420
It's really weird.

823
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,420
I can't imagine.

824
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,720
It looks so crazy in video.

825
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,020
I imagine in person, it looks 50 times crazier.

826
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,620
We're going to have to, I mean, that weather is going to be nuts, but we

827
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,120
have to somehow at least get it.

828
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,820
I am excited to see those things.

829
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,120
Yeah.

830
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,320
Where do you, especially because it will be torn down in three years.

831
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,520
That's your money's going on that.

832
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,420
I think I'm with you.

833
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,520
I feel like, and we'll, we'll discuss some of this.

834
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,620
Saudis buy it in bankruptcy, you know?

835
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,420
Oh, that's true.

836
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,720
There's always that option.

837
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:15,920
Yes.

838
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,020
It just may not be owned by the current owner for very long.

839
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,520
I think sphere is going to work.

840
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,220
That's my prediction.

841
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,920
It's going to be crazy.

842
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,520
I think.

843
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,020
Yeah.

844
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,520
Yeah.

845
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,220
But that's also you're coming at it from a pro U2 angle.

846
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,720
I think that's telling us coloring your view.

847
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,020
I'm coming at it from a, I'm indifferent to you too.

848
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:39,520
And I think that seeing a side of a big eyeball with the weird

849
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,920
muscle-y side part of an eyeball.

850
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,020
I think it's so bizarre.

851
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,420
It is.

852
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,020
They just stopped showing the eyeball.

853
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,320
Maybe the eyeball makes it extra weird.

854
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,220
But when they turn it into a giant pumpkin, that's cool.

855
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,220
They showed that already.

856
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,320
And there's a big basketball.

857
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,020
WW.

858
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,720
I like the best.

859
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,820
WW you might run an event in there.

860
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,420
They're talking to them already.

861
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:58,920
Okay.

862
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,620
That would be good.

863
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,220
I feel like we're getting into the zone of like, oh, people are

864
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,320
interested in using this thing.

865
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,020
So we'll see.

866
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,120
As long as the performers and wrestlers or anybody who had

867
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:14,420
don't like go into absolute seizure convulsions every time

868
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,420
they look up slightly, as long as the room doesn't scramble

869
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,520
everyone's brain.

870
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,620
That's yeah, which it might, that might be a danger where

871
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,920
you might never come back.

872
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,320
But we're like, we need to make sure we should record a

873
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,220
goodbye episode from you just in case.

874
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:29,720
Yeah.

875
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,620
Who's the ability to Colonel Kurtz Mike's apocalypse.

876
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,020
Now he's going up river to the sphere.

877
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,020
If that look I have mission possible spoil.

878
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,820
Am I allowed to do a little spoiler Jason?

879
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,220
I'm sorry.

880
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:39,620
Fine.

881
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,020
Sure.

882
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,420
I mean the entity is the sphere.

883
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,420
Oh, you're right.

884
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:43,720
Yeah.

885
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,120
AI that is the bad guy.

886
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,820
Mission Impossible is that'll be in the sphere.

887
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,020
Spoiler Tom Cruise fights the sphere.

888
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,520
Yes.

889
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,820
So yeah, I may give myself over to it.

890
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,820
I may willingly give my body to the entity when I'm seeing

891
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,520
you to perform Octon baby.

892
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,820
What was that about?

893
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,320
Like, oh, all the sphere footage seems like it's doctor,

894
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,720
but it's real reminds me of the thing that is doctored,

895
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,220
which is the clip from the flash where someone reversed

896
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:09,420
it.

897
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,920
So it looks like the flash is putting a baby in the microwave.

898
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,120
Oh, Jason, Jason, I've got news for you.

899
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,320
The flash absolutely puts a baby in the microwave.

900
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,020
He saves it, but this seems like the flash is smiling

901
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,320
and about to microwave.

902
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,220
Yeah.

903
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:25,620
Yes.

904
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:30,920
Well, he puts the flash midair puts babies in non working

905
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,820
microwaves to save you to shield them from explosions.

906
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,320
Got it.

907
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,020
So no, it doesn't feel weird at all to see someone we're

908
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:42,820
supposed to believe in as a great superhero putting a baby

909
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,120
in a microwave.

910
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,920
Like how did nobody in the biggest corporate chain do the

911
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,120
calculation that a baby going into a microwave is one of the

912
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,420
most profoundly disturbing images ever.

913
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,520
Small baby are pretty big.

914
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,820
It is.

915
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,820
Well, it's a like it's a newborn.

916
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:05,020
It's like babies who are just born that day go flying out

917
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,620
of a building tons of them, tons of them.

918
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:11,620
And the flash has to save them all from like sharp objects

919
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,920
and shans shove some in microwaves.

920
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,920
But even still the littlest baby could the little microwave.

921
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,320
I don't want to find out.

922
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,420
I don't want to run this test at home.

923
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:26,120
No, someone refers to there's footage at the end of the scene.

924
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,520
He tastes baby out of the market.

925
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,320
Someone refers.

926
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,220
So it looks like a woman is screaming as he's smiling puts

927
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:36,720
it in the microwave and I mean that sounds funny and weird,

928
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,820
but I'm telling you the way it actually plays out is equally

929
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,520
disturbing.

930
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,920
That is one of the most disturbing sequences ever shot by

931
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,220
humans and somehow Tom Cruise is trying to tell us this is

932
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,220
the best movie ever made.

933
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,520
The sphere is like a big circuit like an orb microwave and

934
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,620
I'm willingly going to be put into it.

935
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,220
You're a baby happily nestled in your sphere.

936
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,620
The sphere is a big womb.

937
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,320
The sphere is.

938
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,120
Yeah, we just talked about big wombs.

939
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,920
Yeah, it's yours.

940
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,320
Jason.

941
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,420
Yeah, you're into this.

942
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,720
Mike's pondering is orb again.

943
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:13,120
Okay, as we start heading towards this little this little

944
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,520
animatronic thing and some old-school 90s, I'm going to

945
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,720
bring up one more thing just in case you crossed over with

946
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,720
this, but I'm going to bet that you did not.

947
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,120
We've done many trips where we've kicked things off at the

948
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,920
MGM Grand in the lobby bar.

949
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,720
That's a wonderful bar.

950
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,120
Nice to get some champagne and hey, we're here and we're

951
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,020
going to start hitting it which is now like a pretty like

952
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,520
classy elevator.

953
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,920
I like that bar.

954
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:41,720
Did you have any recollection of the bar being stupider than

955
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,520
it is today?

956
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,120
No, okay.

957
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:50,420
What it was due to the stray licensing we talked about in

958
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,920
the theme park that hey, all your favorite characters are

959
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,920
here Popeye tumbleweed for the 1960s comic tumbleweed and

960
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,120
we forgot a big one Betty Boop.

961
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,420
Oh, yeah.

962
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,120
We I guess I was on my list tonight.

963
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,720
We just never said her name Betty Boop was around at the

964
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,320
theme park.

965
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,420
I don't know if you ever saw Betty Boop anywhere on the

966
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,120
property.

967
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,520
Novelty lunchboxes.

968
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:11,820
Yes.

969
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,320
Yeah.

970
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,720
That's the main place you seen her now is tin lunchboxes,

971
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,520
but Betty Boop had a presence in the theme was a let's say

972
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,920
something we said in the last episode face character not

973
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,920
for character.

974
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,120
So kind of weird that it's a big mascot version of Popeye

975
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,120
and olive oil, but then just a woman is Betty Boop so you

976
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,420
could see that in the park, but the bar was Betty Boop's

977
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:34,920
bar.

978
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,820
It was a Betty.

979
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:40,520
Wow, it was a Betty Boop bar and then you hear that and

980
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,420
you think okay, so kind of like pink hearts got an aesthetic

981
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,320
sort of close to Minnie Mouse.

982
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,720
No, not at all.

983
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,720
Regular bar got a little trashier in its style.

984
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,320
Maybe then currently but relatively standard issue Vegas

985
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,520
bar except that it had an animatronic.

986
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,120
Are you following me an animatronic Betty Boop?

987
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,620
Wow wrong.

988
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:09,520
No, what Betty Boop's bar had an animatronic if I made you

989
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,020
guess 2000 names you would never land at what the animatronic

990
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,820
was of is it the dog?

991
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,420
No, as fight.

992
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,020
It was not an animatronic of Dix as bite.

993
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:26,320
It was does the name Foster Brooks mean anything?

994
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:26,720
Yeah.

995
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,220
Yeah.

996
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,120
Do you know Foster Brooks?

997
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:34,320
So Foster Brooks was a while you might describe Foster as

998
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:39,320
a lovable lush a drunk cat like a cat.

999
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,120
A comedic guest kind of an handicap but a real pretty it was

1000
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,820
like like the real person's name is Foster Brooks and that was

1001
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:49,620
like their persona was a slurry drunk guy and you would see

1002
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,120
Foster Brooks on like Dean Martin specials and stuff like

1003
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,720
that like a very 1960s Omni present thing that I only know

1004
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,220
the I think I only know the name because like Jim Brewer saying

1005
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,020
like I want to be like Foster Brooks.

1006
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:07,220
I want to be like the modern foster Brooks, you know, I'm

1007
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:07,920
really angry.

1008
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,320
He can't play hot drunks on SNL.

1009
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,620
Anyway, so name you've never heard before in your life in

1010
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:20,220
the early 90s people think we got to put an animatronic Foster

1011
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,920
Brooks into the Betty Boop bar.

1012
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,220
What is this?

1013
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,320
How does that all tie together?

1014
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,520
It makes no sense.

1015
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,120
Foster Brooks ever in Betty Boop cartoon or anything.

1016
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:30,520
Do we know?

1017
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,220
I don't think so.

1018
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,720
Well, and also it's like a it's a photo realistic right.

1019
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,420
It was very human animatronic.

1020
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:36,820
Yeah, I know.

1021
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,620
I'm going to play a clip and stop it almost immediately because

1022
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,120
the sound is going to be awful.

1023
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,920
This is just to give you vaguely the flavor of the fun you

1024
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,020
would get if you sat next to animatronic Foster Brooks.

1025
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,720
A loud laugh track mainly.

1026
00:45:52,720 --> 00:46:08,320
This is like our favorite Simpsons joke.

1027
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,420
The John Muir.

1028
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,920
National Park and opens the door.

1029
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,220
It's playing a movie.

1030
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,820
Let's let John Muir tell the tale.

1031
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:18,720
Wow.

1032
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,520
Was this animatronic put in there to make you feel better

1033
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,620
about yourself?

1034
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,020
Like you think you're having a bad day.

1035
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,020
Maybe so.

1036
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:29,320
Yes.

1037
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,220
Are you're you're worried that you've had one drink too many?

1038
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,220
Well, you're no foster.

1039
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:39,620
Yeah, not slurring to I bet though many many people challenge.

1040
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,220
I put there are lots of people vastly drunker than Foster

1041
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,720
Brooks.

1042
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,820
Yeah, Foster.

1043
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,320
Why not like a more famous?

1044
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,620
Maybe he was very famous and I'm wrong, but like he was like

1045
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:54,420
the 15th most famous guy on those Dean Martin roasts because

1046
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,220
of I think because of the drunkenness.

1047
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:00,820
I think I'm saying there's no more famous like drunk or fake

1048
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,420
drunks.

1049
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:05,920
Maybe they went to several people before him or before several

1050
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,820
estates.

1051
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,920
Yeah, that all the time.

1052
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,820
Yeah, the WC fields estate was just playing hardball.

1053
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,720
I think that's it.

1054
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:18,520
I think maybe like nobody's there's never been an offer for

1055
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,920
a Foster Brooks anything.

1056
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,620
So they are they are motivated to sell.

1057
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,620
Mecca Toys has not approached the Foster Brooks estate to

1058
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:29,120
make a series of seven inch articulated Foster Brooks action

1059
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:29,620
figures.

1060
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:33,320
We found one podcaster who we believe will buy a Foster

1061
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:37,020
but so with that as an entry point, maybe we'll sell to

1062
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,520
what about Red Skelton, right?

1063
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,920
He had the drunk thing too.

1064
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,620
They were all doing this stupid drunk pretending to be drunk

1065
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,220
and it made them like money on the Ed Sullivan show.

1066
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:48,620
Look, I think I think what we're learning is that the MGM

1067
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:52,620
grand while very fun when it first opened probably needed

1068
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:58,220
like a big picture got Tony Baxter or Joe Roady for like

1069
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,720
to make it cohesive.

1070
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,520
Yeah, for some cohesiveness.

1071
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,220
Yes, absolutely.

1072
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,720
And it probably should have been the person who did the

1073
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,620
the Wizard of Oz display would seem pretty top-notch just

1074
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,020
really good before I moved past that.

1075
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,820
So that was the thing would you would just play a scratchy

1076
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:19,620
tape with a laugh track and I think no one ever got near it.

1077
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:24,220
I think like how can we get some seats across the and the

1078
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,020
why did it go away?

1079
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:30,320
Well, one person says it just got it fell into such a

1080
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,420
disrepair that they just threw it in the trash and nobody

1081
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:37,220
knows what happened to it video, but I would rather believe

1082
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:42,820
the urban legend of it, which is that Mike Tyson was there

1083
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:47,220
on a fight night and the animatronic made him so mad or even

1084
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:51,820
possibly the specific Hector ring from this old comedian

1085
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:56,820
recording made him so mad that he's like, oh yeah and like

1086
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,120
punched the head off.

1087
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,020
I don't believe that for one minute.

1088
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,720
But I love that would be really fun.

1089
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,820
Yes, if that's the yeah, yeah.

1090
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,420
And if that was like what if that I don't know the timeline

1091
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:11,720
here, but MGM Grand Arena is where Tyson bit Holyfield's

1092
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,220
ear.

1093
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:17,420
So what if that was like the instigator the night where

1094
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,220
shit really.

1095
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:18,720
Oh wow.

1096
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,520
Yeah, what if that pushed him over the edge and animatronic

1097
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,120
foster Brooks caused the ear bite?

1098
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:23,820
Oh my gosh.

1099
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,420
I was I thought you were going to say what have you bit the

1100
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,620
ear off the animatronic?

1101
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,920
I broke that gives me a good idea.

1102
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:33,020
So maybe all the scenarios I like with him involved with

1103
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:33,720
animatronics.

1104
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,420
I mean idea.

1105
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,120
I just love that it was there in general now doesn't sound

1106
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:42,320
good, but pretty good animatronic pretty believable looks

1107
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,520
like it might have been a Sally.

1108
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,020
I think maybe it was a Sally and that maybe leads us into

1109
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,320
I just wanted to let's get all the nonsense out of there

1110
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,820
and now get to the main show here.

1111
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,420
The Wizard of Oz walkthrough.

1112
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,720
I mean we can kind of step through what this experience

1113
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,220
was but I the headline as we talk about that foster Brooks

1114
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,520
animatronic kind of looking good.

1115
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,820
These animatronics looked good.

1116
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:05,720
Yeah, really good.

1117
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:10,920
It is a full set of I mean, there's several iterations of

1118
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,320
the main four of Dorothy's Scarecrow Cowardly Lion Tin

1119
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,520
Man, but then you get a Glinda and you get the Wicked

1120
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,620
Witch and the Wizard.

1121
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,620
They all look these are top-tier animatronics.

1122
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:25,620
They're really good.

1123
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:28,320
I sure wish I could have seen these that I mean they're

1124
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,120
incredible.

1125
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:29,420
Yeah.

1126
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,620
Yeah, and this is a nut.

1127
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:34,020
This is like night and day from the video of the park itself

1128
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,120
the MGM Park.

1129
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:38,520
Yeah, far as just like feeling do you remember we were talking

1130
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:43,120
about how the rapid ride had animatronics and it was Garner

1131
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,620
Holt's first job.

1132
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:48,720
Yeah, but do you recall the animatronics in any way?

1133
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:53,420
I recall that they were there but I not not especially you

1134
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:56,620
didn't think these are wow, this wasn't blown away.

1135
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,120
Sure.

1136
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,320
I mean, I will say that those animatronics maybe were

1137
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,020
on the same level.

1138
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,320
It's just I was I'm seduced by the atmosphere and the mood

1139
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,620
of this more than I am of barely seeing any.

1140
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:10,420
Well, and like look a rapids right is not a good mechanism

1141
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,320
for yes, animatronics because you're spinning past

1142
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,120
her Milly Fes these things you can yeah, could you at the

1143
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,420
time you could walk up and stare at them.

1144
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:22,520
Yeah, get really close to them probably touch them try to

1145
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,820
kiss them get tackled get kicked out of the scene.

1146
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,620
Yes, I would have tried to kiss a couple of them just a

1147
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:31,320
little kisses, but I would have tried I just I'm not

1148
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,820
attracted to the tin man.

1149
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:35,120
I just want to know what a tin kiss would be like.

1150
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,120
Yeah, of course.

1151
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,620
He's so friendly.

1152
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,720
Yeah, he's been with me all my life.

1153
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,120
Sure you can anytime.

1154
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,020
I got a big high.

1155
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,920
I think it's very interesting to that like very detailed

1156
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,420
animatronics in the queue.

1157
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:58,320
But the first thing you see are very detailed statues.

1158
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:01,720
Yeah of the characters and then the wizard in the hot

1159
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,720
air balloon.

1160
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,320
Yes.

1161
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:07,520
Yeah, which less of a part of the original movie than the

1162
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,820
Franco Franco.

1163
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:12,620
Which most of the marketing was about the hot air balloon.

1164
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:13,620
Yeah, that is true.

1165
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,620
Get you the balloon in theaters.

1166
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,220
Finally.

1167
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,820
Yeah, so this was okay.

1168
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,920
We talked we talked about the theme park in the main feed

1169
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,420
but that was not the only big crazy themed thing meant to

1170
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,620
attract people in the case and meant to make a big statement

1171
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:28,420
in that casino.

1172
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:33,120
This is what this is what you saw when you walked in on

1173
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:37,220
opening day from the strip from the main strip entrance.

1174
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,720
And it's like it's an insane tableau.

1175
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:47,120
It's those characters and then the rendering of the Emerald

1176
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:47,920
City.

1177
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,220
Yeah, is unreal.

1178
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:50,520
It's huge.

1179
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,020
It is absolutely movie quality.

1180
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,920
You could this would completely work in a Disney park.

1181
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:00,420
Yes, it's that high level and it's when you see the video

1182
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,920
you go, how would you get rid of this?

1183
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,820
Yeah, I don't I mean, I know most adults don't give a shit

1184
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:06,520
about it.

1185
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,220
I understand that from a logistic point of view, but it

1186
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,220
looks so good.

1187
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,920
It did add such an interesting atmosphere to it.

1188
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,720
Yeah, and that area that's like three stories high.

1189
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,920
Yes, really high and like that is a massive space and it

1190
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,820
looks like they utilized all of it really high domed ceiling

1191
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,220
thunder and lightning and colored light.

1192
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,720
I missed I guess trying to simulate the tornado.

1193
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,520
Yeah, as you get closer to the core, it seems like yeah, then

1194
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:37,720
the storm is starting the Wicked Witch flying overhead every

1195
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,220
now and then yeah a little projection of that and meanwhile

1196
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:46,420
the audio experience is just slot machine sounds on every

1197
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:46,920
side.

1198
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,920
It seems like yes because it is like, you know, some of it

1199
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,520
is the clean entrance to the entire property.

1200
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,920
So, you know, it's not slot machines on all sides, but the

1201
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,020
deeper you go into the corn maze, you are definitely only

1202
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,120
10 feet away.

1203
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,620
It's the oddest tableau juxtaposition of it because it

1204
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:08,920
is there's a lot of like eerie sounds happening and atmosphere

1205
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,820
sounds for Wizard of Oz, but you can also hear slot machines

1206
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,020
just going nuts like normal casino.

1207
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,320
It's very competitive.

1208
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:22,020
Let me step through the entire experience and I'm even going

1209
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,320
to walk us out the door a little bit because I'm not going to

1210
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,620
let two MGM Grand episodes pass without giving a little bit

1211
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:31,920
of love to the big blocky lion, the original entrance.

1212
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,720
Erin, you were there.

1213
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,820
You started going in this transitional time.

1214
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,320
What was going on with the line?

1215
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,320
You missed it entirely.

1216
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,820
Yeah, I believe I missed it.

1217
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,820
It was under construction the first time you...

1218
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:43,520
I think so.

1219
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:47,620
To be honest though, I always entered the hotel through the

1220
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:51,020
carport through the, you know, like the valet area.

1221
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:51,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1222
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,920
Since I was staying there.

1223
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,620
So I very rarely went through the entrance and exit.

1224
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,620
Do you know what was there when you went?

1225
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,220
Because now it's sort of this kind of a fountain and like a

1226
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,820
lot of big screens playing music videos and stuff.

1227
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:04,520
I don't remember.

1228
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,020
Nothing like noteworthy.

1229
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,420
It might have been under construction.

1230
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,420
It might have been just, you know.

1231
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,320
Oh, maybe.

1232
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:09,620
Yeah.

1233
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:09,820
Yeah.

1234
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,920
But this is something I remember.

1235
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:19,220
The first time we went to Vegas together when I was but 21.

1236
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,320
You educated me about a number of things.

1237
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,420
You like onboarded me.

1238
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,620
First of all, that Vegas is fun and you can have a big silly

1239
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,120
time and the best meals you've ever had.

1240
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,120
Like I don't think I knew any of that.

1241
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,920
Like you completely turned me on to how much fun Vegas can be.

1242
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,120
But there were little things too.

1243
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,720
One of them being, I think I was like, oh yeah, I can

1244
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,320
get to go see that big blocky line.

1245
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,120
I didn't know the lion was gone.

1246
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,220
You burst my bubble.

1247
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,820
Oh, I love the but I just I don't know.

1248
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,720
I love the weird mustard color.

1249
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,120
I mean, I like my kind of like blocky brutalist Epcot.

1250
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,020
The architecture.

1251
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:56,420
So you made me sad a little bit when you told me that the

1252
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:59,220
lion was not only gone long gone.

1253
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,320
I didn't make the decision.

1254
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,720
It made me so sad.

1255
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,720
You should have let me believe it.

1256
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,520
I saw with my own eyes.

1257
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,620
You should have been so happy on the plane.

1258
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:12,020
I told him I was there but you couldn't see it because

1259
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,520
something was going on that day.

1260
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:20,220
I could have just lasted 17 years.

1261
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:23,020
Someday we're going to see it.

1262
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:23,420
I swear.

1263
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:29,220
Yeah, the other thing that you I also just remember being

1264
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,920
in our first Vegas trip together that like wait on the

1265
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,820
drinks are free.

1266
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,420
If you play a little bit, I didn't know like this is how much

1267
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:37,420
I knew nothing.

1268
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,720
And then we're walking out and like but wait, I still have

1269
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:43,620
my glass and you say no, no, no, you can keep walking with

1270
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:43,820
that.

1271
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:47,420
That the note I actually didn't know that you could just

1272
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,320
walk the streets with alcohol.

1273
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,420
Yeah, be a shithead and just drop your glass in whatever

1274
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,220
hotel you want.

1275
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:59,820
Afterwards, throw it trying to hit the big breast lion car,

1276
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:02,220
the big bronze lion because I'm mad that it's not the old

1277
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,220
lion that I like.

1278
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,220
That's the same thing Jason would do with his silverware

1279
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:06,420
from the waffle job.

1280
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:08,020
He was living.

1281
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,320
It was just trying to live vicariously Vegas.

1282
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,020
Hey, you need a forks gang.

1283
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,120
Just trying to get to know each other.

1284
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:14,820
I got a lot.

1285
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,820
This is your end to make college friends.

1286
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:19,620
Yeah, I was making college friends covered in flop sweat

1287
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,020
from waffle batter.

1288
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,920
Yeah, I've covered in flop sweat and waffle batter.

1289
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,020
But if you need a fork.

1290
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,420
I got a pot of mine.

1291
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:38,420
Over 19 year olds and the nastiest syrup that I've

1292
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,420
got most never.

1293
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,820
You can probably speak to how never changed it was.

1294
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,320
I only get one question at the end.

1295
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,420
Pressures on a good one.

1296
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,820
You're going to call me up the scar.

1297
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:52,820
Maybe we'll answer that question.

1298
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,020
You got a waffle scar?

1299
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:56,620
No, it's more complicated than that.

1300
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,320
Fuck fine.

1301
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,420
And just do it now.

1302
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,420
I want to know how you got these scars.

1303
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:08,220
I switched shifts with someone once and so I was working

1304
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,820
the dinner shift one night.

1305
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,220
What were you preparing for that?

1306
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:14,420
I was on the meat carving station.

1307
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:20,620
I was taught how to do it in about 45 seconds.

1308
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:21,620
What were you slicing?

1309
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:22,420
What kind of meat?

1310
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:24,620
I was slicing different different story.

1311
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,220
I get to ask a couple of more questions.

1312
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,620
That's the line of questioning.

1313
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:28,220
I understand.

1314
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:31,420
I was slicing like roast beef or roast pork.

1315
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:37,220
And when you wear that, you're already wearing like rubber

1316
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,820
or latex gloves.

1317
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:43,620
Then you wear like a fucking chain metal glove so that

1318
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,220
you're slicing with your right hand.

1319
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,820
You got the chain metal glove on your left hand.

1320
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:50,420
I've watched a video demonstrating carving stations before.

1321
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:52,220
I think at the old country buffet.

1322
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:55,220
That's one of the great employee informational videos

1323
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,020
available on YouTube.

1324
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,220
I know about the big glove.

1325
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,420
Jason wore it.

1326
00:58:58,420 --> 00:58:59,620
So you don't cut your hand.

1327
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,820
So you don't cut your hand.

1328
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,420
What a falconer would have to wear.

1329
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:08,820
Unless you cut right at the above where the glove ends.

1330
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:12,220
So I stabbed myself.

1331
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,620
I poked myself.

1332
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:14,220
Oh, God.

1333
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:18,020
And they really have to like dump that roast.

1334
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,620
They had to get you.

1335
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:20,620
You bled on the roast?

1336
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,820
You bled all over the roast?

1337
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:23,020
I ruined a roast.

1338
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:29,420
And they're like, all right, we're going to put you on the ice cream

1339
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:30,820
stand for the rest of the night.

1340
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,420
You went to the ice cream stand?

1341
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:36,020
I scooped ice cream a few times, which is kind of nasty

1342
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,420
in itself because it had a toppings bar with it.

1343
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:42,220
And marshmallow syrup, as much as I love to eat it,

1344
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:45,420
is incredibly hard to clean up and manage.

1345
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:46,420
Oh, no.

1346
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,220
So wait a second.

1347
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,220
They didn't send you to urgent care.

1348
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,420
They sent you to ice cream?

1349
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,420
Eat.

1350
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:54,220
We've still got to get somebody to cover the shift.

1351
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:57,020
It was a pretty small jab.

1352
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:58,620
But you have a scar from it?

1353
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,820
I do have a very tiny scar from it.

1354
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:03,220
A small jab that lasted forever?

1355
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:04,620
That's part of your life now?

1356
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:05,620
It's very faint.

1357
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,220
That affected your body?

1358
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:07,620
Wow.

1359
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,120
Yeah.

1360
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,820
So that's my work study story.

1361
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,020
And they had to fill out an incident report

1362
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:16,220
and begrudgingly get me a glass of water.

1363
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:17,620
How many begrudgingly?

1364
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:19,420
Oh, God.

1365
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,620
Yes, Prince.

1366
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:22,420
Here you go, sir.

1367
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:25,220
All of the adults who manage the dining

1368
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:27,420
are like, they hate it.

1369
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:29,020
They hate it running it.

1370
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:31,620
They hate it managing a staff of students.

1371
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:34,420
How many minutes into the shift did you slice your wrist?

1372
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:37,020
We're talking like 30 minutes.

1373
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:37,820
Wow.

1374
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:38,620
Wow.

1375
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:42,220
So and you also, I didn't really know about the concept

1376
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,020
of restaurant crew meals.

1377
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:47,420
So we would have to get there 30 minutes before our shift

1378
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:50,220
to take lunch before we did a shift.

1379
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:55,020
And looking back, I'm like, this doesn't seem right.

1380
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:57,420
So everyone's eating beforehand.

1381
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,820
And then at the end of the meal, you clock in.

1382
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:04,020
So you kind of had to do a mandatory meal with everyone.

1383
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:04,620
Very odd.

1384
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:05,220
At the beginning.

1385
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,220
At the beginning.

1386
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:10,420
And also, they have only kind of put out the food.

1387
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:12,900
You're kind of in a weird in-between period

1388
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,220
between meals, a lot of the chefs.

1389
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:17,220
So yeah.

1390
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,900
Did you have to do, did they have to do a funeral

1391
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,220
for the roast?

1392
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:23,020
Did you have to say a few words?

1393
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:25,220
Did you offer to take it home?

1394
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:26,620
You can eat your own blood.

1395
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:27,220
That's fine.

1396
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:29,020
I'll throw it out for you.

1397
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:30,020
Just let me take it.

1398
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,020
No, no, yes, I'm putting it in my car.

1399
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:35,020
But that's because I have a bigger trash can I know about.

1400
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:39,420
Jason's running the old bleed on the roast pun.

1401
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,620
Life hack.

1402
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,420
Brace yourself.

1403
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:46,020
This asshole already dropped a vat of marinara sauce

1404
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,020
last week.

1405
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:51,620
So like I did drop a vat of marinara sauce in the pizza

1406
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:53,620
station.

1407
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:56,420
Jason dropped a bit.

1408
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:59,020
You keep like this episode.

1409
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:00,420
Now you tell us all this.

1410
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:03,620
This is an untapped wow.

1411
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:05,620
This should be a 19 part series.

1412
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:06,220
Yeah.

1413
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,220
Are you working?

1414
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,420
You're pulling like Mr.

1415
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:13,220
Bean style like mistakes during food preparation in college.

1416
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:13,820
Yeah.

1417
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,620
Anyway, there was a magic show at the end of the

1418
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:16,620
Yellowbrook Road.

1419
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:19,420
Yeah, I was going to say there's we've talked about there's

1420
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,620
some episodes where people end up saying when are they going

1421
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:23,020
to get to the fireworks factory?

1422
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,820
Yeah, but this one feels like okay, when are they going to

1423
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:26,620
get to the fireworks factory?

1424
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:29,020
But they are in the dynamite factory.

1425
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:32,620
Big and it's colorful.

1426
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:36,020
It's going off red and green and purple all color.

1427
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:38,420
I got to know it's kind of equivalent to the fireworks

1428
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,020
factory.

1429
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:42,220
Yeah, it Jason Lohr unlocked.

1430
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:45,220
It should be also part of the description of part of this.

1431
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,020
Oh boy.

1432
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:46,420
Yeah.

1433
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:48,020
Well, we'll tease it.

1434
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,620
Anyway, the lion was cool.

1435
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:50,620
The lion is cool.

1436
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:53,820
It's like Sphinx style.

1437
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:59,620
Like that's like an Egyptian old but like metallic or gold.

1438
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:00,620
Yeah, definitely.

1439
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,020
I don't know.

1440
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,020
I just like the color.

1441
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:03,820
I like the treatment.

1442
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:04,820
I like the blockiness.

1443
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:06,020
But then there's that bizarre.

1444
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:10,620
It also to me feels like 90s polygons.

1445
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,820
Yeah.

1446
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:12,020
Yeah.

1447
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,420
Like also CGI.

1448
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,020
Yeah.

1449
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:17,020
Or video game stuff, which I think also makes it sort of

1450
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:20,220
attractive to a man of a certain man or woman of certain

1451
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:20,620
age.

1452
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:24,420
Anybody who saw early CGI, the kind of early CGI that wasn't

1453
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:25,420
terrifying.

1454
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:27,420
Yeah, it was just blocky and bad.

1455
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,020
It was charming.

1456
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:30,620
Yeah, charming.

1457
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:33,820
There's some attention to detail on the line that I like.

1458
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:36,620
One, the eyes are emerald green.

1459
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:39,020
Oh, like the building and everything else.

1460
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:41,420
And then the doors into the casino,

1461
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:45,820
the door handles are giant letters that say Oz.

1462
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:46,620
They say Oz.

1463
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:49,420
Did they still does that sound familiar in your transitional

1464
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:49,820
era?

1465
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:51,020
I believe so.

1466
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:54,620
I think on the other side where there's the West Wing entrance

1467
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:58,020
where there's that Starbucks where like the Rainforest Cafe

1468
01:03:58,020 --> 01:03:59,620
also was that side entrance there.

1469
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,420
I think was Oz for a little while.

1470
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,220
Wow.

1471
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:03,220
That's harder to change.

1472
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:05,620
That's what I like is that they'll get or they'll implode

1473
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:08,620
the big thing but leave little odds and ends.

1474
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:11,620
Little odds and ends all over the place for years.

1475
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:12,420
Oh, yes.

1476
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:12,820
Oh, it's you.

1477
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:15,420
Yes, you enlightened me to one which we'll get to when it's

1478
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:17,220
when we get to the attraction.

1479
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:24,420
The big lion went away because of this odd mythology that

1480
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:29,820
Chinese gamblers didn't like the lion because it was bad luck.

1481
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:33,820
So entering through the lion's mouth felt like, well, I'm not

1482
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:34,820
going to have a good night.

1483
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:38,220
So I'm not going to play here.

1484
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:41,620
Like a giant swath of the population would not set foot

1485
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:45,020
in that place due to the lion and somehow.

1486
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:46,620
Okay.

1487
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,420
What if it's just a big bronze line?

1488
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:49,420
What if it's the big?

1489
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:53,820
What if it's the biggest bronze statue in the US and it's

1490
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:54,620
of a lion?

1491
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:55,620
Yes, that's fine.

1492
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:56,420
That is not bad.

1493
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:57,420
Don't enter through it.

1494
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:59,020
Yeah, I guess that's what it's about.

1495
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,620
Might be the huh?

1496
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:04,120
Yeah, then where the logic kicks in for that culture, which

1497
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,020
I'm not an expert on.

1498
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:08,420
Two story line next to the three story hawk a song.

1499
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:13,020
Yes, the biggest bronze statue still doesn't come close to

1500
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:14,820
just a nightclub billboard.

1501
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,220
There used to be a billboard in Hollywood.

1502
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:20,820
I think for hawk a song like a rotating series billboards

1503
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:24,220
for Vegas Residencies and clubs and I'd be drive by them all

1504
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:24,820
the time.

1505
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:27,820
Yeah, they were always pushing that stuff at us.

1506
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:29,020
It essentially knows.

1507
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:29,420
Yes.

1508
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:31,620
I don't are we going to end up?

1509
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,220
We're going to end up going through Sin City.

1510
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,620
I think without EFX.

1511
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:39,220
I don't think we have time for EFX unless we make a please

1512
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:43,920
make your appeal listeners if you know EFX needs to be done.

1513
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:46,720
But anyway, Lion Lion goes away.

1514
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,020
But still this is just like this is all just to set the

1515
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:51,720
scene of and then you go through these do you open the

1516
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,920
Oz door handles and then find Oz.

1517
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,520
I'm sure the best depiction of Oz anywhere.

1518
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,620
We sort of we know theme parks pretty well.

1519
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,620
We know the great movie ride, of course.

1520
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:07,020
And that's the great movie ride scene of the Wizard of Oz

1521
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:08,220
is spectacular.

1522
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:11,920
It's probably the best part of the great movie ride and yet

1523
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,020
better.

1524
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:14,220
This is this better.

1525
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,020
What's a different?

1526
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:17,520
It's a different part of the move.

1527
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,920
I mean, it's showing a different scene.

1528
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:21,220
I guess it's so I don't know.

1529
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,620
I think there's up there's positives and negatives.

1530
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:27,920
I guess it's I mean, there's you have the like cast of

1531
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,920
hundreds animatronics.

1532
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,320
Yeah, it's it to the great movie ride, which is good.

1533
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,920
The vast array of munchkins you have less animatronics, but

1534
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,920
these animatronics are really fantastic.

1535
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,520
So it's it's the big four.

1536
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,820
Who are your favorite four favorite Wizard of Oz characters?

1537
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:45,220
Me?

1538
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:45,620
I don't know.

1539
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:47,320
I got to go with lion tin man.

1540
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,420
Scary grow.

1541
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:53,820
And the munchkin killing themselves.

1542
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:54,520
And oh yeah, yeah.

1543
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:01,620
An interesting thing that I because there is some good

1544
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:03,820
video footage of walking through this.

1545
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:08,020
There is one really good all the way through well, even

1546
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:09,020
though it's old camcorder.

1547
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:13,120
We're like and it's it's very charming to women walk into

1548
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:15,520
the casino and see the Oz for the first time.

1549
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:19,820
One of them like goes like wow, like like it's so excited

1550
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:20,420
about it.

1551
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,020
It's a real Barb and star.

1552
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:22,620
Yes.

1553
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:23,020
Yeah.

1554
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:25,720
And Barb is one of them actually Barb.

1555
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,720
I watched it last night.

1556
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:30,520
I like have a Barb and Sherry.

1557
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:36,120
Barb and Sherry for sharing your your memories with us

1558
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:38,320
allowing yourselves to be on YouTube and they're having a

1559
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,720
lot of fun and it kind of made me realize a few things

1560
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:42,420
about this one.

1561
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:46,020
Of course the yellow you follow the yellow crude this walk

1562
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:49,920
through was kind of out of the reverse order of the movie

1563
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,020
or like another water like you see Oz first and then you

1564
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:57,020
go to the cornfields and then you go to the scary forest.

1565
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,120
Oh, yeah.

1566
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:00,220
So it's kind of an interesting order.

1567
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:03,220
But the other thing that I think other footage didn't

1568
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,820
reveal was the ticket booth.

1569
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:07,220
Yeah.

1570
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:12,320
So this was a ticketed attraction cash only cash only.

1571
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,020
Wow.

1572
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:14,520
But I funny detail.

1573
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:17,720
I was trying to figure out like I it seemed like maybe the

1574
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:21,420
walkthrough was free and the tickets were for the magic

1575
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:21,920
show.

1576
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,420
Maybe these that sound right.

1577
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,020
Yeah, there might have been a way I could see that being

1578
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:31,320
the case because towards the end of the that specific video

1579
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:34,520
in the walkthrough they're getting close to the Emerald

1580
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,720
Castle or whatever the hell it is and somebody asked for

1581
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:38,320
a ticket.

1582
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:42,520
Okay, so the walkthrough where you see like a lot of the

1583
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,720
animatronics was probably free and then there's a ticketed

1584
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:49,520
point so you could maybe just bail after well, and then

1585
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,420
that's the thing that we've talked about a essentially a

1586
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,720
queue where then you don't do the attraction.

1587
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,920
It was possible there and look it does it does seem like a

1588
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:58,420
good one.

1589
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:01,320
Yeah, maybe this is the unskippable unskippable queue.

1590
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,020
I would say that that's that's right.

1591
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:11,120
So yeah, Emerald City is huge balloon going up and down.

1592
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:15,720
What's like I mean, it's not like the scenes are super

1593
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,220
memorable.

1594
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:18,820
It's just that you get still versions of the characters and

1595
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:22,120
then you go along this path and you meet really well done

1596
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:24,920
animatronics of all of them and you're two feet away and

1597
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,020
you could tell even in old in old camcorder footage.

1598
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:29,320
You could tell if these were not good, but they're really

1599
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:29,720
good.

1600
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:30,620
They're really good.

1601
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:33,720
What seems like the best is that if you if you guys will

1602
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,920
watch these these videos, I was very impressed by the wicked

1603
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:37,420
witch.

1604
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:40,220
Yeah, I think that might be number one.

1605
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,620
Yeah, that that's that just seems exactly like the actual

1606
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,720
actress and from the film.

1607
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:49,720
Yeah, it's I don't I they're all pretty good.

1608
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,620
Which one is the most memorable probably also because that's

1609
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:56,520
the most scary character and it's burned in my child brain

1610
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:57,020
forever.

1611
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:58,320
Sure.

1612
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,420
So took like confront and they kind of hide her you sir around

1613
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:03,020
a corner behind a tree.

1614
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:04,220
And yeah, no shit.

1615
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,820
But yeah, the whole thing it's not that even it's just the

1616
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:10,420
whole thing and it's because of the video I'm sure is adding

1617
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:15,320
some ambience because it's old the foot it's old but the vibe

1618
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,320
is correct for this eerie feeling.

1619
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,620
I would have every time I watched the Wizard of Oz, which

1620
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:22,920
I loved as a kid, but and I probably said this before the

1621
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,320
movies is weird.

1622
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:28,020
It's got a weird air like air vibe going on through the whole

1623
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:32,320
thing and I'm not like a I don't want to say it's not pleasure.

1624
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,120
That's not correct, but it's not like a relaxing.

1625
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,220
No movie.

1626
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:40,220
No, it's not edgy to me very edgy and you'd want the same

1627
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:40,820
way growing up.

1628
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:44,320
Yeah, I don't know anybody who was like, oh the wizard.

1629
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,920
Just put that on kick your feet back and that's a pleasant

1630
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,920
thing to fall asleep to know is always like, oh, that's the

1631
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,220
scenes coming up where I'm going to hate it and like it would

1632
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:56,820
be you feel forget what's when and where like, yeah, because

1633
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,320
how many characters has she gathered by the time the scary

1634
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,220
trees happen?

1635
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,120
Yeah, wait, do we still shit?

1636
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,220
She's got scarecrow.

1637
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,120
Yeah, for a lot of kids.

1638
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,920
It's probably the first film of your life.

1639
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:08,220
You know what?

1640
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:11,320
I mean, you see a lot of like movies, you know, just like

1641
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:14,220
like casual like yeah, I'll throw on all over in company for

1642
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:14,520
a minute.

1643
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,120
I'll throw on a lot of sure.

1644
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,720
Yeah, all the fucking shit our kids watching right now.

1645
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,620
All the non movies baby.

1646
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:22,520
Talk about AI.

1647
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,220
Oh my God.

1648
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:25,120
Yeah, that's the future.

1649
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,820
Our kids seeing the future of a.

1650
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:30,720
It's horrendous, but I feel like Wizard of Oz is probably

1651
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,620
one of the first films, you know, like like a really

1652
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:38,020
respected movie like a fi type top 100 to that you actually

1653
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:43,720
sit in your entry for many years aired around Easter on

1654
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:44,220
TV.

1655
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:44,920
Is that right?

1656
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,420
Oh, am I remembering that?

1657
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:48,220
Christmas maybe Easter.

1658
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,020
I think of me.

1659
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:52,420
I'm in step Thanksgiving.

1660
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:55,020
Is it a big it's all day on Thanksgiving?

1661
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,520
What is what holiday is Arbor Day?

1662
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,520
I know I was in the trees.

1663
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,520
I just remember there was a reverse of it.

1664
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,220
That makes me want to chop all trees down.

1665
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:04,720
That's true.

1666
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,620
This Arbor Day.

1667
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:07,020
Let's get rid of all Arbor.

1668
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:10,820
Just there was one holiday and I remember every year flipping

1669
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,420
channels and landing on whatever broadcast network and it's

1670
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:17,620
like, oh yeah, Wizard of Oz every year Thanksgiving.

1671
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:18,420
I think it's Thanksgiving.

1672
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:18,820
Okay.

1673
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:19,320
Yeah.

1674
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:22,020
The vibe though, that's that's like even the carrot like,

1675
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:24,520
you know, there's a close-up of Ray Bolger's face and you're

1676
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,520
like, I like this guy, but this is creeping me out his

1677
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,120
makeup and the whole thing.

1678
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,820
So like watching that's killing them.

1679
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:34,620
The makeup is destroying their size.

1680
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:36,320
I was reading about this last night.

1681
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:40,020
I talked about this with my dad because his buddy Epson is

1682
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:41,120
who it happened to.

1683
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:41,520
Right.

1684
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:45,820
He was replaced and so he was already recast as a Scarecrow

1685
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,920
at first and then he was cast as a Tin Man.

1686
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,620
There's a lot of photos of him in the Tin Man outfit and then

1687
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:55,820
he had a severe allergic reaction to aluminum dust breathing

1688
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:57,120
in aluminum dust.

1689
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,620
It almost killed him.

1690
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:04,020
And so they're the same kind of paint on like do they use

1691
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:04,920
the same paint?

1692
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:07,620
They switch for the replacement.

1693
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:11,920
They did aluminum paste so that he wasn't free.

1694
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,920
Still aluminum.

1695
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:17,820
Still aluminum.

1696
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,020
It was a paste not paint.

1697
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,720
So it was fine.

1698
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:21,620
But there's an outtakes.

1699
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:24,220
There is you can hear Buddy Epson sing If I Only Had a

1700
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:28,020
Heart on YouTube and there is an ensemble number in the

1701
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:31,820
movie where it is his voice.

1702
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:32,620
Really?

1703
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:33,420
They still use it?

1704
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:33,920
Wow.

1705
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,420
Still makes it in.

1706
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:36,920
That's like seeing the you know,

1707
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:39,020
Eric Stoltz's hand in one shot.

1708
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:41,120
Yes, it is exactly like that.

1709
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:44,320
So yeah, when I say that it's like the walkthrough.

1710
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:48,420
I when you see the walkthrough like something like this,

1711
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:51,020
you know why they put in ride vehicles because they have to

1712
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:54,520
move people through versus you wanting to live in it for a

1713
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:57,820
while because like if the Haunted Mansion was a walkthrough

1714
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,120
people would just be standing around because they want to

1715
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,620
they want to soak it in a little more.

1716
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:03,120
Yeah.

1717
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,520
Well except though.

1718
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,520
I mean like aficionados of themed entertainment maybe but

1719
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,720
just regular Vegas folks.

1720
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:13,620
I don't know because one of the videos I watched there's a

1721
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:16,320
like it's a guy filming and he's with his wife or something

1722
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,720
and she's just blasting through and he's like wait,

1723
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,420
stop stop.

1724
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:22,520
This is she's going to start talking like they like she's

1725
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:25,520
doesn't even it doesn't occur to her that Dorothy is going

1726
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,620
to do something.

1727
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:26,920
Yeah.

1728
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:31,320
Well, I there's the Vegas goers maybe aren't lingering like

1729
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,520
the theme park people.

1730
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:33,020
Sure.

1731
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,120
That's I guess what I'm saying.

1732
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,720
I feel like this like I feel like it hit a really specific.

1733
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:39,620
I don't know if adults cared about this and maybe not at all

1734
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:42,320
because they obviously got rid of it really quickly.

1735
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:47,120
But I think if you took one of those trips when Vegas was

1736
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:50,120
family-oriented, I think this stuck in your head forever.

1737
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:56,120
And I even saw on our patreon Marnie sure said something in

1738
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,720
voting for this one to be the Club 3.

1739
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:02,720
I talk about the Wizard of Oz MGM Grand experience so often

1740
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,920
that it came up in conversation literally yesterday.

1741
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,920
Nothing made a greater impression on my young mind and

1742
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,420
nothing ever will again.

1743
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:10,020
Wow.

1744
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:15,920
This lasted with people so like I think our generation is

1745
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,620
just more predisposed to like this kind of thing and we fix

1746
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:22,420
it on this kind of thing and go and where was it and what

1747
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:26,120
day and how long was that around and I don't know.

1748
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,620
We're just we're the animatronic generation.

1749
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:30,320
That's I think that's right.

1750
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:33,520
Well animatronics and just the ubiquitous nature.

1751
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,620
We joke about the tin lunchboxes, but everywhere my family

1752
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:41,320
went on a trip for like a day trip or a long weekend the

1753
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:46,120
kind of souvenir shop selling like gadgets and gizmo.

1754
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:50,820
It's a wall of Elvis tin lunchbox Betty Boop Wizard of

1755
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:51,220
Oz.

1756
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:53,420
So it was just always around.

1757
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:54,420
These are the big ones.

1758
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:54,820
Yeah.

1759
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:55,220
Yeah.

1760
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:56,920
Lucy.

1761
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:57,620
I love Lucy.

1762
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,720
Yeah, always.

1763
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:04,720
So, you know, like you're saying Jason starts it starts a

1764
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:07,820
little friendly but then gets spooky and you and of course

1765
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:10,920
like I'm pretty sure I did this.

1766
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:14,120
I'm pretty sure I was in here when I was a kid didn't, you

1767
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:18,620
know, hit me as hard as Marnie I guess but I was like why

1768
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:20,520
don't when we were looking at video of it the other day

1769
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:23,420
like why doesn't the God this thing is so much grander better

1770
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:27,120
done than I thought and maybe I blocked it out because of

1771
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,520
the goddamn trees.

1772
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,120
Oh, right.

1773
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:32,920
As soon as I we went as we're watching the video together as

1774
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,620
soon as it hit the and I'm not joking.

1775
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:37,920
I'm not just like, you know, doing a bit about now as soon

1776
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,720
as one showed up like out out.

1777
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:40,220
I'm out.

1778
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:42,120
Yeah, I hate those trees.

1779
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,920
I when I started watching I was like, I wonder if there's

1780
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:46,920
scary trees in this and I saw it.

1781
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,220
I was like, oh man, Scott's got to have to talk about the

1782
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:49,820
scary tree.

1783
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:53,520
Aaron reaching for the emergency can of like Coppola winery

1784
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,920
Sophia Rose.

1785
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,520
We got to go higher than Coppola.

1786
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,420
That's an emergency.

1787
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:01,620
When you keep it in the cow.

1788
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:03,920
That's our version of an Epi pen.

1789
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,520
Just get him something.

1790
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,520
We'll get you better wine later.

1791
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:15,120
But yeah, that can we can't raise the what's his name test

1792
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:15,520
Parker.

1793
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,120
We can't wait to test park.

1794
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,920
Yeah, yeah, buddy.

1795
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,420
Ups and pal fest Park.

1796
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:21,120
Yeah.

1797
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,820
Yeah, don't like it.

1798
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:25,920
I don't and it's in that voice.

1799
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:26,720
Dear God.

1800
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,220
Oh, yeah.

1801
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,820
Should like that voice though.

1802
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,220
It's so up your alley.

1803
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:33,920
That's true.

1804
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,020
And I like doing it.

1805
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:35,620
I know.

1806
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:36,120
Yeah.

1807
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:37,920
Whatever you know, I agree.

1808
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:43,720
He's like, I guess it sounds like like the MGM Grand Show

1809
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,320
that one of you and your mom.

1810
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:46,920
Oh, yes.

1811
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:47,620
Yeah.

1812
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:48,520
Oh, yeah.

1813
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,420
This came up in the episode.

1814
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:53,620
Watch this terrible like Blacklight show where there was

1815
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:56,320
like some repeating it for the eyes, but you haven't heard

1816
01:17:56,320 --> 01:18:00,220
it Aaron the that there was like a an astronaut with a cord

1817
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:04,920
in this show is at the MGM Grand and then a director yells

1818
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:09,120
cut and then some scissors show up as if to cut the astronaut

1819
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,120
off from his supply and connection to the spaceship and

1820
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,220
then you're the same voice say not that kind of cut.

1821
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:21,620
Law way back in there taking up space in my head since I was

1822
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:22,120
eight.

1823
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:22,620
Wow.

1824
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:26,020
Just like Figaro pulling the signs from the last time you

1825
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:26,720
were with us.

1826
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,820
This shit is why this podcast has to happen.

1827
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:32,520
I just like you got to get it out and just get and get

1828
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:36,020
revenge on the world by planting these things that wasting

1829
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:40,020
adult brain space, right adult brain space of strangers.

1830
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:41,420
Now you have this.

1831
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,620
Yeah, you're forcing your bad memories on them.

1832
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:48,020
Yeah, this podcast is mostly a spite show.

1833
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:49,920
Yeah.

1834
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:52,620
You want to make me watch weird things and learn weird

1835
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:54,420
things that I'm a kid world.

1836
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:57,320
Well take this a specific group of really nice seeming

1837
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:57,820
people.

1838
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:02,420
This is true.

1839
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:05,020
First, I'm going to give you my facts.

1840
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:10,920
Did you did everyone when they were kids?

1841
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,220
I was obsessed with the idea of like gambling and slot

1842
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:17,920
machines, but a casino is a like kind of a scary ish place

1843
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,320
in a lot of ways noise wise and just smoke wise.

1844
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,220
They're scary when you're a kid.

1845
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:22,620
Yeah, for sure.

1846
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:25,420
So it's like to have the Emerald City and then have it

1847
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:27,620
be this scary atmosphere and in addition have another

1848
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:30,020
scary just on the outskirts of the Emerald City.

1849
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,320
There's an even scarier place where the adults are all

1850
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,420
losing their money and they're drunk and it's like an

1851
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:36,720
extra level of it.

1852
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,420
Frosting that's happening too.

1853
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:41,320
Yes, they don't stop short at just the scary cake.

1854
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,920
Yeah, it's like you get past those cowardly lines like

1855
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,120
don't go past here like don't like don't is weird with

1856
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,220
at one point you get two views of them, but you pass by

1857
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:53,620
cowardly lion and Tin Man talking and scared and him

1858
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:57,220
like go but then you're looking like through several

1859
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:58,320
layers of bushes.

1860
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,420
You just see distant slot machines and ash.

1861
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:04,820
Yeah, which just land here that you're barely catching

1862
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:07,820
like these characters from from behind and they're scared

1863
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:10,220
and yeah, what are all those people doing?

1864
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:13,520
And yeah, so so if you were a kid, I think that almost

1865
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,220
that amplifies it to some degree because it's just like

1866
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:18,120
this juxtaposition of two scary.

1867
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,420
You think maybe the lack of full immersiveness actually

1868
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:22,920
adds to this experience.

1869
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:26,020
It adds to it and not in the way they wanted but in a way

1870
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:27,720
I feel like if you were a kid, it would have been an

1871
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,320
extra level of like this is for the adult.

1872
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:32,920
This is the adult place on the outskirts of a scary place

1873
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:35,120
that I like with some friends of mine.

1874
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,720
Yeah, so it has an extra level.

1875
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:40,020
I do think it's like I don't know.

1876
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:42,820
We'll probably sum up but like it's in the wrong.

1877
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:43,820
It's in the wrong spot.

1878
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:46,020
We know that it shouldn't be in the lobby of a big

1879
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:48,620
casino where a bunch of adults are just going like I just

1880
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:51,920
want to fucking win some money and I'm tired and like

1881
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,020
it's not the place where I get my free well vodka.

1882
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:55,420
Yeah.

1883
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:56,020
Yeah.

1884
01:20:56,020 --> 01:21:00,220
So but yeah, the have that sort of be how it's set up is

1885
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:00,920
interesting.

1886
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:05,620
Isn't it amazing that they tried like the risk of all and

1887
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:07,720
all the things that we're going to talk about like it's

1888
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:13,720
so nuts that Vegas took this swing and like would all

1889
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:14,620
this stuff work?

1890
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:18,220
The only way to find out is to spend more money than we've

1891
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:23,820
ever spent to get Disney caliber ride creators and art

1892
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:28,220
directors and like they most bits and pieces of MGM Grand

1893
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:31,720
Adventures seem like cruddy low budget but across if you're

1894
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:36,020
looking at the entire trend of Vegas family stuff, some of

1895
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:39,720
it is so high end for something that was only there for like

1896
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,720
a year and a half.

1897
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:41,620
It's crazy.

1898
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:42,020
Yes.

1899
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:42,520
Yeah.

1900
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:45,420
I always thought we talked a little bit like I get why they

1901
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:49,020
tried it but in this instance, this is truly like just trying

1902
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:53,620
to cram a thing in another thing like two things that are

1903
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:56,120
competing for its audience.

1904
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,720
Like these are two different audiences and they're both

1905
01:21:58,720 --> 01:21:58,920
right.

1906
01:21:58,920 --> 01:21:59,220
Right.

1907
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:01,620
And one right up next to each other than the other.

1908
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:03,320
This was very strong.

1909
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,320
I know it was the runner-up but I will say I saw the

1910
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,120
Caesars statue show.

1911
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:07,520
Yeah.

1912
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:07,820
Yeah.

1913
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:10,620
And same thing because you have a lot of people who are who

1914
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:13,820
just want to shop and shop expensive shit like you have

1915
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:17,620
people there who like are so annoyed that suddenly there's

1916
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:20,820
a huge show that people are flocking to and the lights are

1917
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:24,420
dim and it's really hard to get around that main hub.

1918
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:27,520
There's a big hub with lots of story.

1919
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,320
You have to pass through that to get to other areas within

1920
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:30,920
the shops.

1921
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:33,020
Oh, that's fascinating.

1922
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:33,320
Yeah.

1923
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:33,520
Yeah.

1924
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:34,020
It gets here.

1925
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:36,420
It's the people are walking by with a ton of bags and a bunch

1926
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:37,820
of kids stop in front of me.

1927
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:41,120
Excuse me, you know, like bumping into as like you're

1928
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,020
trying to watch the show or it.

1929
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:43,820
Yeah.

1930
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:44,020
Yeah.

1931
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:45,120
Very similar thing.

1932
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,520
Yeah.

1933
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,820
Where it's just like I get why they tried.

1934
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:52,120
I still I think that there's a better version of it now and

1935
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:55,120
I've said this before because we we're all grown up where the

1936
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,420
animatronic generation, which is a thing we should start

1937
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:58,320
saying now.

1938
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:00,320
Yeah, actually that is a ring to it, isn't it?

1939
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:00,620
Yeah.

1940
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:01,220
Yeah.

1941
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:02,620
That's a nice nice term.

1942
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,120
I like it's the one thing that binds us all.

1943
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,720
We have that's what we have for that to ageing.

1944
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:08,520
Millennial.

1945
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:09,520
Oh, yeah.

1946
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:11,720
I'm not loving that one.

1947
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,420
Don't lump me in with all that.

1948
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,020
Isn't there another more specific term something millennial?

1949
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:18,520
Is it it's a geriatric millennial?

1950
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:21,720
No, you're a geriatric millennial.

1951
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,020
Yeah, that's not what we are.

1952
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:26,220
We saw most generations of animatronics.

1953
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:28,220
We saw some scary older ones.

1954
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:30,420
We saw ones where they're getting we've seen it all.

1955
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:32,220
We've seen it all.

1956
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:34,920
And we've all were at the end of days with animatronics in

1957
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:37,720
some ways, which says sad because the Chuck E.

1958
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:39,920
The beloved Chuck animatronics are gone.

1959
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:40,120
Sure.

1960
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:41,520
But sometimes new ones show up.

1961
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,920
Hey, we also seen the highest end, you know, Honda.

1962
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:44,520
That's true.

1963
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:44,920
You're right.

1964
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:45,420
He's new.

1965
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:46,020
Sure.

1966
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:46,520
Yeah.

1967
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,820
And we've seen the many Johnny Depp.

1968
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:49,620
That's true.

1969
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:52,320
We saw the golden era of activations.

1970
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,620
Do people talk about activations anymore?

1971
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:56,320
I think so.

1972
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:56,620
Yeah.

1973
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:57,120
Okay.

1974
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,720
Immersives activations.

1975
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:00,320
Those are all sort of in the same family.

1976
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:01,320
It's all in the umbrella.

1977
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:01,920
Yeah.

1978
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:07,520
But the okay, so when you go, this is the part I sort

1979
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,220
of recalled the walkthrough, but I did not recall that

1980
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:14,020
the point of it ultimately is to get you to well, first

1981
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:16,820
of all, to the dead center where things get scarier and

1982
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:20,320
scarier and there is a thunderstorm that is really well

1983
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:27,320
done and then legit unsettling and then laser animated

1984
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:28,820
birds go by.

1985
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:30,320
That's really nuts.

1986
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:31,020
What were you saying?

1987
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:32,120
Jason about the wisdom?

1988
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,420
Is there a flying witch?

1989
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:36,120
So I thought one of the ones someone said there's the

1990
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:39,220
witch, but now that you say laser animated bird, it's a

1991
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:40,520
little hard to make out.

1992
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:43,720
It could be there's some like, is it some distant prop

1993
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:47,720
or something on a distant projection on the ceiling?

1994
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:48,020
Okay.

1995
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:48,120
Okay.

1996
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:53,720
So feeling the cloud ceilings as a kid, I was always

1997
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:58,720
fascinated when I saw clips of Vegas attractions or casinos

1998
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:02,720
and then it eventually saw it in the Caesar's Palace in

1999
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:03,520
Atlantic City.

2000
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,220
But I love the cloud ceilings because it was just a thing

2001
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:09,720
that Disney didn't do, you know?

2002
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:10,520
Yeah, true.

2003
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:10,920
Yeah.

2004
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:13,020
Maybe here and there, but yeah, like environments are

2005
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:14,720
supposed to hang for a long time.

2006
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:19,120
There's see it like clouds on the Pirates by the blue Bayou.

2007
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:23,620
I mean, yeah, here and there, but I big daytime cloud

2008
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:23,920
scene.

2009
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:24,320
Right.

2010
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,720
Very Vegas night time.

2011
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,520
Probably a few years ago.

2012
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:33,720
I think I was in like a photo up in Disney World where you

2013
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:35,420
were going by a barn.

2014
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:39,120
There was like a barmen of fake crops and stuff to like

2015
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:42,320
get to take a photo with Mickey or something and I was

2016
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:46,520
like, oh, it's cloud ceilings like the you know, like the

2017
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:47,220
casinos.

2018
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:48,120
Yeah, right.

2019
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:48,520
Right.

2020
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:52,720
Well, there was also and again, I asked you, Darren, if

2021
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:56,720
this was still going the first time you went but not just

2022
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,920
the cloud ceilings when you enter this but once you're

2023
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,020
done with it or if you're just going straight into the

2024
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:04,720
casino, which was most people do you have were you ever

2025
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,820
there when the ceiling looks like this?

2026
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:07,520
Wow.

2027
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,020
Rainbow casino.

2028
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:10,520
This was the original.

2029
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:13,620
This is this is what that main wing entrance wing looked

2030
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:14,720
like in 93.

2031
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:18,820
You know, I'm not I'm not sure it's amazing.

2032
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:19,320
Yeah.

2033
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:19,820
Yeah.

2034
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:22,520
It's very like Sanrio Puroland.

2035
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,620
Yes, very pure land.

2036
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:25,220
Yeah.

2037
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:28,320
And there's a couple I mean somewhere over the rainbow.

2038
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:32,920
There's that and then there's also a rainbow projection or

2039
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:36,420
see lights or painting on the ceiling.

2040
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:37,420
Right, right.

2041
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:37,720
Yeah.

2042
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:38,120
Yeah.

2043
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:39,520
Above the Emerald City.

2044
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,020
So that yeah, that center but the fact that it's not just

2045
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:45,820
like facade distant Emerald City that you can get right up

2046
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:49,520
to it and then that houses a magic show.

2047
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:50,820
Oh my God.

2048
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:53,520
And I didn't think I remembered that but one.

2049
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,120
Okay, this is where the videos get tough and where we don't

2050
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:58,820
have a lot to say about the magic show because you got to

2051
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:00,020
turn off your cameras.

2052
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:02,120
I think one of those videos says that on screen had to turn

2053
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:06,020
my camera off so long, but you see enough of the vibe and

2054
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:10,220
it's this green tinted laboratory reminiscent of like

2055
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:14,720
the Wizards workshop or whatever and it's vials and old

2056
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:15,420
library books.

2057
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:20,120
I have always had this distant memory of seeing a magic show

2058
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:23,020
in Vegas when I was a kid, but I was like how because it

2059
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:26,720
wasn't a thing where you could it couldn't have been like

2060
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,920
a late thing where you could drink and now I realized it

2061
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:31,520
was this I did this whatever was going on in there.

2062
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:34,920
I think it was it must have been like kind of brief magic

2063
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:35,720
shows, right?

2064
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:39,220
It probably was not like a full hours worth of entertainment.

2065
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:41,220
This might have been like 15 20 minutes.

2066
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:41,720
Yeah.

2067
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,120
Yeah, I think that's the deal.

2068
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:46,020
But once I saw the room and realized I'd been in the room.

2069
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:49,920
So I did see whatever this was called the Wizards secrets is

2070
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,520
what this like hidden laboratory was.

2071
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:55,820
The secret is that he's a he's a he's got a wizard man.

2072
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:57,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and in her dream.

2073
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,620
He is a both a con man and a liar.

2074
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:01,620
He's getting the F out of here.

2075
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:02,520
He's in the balloon.

2076
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:06,220
He's getting out of this room looks incredible like really

2077
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:09,620
intimate really detailed like pretty Disney style.

2078
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:12,220
You would really accept that is like, yeah, it feels like

2079
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:16,720
the pre-show room in Tower of Terror or something or Matt.

2080
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:20,920
It has real Magic Castle like little side theater room

2081
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:21,820
extremely.

2082
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:23,820
Yeah, which and that's good for Magic.

2083
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:26,220
You're you're close to whatever and I don't remember what

2084
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:26,820
it was.

2085
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:31,620
All I remember is that it was building to some particularly

2086
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:35,520
big illusion that when it happened, I didn't know how it

2087
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:35,920
happened.

2088
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,820
And then I must have been with my mom and she explained to

2089
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:40,820
me here was a premise for the first time in my life.

2090
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:44,320
Like that was the art of distraction because like remember

2091
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,020
when they were building the big thing and then somebody yelled

2092
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:48,820
or there was a big thunderclap in the back and everybody

2093
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:51,920
turned their heads and looked this way and then back in the

2094
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,020
center or whatever the thing was had happened.

2095
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:54,220
Right.

2096
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:57,120
That's all I vaguely remember about it is that it was some

2097
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:01,720
hey look over here and and then something huge happened and

2098
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:03,820
that's a neat thing to discover when you're a kid.

2099
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:04,320
Yeah.

2100
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:04,720
Yeah.

2101
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:05,120
Sure.

2102
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:08,420
Yeah, I love I just thinking about how your brain blocked

2103
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:11,120
out the trees and the magic show remains.

2104
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:14,020
That's interesting to me only barely but I didn't connect it

2105
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:14,820
to this.

2106
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:18,120
Yeah, like vaguely remembered the room and the eerie green

2107
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:20,220
hint of the room, but I didn't remember anything that

2108
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:22,920
happened in there other than than getting distracted.

2109
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:23,520
Right, right.

2110
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,620
And my mom ruining magic for me.

2111
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:28,420
So she told you that day what happened.

2112
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:29,120
Yeah, I think so.

2113
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,820
Okay, I just want to that was at least her idea of how

2114
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:35,020
whatever the thing was but did anyone see anything else in

2115
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:38,020
a video of have we have we mentioned everything?

2116
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:39,720
Am I missing any details here?

2117
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:42,720
Yeah, I'm trying to think if there's anything else.

2118
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:44,520
I don't think so.

2119
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,020
I mean, it's pretty it's well-documented compared to some

2120
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:50,820
other Vegas stuff but not like comprehensively.

2121
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:52,620
It's like a Disney ride or something.

2122
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:56,520
I think there was a gift shop that then after they tore this

2123
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,020
down moved around.

2124
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:01,720
Yes, was yes, the gift shop remained for many many years.

2125
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:07,620
Yeah, there's a it's the there's this shopping corridor.

2126
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:11,620
That's like the forgotten basement sort of of the MGM

2127
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:11,920
Grand.

2128
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,420
It's the corridor that you take to get to the self-parking

2129
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:17,320
and for a while also to the original monorail entrance.

2130
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:20,920
That's where I think that's where like the that Brad

2131
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,920
Garrett's comedy club is.

2132
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:27,120
And that's where you could get like IVs, you know, if you

2133
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:29,920
had too much to drink the night before you could get,

2134
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,320
you know, like vitamin B replenishment.

2135
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,620
I didn't realize this was possible and the Jason brought

2136
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:36,720
this up and I thought that there's no way they there's

2137
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:39,420
like three or four on this strip at this needle.

2138
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:41,520
But no, yeah, you get stabbed with a needle.

2139
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:42,520
That's crazy.

2140
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,620
It's pretty I think that's pretty hot right now.

2141
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:47,420
I think you can have them like if you're willing to pay

2142
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:49,220
for it for like bachelor parties and stuff.

2143
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:51,720
If you're like staying somewhere like at a house you

2144
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:53,620
can have like a couple of nurses come over.

2145
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:54,220
Yeah.

2146
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:54,620
Yeah.

2147
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:55,020
Yeah.

2148
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:57,120
Well, are they sexy nurses?

2149
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,720
No, just like professional.

2150
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:00,820
They're just professional RNs.

2151
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:02,920
Yeah, that would be a really good thing.

2152
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:05,020
Professional RNs could be sexy too Jason.

2153
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:06,620
Fine professionalism sexy.

2154
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:08,620
So yes, they're sexy nurses.

2155
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:09,620
Show Wang.

2156
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:14,020
Should we all get injected and vaing?

2157
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:16,220
Is this our new experience we need to have?

2158
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:18,320
I've never done it.

2159
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:20,720
Wait, we can just get B vitamins.

2160
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:23,620
You could also electrolytes and B vitamins.

2161
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:25,320
They might come to your room.

2162
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:26,020
You could get it.

2163
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:28,220
If you don't want the IV like you could just get a quick

2164
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:28,720
shot.

2165
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,620
And the idea is that this gets in your system a lot faster

2166
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:32,620
than drinking it.

2167
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:35,020
Yeah, it's like a hangover cure.

2168
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:38,920
So if you had too many well drinks or cold drinks at the

2169
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,920
slot machines or the tables, you know, but would the idea

2170
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,520
be that like you'll be like, oh my God, it's gone in 10

2171
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:45,420
minutes or something.

2172
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:46,120
Is that the idea?

2173
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:47,220
That's the idea.

2174
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:49,720
I think my brother-in-law has had it done before.

2175
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:53,720
I have a memory of him going in at least to get the shots.

2176
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:54,220
Okay.

2177
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:54,620
Okay.

2178
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:57,920
But anyway, that's the shady corridor.

2179
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:00,120
It's always been just like that.

2180
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:03,520
If you it's the place that you don't want to be.

2181
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,420
It's the it's the least grand part of the MGM grand.

2182
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:07,620
It feels very old.

2183
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:08,620
The ceilings are low.

2184
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:12,420
It's kind of weird, but that's where all the remnants of the

2185
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:14,820
Wizard of Oz stuff was when I was going there.

2186
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:18,620
Like that's where the last bits of it decayed for a while.

2187
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:20,020
And one was a big gift shop.

2188
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:22,320
No entrance Wizard of Oz thing gone.

2189
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:26,620
What like 95 96, I think but this still but like there was

2190
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:30,320
still like you had to just like Wizard of Oz footprint in the

2191
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,620
corridor that takes you to the self parking where all the

2192
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:35,820
crap is and what doesn't it's it's isn't there like a very

2193
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:38,520
pervasive subway smell subway sandwiches.

2194
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:41,820
There was a subway and there was a hot dog cart to okay.

2195
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:43,520
And the very end of it really traps.

2196
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:48,020
Yeah, that really smell the buns just absorbed the smell.

2197
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:50,120
That's where the flavor is Jason.

2198
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:52,020
You didn't work at a subway or anything in college.

2199
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:53,920
Did you know I didn't work at a subway?

2200
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:57,820
Okay, we don't I didn't work at the BJ subs between the

2201
01:32:57,820 --> 01:33:02,120
West Tower and the East Tower sandwiches you've ever tasted.

2202
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,220
I was going to say shout out to BJ's, but maybe they don't

2203
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,520
shout down to BJ's.

2204
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:12,720
Or the what do you how would you say like the the cappuccino

2205
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:16,520
premixed cappuccino machines from the gas station.

2206
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:21,220
I did live on those sorts of like push the button fill up

2207
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:21,820
the cup.

2208
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:24,520
I did live on those when I pulled all nighters, you know

2209
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:27,020
finishing from BJ's you mean from BJ's.

2210
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:28,920
You have a same gas station cappuccino.

2211
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:31,320
Yeah, and that I feel like when I moved to the other side

2212
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:34,520
of campus, that's when Red Bull was catching on which I

2213
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:37,620
really don't like the taste of but sometimes would grin

2214
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:39,720
and bear it, you know, how many all nighters did you pull

2215
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:40,920
in college handful?

2216
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,920
Got I tried to not zero.

2217
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:47,720
Nice.

2218
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:51,220
No one one one night, but it wasn't and it was more of my

2219
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:55,120
friend Kia and I stayed up all night just like having fun

2220
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:58,420
and then we found out that the name for dusk but in the

2221
01:33:58,420 --> 01:33:59,920
morning is civil Twilight.

2222
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:03,520
So we called that day civil Twilight and yeah, I heard

2223
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,220
that cute.

2224
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:07,320
Yeah, we called like that that night like the first night

2225
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:08,520
that we like really hung out.

2226
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,920
It was just like yeah, like we're good friends.

2227
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,420
We called simple Twilight.

2228
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:13,920
Oh, we stayed up all night.

2229
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,720
Hey, Kia friend of this day.

2230
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:16,520
Kia.

2231
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:21,820
But yeah, Emerald City gift shop remained neon follow the

2232
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:23,920
yellow brick Road sign in the window.

2233
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:29,520
Just really weird that like, okay with it.

2234
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,920
We have realized we don't we need all the square footage

2235
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:35,320
we can get for like more slot machines for restaurants for

2236
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:37,020
nightclothes fill in all this stuff.

2237
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:39,920
That's just like fun little flourishes start making more

2238
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,020
money and I guess this was a gift shop.

2239
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:45,120
However, it seems really strange that in increasingly

2240
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:49,220
unfamily Vegas, they still need a place to sell like little

2241
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:51,220
porcelain Glinda's.

2242
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,820
We need to have that all the time.

2243
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:57,120
Yeah, and yeah a lot of Ruby slippers not that you could

2244
01:34:57,120 --> 01:35:00,720
actually wear but like little figurines of Ruby slippers.

2245
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:03,020
Yeah, they probably a good grandma kind of present.

2246
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:05,620
Yes, that's where it strikes me is that like well, that's

2247
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:10,420
completely for the old ladies doing their Vegas trips like

2248
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:12,720
they probably they're spending a lot of time in there.

2249
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:16,220
Yeah, maybe Michael Jackson when he was I have that one.

2250
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:16,920
I have that one.

2251
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:17,920
I have three of those.

2252
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:20,320
I have seven of those each munchkin.

2253
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,420
He had all the munchkins in.

2254
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:23,920
I know all of their names.

2255
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,420
Yeah, and he was yellow.

2256
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:30,520
Mustache bigger mustache.

2257
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:32,420
He was personal friends with all of them.

2258
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:37,320
I assume to Jackson befriended each living munchkin.

2259
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:37,520
Act.

2260
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:38,620
Yeah, probably correct.

2261
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:39,820
It seems right.

2262
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:40,820
That feels very Michael.

2263
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:41,220
Yeah.

2264
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:41,720
Yeah.

2265
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:47,120
So this thing disappears other than the store at some point

2266
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:48,820
in time Toto got stolen.

2267
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,320
Yes took Toto out of there.

2268
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,720
Although then I watched a news report about it thinking.

2269
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:56,820
Ooh good clips and I was like this is all fake.

2270
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:57,920
This is a bunch of crap.

2271
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:01,820
This must this is like a coordinated PR attempt from the

2272
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:03,020
MGM grand.

2273
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:05,820
Everybody was like acting in it a little bit too much.

2274
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:07,720
That's what the news anchor is even like.

2275
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,420
Was this a publicity stunt?

2276
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:12,820
Well, I can't say probably like he seems like it when they

2277
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:15,020
interview the kidnappers and they all have bags on their

2278
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:15,320
heads.

2279
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:17,320
Yeah, it's very given Toto a tour.

2280
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:22,420
It's very cutesy like sending fake ransom photos of Toto

2281
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:24,620
bags on their heads was a paper.

2282
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:25,520
Last resort.

2283
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,120
Did they shave him and turn him into ass bite?

2284
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:32,520
Look at this knucklehead.

2285
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,620
But he steals dogs.

2286
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:37,220
And is gay.

2287
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:41,620
And also as always.

2288
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:45,820
Yeah, but then but other than that Wizard of Oz stuff kind

2289
01:36:45,820 --> 01:36:47,020
of disappears.

2290
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,520
Mostly is gone by the time you're there, but there's still

2291
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:54,520
a lot of dumb family stuff for you to enjoy and for these

2292
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:55,820
formative years to happen in.

2293
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,020
I don't okay.

2294
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:58,820
Look, we've been going for a long time.

2295
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:03,220
I don't know that I have time to do a lot of the stuff that

2296
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:03,820
I have here.

2297
01:37:03,820 --> 01:37:06,920
But let's so let me just let me do the speed round of it.

2298
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:09,320
Yeah, because there's one other big way that the Wizard of

2299
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:12,820
Oz characters factored into the MGM grand and that is the

2300
01:37:12,820 --> 01:37:18,520
opening ceremony the December 18th 1983 opening ceremony.

2301
01:37:18,820 --> 01:37:20,620
We love our opening ceremonies.

2302
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:23,620
Yeah, this is this is some real Scott and Aaron YouTube

2303
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:27,420
crap one night of you know, Discovery.

2304
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:30,020
This is exactly how we like to entertain ourselves.

2305
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:32,120
This was such a good one, right?

2306
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:38,620
Like an hour like a 50 minute here is just the live disorganized

2307
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:43,820
not like shot with nice like coordinated cameras by the I

2308
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:46,020
think they were filming it on like film cameras.

2309
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:49,320
But what we're watching is the local news and they've set

2310
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:53,020
up two cameras to cover one of the most complex opening

2311
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:54,520
ceremonies I've ever seen.

2312
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:57,920
They don't have good vantage points of anything in order.

2313
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,320
They have good audio feeds of anything.

2314
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:03,120
So it's just news anchors who in many cases are saying now

2315
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:05,520
is that I see somebody pulling up there.

2316
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:08,020
Is that is that Chris Christopherson?

2317
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:09,320
Honestly, I don't have a good lie.

2318
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:13,720
Can't tell I can't tell and I we do have an angle on it.

2319
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:17,120
It is absolutely as a man who doesn't resemble Chris Christopherson

2320
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:17,820
in any way.

2321
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:23,320
But anyway, this ceremony is this huge thing in the where

2322
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:27,520
you park your car where you where you arrive in the casino.

2323
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:30,220
They've taken over that and there's a ton of pedestrians

2324
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:34,620
but then also cars pulling in celebrities arriving for the

2325
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:35,720
big grand opening.

2326
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:42,220
Let me let this local news guy say all of the stars who are

2327
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:43,020
going to be there.

2328
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:51,520

01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:57,120
He was Treasury Secretary many many years ago.

2331
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:00,320
He may remember years ago Andre Agassi, of course will be here

2332
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,920
the local hero tennis course Jerry Tarkany.

2333
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:03,820
We saw Jerry Harry.

2334
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:06,320
He's expected to appear for tonight's events.

2335
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:07,120
Dr.

2336
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:07,620
Dre.

2337
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:07,920
Dr.

2338
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:09,120
Dre is a rapper.

2339
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:10,320
He will be here as well.

2340
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,320
Matthew Modine will be here.

2341
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:13,020
Wow.

2342
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:16,520
Howie Mandel will be here as well and we're expecting Shirley

2343
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:20,320
McClain and we also saw Dr.

2344
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:24,420
Dre who is a rapper rapper rapper is a profession.

2345
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:25,420
I don't know exactly.

2346
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:29,920
I've never seen it in action, but I'm told people enjoy seeing

2347
01:39:30,020 --> 01:39:33,520
rappers do their rapping clarified the not the kind that

2348
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:36,620
you would get on a Malm's bar or something like that such

2349
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:40,420
an assort is a living human being I guess who performs in

2350
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:41,120
some way.

2351
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:42,420
I don't understand it either.

2352
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:44,120
I'm scared.

2353
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:44,720
Ask your kid.

2354
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:49,820
I hope they ban it whatever it is, but the biggest stars

2355
01:39:49,820 --> 01:39:54,520
who are at this opening are four very recognizable characters.

2356
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:55,220
Here they are.

2357
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:56,820
The Wizard of Oz is here.

2358
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:57,520
Let's take a look.

2359
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,520
The Wizard of Oz is here.

2360
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:01,920
And of course the movie is here.

2361
01:40:04,220 --> 01:40:04,720
There they are.

2362
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:07,720
The news anchor said there's Dorothy and then there are the

2363
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:11,020
three characters the three characters three characters are

2364
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:11,520
here.

2365
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:13,720
Dorothy and the rest.

2366
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,320
It's a real Gilligan's Island.

2367
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:18,520
It's a Gilligan's Island.

2368
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:22,020
It's three of the most colorful three characters who look if

2369
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:25,120
you want to guess their names just look at them and say what

2370
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:25,620
you see.

2371
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:28,120
Yeah, this guy is so stressed out though.

2372
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:29,820
Like give him the benefit of the doubt.

2373
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:31,120
He's been there all day.

2374
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:33,920
He's had to fill so much time.

2375
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:36,020
Yeah, because everything started late started like it

2376
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:39,320
should be had to BAM for like 20 minutes.

2377
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:41,420
He's been live on television for hours.

2378
01:40:41,420 --> 01:40:42,920
So he's he's just bleary-eyed.

2379
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:44,020
He doesn't know what then he isn't.

2380
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:45,720
You wouldn't know what Mickey Mouse is named.

2381
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:47,520
He could have gotten like he would have been like Scarecrow.

2382
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,620
I think he would have said he could have tin man.

2383
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:50,720
He made it call like Mr.

2384
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:54,420
Metal or something and then the lion you probably would have

2385
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:57,720
said there is a woman approaching me and three whimsical

2386
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:00,420
creatures who mock God's plan.

2387
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:07,020
An upright lion does not walk on on his hinds.

2388
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:07,420
Please.

2389
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:08,820
I hope somebody shoots him.

2390
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:14,020
Can I mention the one weird pop cultural moment where this

2391
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:15,120
is referenced?

2392
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:18,220
Yes, there is a line in the movie swingers.

2393
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:22,620
They go to Vegas if you remember that part in Vegas and Vince

2394
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:28,520
Vaughn and Favreau pick up a couple women Vince Vaughn says

2395
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:32,820
like, oh this girl so-and-so she's a Dorothy at the MGM

2396
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:33,720
Grand.

2397
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:37,120
Oh, yeah, I mean that's good.

2398
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:38,720
That speaks to yeah.

2399
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:39,820
Hey, that's a catch.

2400
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:40,820
Yeah, sure.

2401
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:43,120
Favreau is an animatronic guy.

2402
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:47,820
But the real catch at this and now and you'll see why I'm

2403
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:50,520
jamming this in that at a long episode you will understand

2404
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:51,120
immediately.

2405
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:53,220
Well, maybe not immediately you have to like I'm going to

2406
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:57,020
make you you'll see the face and you will understand because

2407
01:41:57,020 --> 01:41:59,720
he said the Wizard of Oz is here and that's true.

2408
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:03,120
The Wizard is here and unlike the Dorothy whose name we don't

2409
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:05,720
know you will certainly know the name of the Wizard.

2410
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:15,120
Who do we see?

2411
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:15,820
Who do we got?

2412
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:18,320
One of my favorite people of all time Rip Taylor.

2413
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:18,720
Rip.

2414
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,920
Rippy beloved to Aaron and I both because we have the really

2415
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:25,920
specific memory.

2416
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,020
I'm sure I've said on the podcast when we were having a

2417
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:31,220
nice dinner at the Animal Kingdom Lodge and then I got a

2418
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:33,520
phone call that I thought was going to be my parents which

2419
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:35,520
made me think there was going to be an emergency.

2420
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:36,520
So I'm sorry.

2421
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:39,320
I really got to take this and I go outside Scotty.

2422
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,220
It's Rippy.

2423
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:41,420
I'm angry.

2424
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:46,320
Because I had filmed a Funny or Die with video with him three

2425
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:49,520
days prior right before getting on a plane to Disney World.

2426
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:53,620
So the bizarre and then me I left for so long and you look

2427
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:54,520
at me like what was that?

2428
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:55,320
What's going on?

2429
01:42:56,020 --> 01:42:56,520
Sorry.

2430
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:58,020
Sorry it was Rip Taylor.

2431
01:42:58,020 --> 01:42:58,720
It's Rip Taylor.

2432
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,320
Man about a lot of things.

2433
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:05,620
I know you knew you'd known each other a long time.

2434
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:06,820
You're probably very impressed.

2435
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:14,720
God my boyfriend.

2436
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:17,620
I guess he knows celebrities like Rip Taylor will just call

2437
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:19,820
him and chew him out.

2438
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:22,820
You're on the phone with the gals bragging.

2439
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:24,620
Well, Scotty just step away last night.

2440
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:26,120
He was on the phone with the celebrity.

2441
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:30,020
It is really is something we say just that's lasted.

2442
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:33,320
That was 13 years ago now and still so often we will say

2443
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:36,520
Scotty you used me up Scotty.

2444
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:41,720
Sitting in Giku the cooking place with Scotty the starmaker.

2445
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:47,320
So yeah, I mean is this not the greatest casting you ever

2446
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:48,020
seen?

2447
01:43:48,020 --> 01:43:50,020
He looks just like him.

2448
01:43:50,020 --> 01:43:52,520
He's ever looked more like a Wizard of Oz.

2449
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,220
He looks like every Wizard of Oz character.

2450
01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:55,120
He looks like the Munchkin.

2451
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:58,620
They keep calling them the Wizard of Oz and he gives

2452
01:43:58,620 --> 01:44:01,520
little awards out to MGM executives.

2453
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:05,420
He says like because you are the heart of this organization.

2454
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:09,720
So I give you the heart by the power invested in me as the

2455
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:10,620
Wizard of Oz.

2456
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:14,020
But then what he's wearing, I think that's not right.

2457
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:14,920
I think what he's wearing.

2458
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:16,620
He's actually the gatekeeper.

2459
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:17,020
Yes.

2460
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:20,120
He's the guy who pokes his head out which is the same actor

2461
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:23,020
is the Wizard of Oz, but everyone from news anchor to

2462
01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:26,720
rip himself calls himself the Wizard of Oz and I don't unless

2463
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:29,220
is that the same guy is that the idea that he's the Wizard

2464
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:30,620
in disguise or something?

2465
01:44:30,620 --> 01:44:31,320
I don't know.

2466
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:34,620
Is the joke that like, yeah, the Wizard pulls a lot of fast

2467
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:35,220
ones.

2468
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:38,420
So he's like, I know what you can't see the way and it's like

2469
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:41,120
a trick like pretending to be your own secretary.

2470
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:41,520
Yeah.

2471
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:41,820
Yeah.

2472
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:42,020
Yeah.

2473
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:43,020
The Donald Trump.

2474
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:43,520
The Trump.

2475
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,020
Yeah.

2476
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:49,520
If you go a little further up the strip like, oh, yes,

2477
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:51,820
you can find unpleasant not fun casino.

2478
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:55,320
So anyway, then there are just hundreds of dancers who come

2479
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:58,320
out every type of Wizard of Oz character, the ones in the

2480
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,020
big hats.

2481
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:00,320
There's flying monkeys.

2482
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,420
We didn't mention that there's a flying monkey bar.

2483
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:03,220
That was another thing.

2484
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:07,620
There's no photos of you can't figure nobody filmed that like

2485
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:09,620
animatronic drunk.

2486
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:11,820
What's his name already?

2487
01:45:11,820 --> 01:45:12,620
Foster Brooks.

2488
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:15,420
But anyway, limos are pulling up.

2489
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:18,120
This is not just a brief appearance from Rip Taylor.

2490
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:22,620
They make him read the name of every car that pulls up and

2491
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:24,120
he doesn't have a good vantage point either.

2492
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:28,420
So like a car pulls up and you hear him say that there is

2493
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:31,320
it's from from Dougie.

2494
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:32,020
How is there?

2495
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:32,920
We all know him.

2496
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:35,220
It's Neil Patrick Hayes.

2497
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:38,220
There is Neil Patrick Hayes.

2498
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:41,420
I really listen to make sure and he gets it wrong.

2499
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:44,120
He doesn't say the right name and then after and it's the

2500
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:46,220
most insane lineup of people you ever seen.

2501
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:47,320
It's Dougie Hauser.

2502
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:48,220
It's Neil Patrick Hayes.

2503
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:51,220
And then right after that is Alexander Haig Reagan's

2504
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:52,520
Secretary of State.

2505
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:57,020
And then after that is just a mascot owl and wolf from the

2506
01:45:57,020 --> 01:45:57,820
theme park.

2507
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:01,220
You cannot make any heads or tails of the theme of who's

2508
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:02,320
arriving at this.

2509
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:08,720
But Rip Taylor has to read and read and then let me just

2510
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:10,920
play a couple more clips really quick.

2511
01:46:11,620 --> 01:46:14,520
Then like then there's a big gap where no limos are showing

2512
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:14,820
up.

2513
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:17,820
So with the news guy asked to vamp again.

2514
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:19,220
So here's how he fills the time.

2515
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:22,620
As you stand here watching and you see the characters from

2516
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:25,220
the Wizard of Oz, of course the original characters,

2517
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:27,720
of course you have Judy Garland, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley,

2518
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:28,620
and Ray Bolger.

2519
01:46:28,620 --> 01:46:30,320
Of course they have all passed away.

2520
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:31,720
At least I'm pretty certain they have.

2521
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:35,420
It's kind of sad that they would not be here for something

2522
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:35,820
like this.

2523
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:37,220
I'm sure they would enjoy that.

2524
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:40,720
Not all the original actors, the original character.

2525
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:41,920
The original characters.

2526
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:45,020
John Elham, Judy Garland, Ray Bolger.

2527
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:48,120
But Ray Bolger, I'm pretty sure Ray Bolger is dead.

2528
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:50,920
I think he kicked the bucket, but if he didn't kick that

2529
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:53,520
bucket, I think he'd be having a blast here.

2530
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:58,820
Then there's a big fireworks show, but they don't turn off

2531
01:46:58,820 --> 01:47:00,020
Rip Taylor's mic.

2532
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:03,720
So you're watching fireworks, but you get occasional commentary

2533
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:04,520
from Rippy.

2534
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,020
Talking to people he knows.

2535
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:28,020
Who he sees.

2536
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:31,420
What the hell is going on over there?

2537
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:33,120
What is that?

2538
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:34,720
I don't know her.

2539
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:36,220
Send her away.

2540
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:37,820
She's looking at me weird.

2541
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:41,020
And then one more thing really quick because the other thing

2542
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:43,120
I loved about this special was that then when the fireworks

2543
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:46,120
really kick in, there's an amazing medley of classic rock

2544
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:49,820
songs where you cannot possibly predict what's coming up next.

2545
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:51,520
And here's a taste of that.

2546
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:52,820
Here's this.

2547
01:47:57,020 --> 01:48:07,320
Yeah, one sec, one sec, a little more.

2548
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:16,420
It's too much.

2549
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:19,720
Honestly, it's there's too much smoke.

2550
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:21,020
I can't breathe.

2551
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:23,820
An ash landed in my mustache.

2552
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:25,520
I'm on fire.

2553
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:27,320
That's what Rippy out.

2554
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:30,620
Someone put Rippy out mics on for the next 48 hours.

2555
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:32,920
They're very dramatic station.

2556
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:34,220
I'm sleeping.

2557
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:38,720
He interrupts the network.

2558
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:41,020
It's a reruns of cheers at 4 p.m.

2559
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:44,720
Why I don't need room service.

2560
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:45,720
I'm trying to sleep.

2561
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:48,020
I was out late being the Wizard of Oz.

2562
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:52,020
I fell asleep on the lion snoot and then I was stuck up there

2563
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:55,420
for about I fell out the window and landed on the snoot.

2564
01:48:56,420 --> 01:48:58,420
Worst night of sleep I've ever had.

2565
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:02,320
What is that very recognizable music cue?

2566
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,120
Baker Street.

2567
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:08,420
And then it'll go into Human League.

2568
01:49:08,420 --> 01:49:12,020
Don't you want me and paint it black and then still more and

2569
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:13,520
it never stops.

2570
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:17,920
Hey, it's so just look this up on YouTube.

2571
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:20,720
This is the most delightfully disorganized but it has the

2572
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:21,420
Wizard of Oz.

2573
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:24,420
The Wizard of Oz has to be there as we kick off this play.

2574
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:26,620
You know, it's like it's part of the fabric.

2575
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:31,620
Yeah, the citizen at one point there's the very dynamic

2576
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:35,120
fireworks show and then there's a cutaway to the citizens

2577
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:38,020
of Oz all pretty much standing still.

2578
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:38,620
Oh, you're right.

2579
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:39,620
I forgot that was in there.

2580
01:49:39,620 --> 01:49:41,520
They're not dancing anymore.

2581
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:42,620
They don't know what to do.

2582
01:49:42,620 --> 01:49:43,920
They're looking at each other.

2583
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:46,220
What are we supposed to dance for part of this?

2584
01:49:46,220 --> 01:49:48,820
I know they didn't tell us to so don't don't do it.

2585
01:49:48,820 --> 01:49:52,320
You can see that very human moment where you go like I guess

2586
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:56,620
I'll put my arms at my side and then no one seems comfortable.

2587
01:49:56,620 --> 01:50:01,020
Like it's like I guess that's not conveying anything.

2588
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:04,120
I guess that's normal and then they just look so uncomfortable

2589
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:04,720
doing that.

2590
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:11,120
So anyway, I couldn't I had to show Rippy is the Wizard of

2591
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:15,620
Oz but you know, look this Club 3.

2592
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:17,420
Thank you for voting for this and Aaron.

2593
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:20,620
Thank you for being here because you inspired we got to

2594
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:23,620
inject some Scott and Aaron YouTube Vegas bullshit.

2595
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:28,320
We got some great memories of you being scared of lions

2596
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:32,420
and hanging in fun arcades and you prompted some greats

2597
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:36,420
by saying waffle you have unlocked Pandora's waffle iron.

2598
01:50:36,620 --> 01:50:38,120
Do we have a good question?

2599
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:38,420
Oh, yeah.

2600
01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:38,820
Yeah.

2601
01:50:39,220 --> 01:50:41,120
See the problem is there's a couple of different ways

2602
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:42,320
you can go with a good question.

2603
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:45,320
Like one is like kind of a joke question, which I don't want

2604
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:45,720
to do that.

2605
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:47,920
I want to get to the reality of the situation.

2606
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:50,320
I mean you can save it.

2607
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,120
We can just make it its own episode.

2608
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:57,520
Jason's college college career preparation or whatever you

2609
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:58,020
would call it.

2610
01:50:59,020 --> 01:50:59,520
I'll say this.

2611
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:02,220
Did you have a waffle each time you worked?

2612
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:09,120
No, really well because like I said, we ate the crew meal

2613
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:12,920
half hour before no one was working the waffle station

2614
01:51:13,220 --> 01:51:15,420
until I rolled on over there.

2615
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:17,920
Nobody but you didn't like to scream take them.

2616
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:20,220
You weren't like grabbing minis is you know, because the

2617
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:24,420
oh no, I was not discreetly grabbing like because that was

2618
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:26,620
the other thing they're like, here's a big plate.

2619
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:30,620
If no one's in line, just keep making waffles and mini waffles

2620
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:32,120
and put them over on the plate.

2621
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:35,320
So that way when people walk up they can just you can just

2622
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:38,520
give them one which looking back I'm like, oh yeah, nice

2623
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:40,420
room temperature waffle.

2624
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:40,720
Yum.

2625
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:41,220
Yum.

2626
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:42,420
Not fresh.

2627
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:44,120
Yeah, would that happen?

2628
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:46,320
We'd have to start stacking up waffles.

2629
01:51:46,620 --> 01:51:47,520
This is two questions.

2630
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:51,920
Even like again, the 19 year old semi hungover college

2631
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:54,520
students would be like, can I have a fresh one?

2632
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:55,720
And I'll be like, yeah, sure.

2633
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:56,320
Okay.

2634
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:59,220
Well more to come on that.

2635
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:00,120
Yeah, this is not the end.

2636
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:02,720
We have finally you keep finding pockets.

2637
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:04,420
You think you're done and then you get to like that

2638
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:07,420
fireworks show and then it just keeps on going.

2639
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:11,120
But this episode I will have to end for now, but I'm so

2640
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:14,220
happy to say Aaron Gardner, you survived podcast the ride

2641
01:52:14,220 --> 01:52:15,620
Sin City Nights.

2642
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:16,020
Yay.

2643
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:17,720
So happy you could do it.

2644
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:18,620
This was a blast.

2645
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:19,520
Thanks for joining us.

2646
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:21,920
Thanks for letting me talk about one of my favorite places.

2647
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:22,520
Oh jeez.

2648
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:25,420
Oh, we had to and you made it one of my favorite place.

2649
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:28,320
You made Las Vegas one of my favorite places with our many

2650
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:29,020
great trips there.

2651
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:29,820
So thank you.

2652
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:33,320
Let's exit through the Emerald City gift shop.

2653
01:52:33,620 --> 01:52:35,120
Last time you were here.

2654
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:38,020
You were you had a thing to plug which is your appearance

2655
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:39,020
on the Price is Right.

2656
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:41,720
You don't have anything else like that going on.

2657
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:42,620
I can't imagine.

2658
01:52:42,620 --> 01:52:47,920
Well, I'm pleased to report that my career my lucrative

2659
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:52,020
career as a game show contestant continues and I believe

2660
01:52:52,020 --> 01:52:56,020
December 4th y'all can catch me on let's make a deal.

2661
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:56,620
Wow.

2662
01:52:56,620 --> 01:52:59,520
CBS check your local listings.

2663
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:03,020
Geez finally something to look forward to in December.

2664
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:04,420
I know it's so far.

2665
01:53:04,420 --> 01:53:07,120
I've been filming this like a month ago and it's so far away.

2666
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:09,420
It's a long haul to Christmas, but now there's a little

2667
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:10,920
treat for everybody right before.

2668
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:11,120
Wow.

2669
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:12,120
Thank you for dropping this.

2670
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:14,220
Everybody shut up about it though, because we were not

2671
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:16,620
supposed you made the calculation like we're behind

2672
01:53:16,620 --> 01:53:17,620
several paywalls.

2673
01:53:17,620 --> 01:53:20,520
Yeah, I think we're think we're also let's make a deal is

2674
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:22,320
a much jinkier production.

2675
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:25,020
And the prestigious prices, right?

2676
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:25,820
Well, don't think this did.

2677
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:28,320
Oh, if they hear you say that too, now they probably lean

2678
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,020
into it.

2679
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:30,520
That's the vibe that I got there.

2680
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:31,620
But anyway, it was a blast.

2681
01:53:31,620 --> 01:53:33,220
I really loved doing it.

2682
01:53:33,220 --> 01:53:37,120
I had a lot of fun and yeah, I don't have a social media

2683
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:41,120
footprint myself, but I will force Scott to post the let's

2684
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:42,320
make a deal stuff on your socials.

2685
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:43,220
I will use mine.

2686
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:46,320
Hey, do you want to put it out in the universe the next

2687
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:47,920
game show that you like to be?

2688
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:52,820
I may have filled out a contestant form for a certain

2689
01:53:52,820 --> 01:53:56,020
game show that a certain Jay Leno.

2690
01:53:58,820 --> 01:54:02,120
Gentlemen, but I haven't heard back from them.

2691
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:05,220
So fingers crossed everyone.

2692
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:08,720
But we're crossed you could win upwards of $200.

2693
01:54:09,220 --> 01:54:11,620
Honestly, it would be worth it.

2694
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:13,620
But hanging out with Jay and Kevin.

2695
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:18,420
Well, fingers crossed for you listeners put out your good

2696
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:20,820
luck for that because well, my God, all of our brains

2697
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:24,420
are explode Aaron with with with Mr.

2698
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:24,720
L.

2699
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:25,620
I know.

2700
01:54:25,620 --> 01:54:28,720
Hopefully my recent appearance on let's make a deal doesn't

2701
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:30,720
hinder things because there's a lot of weird laws.

2702
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:31,520
Oh really?

2703
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:32,020
Oh, yeah.

2704
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:32,720
Because you have to wait.

2705
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:33,820
Show you could appear on.

2706
01:54:33,820 --> 01:54:34,520
Yeah.

2707
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:34,820
Yeah.

2708
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:35,320
Wow.

2709
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:38,520
Well, and we got you know, you got strikes going on too,

2710
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:40,320
but it may know it's different rules of the game.

2711
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:40,820
Who knows?

2712
01:54:40,820 --> 01:54:43,420
Who knows when they'll look there's something more powerful

2713
01:54:43,420 --> 01:54:46,520
than the like collective action of all the actors out there

2714
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:49,220
and that's Jay Leno's need to work at all times.

2715
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:51,120
So I think he will he will find a way.

2716
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:53,320
Well, wonderful.

2717
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:54,220
Thank you, Aaron.

2718
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:54,920
To have you.

2719
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:55,920
Oh wait, I have to apply.

2720
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:56,420
We never have good.

2721
01:54:56,420 --> 01:54:59,620
So I have to say your bravery saved the podcast.

2722
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:01,620
Well done freedom fighter.

2723
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:05,220
But I wasn't that that felt great.

2724
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:07,420
In many years of marriage that felt like the most intimate

2725
01:55:07,420 --> 01:55:08,920
moment we've ever had.

2726
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:12,020
Yeah, it doesn't get more intimate than those magic words.

2727
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:14,420
Yeah, but I say that to the listeners too.

2728
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:16,320
And I forgot to say next month.

2729
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:17,420
What do we do next month?

2730
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:18,720
We got a couple things floating.

2731
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:23,320
Fall of Atlantis was the runner up Dixie Stampede Dolly Parton's

2732
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:25,020
Dixie Stampede was a runner up.

2733
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:26,720
I say chaos round.

2734
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:29,520
If you want more Vegas, let's do fall of Atlantis or suggest

2735
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:31,320
other Vegas ideas.

2736
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:32,520
Let's throw those in too.

2737
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,820
If you want other stuff, let's do Dixie Stampede new

2738
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:38,720
new non Vegas ideas to the let's let them all against each other.

2739
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:40,920
What about Jason working in food service?

2740
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:42,320
Full Jason food service.

2741
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:44,420
Ever since they're trounce all of them.

2742
01:55:44,420 --> 01:55:48,220
The protocol is just somebody needs to say it in the commu.

2743
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:51,020
I was saying it doesn't count somebody needs to it's like a

2744
01:55:51,020 --> 01:55:52,620
very parliamentary procedure.

2745
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:55,620
Yeah, but if somebody stands and calls for it, it can be in

2746
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:56,120
the running.

2747
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:58,020
I have a good story.

2748
01:55:58,020 --> 01:56:00,720
I haven't even told you about you preparing food.

2749
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:01,220
Yeah.

2750
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:06,820
Yes, and it's a little too on the nose almost.

2751
01:56:06,820 --> 01:56:07,720
Oh my God.

2752
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:10,620
Did you get a bunch of tomato sauce on your nose?

2753
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:17,720
Miraculously in the story.

2754
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:22,220
I did not but I did get yelled at by an unpleasant man.

2755
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:22,720
Yikes.

2756
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:25,520
Okay, we got that Mike story still floating out there too.

2757
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:28,820
This could be a bit actually August could be the tough one

2758
01:56:28,820 --> 01:56:29,620
to win.

2759
01:56:29,620 --> 01:56:30,220
What's that?

2760
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:32,620
Yeah, somebody should put it out there.

2761
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:35,420
Just like the vote for the story hour.

2762
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:39,020
Like yeah, three is just like the stories that oh just the

2763
01:56:39,020 --> 01:56:40,220
story is the story.

2764

That is another move you could make.

2766
01:56:42,620 --> 01:56:43,020
Yeah.

2767
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:43,520
Okay.

2768
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:48,220
Well, it's in your hands now listener only you can decide

01:56:48,220 --> 01:56:51,320
California split my gambling buddy over here.

2770
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:52,120
What do you mean?

2771
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:56,820
Well, we would both be telling our our foolish stories.

2772
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:59,720
Yeah, my film California split.

2773
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:00,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:57:00,620 --> 01:57:03,820
Elliot Gould and George Siegel, you know, today's Elliot

2775
01:57:03,820 --> 01:57:05,020
Gould and George Siegel.

2776
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:08,020
Yeah, and I guess because I drink two glasses of wine

2777
01:57:08,020 --> 01:57:09,820
sometimes I'm today's Foster.

2778
01:57:09,820 --> 01:57:10,720
Foster Brooks.

2779
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:11,620
100%

2780
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:13,220
So long.
