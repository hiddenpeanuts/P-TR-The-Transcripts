1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,040
The Dead Speak.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,160
Podcast The Ride is back with resolutions for 2020.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,440
Occasionally accurate Harry Potter specifics

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,480
and magical creatures called bees.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,180
Lots of bees.

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,760
It's the economically named

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,800
Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,080
today on Podcast The Ride.

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:54,720
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the podcast about theme parks that will, in 2020, cover the Country Bear Jamboree.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,560
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Jason Sheridan, who is on board, correct?

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,760
I am, I'm being a little, starting the new year off blind side.

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,800
Yeah, yeah, that's right, coming in hot.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,880
We gotta do it, a lot of you are doing a big ride today.

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,720
And Mike Carlson, what do you think?

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,560
What?

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,320
First of all, I'm a little under the weather.

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,160
I'm not prepared for something like this to be railroaded.

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,160
I know, I was worried about launching that on you,

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,560
considering your health.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,480
I'm being railroaded here, is what I feel like is happening.

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,640
But you're being, here's what I'm, you're being railroaded into doing.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,960
Your dream.

25
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,880
This is like, why would you avoid doing,

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,040
talking on your podcast about your favorite thing in the world?

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,880
People have been waiting, I think it's time.

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,080
Yeah, that's true, huh.

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,160
I don't know, you know, I think it just like, it feels like,

30
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,200
I think I've said this before, I wanted to go somewhere

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,160
and sort of meditate on it and think about doing Country Bears

32
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,960
and feel like if it's the right year to do it.

33
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,800
Sure.

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,880
Is 2020 the right year?

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,040
I guess we have 12 months to figure out which month it is.

36
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,400
That's what I'm saying, we're at the very,

37
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,320
we're at the very, very beginning, which gives you 11 months

38
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,480
at the, you know, extreme of meditation.

39
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,280
So that's a ton, that's a ton.

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,120
This is the most shocking.

41
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,200
We could devote all of December to it,

42
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,400
however you want to frame it, there's so many options.

43
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,720
This is the most shocking start to something

44
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,680
since the rise of Skywalker when we said that,

45
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,000
it's at the Dead's Peak and Emperor Palpatine.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,240
The bears sing.

47
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,080
The bears.

48
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,160
The bears sing.

49
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,200
Wow, okay.

50
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,720
Yes, and shocking as a broadcast from a cave.

51
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,560
Oh my gosh.

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, it's, I know, I knew it was gonna throw you,

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,080
but I think it's a big year coming in hot.

54
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,160
I have to travel to the Country Bear version of Exegol,

55
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,560
the Sith planet, to talk to.

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,960
You're the bad version, you're Palpatine?

57
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,960
No, I'm not Palpatine, I'm Solo.

58
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,280
You're gonna discover dozens and dozens of bears there

59
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,480
waiting for you.

60
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,280
Roar, roar, roar, they kinda like mutter or something.

61
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,520
Built by crowds that are guys or ghosts, eh, what is it?

62
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,760
We're not sure exactly what they were.

63
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,520
I don't know, and thank God we didn't have to find out

64
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,560
much more, because if they had done something,

65
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,760
that would have been, tariff,

66
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,000
that would have thrown me big time.

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,840
Yes, we shouldn't spend so much time on Exegol.

68
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,040
We probably will get there on the rise of the Resistance ride.

69
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,240
I assume it goes to Exegol.

71
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,680
I assume you'll be on Exegol.

72
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,120
We're gonna talk about Exegol a lot this year.

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,120
I will declare this, Exegol will be the planet

74
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,960
we discuss the most in 2020.

75
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,240
Exegol exclusive.

76
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,880
Good space name, a lot of Xs in it, that's very spacey.

77
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,080
Yes, and I will say I like Exegol, honestly.

78
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,480
I think there could be better uses of it.

79
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,000
It's the planet where there is always lightning.

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,480
It is the only all strobe planet.

81
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,000
Uh-huh, there was warnings about that movie

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,560
that if you were sensitive to strobe lights,

83
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,480
you shouldn't do it.

84
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,320
No kidding, yes.

85
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,160
And it's Exegol.

86
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,920
Entire scenes.

87
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,600
Well, that's the new Star Wars planets.

88
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,560
The five sets from The Mandalorian were all CGI light.

89
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,120
In pitch black.

90
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,800
That's the reigns.

91
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,720
That's Star Wars, baby.

92
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,880
Disney ain't doing well.

93
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,720
We fucked up.

94
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,160
Uncle Billy, Uncle Billy lost.

95
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,160
Lost Disney's $8,000.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,840
So they have to.

97
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,480
They spent too much money on Rise of Resistance.

98
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,840
That's where all the Star Wars money went.

99
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,000
Which we'll cover soon, we'll get there soon.

100
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,000
But here, yeah, I think you need to be like Rey on Exegol,

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,640
summoning all of the spirits of Bear's past.

102
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,480
Be with me.

103
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,320
Right.

104
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,880
Again, in black voiceover.

105
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,640
Just yeah, you'll hear all their voices.

106
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,480
Be with me.

107
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,800
Be with me.

108
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
Be with me.

109
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,680
Don't use the footage.

110
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,440
Don't use the in costume footage

111
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,920
that is shot and on a hard drive.

112
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,760
Supposedly.

113
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,360
Supposedly, that was good.

114
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,440
Wait, really?

115
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,280
Yes.

116
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,360
There are so many rumors.

117
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,440
There are so many rumors about Rise of Skywalker reshoots

118
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,320
right now.

119
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,160
Wow.

120
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,000
There are rumors.

121
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,120
I would love to know every,

122
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,560
I would love to do a pop-up video

123
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,240
and see every frame, what was a reshoot and what wasn't.

124
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,360
I will send you multiple reddits,

125
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,080
and some of them could be total bullshit,

126
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,800
but there's versions of the rumors

127
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,400
where Matt Smith is a full character that was cut out.

128
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,600
He was the villain of the movie.

129
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,520
A full on Doctor Who.

130
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,520
They, it is possible that Disney could have promoted

131
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,600
the new Star Wars bad guy as the Doctor Who y'all liked.

132
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,040
And I don't know any of the,

133
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,600
I don't know how true any of this is,

134
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,480
but if you go back in April,

135
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,840
there's like Matt Smith is in this movie reports.

136
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,400
So it's not like this is completely out of the field.

137
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,280
But there's versions, yeah, where there were,

138
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,320
spoiler alert, I guess,

139
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,800
Jedi's at the end, Jedi ghosts at the end.

140
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,960
Because I had said, we shouldn't talk about this.

141
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,800
This is for the Star Wars episode.

142
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,400
It's approaching our level of conspiracy theories.

143
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,480
I love conspiracy theories.

144
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,120
Anyway, let's get to this in the Rise episode.

145
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,960
Rise of Resistance.

146
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,800
Yeah, yeah.

147
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,640
I think we'll have a ton to talk about.

148
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,000
I don't know if we're gonna want to go over the fucking movie

149
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,160
during that episode.

150
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,160
I will guarantee in 2020,

151
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,280
we'll work on our communication skills.

152
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,200
We'll work on taking turns.

153
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,640
The next episode, Mike will tell us what we're doing.

154
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,480
And then I will surprise us with what we're doing.

155
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,120
Well, I like declarations.

156
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,200
I think I wanted to get it on.

157
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,000
Like, okay, so will you commit?

158
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,160
Will you commit to Country Bears 2020?

159
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,440
I have to commit now.

160
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,280
Yeah, you do.

161
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,120
Okay, okay, okay.

162
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,960
Let me think here.

163
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,800
Let me think.

164
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,040
I'll commit, but I am prepared for it to be

165
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,600
Irishman level.

166
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,040
That's fair.

167
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,880
Irishman.

168
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,720
Of course.

169
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,560
Let me just summon.

170
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,960
Let me see if I can summon.

171
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,560
Oh, surprise guitar, apparently.

172
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,920
Well, no, that was supposed to be like a,

173
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,080
sort of an otherworldly.

174
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,920
Oh, that's right.

175
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,720
Yes, I will commit.

176
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,560
Yeah.

177
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,400
I've been tapped on the shoulder by Big Al.

178
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,240
Oh, he appeared.

179
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,240
Yeah, that was him.

180
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,080
He was with you.

181
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,480
I should have actually just played one string

182
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,320
on the guitar there.

183
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,880
Ding, bong, bong.

184
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,720
That's good.

185
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah, oh, there he was.

186
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,280
I felt his spirit.

187
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,120
Wow.

188
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,280
Yeah, exactly.

189
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,960
However you want to play it, as many hours as it takes.

190
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,920
It's going to grow.

191
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,640
Like, I caught some of Bugsy on TV.

192
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,480
Not our Bugsy.

193
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,320
No kidding me.

194
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,680
Some of the Warren Beatty Bugsy on TV.

195
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,600
A movie that is just about a casino budget

196
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,920
slowly going from $1 million to like $6 million.

197
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,720
And Ben Kingsley and Joe Montegna

198
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,000
is just getting more and more mad.

199
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,320
And then any goodwill I had for the movie

200
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,000
immediately thrown out the window at the very end credits

201
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,160
where it says, written by James Toback.

202
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,240
And I was like, oh, man.

203
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,080
I forgot.

204
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,520
Man, what the heck.

205
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,520
The guy who, pure stats-wise, is maybe the top dog

206
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
of Me Too.

207
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,320
James Toback.

208
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,160
Although we don't know.

209
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,320
We don't, I don't know.

210
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,760
Stats-wise, I don't know.

211
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,040
There's people maybe putting up even bigger stats.

212
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,120
Toback's also, his shit was like,

213
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,720
his shit was like, just like, walk up to you

214
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,160
and like rub himself on you in a crowded place.

215
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,000
Jeez.

216
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,840
My God.

217
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,720
Just really, I don't even know what to.

218
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,360
Creepy as old grandpa Palpatine.

219
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,200
But we'll get to that on the.

220
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,320
We'll get to that on the Warren Beatty episode.

221
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
On the Toback episode.

222
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,680
It's Toback slash Thought Sunrise of Skywalker.

223
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
But that's incredible commitment.

224
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,520
I love it.

225
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,960
It's a New Year's resolutions.

226
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,800
That's how I feel.

227
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,320
Anything else we're excited for in 2020?

228
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,600
Oh, yeah.

229
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,440
At 2020, I mean, rides-wise,

230
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,920
we got Marvel Land opening in the summer

231
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,880
that has been confirmed in the last couple weeks.

232
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,080
There was some speculation of like,

233
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,680
maybe that'll be pushed, but no, apparently not.

234
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,480
Because it's another in the series of,

235
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,760
the land is opening.

236
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,120
Not the big ride, but something as a restaurant.

237
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,200
And that hasn't even started construction.

238
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,040
The big ride.

239
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,640
That's God knows where we're gonna get that.

240
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,160
But you know, I can only think of Rise of the Resistance

241
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,400
because it opens here in.

242
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,120
Yeah, which all we can say is we'll try to,

243
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,640
we're gonna do it as soon as we can.

244
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,360
But my fear is we're all gonna go

245
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,680
and then it won't be open.

246
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,400
And then I don't know, I hope we get to it in January.

247
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,960
We're gonna try, right?

248
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,800
Yeah.

249
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,640
That's all we can say.

250
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,460
Oh yeah. Yeah.

251
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,340
I think it's like what we're covering today

252
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,420
could be a lot of problems.

253
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,100
Not guaranteed, Hagrid's I'm saying.

254
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,700
The big rides of late have been fraught with peril.

255
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,540
Complicated.

256
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,140
I mean, higher and higher expectations,

257
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,700
but they're also reaching higher and higher.

258
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,660
And when you just keep adding on different drops

259
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,260
or launches or all of that,

260
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,940
it's just more technical issues.

261
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

262
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,980
And well, you know, and speaking of reaching higher

263
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:40,140
and higher and you know, climbing to ambition growing,

264
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,580
I wanted to say towards the top here,

265
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,140
everybody check out the podcast, the right YouTube,

266
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,100
which we've been putting up things

267
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,780
a little bit here and there.

268
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,380
Mike, I was gonna ask you, we gotta put up the,

269
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,140
it was on Twitter, but the video you sprung on me

270
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,340
at the live show, the baby Grinch reason

271
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,140
for the season video, I'll put that up.

272
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,060
But I wanted to get people to the YouTube

273
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,620
because I have done a new cut of the,

274
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,700
maybe a highlight of 2019,

275
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,620
at least for me personally, the Michael Eisner hello video,

276
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,060
which was acknowledged by Michael Eisner himself.

277
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,940
I collect in that original video, 67 hellos

278
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,860
from various sources due to a new channel I found,

279
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,260
Walt Disney Introductions, credit to them.

280
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,180
And one from the Imagineering story,

281
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,060
there is a hello, I noticed, I've only seen in the image,

282
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,500
because now I know all of them, I know where he's standing,

283
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,660
I know how many characters he's with, is he by a lake,

284
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,700
is he by a different lake, which version of poo is he with?

285
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,620
What I'm getting at is I've done a new cut, Hello 2020,

286
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,460
and it has gone from 67 hellos to 104 hellos.

287
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,300
Oh my God.

288
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,740
So that is only on the podcast, the right YouTube.

289
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,660
That's incredible growth, that's over a third more,

290
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,420
I forget the percentage there.

291
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,260
Is it too long to put on Twitter as well now?

292
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,660
No, I think it's still, because it is paired to just hellos.

293
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,180
I think it's still, yeah,

294
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,620
I think I could still throw that out,

295
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,260
or I could just do the new section.

296
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,660
Well, the Twitter one, because I, yeah,

297
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,020
when we were saying 2020, one of the things,

298
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,300
we haven't talked, we haven't done really a powwow meeting

299
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,740
yet about guests and stuff, but Michael Eisner is,

300
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,060
maybe guest, like, wanted guest number one.

301
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,700
Yeah, yeah, that was so, well, we were texting about

302
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
the country bears thing, because there was a thread

303
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,100
on the Facebook we noticed that was like,

304
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,620
what do you want for 2020?

305
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,220
The top two things were Eisner and country bears.

306
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,780
So we, yeah, we should talk strategy

307
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,940
about how do we do this.

308
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,140
Is it a petition?

309
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,380
Is it another round of Twitter,

310
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,300
like tweeting at him with a video,

311
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,380
because he famously has retweeted us once

312
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,340
with the original hello video.

313
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:02,340
But I think that, first of all, there's no DM option.

314
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,740
I think Twitter, I'm not sure that a Twitter campaign

315
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,140
will be heard.

316
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,780
Eisner's DMs are not open.

317
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,620
They are not open.

318
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,780
You cannot slide into Michael Eisner's DMs.

319
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,620
Goodbye.

320
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,980
So I don't know, I mean, like, I think tweeting,

321
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,940
I love that when he tweets, like, he tweeted his

322
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,940
Rise of Skywalker opinions, which was fun to see.

323
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,620
Nick Mundy had our back and immediately responded,

324
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,900
go on podcasts, a ride, got a lot of likes.

325
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,140
If he's noticing what's getting likes,

326
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,380
I also, I was checking the stats when he retweeted

327
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,780
our video, which if you haven't seen it,

328
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,820
it's a super cut of every time he says hello,

329
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,540
introducing Disney movies.

330
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,700
I was checking his stats like a crazy person.

331
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,020
That was one of his 10 most popular tweets of all time.

332
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,860
Sure, wow.

333
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,300
Like, and that wasn't like a retweet or,

334
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,020
like of like original content Eisner tweets.

335
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,300
I mean, it demolished most tweets about the soccer team

336
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,700
he owns, no offense to the soccer team.

337
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,620
But our video is more popular than,

338
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,540
if we took up a British soccer stadium

339
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,820
and just played that montage in a loop,

340
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,980
we'd sell it out way easier than whatever

341
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,220
the soccer team is called.

342
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,380
Right, we are more popular than the soccer team.

343
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,100
Yes, absolutely, yeah, yeah.

344
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,460
So he's gotta do it.

345
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,300
And with that, but with things like putting down

346
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,060
the soccer team, I'm sure we're definitely

347
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,900
gonna get him here.

348
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,500
You're already gonna get like hit with a bottle

349
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,420
by Arsenal fans or whatever.

350
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,500
Oh no, they're gonna find me in America.

351
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,580
Or throw it so far from me.

352
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,420
Throw it so far.

353
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,900
They're so good at throwing bottles,

354
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,620
it's gonna hit me in the valley.

355
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,860
Is it a petition?

356
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,220
I don't know how many listeners we have, honestly.

357
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,060
I think a polite email is probably usually the life.

358
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,780
That would be my, I mean the real answer,

359
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,740
yes, is that.

360
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,660
I've sent a polite email.

361
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,500
I did it without.

362
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,340
But where?

363
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,140
Maybe you shouldn't say, but.

364
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,340
Yeah, not to a direct channel,

365
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,900
but somebody who should be in the circle.

366
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,220
No response.

367
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,220
Maybe it was the wrong email.

368
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,300
Maybe we should send it to multiple emails, though.

369
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,260
I think like office culture email,

370
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,740
you sometimes do need to send five,

371
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,460
of the kind of banal, like hey, following up,

372
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,940
checking in, the stuff like individually you might hate,

373
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,900
but like in a corporate culture,

374
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,660
that is kind of the dance.

375
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,660
I think that would work.

376
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,140
I honestly think.

377
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:29,980
That is the dance.

378
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,820
We just stay.

379
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,660
Yeah, I think so.

380
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,500
The dance of death.

381
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,580
Well, and maybe we have to try,

382
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,460
we have to get multiple of these emails.

383
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,740
We have to find, if anyone has some way to,

384
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,300
I'm on IMDB Pro, and that didn't get me any closer

385
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,260
to having info for him or his company,

386
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,460
because I think it's like some PR representative,

387
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,860
and we threw some stats their way.

388
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,860
That's what the angle I did.

389
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,060
Yeah, yeah.

390
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,580
I mean, do we have new stats that would be?

391
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,820
Like stats that like, is he like, oh wow,

392
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,380
the downtown Disney ordeal did a certain amount of numbers?

393
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,620
Like it's hard to tell what.

394
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,100
I mean, the stat is 18 stages.

395
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,540
Oh really, 18 stages.

396
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,260
Well then I gotta see what these guys are about.

397
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,980
18 stages, oh my God.

398
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,820
They made this.

399
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,020
I have to talk to these men.

400
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,460
They have respect for La Brea Bakery.

401
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,420
Edwin, meet me at Catal.

402
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,260
No.

403
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,420
The Eisner table at Catal.

404
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,420
My table at Catal in the back.

405
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,500
We'll break all the rules.

406
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,060
We'll don't, if this episode,

407
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,420
if he only gives us 15 minutes, that's okay.

408
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,260
Oh yeah.

409
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,820
If we have to record it while he's like jogging

410
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,460
or something, we'll do, like, however we need to fit it

411
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,300
into his schedule.

412
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,740
If he just wants to talk about the football team.

413
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,700
Yeah, that's fine.

414
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,820
I mean, it's not my favorite, but.

415
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,980
Club, I think you say football club.

416
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,460
Football club, you're right, you're right.

417
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,300
FC, FC?

418
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,140
You're right, yes.

419
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,940
This cow will trick him by knowing all of his phrases.

420
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,060
Footy, Michael, do you wanna come on

421
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,300
and talk a little footy?

422
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,260
Your footy club?

423
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,220
Your footy club.

424
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,340
Do you think we ask, like we do another episode

425
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,780
with Tony Baxter first and we go,

426
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,340
Tony, could you drive us to Michael Eisner's house?

427
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,900
We knock on the door?

428
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,180
I think the answer is no.

429
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,020
Okay, fine.

430
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,380
That's presumptuous, but does he know,

431
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,860
and you're saying he knows where Eisner lives now?

432
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,700
I don't know.

433
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,540
I'm not sure.

434
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,380
I don't know anything about that.

435
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,060
I know where his, I've gone up to Lake Arrowhead

436
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,620
a couple times and I took the boat tour once

437
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,660
that just like goes around the lake

438
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,740
and they point out houses and like,

439
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,660
that used to be Michael Eisner's.

440
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,660
I know where Mike Love lives now.

441
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,500
Whoa.

442
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,340
Around Lake Arrowhead.

443
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,740
Wait, in what city, in Arrowhead?

444
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,580
Whoa.

445
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,580
There's also, there's a kind of an infamous house.

446
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,740
And good vibrations coming out of there.

447
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,980
I think the residents hate him.

448
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,180
Is it Hagar?

449
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,460
Some like 80s rocker bought two big houses

450
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,940
next to each other and connected them

451
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,740
to make like an architectural monstrosity

452
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,020
and the townsfolk hate him.

453
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,380
Geez.

454
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,220
Yeah.

455
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,260
Sammy wouldn't do that.

456
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,180
It seemed like a big like 90s, like place if you had money

457
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,700
because they were like, that used to,

458
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,620
either that is or used to be Eric LaSalle's house.

459
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,580
And that was the one with a 20 car garage Jay Leno bought.

460
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,980
I think a lot of these have flipped a couple of times.

461
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,820
Sure.

462
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,660
But like.

463
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,900
I don't wanna side check too much.

464
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,740
Have I talked on the show about seeing Dennis Rodman's house

465
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,580
in Newport Beach?

466
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,420
No.

467
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,260
No.

468
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,420
Okay, so this is in the 90s.

469
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,540
I spent a lot of summers down there

470
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,940
and my dad and I were on a bike ride

471
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,140
and he's like, now I've heard Rodman moved in around here.

472
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,420
I wonder what is the,

473
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,220
I wonder if we'll be able to tell,

474
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,260
I think it's in this neck of the woods, we'll see.

475
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,900
So we're like on this bike ride going, I wonder is this?

476
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,900
And then suddenly we see a,

477
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,220
the biggest Hummer I have ever seen

478
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,020
more than blocking the bike path.

479
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,120
It has his face massive on the back.

480
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,620
The pattern on the hood of the car

481
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,180
is a bunch of airbrushed naked women.

482
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,020
Oh my God.

483
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,180
All drawn to have breast implants

484
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,340
and they are all touching themselves.

485
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,700
And the car, the license plate has an abbreviated version

486
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,220
of this and the car says it really big, wool patrol.

487
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,060
What?

488
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,940
Which I guess is some, it's like about pubic hair.

489
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,940
That's what I, I guess?

490
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,420
He loves, Rodman loves wool.

491
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,260
Good, just wool.

492
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,900
I mean like getting warm with some wool.

493
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,700
God, I've never even heard that before.

494
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,180
I think it was a coincidence.

495
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,340
He hired a decoy to throw people off the trail.

496
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,020
Yeah, he lives across the street.

497
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,780
He lives in the ocean.

498
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,220
He's like in some underground pod house.

499
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,060
Oh yeah, yeah.

500
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,340
You gotta take a submarine to get there.

501
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,340
No, but then driving back the other way,

502
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,580
we watched him coming out and plumes of smoke

503
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,820
and a smell that made me for the first time in my life

504
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,940
say, dad, what's that smell?

505
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,740
So that was the very, what a cool way

506
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,180
to discover the smell of wool.

507
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,700
Dad, what's the wool patrol?

508
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,060
How do I join?

509
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,020
It's much different than the paw patrol.

510
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,420
This car is a famous thing too.

511
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,940
If you Google Dennis Rodman Hummer,

512
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,540
you will discover, you gotta see this for yourself.

513
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,860
It's unbelievable.

514
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,340
I guess I gotta do it right now.

515
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,940
I will guarantee we will do

516
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,820
the Dennis Rodman Hummer episode.

517
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,740
I wish it was a car you could ride.

518
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,860
I wish it was, if that was an option

519
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,580
on Radiator Springs Racers.

520
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,500
Yeah, you got it.

521
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,620
Oh, it looks like shit.

522
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,380
It's really stupid.

523
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,900
It's stupid as hell.

524
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,540
I mean that obviously sounded stupid and bad,

525
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,580
but this looks like shit.

526
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,420
No, it's not a cool kind of,

527
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,060
it's very similar to when Tom Green painted sluts

528
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,940
on his parents' car and it said Slutmovie.

529
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,380
It's like that variety of just super trash.

530
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,740
But his, I'm not sure if his was funny on purpose.

531
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,180
I don't think it was.

532
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,660
It doesn't seem to be.

533
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,300
All right, so yeah, full Rodman Hummer episode coming.

534
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,060
Back to, real quick to Eisner.

535
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,460
Iger supposedly, Bob Iger supposedly leaving as CEO.

536
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,580
Is there any movement to get Michael Eisner

537
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,140
back in the CEO position at Disney?

538
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,300
Are there rules about this?

539
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,340
So there are term limits.

540
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,980
Can you go back like Jerry Brown

541
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,460
as governor of California?

542
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,660
I think you can.

543
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,980
And I think maybe with some like Lieutenant CEOs

544
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,820
with Mr. Eisner, three to be exact.

545
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,900
That's right.

546
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,140
With Eisner at the helm and three Lieutenant CEOs

547
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,340
of the Disney corporation. The Knights of Mike.

548
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,180
Yes.

549
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,580
Faceless, faceless, characterless man.

550
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,100
Faceless, developed, developless.

551
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,700
He's wearing the wear hoods all the time.

552
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,540
And he'll just, yeah.

553
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,100
Oh, hello, hello.

554
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,940
Hello, hello.

555
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,500
Gosh, we've really added to the IP of the show today.

556
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,340
Yeah, yeah.

557
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,700
So that, yeah, maybe that's it.

558
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,980
Maybe we push for Eisner.

559
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,020
Jobs went back.

560
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,860
Jobs went back to Apple.

561
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,020
Yes, Jobs went back to Apple.

562
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,980
Izer was, yeah, Izer can go back.

563
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,860
I don't think there's any sort of term limit.

564
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,060
He's gotta save it.

565
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,180
Just like, Choms.

566
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,860
He's gotta save his ailing company.

567
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,420
That's right.

568
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,540
I don't know if that's accurate.

569
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,060
I think it's doing great, but like,

570
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,500
it's ailing in my eye,

571
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,420
because there aren't fun specials anymore.

572
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,620
Yeah, he needs to host the specials again.

573
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,180
We need direct to DVD sequels of all these movies.

574
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,180
We need him back.

575
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,540
Oh, you're saying, so not like Lady and the Tramp.

576
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,740
We don't want live action Lady and the Tramp on Disney+.

577
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,340
We want cheaply animated Lady and the Tramp 4.

578
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,180
Yes.

579
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,020
That involves time travel.

580
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,020
If you really are being honest with yourself,

581
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,900
what would you rather have?

582
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,380
The boring same movie that's just live action,

583
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,580
or like some bizarre thing where

584
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,660
Lady and the Tramp go to space?

585
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,740
Of course.

586
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,820
Lady and the Tramp go to space.

587
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,300
Of course.

588
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,340
It's better.

589
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,180
Hell yeah.

590
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah.

591
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,840
Absolutely.

592
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,540
Well, Disney Plus allowed me to see for the first time

593
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,140
Aladdin 3, what's it called?

594
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,580
The King of Thieves?

595
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,940
King of Thieves with his father, right?

596
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,380
Yeah, yeah, with his hot dad.

597
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,060
Yeah, that wasn't overhyped.

598
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,740
Williams comes back, doesn't he?

599
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,980
But number two is Castellaneta.

600
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,900
Yes.

601
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,940
Right?

602
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,820
So crazy.

603
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,700
And you get in Aladdin and King of Thieves

604
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,820
something more memorable than any of these boring,

605
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,220
if you only do shot for shots,

606
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,340
you're not gonna get dynamic things like

607
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,780
the genie transforming into Mrs. Doubtfire.

608
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,620
Yes.

609
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,700
Incredible, historic moment.

610
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,100
Like that one thing is more interesting

611
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,700
than live action Beauty and the Beast,

612
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,540
Aladdin, like all of them put together.

613
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,380
Yeah.

614
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,200
Yeah.

615
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,220
Well, there's only one solution is bring back Eisner.

616
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,060
Yeah.

617
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,500
Reinstall Eisner as CEO.

618
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,620
Let's get crazy.

619
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,900
With three youngish lieutenants.

620
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,740
Youngish.

621
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,700
On the CEO scale, there's not a lot of CEOs our age.

622
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,540
Yeah.

623
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,340
They're all Palpatine.

624
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:53,340
Youngish fixers, youngish hooded, Eddie Mannix kind of fixers.

625
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,380
I think, yeah, I think we have the two year

626
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,580
track record of ideas to prove that we belong there

627
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,420
at this point.

628
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,540
Yeah, we're tossing them off left and right.

629
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,340
I can't remember the rest of the water.

630
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,380
I could only remember Haldeman.

631
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,460
I couldn't remember the rest of Nixon's lieutenants.

632
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,420
You were trying to name.

633
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,260
Haldeman, Kissinger. John Dean.

634
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,100
Yeah, Dean.

635
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,540
Who else was in there?

636
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,380
I don't recall.

637
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,540
Rumsfeld.

638
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,380
I don't know.

639
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,380
Rumsfeld, yeah.

640
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,180
Young, re- young genie.

641
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,860
Roger Stone.

642
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,700
Stone, yeah.

643
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,380
We do have the back tech, too.

644
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,660
We have the Eisner back tech.

645
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,500
Yeah, yeah.

646
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,900
Like Stone is the Nixon.

647
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,820
We gotta get him on just to show him our Eisner back tech.

648
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,660
Yeah.

649
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,100
And I'll show him the prototype of my action figure

650
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,300
I created forever.

651
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,660
Man, we got it.

652
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,140
Okay, well, if anyone listening has any ideas

653
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,820
or any like ins to get him, please let us know.

654
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,660
Yeah.

655
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,860
Anything else you wanted here on the show this year also?

656
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,220
Please, we're excited.

657
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,220
I think there's a lot of fun stuff coming.

658
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,380
We got a lot of stuff in Orlando now we can talk about

659
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,660
that I've been again that we all went recently.

660
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,020
It's sort of what we're doing today.

661
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,220
I don't know where it lives.

662
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,940
We did a McGruff episode.

663
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,580
We unlocked a Patreon episode.

664
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,900
There's a Patreon if you're just new to the podcast.

665
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,580
You can, there's three, every four episodes

666
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,700
for free every month.

667
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,300
There are three extra episodes you can pay $5 for.

668
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,100
We unlocked in one of those episodes last week

669
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,060
about McGruff's singing career.

670
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,180
Yeah.

671
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,620
And I think we can also promise for 2020,

672
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,740
probably on the Patreon, but I don't know, is McGruff 2.

673
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,740
Well, we're announcing it.

674
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,140
We're saying it's McGruff 2.

675
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,540
There's some exciting developments

676
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,180
that we don't want to tip too much.

677
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,300
It's really good.

678
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,780
And I think we can say even we haven't heard.

679
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,980
McGruff 2 will consist of things we have not yet heard.

680
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,820
Yeah.

681
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,100
Thanks to some help that we're getting.

682
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,340
And I don't want to say much more.

683
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,660
And I'm working on some other leads.

684
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,340
I'm hoping those are gonna pan out.

685
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,180
Wow.

686
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,540
It's exciting.

687
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,380
It's very exciting.

688
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,500
Let me ask Jason, let me ask you a quick question here

689
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,340
because this is totally a sidetrack

690
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,580
and we shouldn't do it because we're already behind.

691
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,180
It's come to my attention that there is a misconception

692
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,460
among human beings that McGruff's first name is Scruff.

693
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,740
Okay, I fucked that up.

694
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,580
No, no, I'm not.

695
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,420
Twice now.

696
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,500
I'm not even trying to accuse you

697
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,460
because Lindsay, I was talking to her last night

698
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,220
and she also thought that his first name was Scruff.

699
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,380
Scruff, of course, is his nephew.

700
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,780
But then there's a famous jingle,

701
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,980
Scruff McGruff Chicago, Illinois 60652.

702
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,460
Did you also think his first name was?

703
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,860
Yes, and I think we talk about this on the episode.

704
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,900
Do we?

705
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,180
I think I brought this up on the episode

706
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,180
and when we unlocked it, I just went back into my notes

707
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,980
and scheduled a similar tweet to the first one.

708
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,140
So both times you called it Scruff McGruff?

709
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:53,140
Yes, I forgot my own lived experience.

710
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,060
Wow.

711
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,300
I may have thought that at one point in time

712
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,460
until we sat and discussed it at length.

713
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,500
But McGruff has one name like Madonna.

714
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,460
I think the jingle is what got me

715
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,940
because you were supposed to address the male

716
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,300
to Scruff McGruff.

717
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,780
Why do you address it to Scruff?

718
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,140
Because Scruff is his name.

719
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,260
Lindsay is shouting from the kitchen, why would they say it?

720
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,740
It's because in the commercial,

721
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,780
Scruff is a little like Robin Muppet style little dog.

722
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,500
When did addressing it to Scruff McGruff begin

723
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,540
and why would you send it to the network?

724
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,060
When is it addressing it to Scruff begin?

725
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,060
I think that's later, that's in the 90s

726
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:34,660
when they created the IP of Scruff

727
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,460
and added like, they probably thought you needed a child

728
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,180
to sympathize, that was your way into the McGruff world.

729
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,420
You sort through the mail,

730
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,060
I don't have time to do this shit.

731
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,940
As a kid, I loved getting mail.

732
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,020
It was very exciting if there was mail for me.

733
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,260
So the answer is they gave it to Scruff,

734
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,100
they send it to Scruff because kids like getting mail more.

735
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,940
It's more of a novel thing.

736
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,780
I think so.

737
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,740
I'm not convinced that it was Scruff as secretary.

738
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,860
Well, it was to both of them, I think that was the idea.

739
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,140
It was to both of them.

740
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,980
Yeah, you were sending it to Scruff McGruff.

741
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,660
And it'll weed through the creepy ones.

742
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,340
People send in McGruff their underwear or whatever.

743
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,860
Scruff will throw that out.

744
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,300
Keep them coming, ladies.

745
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,340
Oh, no, that's the mail I want.

746
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,220
Sniff, sniff.

747
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,660
He's a pervert, apparently.

748
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,340
Yeah, in the commercial, he go, he's talking to his nephew

749
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,380
and he goes, this is my nephew Scruff.

750
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,380
So like he lays it out there, like he explains anyway.

751
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,220
So McGruff to he's going to get the paper cut.

752
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,380
So I don't got to

753
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,100
coming in 2020 McGruff to.

754
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,180
Well, to some part, I don't know which part of it.

755
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,420
We'll see how epic it is.

756
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,340
That's OK. If that's not a good enough

757
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,940
indicator of what's going on at

758
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,740
patreon.com slash podcast, the right.

759
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,220
Yeah, go subscribe to the second gate.

760
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,140
And we'll remind you that at the end, too.

761
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,380
Lots of fun stuff coming. Yeah.

762
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,100
You want to talk about this thing? Yeah.

763
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,540
Now let's get to the main.

764
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,380
There's a lot of fun business.

765
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,220
I'm glad we had some business.

766
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,140
But now we have this business of Hagrid's Magical Creatures

767
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,620
Motorbike Adventure, which we were fortunate enough to go on

768
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,260
several months ago while in Orlando.

769
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,260
This is a this is a big one.

770
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,260
This is a good one. This is a hell of a ride.

771
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,620
Yeah.

772
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,660
I don't know. I think of the stuff that opened in 2019, maybe

773
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,900
the thing I enjoyed the most.

774
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,620
Yeah. Yeah. Well, individual attractions.

775
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,340
I'll say well, because you're sort of like

776
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,780
Galaxy's Edge is this huge, this amazing experience.

777
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,780
But that's a full land.

778
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,540
Yeah, I think and not complete in my eyes yet,

779
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,500
because I haven't done Rise of the Resistance.

780
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,540
Yes. And that and if that truly is the like real showstopper,

781
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,140
then we haven't gotten to do it yet.

782
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,660
But yeah, the the showstoppers we were fortunate enough to do.

783
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,460
This is well, it's a good and we could, you know, we could say right away.

784
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,860
I wanted to get into this notion.

785
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,300
Mike, you brought this up.

786
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,500
It was it was it's a bold statement, but I think I might agree with you.

787
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,060
Best ride in Orlando.

788
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:14,180
Oh, did I remember bringing that's a good question.

789
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,740
Yeah, I having thought about it, it's like this is certainly in the top

790
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,380
five, maybe at the very least pretty quickly out the gate.

791
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,980
Most expensive, I think, in Orlando.

792
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,300
The real ever rough budget is three hundred million dollars.

793
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,940
Is that right? Yes.

794
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,020
Geez. I did not come across that number.

795
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,700
It's the longest roller coaster in Florida.

796
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,180
It has it has seven launches, which I sure will get into.

797
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,300
That is the most worldwide.

798
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,020
Wow. That's the most launches anywhere anywhere.

799
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,300
Well, only the second in America to have a drop to.

800
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,420
Yeah, which oh, well, here, spoiler.

801
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,580
If I want to say this is maybe an episode you should not listen to.

802
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:01,780
If you want to be surprised by this ride as we as I got to think as we all got to.

803
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,820
Did you guys know what happened on this thing?

804
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,060
I kind of knew what happened.

805
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,060
I read about it. I was foolish.

806
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,140
I know too much about Rise of the Resistance to what I'm trying to stay away.

807
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,460
But I did know a little too much.

808
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,460
So I'm trying to stay away from Rise of the Resistance.

809
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,820
I knew nothing.

810
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,460
And I think if I'd known some of the things that this ride does,

811
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,820
I might not have gotten on it.

812
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,900
I might have said that sounds too scary.

813
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,660
So I'm really glad I didn't do it.

814
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:27,620
But truly, if you're concerned about spoilers, maybe skip way ahead on this one,

815
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,300
because this is it is it's really something if you don't know what's coming.

816
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,980
And they do a good job of keeping you surprised.

817
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,860
Like I don't there's so many things on this where it happened.

818
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:42,380
And I was like, what? How crazy?

819
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,380
It seems like this and then Rise, from what I know about Rise of the Resistance,

820
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:56,940
are like really going to play with your expectations in a very cool way.

821
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,340
And that's what this one does.

822
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,180
I guess we can say it now because we've spoiled her.

823
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,020
But like there's a drop there.

824
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,140
The track drops on this roller coaster.

825
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,860
Yeah, which is crazy.

826
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,140
About two stories, I think.

827
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,100
I saw 18 feet. Yeah, it's not that.

828
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:17,420
Yeah, which is equal to the other ride in the world that does this.

829
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,580
Which another spoiler, if you want to be surprised,

830
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,820
if you don't want to hear what it is. OK, here.

831
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,980
Now go away. OK, now the ride is at Busch Gardens Williamsburg,

832
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:33,980
and it's called Verbolten, which is a snazzy jazz up of Verboten.

833
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,300
The word the German word for forbidden.

834
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,740
It's like a crazy like German forest.

835
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,100
It's like sort of a cousin of Hagrid.

836
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,820
Interesting. Yeah.

837
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:47,220
Beautiful Park, Busch Gardens Williamsburg, built in the woods and built on water.

838
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,060
Like it's really cool.

839
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,100
My family went there a few times, grown up. Oh, really?

840
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,420
I don't I didn't know anything about it.

841
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,100
I watched a little of the ride through of this thing.

842
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,780
And yeah, it seemed like when you're like like the big drop on this thing

843
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,700
where you're sort of like looking over the forest.

844
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,700
Yeah, seems wonderful.

845
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,860
I think the premise of that ride, or at least the initial teaser video,

846
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:09,100
was that like you were racing down the Autobahn and then got struck by lightning.

847
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,420
And I think that's pretty rock and roll.

848
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,420
I think that's pretty fun.

849
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,860
Hell yeah.

850
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,060
Well, and then you end up in like but then it's like

851
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,020
then it's kind of like magical creatures stuff.

852
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,260
So it's like a like is it that the lightning takes you to another

853
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,620
like you're just on the regular German, the awesome German freeway,

854
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,980
and then you go into like fairyland?

855
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,900
Oh, sure. Yeah, that probably adds up.

856
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,340
They have like a VR fairy theater thing, too.

857
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,780
So there's a lot of like interesting stuff in Busch Gardens.

858
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,940
They call some what are the big like body of water there?

859
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,140
They call the Rhine.

860
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,740
So it is like a little mini German area.

861
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,620
That seems cool. That does. Yeah.

862
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,740
Yeah, I mean, what else like stats?

863
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,860
Why there's the stats are crazy for sure.

864
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,380
That's the longest coaster in Florida. Yeah.

865
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,580
Almost a mile long.

866
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,500
Oh, top speeds of 50 miles an hour.

867
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,860
Really good. That's great.

868
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,060
Yeah, it almost doesn't.

869
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,780
It is fast.

870
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:12,660
It's I'm trying to think like my my feelings on it was it's not often

871
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:16,420
I feel like that you get on something ride wise that really go.

872
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,980
Oh, I don't I've never felt this before.

873
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,820
Like like because, you know, you go on roller coasters and sometimes

874
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,420
they're similar, like even like Radiator Springs Racer, which is like before.

875
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,700
Is that the big last big ride before Millennium Falcon opened here?

876
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,780
I think so. Yeah, it's great.

877
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,900
It's fantastic.

878
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,820
But it's not unlike a sensation I had felt on a ride before.

879
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,780
It's sort of the bones of test track. Yeah. Yeah.

880
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,100
Yeah. Once you realize there's crossover there.

881
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,780
Yeah, this thing is so I imagine like rearranged it like, yeah,

882
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,580
I guess there was technically a drop on a coaster before.

883
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,620
There's like a couple of things that have been done, but they're rearranged

884
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,740
in this really surprising way. Yeah.

885
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:02,700
And down to like, you know, I got I got fooled by things so easily

886
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,780
like the Indiana Jones adventure before it, where you feel the sputter

887
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,700
and the motor. Yes. And you forget.

888
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,660
Well, that doesn't have right.

889
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:15,700
Yeah. Like any like errors in the old dusty car are manufactured.

890
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,980
And it's similar with the bike where it's like motor sputtering and shaking.

891
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,260
And they made all that up.

892
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,900
And doesn't happen in the minor. Yeah.

893
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,980
And roller coaster and feeling the great beast

894
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,380
breathe between your legs on the flight of passage is not actually the mighty Akron.

895
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,580
It's it's just an illusion. Yeah.

896
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,340
Yeah, it's Avatar. It's Avatar.

897
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:40,340
But yeah, no, I yes, it's there's just like little those those little touches, really.

898
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,620
The ride vehicle is a motorbike and a sidecar.

899
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,700
Yeah. Which is two different experiences.

900
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,660
Oh, yes. Right. Which is a very, very cool.

901
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:52,100
I is that unprecedented? Do we know where there's like different?

902
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,140
Because it's a different level.

903
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,580
It's a different level.

904
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,780
I have to say, I I messed up.

905
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,220
Well, boarding this is very interesting.

906
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,860
I thought I did the motorcycle first, and I thought that was such a

907
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,420
I've never ridden a motorcycle in real life.

908
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,300
And I was like, holy shit to be on a roller coaster track.

909
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:15,060
In that posture, going that fast was very exciting.

910
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,620
The sidecar is good, too.

911
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:21,340
But I wish I had done the sidecar first because it felt like a D heightening to me.

912
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,900
Yeah, yeah, I did the other way. And I agree.

913
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,020
I think I yeah, I mean, I think sidecar is cool in its own way.

914
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,780
Yeah, for sure. It might be.

915
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,020
Yeah, motorcycle might be superior.

916
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,580
Have you not been on any other coasters that are motorcycle ish,

917
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:39,100
like Tron, which is only in Shanghai? Yeah, I haven't done Tron.

918
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,700
We did a bunch of times the Pony Express at Knotts.

919
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,700
Oh, yeah. That's if you're riding a horse.

920
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:50,140
That is a similar, unique sensation with much more unique restraints.

921
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,340
But that is like you're sitting, you lean forward and even just like roller

922
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,300
coasters, your brain, you just get trained to like lean back.

923
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:05,980
And these you have to lean forward and just like white knuckle any handles or whatever.

924
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,940
Yeah, it's pretty exciting.

925
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,300
And you get pretty tricked.

926
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,620
It feels like you're driving the thing when we did.

927
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,900
I got front row, I think, too.

928
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,220
I was in the front row at Haggard's. Yeah.

929
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,700
And Haggard's, which is just like there's nothing in front of you, obviously.

930
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:25,660
So like you really your brain starts to go like, I can drive a motorcycle pretty well.

931
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,300
That's pretty cool. We should maybe address a little.

932
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,420
It's probably not. It's a tiny elephant in the room.

933
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,660
It's a baby in the room.

934
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,180
How did we get on this thing?

935
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,460
I will only I don't want to I don't want to say much,

936
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,860
except that I will recognize this is a very hard attraction to get on.

937
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,420
And I want to recognize and acknowledge that we got onto this

938
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,540
because of podcast privilege.

939
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,140
Yeah, we pulled some strings.

940
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,460
We pulled. So we got to pull some strings.

941
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,700
Thank you to people who.

942
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,500
Time we've ever done that. Yeah.

943
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,100
Yeah. And work. What a place to do it.

944
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,980
Oh, my God.

945
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,820
Thanks, people who helped magical creatures.

946
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,980
You thank you Haggard and friends.

947
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,140
Yeah, thanks, Haggard.

948
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,460
Haggard. We know Haggard.

949
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,300
Boys. Hello.

950
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,940
Boys. Boys.

951
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,420
So full disclosure, I did have to go back and watch a bunch of videos of the queue

952
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,060
to try to get some perspective on that.

953
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,420
So sorry, everyone.

954
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,060
We are in the line and we got to skip the line.

955
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,620
And then we got to it.

956
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,940
For completeness sake.

957
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,060
It was so nice. It was like, OK, so do it.

958
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,260
Motorcycle and then do it. Sidecar.

959
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,100
We got to do both in a row right away.

960
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,380
It was unbelievable.

961
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,460
And sorry to anyone who hasn't gotten on this thing.

962
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,500
But hey, I don't know.

963
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,940
You get something for women.

964
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,820
Entertaining people for a little bit is nice to reap a little reward.

965
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,660
And it was it was great.

966
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,940
Thanks for helping us.

967
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,300
Yes, that was wonderful.

968
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,660
Yeah, so that's I don't think it would just by happenstance.

969
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,340
So I got to go front row, I think it was just.

970
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,180
Oh, yeah. And sometimes it just works out.

971
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,820
I didn't demand that.

972
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,100
No, I wouldn't be that bold.

973
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,940
But that that brings up a good point.

974
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,820
The loading of this for a roller coaster is very unique.

975
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,860
It's a continuously loading, moving platform similar to

976
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,260
Haunted Mansion or Forbidden Journey.

977
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,380
It's kind of a stressful entrance.

978
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,060
I know, like, go, go, go, guys, go, go, go.

979
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,300
Like we I don't think we you're sort of dilly dallying.

980
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,380
What should I pick? And then like, no, get on.

981
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,460
Yeah, it is a little it's a little jammed in there.

982
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,340
There is even there in the queue.

983
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,540
There is a video

984
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,700
saying like, here is how to get on.

985
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,620
Don't stop walking.

986
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,020
Get on the motorcycle first and then get in the side.

987
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,100
But like they and kind of done.

988
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:33,820
I reminded me, I think, on purpose of like an old British

989
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:39,940
informational pam, like sort of like not quite the look around you aesthetic.

990
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,540
Yeah, that's the that's the show I'm thinking of. Right.

991
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,100
Yeah, yeah. It's very dry.

992
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,540
Yeah. But kind of done in that in a drawn

993
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,180
pamphlet information pamphlet style. That's cool.

994
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,100
I missed that one. I actually watched that.

995
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,660
Yeah. Are you that's that different?

996
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,940
Because in the queue, there is also like Hagrid explaining sort of

997
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,460
that is different. Yeah.

998
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,900
So there is like that digital

999
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,460
like projection projection, like like how Harry and the kids are in Gringotts.

1000
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,580
They have the same like and in Hogwarts, you know how like you see them

1001
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,820
kind of come out, but they're just like a projection.

1002
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's sort of like that.

1003
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,580
It's Hagrid and Mr. Weasley, Ron's father.

1004
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:25,300
Did you watch that video, by the way, which the the the them talking,

1005
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,260
the pre show a little bit. Yeah.

1006
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,860
It's I thought it was very funny because I feel like the actor

1007
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,380
playing Ron's father is giving 110 percent.

1008
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,180
And I feel like Hagrid is a little sleepy.

1009
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,140
All right. I'll contract says I got to do this.

1010
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,220
A little green screen at like when he's swinging the umbrella around.

1011
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,340
I'm like, oh, come on, man, give us a little work.

1012
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:51,740
I know when you're that tall, you you it's you know, move that fast.

1013
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,460
But I'm like, wait, he's so lively in the movies.

1014
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,020
How tall is he?

1015
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,660
Right. We're talking about Robbie.

1016
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,980
Yeah. Robbie Coltrane is the people from the film in both cases.

1017
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,340
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is.

1018
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,460
Coltrane and I have Robbie Coltrane and Mark Williams.

1019
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,100
In fairness, they may not have been there the same day.

1020
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,900
Yeah, who knows? He's only 6'1".

1021
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,100
Is he? Yeah, I'm taller than him.

1022
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,100
I'm two inches taller than Robbie Coltrane.

1023
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,340
I'm taller than Hagrid.

1024
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,980
And I move around. OK.

1025
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,340
Why you had to let us on the ride?

1026
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,420
He thought you'd beat him up.

1027
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,620
Hmm. I'm not. How am I sleepy?

1028
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,340
Do I? Because I'm so tall.

1029
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,460
Just I mean, today.

1030
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,220
I'm very sleepy today.

1031
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,620
I always say I don't think you've had a good night's sleep since I met you.

1032
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,420
Yeah, but that's not that's not my height, though.

1033
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,700
That's true. Yeah.

1034
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,500
Yeah, that's anxiety.

1035
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,340
No, it's fine. I'm just teasing a little because like it's

1036
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:45,700
it's hard to do green screen acting and squat a pixies that aren't there.

1037
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,900
And sure. Well, an all in one take.

1038
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,020
The nature of this kind of scene.

1039
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,020
Yeah, they have to have a little projected scene.

1040
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,860
You got to do it all in one.

1041
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,020
Just like Aerosmith and Ileana Douglas.

1042
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,660
Mm hmm. I think they really I think the animation of the bikes

1043
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,220
in that little sequence is wonderful.

1044
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,260
It's like really like blunt, silly,

1045
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,260
you know, physical gag.

1046
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,580
What is the wait? I have a little bullets of what that is.

1047
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,260
So this is explaining the premise of the ride.

1048
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:19,540
So Hagrid is going to take you to a special care of magical creatures class.

1049
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,380
You're going to board a bike and

1050
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,060
he's going to take you to see some creatures.

1051
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,780
Arthur Weasley is like doing some work on the bike

1052
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,300
and he's going to magically duplicate it, which happens.

1053
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,180
But then Fang Hagrid's Borahound releases

1054
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:41,420
Cornish pixies accidentally who fly around and blow up the other.

1055
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,500
It's pretty crazy.

1056
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,580
Full on explodes. Yeah. Yeah.

1057
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,500
It gets pretty extreme.

1058
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,420
But seeing those seeing the bikes like clang up and down and fly and move

1059
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,420
in this really it's like very silly and fun.

1060
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:57,180
Could communicate to people who don't know Harry Potter or the English language.

1061
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,100
It's it's great.

1062
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,540
And and they fit in a little universal spray gag.

1063
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,380
They got a splashy in the face.

1064
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,700
Yeah, they have to do it, which is what that's Hagrid like.

1065
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,420
Like there's something like he has to spray us.

1066
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:13,540
Mr. Weasley is putting out the fires with water sprays from his wand.

1067
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,540
OK, yeah.

1068
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,980
And then what is the like the the is it?

1069
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:23,620
Is it my correct that they didn't completely change the cue of

1070
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,820
what was there before, which is a one point dueling dragons

1071
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,740
and then called Dragon Challenge?

1072
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,700
Yeah. This was an original

1073
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,060
ends of adventure ride.

1074
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,940
You know better than me, probably. Yeah, yeah.

1075
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:38,020
So they this is the second time they have retrofitted this cue.

1076
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:43,380
They changed dueling dragons into dragon

1077
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,540
challenge to make it fit in with Wizarding World stuff a little more.

1078
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:53,220
Kind of taking it from lost continent, from the next land next door

1079
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,740
and sort of absorbing it into the Harry Potter land.

1080
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,980
And when they did that, they they retrofitted the cue a little

1081
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:04,940
and kept that that small stone, the loading building.

1082
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,540
OK, and then they did it again for this.

1083
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:11,300
And there's a video online actually Universal Orlando put it

1084
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,540
on their official channel.

1085
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,780
They did a full cue walkthrough.

1086
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:20,020
Mm hmm. In like very clear, like 4K.

1087
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:24,780
I guess the idea being we'd prefer you not bring cameras onto this ride.

1088
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,460
It did not stop people from strapping GoPros to themselves

1089
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,780
and recording ride throughs.

1090
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,580
But I think to build excitement and it's a long cue.

1091
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,060
Like it is very long.

1092
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:38,820
It goes through all this wooded areas and then through the building

1093
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,300
and then finally to the loading area.

1094
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,740
And then once you get inside, there's lots of little

1095
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:48,860
there's like broken up dragons, eggs and little cocoons and like other stuff.

1096
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:53,140
Because Hagrid is, you know, he takes care of the animals

1097
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,340
and it's the groundskeeper at Harry Potter.

1098
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,340
And please don't yell at me if I don't have that language correct.

1099
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,300
But yeah, not 100 percent.

1100
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,220
I'm trying. Totally trying my best.

1101
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,740
Yeah. So it's been retrofitted a couple of times.

1102
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:09,740
It was interesting because I watched one video that showed like the

1103
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,100
what what Dueling Dragons, Dragon Challenge

1104
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,180
look like compared to what Hagrid's look like.

1105
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:20,580
And in 1999, lower expectations for landscaping.

1106
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,220
It's like it's just metal. It's just beams.

1107
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,100
It's just a coaster. It's just coaster and empty lots.

1108
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,940
There's no attempt to dress up the area around it compared to Hagrid's,

1109
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,140
which is like hidden.

1110
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,460
And they actively tried to hide the ride.

1111
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:39,220
And they planted a thousand trees in this area to make to simulate the forest.

1112
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,980
It is such an insane campus.

1113
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:42,940
Yeah.

1114
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:48,780
So much and such a like actual they made it such actual nature

1115
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,460
that among the many problems this ride has had,

1116
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:56,620
there was at one point a couple of months ago, a bee infestation.

1117
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,620
Yes.

1118
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:01,420
And I maybe heard that a little and I was like, what?

1119
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,900
So there was a hive and they had to get rid of the hive.

1120
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,860
It wasn't much crazier than that.

1121
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:09,100
You guys are a little far away from this picture, but I found this photo.

1122
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,540
All of the black specks of this photo are bees.

1123
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:16,260
It was like a really nuts bee infestation.

1124
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:22,100
And I think the type of bee, whatever it is specifically,

1125
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,460
is a protected species in Florida.

1126
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,940
So to get rid of them was a whole process.

1127
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,220
Yeah. Yeah. I missed all of this stuff.

1128
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,140
This wasn't just some sort of like opening day idea,

1129
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,620
like the ice machine that would an Indiana Jones that would drop like,

1130
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,460
rock debris on your car.

1131
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,860
This wasn't an idea like maybe we'll try live bees.

1132
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:46,020
And then if it doesn't work, we'll have lost control of me bees.

1133
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,340
Well, control me bees.

1134
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,220
He doesn't sound like that.

1135
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,020
He doesn't sound like it doesn't sound like Shrek.

1136
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,660
Oh, arg.

1137
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,180
We don't really have a Hagrid.

1138
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,140
No, I don't at all.

1139
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,540
No, they weren't drones.

1140
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,780
They weren't put there by the part.

1141
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,220
They weren't little little be tiny be drones.

1142
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:05,660
Good idea, though, they just raise bees and unleash the man.

1143
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,820
Like they should genetically engineer bees without the stinger.

1144
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:13,500
Oh, so then you get the noise and then you can unleash bees

1145
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,220
on different motorcycles during the ride.

1146
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,940
Sure. With supplies, even vented flies.

1147
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,900
Yellow yellow flies.

1148
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,780
If you paint them. Yeah.

1149
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,100
Yeah. That's like little dye drops on each fly.

1150
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,620
Mm hmm. That's the next level that I've heard actually rise to the resistance.

1151
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:34,700
There are genetically engineered bees to keep the weight, to scare people away.

1152
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,980
Keep the weight times down.

1153
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,420
Mm hmm. Also, though, Emperor Palpatine unleashes

1154
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,020
a bunch of bees on you in one of the scenes.

1155
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,740
I just didn't pick up on that.

1156
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:47,260
Just like I was texting you the other day, like that first scene

1157
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,580
was supposed to be Mustafa.

1158
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,500
That's true. Yes.

1159
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:54,340
Rise of Skywalker, the first scene when Kylo Ren is like wrecking guys.

1160
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,540
He's just killing guys.

1161
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:59,580
That's supposed to be the planet that Vader's castle is on the planet.

1162
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,380
But it's supposed to be cooling.

1163
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,100
So that's why it's not.

1164
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,060
Oh, that's not clear at all.

1165
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,820
Pick up on that at all.

1166
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,780
Anyway, anyway.

1167
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:12,300
Bees. So there are no bees now.

1168
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:16,340
They got rid of them on this attraction, but there are many wonderful creatures.

1169
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,780
You want to talk some creatures? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1170
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,140
I mean, the big I didn't realize all the mythology of this

1171
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,660
and some early Harry Potter person, but the big deal

1172
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:28,540
in this attraction is that you get to see the blast ended Scrooge.

1173
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,660
And that is a creature that was never seen in the films.

1174
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,180
So it's the first time it's ever physicalized.

1175
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,660
Yeah, I saw it's in Goblet of Fire, apparently. Yeah.

1176
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,460
So yeah, this was this.

1177
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,260
This is the physical debut of this creature is on this ride.

1178
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,660
Kind of terrifying. Yeah.

1179
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,540
Like a scorpion with no head that also shoots fire.

1180
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:56,700
It's a weird like it's just it is like just like a shitting machine.

1181
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,540
It looks like a weird like only a butthole. Yeah.

1182
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:04,580
It's like if you got if you got cursed by a genie or something in a bad way,

1183
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,380
it's like I become a blast ended Scrooge, a blast ended.

1184
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,500
And I made it a genie, not a magician.

1185
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,540
I had to bring genies into this. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1186
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,700
No, it's a magic, right?

1187
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,660
Well, we were talking about genies earlier.

1188
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,660
The genie also magicians.

1189
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,740
Harry Potter is not a magician.

1190
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,620
I know. Oh, technically wizard.

1191
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:25,580
Harry Potter is a magician.

1192
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,900
It would be. Oh, man.

1193
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,020
The whole thing a lot.

1194
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,300
It does make Hogwarts into like the Magic Castle,

1195
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,140
which makes it a lot less interesting.

1196
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,980
I like the Magic Castle a lot. Don't get me wrong.

1197
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:38,660
I'm just saying that like this is a place where kids go to learn magic tricks.

1198
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,100
I wouldn't send any kids to the Magic Castle.

1199
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,300
No, I'd be careful about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1200
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,060
But if Harry Potter could cross over with the Now You See Me universe.

1201
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,060
I mean, well, he kind of did.

1202
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,260
Daniel Radcliffe showing up. Oh, that's true.

1203
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,100
Playing Arthur Tressler's son.

1204
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,100
Yeah. Spoiler alert.

1205
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,340
Spoiler alert for everyone's favorite franchise.

1206
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:03,140
Well, I forgot about Daniel Radcliffe being in it till very recently.

1207
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:08,020
That was that I watched the film and it just like left my brain as soon as it entered.

1208
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,700
Yes. That speeds as fast as this coaster.

1209
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:15,140
The creature kind of reminded me of the tremor, like of a tremor.

1210
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:21,140
Oh, yeah. Tremors with like a molten lava asshole.

1211
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,180
Like that's the only way I can.

1212
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:27,500
Sorry. Yeah. How do they eat? Seat hole. Seat hole.

1213
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,100
Great. I fixed it.

1214
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,260
Fixed my vulgarity again.

1215
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,620
I always can fix it.

1216
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:39,860
But they yeah, they they glow with many different colors and are just steaming.

1217
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:42,500
And this is a this is a bad creature to be.

1218
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,540
This is like the weird, the horrible,

1219
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:50,180
you know, like the limbless creatures created by KFC.

1220
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,780
Who live in cramped cages.

1221
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:56,660
That's the blast headed screwed is like an abomination.

1222
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:00,700
Also, Hagrid made him like create genetically like.

1223
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,060
So he's like a doctor.

1224
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:07,540
Roe style. I actually don't know a ton about apologies about the Harry Potter.

1225
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:08,780
He's always getting into miss.

1226
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,260
Is that do you know that?

1227
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,900
Yeah, I am saying that canonically, like he had a dragon.

1228
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,020
He wasn't supposed to have a dragon.

1229
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,580
So he created his dragon.

1230
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,820
I think he's a I think he was breeding stuff.

1231
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,700
Is this a fuck up on the way to drag?

1232
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,940
Did he mess up and then go, oh, it's the blast

1233
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,420
ended screwed?

1234
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,740
Yeah, that's it.

1235
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,580
Yeah, that's the ticket.

1236
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:35,940
I think I think there is John Lovett's is a liar character.

1237
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,820
He loves it.

1238
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:40,900
He's always doing something like he's not not supposed to.

1239
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,300
I guess he is always like doing crazy stuff, like crazy stuff

1240
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,060
out in the forbidden forest and his little house.

1241
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,260
I didn't know he was playing God out there.

1242
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:52,140
Well, I guess he is.

1243
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:56,420
I I make a little mini version of himself who he plays the piano.

1244
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,340
Someone draw that, please.

1245
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,340
Hagrid and mini Hagrid, if you don't know, we're talking about

1246
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,300
island of Dr.

1247
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:06,540
Moreau, the Val Kilmer version, Marlon Brando in it.

1248
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:10,420
And it's the basis for mini me for Austin Powers, too.

1249
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:14,460
Oh, yeah. I didn't know I knew that part, but I didn't know until the

1250
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,460
really great documentary about the making of Dr.

1251
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,980
Moreau that it that the piano part was.

1252
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:23,020
I thought that was full on Austin Powers and.

1253
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:24,660
Oh, oh, oh, no.

1254
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,860
Tiny piano. I know that.

1255
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,740
It's Marlon Brando playing the piano.

1256
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:32,660
And then there's a tinier version of him on top of the piano playing a little piano.

1257
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,900
Yes. Yeah. And that is real.

1258
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:38,620
Also, I've read that everyone in the movie is cursed that made that movie.

1259
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:41,420
There's like a there's like a feeling that, yeah, like, yeah,

1260
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:44,940
the whole cast got cursed by that movie, that there was just bad.

1261
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,980
That's why Val Kilmer looks like Val Kilmer does now.

1262
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:51,020
Well, yeah. And he had an issue with his health.

1263
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,780
Oh, no. Your health issue. Yeah.

1264
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,860
I didn't know that. And I'm making fun of him.

1265
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,820
Shit. Well, you know, I meant Mark Twain.

1266
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,980
That's right. Yeah, that's what you meant.

1267
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,700
He looks permanently looks like Mark Twain.

1268
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,420
But yeah, there's there's that movie is very interesting.

1269
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,660
There should be some sort of experience based on that.

1270
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:11,860
And Dr. Moreau. Oh, man. Yeah, that's who also, you know,

1271
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,540
that's one of epic universes by surprise.

1272
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:17,220
It's not Fantastic Beasts. It's Dr. Moreau.

1273
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,220
It's Dr. Moreau. I think I read that book in school

1274
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,420
and then I saw there was a movie.

1275
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:26,100
So I watched the movie and I was like, this is very different.

1276
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,620
Yeah. I honestly, you know, everything is IP right now.

1277
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:35,140
So as I'm saying this, I was like, so much to make a new island of Dr. Moreau.

1278
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:41,820
And do it like Superman Returns, where you take old Marlon Brando footage.

1279
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:46,740
If it's a Marlon Brando property, we got to find all the footage we can.

1280
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,340
Oh, my God. That's such a great idea.

1281
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:52,020
Every movie he's ever made from like on the waterfront on,

1282
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,300
you should look for his like B roll foot or like cut scenes

1283
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:00,260
and piece it together in the new version of the island of Dr. Moreau.

1284
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,260
So we like it. You can then you can tell an epic story.

1285
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:06,420
Yeah. He was young and in black and white to when he's older.

1286
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,220
All eras. Yes. Yeah.

1287
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:14,140
You could repurpose what was shot for scary movie two.

1288
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,660
Oh, yeah.

1289
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,140
Yeah, it is. And it became James Woods.

1290
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,940
Andy Richter is in the scene.

1291
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:24,620
Andy Richter, I believe, acted with Marlon Brando in a scene never released.

1292
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:27,620
Right. This footage does exist.

1293
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:30,660
So, yeah, you could take and him as an exorcist could be repurposed

1294
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,020
to be him as a doctor. Yeah. Yeah.

1295
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:37,820
I think that's also you could repurpose the footage of his interview with Larry King.

1296
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,260
Was me an angel.

1297
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:44,300
He like sings. They sing like 40s ditties together.

1298
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,820
Yeah. And then they kiss.

1299
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,500
Yes. Like a sweet kiss between Larry and Marlon.

1300
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:52,620
Yes. Marlon is kind of antagonizing Larry the whole time during the interview,

1301
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:53,820
which is kind of funny.

1302
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,940
Then they sing some old standards together and then they kiss on the mouth.

1303
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:01,860
This is the sort of abomination in front of God that only Hagrid

1304
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:04,860
can cook up in the woods.

1305
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:08,580
So twisted horror.

1306
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:13,260
My strangest creature yet, Larry King.

1307
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:20,700
Late in life, Marlon Brando in the tan suit from that one music video

1308
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,140
and also the score.

1309
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,980
You mean the Michael Jackson one? The You Rock My World video?

1310
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,340
Yeah, right. There's got to be footage.

1311
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,020
There's got to be extra footage from that, too.

1312
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,620
Yeah. And do you guys you know about when he was at that

1313
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,740
Michael Jackson concert right before 9-11 and he was just rolled on

1314
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,660
on a couch in sunglasses and he rambled about like, kids are getting killed

1315
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:45,180
with machetes and like at that Michael Jackson concert, you just got to see like.

1316
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,220
All right. All right. So coming up, the Jackson five reuniting for the first time

1317
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:51,820
in 20 years. But first, Marlon Brando saying whatever he wants on a couch.

1318
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,740
I saw that. They didn't even announce it.

1319
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,820
It was just they just rolled it out and he started talking.

1320
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:58,420
I've seen that special, but I do not know.

1321
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,300
Special. Oh, it's just like grainy.

1322
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,820
Like somebody just had a camera.

1323
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:03,780
Filmed it.

1324
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,340
Well, Madison Square Garden.

1325
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:09,180
This this does this sounds like a half remembered like

1326
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,900
Dana Carvey shows or exit 57.

1327
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:15,820
Like one of those sketch shows that I'm like,

1328
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:18,100
yeah, I kind of remember that.

1329
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,220
Yeah, yeah.

1330
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,220
If this man, an old man on a couch like that.

1331
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:23,260
Yeah, it feels like a sketch.

1332
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,180
Like, where do we put Marlon? I don't know.

1333
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:28,220
After Spacey oddities, maybe Brando oddities.

1334
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,900
Oh, yeah.

1335
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:33,260
Well, and I'm vouching for I'd love Travolta.

1336
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,740
Who? Oh, man.

1337
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:37,700
We both made the same.

1338
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,900
Jason, I both made the same noise.

1339
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,540
Oh, that's that one's too difficult.

1340
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,700
Oh, no, I just like, yeah, yeah.

1341
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,740
Have you seen every little step?

1342
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,020
Yeah, of course.

1343
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,780
Of course, I've seen every little step, please.

1344
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,580
I watch it once a month.

1345
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,580
Please look up John Travolta, every little step.

1346
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,660
Oh, yes.

1347
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:57,580
You've seen the like newer videos he's made with Olivia Newton, John.

1348
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:00,620
That you're like low fi, like low res.

1349
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,660
Yeah.

1350
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,060
Like in like no budget.

1351
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,500
And they're just singing.

1352
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,500
I forget what song it is.

1353
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:10,180
I found a weird one where he's playing a giant game of hide and seek in a YouTubers.

1354
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:15,100
No, it's in his house, but he invites a YouTuber over to play hide and seek with his whole family.

1355
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:19,100
Oh, my God. He has a GoPro strapped to his head and you get to hear all his thoughts about like,

1356
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:24,100
well, I think they'll see me if I stay on top of if I stay next to the cabinet.

1357
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,900
So I'm going to move over into the crawl space.

1358
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:30,020
The strange like it's like being inside his head.

1359
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,020
It's like a being John Malkovich.

1360
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,260
Oh, my gosh.

1361
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,540
You are playing hide and seek inside of John Travolta.

1362
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:40,660
Not quite the most dangerous game, but it's some sort of game.

1363
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,540
All right. Travolta oddities as well.

1364
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,140
Yeah. Oh, boy. New episodes left and right.

1365
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:52,380
OK, back to back to where the creatures are for staying on this.

1366
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:56,620
We can also just like talk through the order of events of the of the ride.

1367
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:00,180
Yeah, I have opening opening day stuff, too.

1368
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,700
Sure. But yeah, what other creature?

1369
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,300
Well, you see, well, here that takes us through the.

1370
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,660
Yeah, OK. I'll go through the I'll go through the order of things.

1371
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:08,940
So you get you get on the thing.

1372
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,900
It starts sputtering.

1373
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:13,780
It takes off and it's very exciting right away.

1374
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,620
And there's good little moves right away.

1375
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,460
But it's just a preview of what's to come.

1376
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:20,260
But it is very exciting from the second from that very first launch.

1377
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,460
Then you end up in a little hut and you see the blasted end of the screw.

1378
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,420
And he glows and then he kind of breathes some smoke and you take off.

1379
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,260
Oh, and the Hagrid animatronic.

1380
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,180
Very good animatronic.

1381
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,900
Garner Holt animatronics, of course, is a girl.

1382
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,820
It is. Yeah. Oh, it's.

1383
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:37,380
Yeah. The only the only complaint I have about the animatronics

1384
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:40,620
is that we're not close to them like we are in like the riot

1385
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,660
in the first Forbidden Journey, right?

1386
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,220
Is that the way when I'm?

1387
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,980
You mean when you're very close to a dragon?

1388
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,180
Yeah, like close to the dragon and close to the spiders and stuff.

1389
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:50,700
Like I just wish I could see them closer.

1390
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,220
I mean, this is I can't do it.

1391
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,420
I'm just like, yeah, they're like, oh, this awesome.

1392
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:58,460
And it's a thing that elevates the original Harry Potter ride.

1393
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:02,340
Yeah, that's an aspect only that has that keeps it essential.

1394
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:04,220
That's all I'm saying. But it's really not a complaint.

1395
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:07,260
It's just like I think it looks like they look awesome.

1396
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,860
Yeah, I'm saying they're very cool.

1397
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,820
So then the Hagrid animatronic, then you take off.

1398
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,740
There's this this huge straightaway

1399
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,660
that then goes up into a lift till and then through an arch.

1400
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:22,180
And this and that section right after Hagrid, I feel like is the like

1401
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:28,260
most exciting coaster part that it's a long, long stretch before more

1402
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,180
like plot and characters happen. That's super exciting.

1403
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,580
And there's big banks.

1404
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:38,700
You go all the way like tilt all the way in a 90 degrees to the left and right.

1405
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,180
It's like a sizably wide vehicle.

1406
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:45,460
So when you go, I actually think the bank turns in the sidecar are pretty damn.

1407
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,580
That's cool. Yeah. Yeah.

1408
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:51,700
And an interesting thing to me, there's not a lot of like

1409
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,220
catwalks or infrastructure.

1410
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,340
Like, I guess you're not high.

1411
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:59,980
You're not super high off the ground in the way that

1412
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:06,140
Dueling Dragons was where they would need that infrastructure for evacuations.

1413
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:10,100
So for the but it does help the immersion and helps the theming

1414
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:14,660
that there's not a lot of like breaking the reality of zooming through the woods.

1415
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,220
That's true. Yeah. Yeah.

1416
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,500
And you're going so fast.

1417
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,700
It is just this blur of trees. Yes.

1418
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:22,140
Yeah, it's a very it feels like a forest.

1419
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,820
And we were told we couldn't.

1420
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,700
They're not running the ride a lot at night right now,

1421
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:30,300
but we were told that the night ride is the ultimate version of this ride.

1422
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:33,460
I assume because like there's big stretches that don't have much.

1423
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,340
Some like don't have many lights.

1424
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:38,700
So when you're zooming through, you're not seeing much of the track, probably.

1425
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,220
Well, I know the answer.

1426
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:43,540
Friends of the show, Carly Weisel, wrote an article about this.

1427
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:48,100
The lights at night are the headlights on the motorcycles.

1428
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,460
That's the lights. Right. That's it.

1429
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:53,100
Yeah. So you really you can't you don't know what the hell's happened.

1430
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,580
The suddenly it's Space Mountain. Yeah.

1431
00:59:56,140 --> 01:00:00,180
The other thing she pointed out any time, like in a natural

1432
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:05,100
like a point in a roller coaster where you would naturally plateau, you launch.

1433
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:08,540
That's yes. That's what kind of sets this apart.

1434
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:11,100
Oh, that's a good way to put it. Yeah, right. Right.

1435
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:14,300
That's the sensation that one of the sensations

1436
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:17,060
I'm talking about when I'm saying like, oh, this is like new.

1437
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:20,180
This feels new because generally on a roller coaster, even the craziest ones

1438
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:22,100
I've been and I am not a coaster head.

1439
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,940
I'm working my way up to it.

1440
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:28,020
But even like the craziest ones I've done, the first part

1441
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,620
generally is where you get all your energy built up

1442
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:34,420
and then you're going through and you coast off of that energy the whole time.

1443
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:36,740
And some of there's like one midway point.

1444
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:39,500
That's right. An exciting surprise. Right. Yeah.

1445
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,980
But this has what is it?

1446
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:43,220
Is it seven seven seven launches?

1447
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:47,620
Yeah. So you're constantly feeling this refreshment of energy.

1448
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:51,740
It feels like it's almost like a three act structure a little bit.

1449
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:54,660
Yeah. Yeah. Like it's sort of and then like a grand finale.

1450
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:57,220
Like they save the biggest launch till the end.

1451
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,820
But and then they're they're less intense launches too.

1452
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:04,100
Like if you had, yeah, you could take kids on this.

1453
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:09,300
Like there's a small there is a height requirement, but it's not super intense.

1454
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,860
It's kind of slinky dog dash similar.

1455
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:13,220
Right. Did that have multiple?

1456
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:16,020
Yeah. Oh, there's a there's like it kind of I think it's there's

1457
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:18,100
there's only two launches. There might be two.

1458
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:21,340
Because there's the middle one is like sort of that on slinky is like

1459
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:24,820
where they kind of reset and you go through those circle things.

1460
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:27,420
Yeah. Yeah. And then you shoot up again.

1461
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:30,340
Yeah. That slinky would be a good

1462
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:32,300
coaster for like your first coaster.

1463
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,260
I mean, they always we always say Big Thunder is a good term.

1464
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:39,580
Like kind of even test for whatever, you know, if you're like 10 or 11

1465
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:44,620
or maybe 16 or 17 and you haven't gone on things or in some cases with me.

1466
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,740
How old was I last year?

1467
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:48,980
I don't remember. I was ready.

1468
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:51,260
34. I was actually OK.

1469
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,900
So, yeah, there are seven launches on this.

1470
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:56,460
I was again, as I said, there was reading about this.

1471
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,380
It's a ton of launches.

1472
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,340
There's drops and there's like a spike, quote unquote.

1473
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,700
I don't know if I want to do this thing.

1474
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:07,060
I'm so glad I became a launch queen as we've been recording these episodes.

1475
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:08,940
And I was trying to do some math.

1476
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:10,860
OK, so all right.

1477
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,140
The biggest launch in this with most

1478
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:15,100
intense, intense one is zero to 50 in three seconds.

1479
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:18,620
In credit, coaster felt like a crazy one to me.

1480
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:20,540
But now I've now I'm a pro.

1481
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,580
That's zero to 55 in four seconds.

1482
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:26,100
Rock and roller, I would call the most intense one that I've done.

1483
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,260
That's how it feels to me.

1484
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:30,300
It's not that much, but it's very fast.

1485
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,740
It's zero to 57 in two point eight seconds.

1486
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:36,460
Very significantly faster than these other ones.

1487
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:41,420
And I mean, just hearing hearing like loud body rock and roll music also

1488
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,420
just makes us experience so much more intense.

1489
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:48,060
That is I mean, you joke, but that is a good trick like pitch blackness,

1490
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,580
loud music, Hulk.

1491
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:52,540
You go through like you can't see where you're going

1492
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:54,940
and then you immediately twist coming out of it.

1493
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:55,940
What does that launch?

1494
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,100
We do we have an episode about this coming up.

1495
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,020
I don't remember the numbers.

1496
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:02,140
Zero to 60 in two seconds or three.

1497
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:04,180
It's every time I talk about it.

1498
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:08,500
I can't pull it off the top of my head, but it's certainly more than what we're

1499
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,700
talking about. Certainly more.

1500
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:10,740
Yeah. Yeah.

1501
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,140
Hmm. Yeah. Coming up.

1502
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:13,660
Stay tuned. Hulk coming up.

1503
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:17,380
Yeah. The Hulk is I think I said it's more intense, but I said it gets away with all.

1504
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:21,620
It gets the psychological stuff out of the way quick, which is my always my thing.

1505
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,380
Yeah. It doesn't.

1506
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:25,740
The buildup is always worse than actually the right itself.

1507
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:30,700
So like Hulk, that's you have no time to think about any of the scary things on.

1508
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:33,820
No. And this one buildup isn't even in the picture.

1509
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:35,260
It's all so joyous.

1510
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:36,500
Yes. Yeah.

1511
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,420
Yeah. You're never there's not one part of this that well, no.

1512
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:42,700
Hang on. Well, I guess I think we maybe are heading to the scarier parts.

1513
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:45,580
Yes. You see fluffy real quick, right?

1514
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:46,580
A three headed dog.

1515
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:47,740
The three headed dog.

1516
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,860
Is he a bore? Is that also a boar hound?

1517
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,060
Do we know or is it?

1518
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,220
I have a list here.

1519
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:54,300
Where is it?

1520
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,580
Oh, I don't have it right here.

1521
01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:00,540
That's where I think supposed to evoke Seribus, the devil dog.

1522
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,500
Oh, sure. Headed devil dog.

1523
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,060
Cool. I'm trying. Very cool. I'm trying.

1524
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:08,140
Yeah. Then and then OK, just past that,

1525
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:11,900
then you go through this like log, the kind of log structure.

1526
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:13,180
It's like a little mountain or something.

1527
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:14,580
And there's a car on top of that.

1528
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:15,380
What's the Harry Potter?

1529
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:16,420
What is this in Harry Potter?

1530
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:19,180
The car and the pixies are dangling off of it.

1531
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:20,220
Is that the Weasley car?

1532
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,180
Yeah, that's the Weasley's flying car.

1533
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:23,100
OK, OK.

1534
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:26,620
The car and the motorcycle are like oddities in the wizarding world

1535
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:29,380
because they don't really drive cars.

1536
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,140
Oh, gotcha. OK.

1537
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:34,580
And that car is in the queue for Forbidden Journey.

1538
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:35,860
All right.

1539
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,580
Yeah, some of them.

1540
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:40,700
I think it used to be in this queue.

1541
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:41,860
Did they take it out and put it over?

1542
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:43,180
Maybe they put it in Hollywood.

1543
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:46,300
I think it is. I think in Florida, it was always in this queue.

1544
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:48,900
I see. But it's somewhere in the land sputtering.

1545
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:49,980
Just right stopped.

1546
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:53,420
OK, so you go you go through this like

1547
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:57,780
like under this little rock structure where that car is into submissed.

1548
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:01,060
And when you come out the other side, they do such a good job of hiding this.

1549
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:02,860
That is what they use.

1550
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:08,340
The Wikipedia calls a spike where, OK, it's described as a spike

1551
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:12,340
that catapults guests 65 feet into the air at a more than 70 degree angle,

1552
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,460
followed by a backwards drop in one movement.

1553
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,300
You just go like straight up.

1554
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:18,620
And that is that was the biggest surprise of it to me.

1555
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:19,780
Like, what's this?

1556
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:24,220
It's like a mini version, a very, very mini version of like the Superman.

1557
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,460
Like, yeah.

1558
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:28,980
But this is a thing I wouldn't have.

1559
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:31,020
I would have been like, I don't know if I want to go on this.

1560
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:34,100
So when I was when that was just happening and I'm just staring straight up,

1561
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,620
that scared the shit out of me.

1562
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,340
Luckily, you aren't there for very long.

1563
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:39,660
But it's so crazy how they hide it behind that mountain.

1564
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:41,860
And then you're like, what? I'm just staring straight up now.

1565
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:45,940
And I went through mist like my like my face is a little misty.

1566
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:49,220
Yeah, I surprised me in how

1567
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:53,140
not just how sharp the angle is, but how quick it is.

1568
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:56,940
Because Expedition Everest, you know, you come to the bent track part

1569
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:59,980
and you you stop there for a while and then you go backwards.

1570
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:01,660
This was almost like a pendulum.

1571
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:04,900
You stop for a second and then you go backwards really quick.

1572
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:05,900
Yeah, yeah.

1573
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:11,540
And it's a similar moment in a in a in a coaster where they have to make a switch

1574
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:15,620
behind you, because now you've got to go backwards

1575
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:20,420
into a whole other section of track and into a like not the place you came from.

1576
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:25,220
So that's really fast to be up there for a little track switch to occur.

1577
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,940
Yeah, I would.

1578
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:28,740
I did not look at a video.

1579
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:30,740
I would love to see it happen.

1580
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,220
Like I would love to see it.

1581
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:35,220
How quick the switches, because, yeah, every time I've seen a video

1582
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:38,540
of some sort of track switch on a coaster, it feels like it takes a little while.

1583
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:41,660
That everyone feel like you have to stay there.

1584
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:44,020
Sometimes you get delayed up there, seemingly.

1585
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:45,340
Yeah. I make the switch.

1586
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:50,220
And then you get delayed on that when you finally end your backwards descent.

1587
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:53,260
Sometimes you get delayed there, too, because the tracks got to switch.

1588
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,300
Oh, gotcha.

1589
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,900
But yeah, both times we went on this part of it.

1590
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,380
We did get delayed a little bit in one of the sections.

1591
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,100
Yeah, yeah. But this part, yeah, was so quick.

1592
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,900
Really? No sign of process.

1593
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,580
So cool. It's really, really cool.

1594
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:10,380
Yeah. And then you go backwards into a show building.

1595
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,140
And you don't know where now you don't know where you are in this forest.

1596
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:15,340
They're like, where was the show building hidden?

1597
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:18,620
And that is like a that's like a cave.

1598
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,660
And there is a again, I don't know, Harry Potter things.

1599
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:25,300
What is the centaur kind of creature pointed an arrow at you?

1600
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:28,180
They they live in the woods. OK.

1601
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:29,780
Noble creatures.

1602
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:32,340
But I like the standoffish.

1603
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,140
I enjoy the woods.

1604
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:37,780
Now that that I think is interesting because I think that's just a statue

1605
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:40,060
that there's a quick lighting cue to illuminate.

1606
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,020
Oh, not an animal trying.

1607
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:43,580
I am not 100 percent sure.

1608
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:48,460
It looked stationary to me, but I thought it was a it's a trick, right?

1609
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:51,740
It's to distract you because then the drop happens.

1610
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:53,060
Not quite that.

1611
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:54,460
No, you keep going.

1612
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:56,780
You're pretty that that thing's pretty far out of sight.

1613
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:59,180
Because you have to go back into.

1614
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:03,460
What is the it's the devil's snare, the devil's snare,

1615
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:07,180
these malevolent vines that that get a hold of you.

1616
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,820
So you go you keep going backwards and backwards and backwards,

1617
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:12,660
and then you stop entirely and you look behind you.

1618
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,700
And where do we go?

1619
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:15,980
What happens from here?

1620
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:20,060
And the room is getting covered in these vines.

1621
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:21,180
That's creepy as hell.

1622
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,860
They did a great job with that effect.

1623
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:24,620
So where do we go? What do we do?

1624
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:26,940
Suddenly drop straight down.

1625
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,580
It is such a shock.

1626
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:30,380
Did you guys both know about that?

1627
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:32,140
Yes. Yeah. OK.

1628
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:35,980
I didn't quite know how it was happening, but I did read that.

1629
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:41,100
So but like I think I even read up the thing going up.

1630
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:43,500
I read about that, but I totally like forgot about it.

1631
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:47,340
I didn't look at any pictures or videos, so I knew it right.

1632
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:50,020
Intellectually, I knew what was coming,

1633
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:52,620
but I didn't know the order and I didn't know the execution.

1634
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:53,820
You know what that feels like?

1635
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:54,820
I didn't know what it feels like.

1636
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:58,380
And I was shocked as Mike said, I was like very surprised.

1637
01:08:58,420 --> 01:08:59,940
Yeah. Pretty much all of this.

1638
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:02,860
It takes a lot to surprise me.

1639
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:06,860
And it feels like the floor just gives out.

1640
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:11,300
It just feels like, yeah, it just feels like, ah, like a like a floor collapses.

1641
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:12,820
Essentially. Absolutely.

1642
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:14,460
You feel really untethered.

1643
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:16,380
Yes. It rattles you.

1644
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:19,420
And that's where we got stuck the first time,

1645
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,060
which I was OK with because I needed a second.

1646
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,900
I needed a breather. Sure. Yeah.

1647
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:27,260
That and then you're just that was that was very unsettling.

1648
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:31,060
Just being in this dark room and having done that big surprise.

1649
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:34,700
But boy, then to get to do it a second time and experience the full effect

1650
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:37,580
where you drop and then just immediately you're going.

1651
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,700
It's nuts. Also. OK. So there's two of those.

1652
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:44,140
There's two rooms next to each other. OK, sure.

1653
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,980
So I think if one drop is not working,

1654
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:50,980
they can still run the ride with the second room. Wow. Wow.

1655
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:54,500
Yeah. So I think I think we saw I think you could see out the

1656
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:58,340
like you saw the other room shooting. Yeah. Cars out when we were stuck.

1657
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,660
Oh, one went ahead of us.

1658
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:01,940
So I don't know what they did.

1659
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:04,620
You know, they didn't fill us in on what went wrong in our version

1660
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,300
or when we went to the first time.

1661
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:09,540
But obviously the other one was either working or whatever.

1662
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:13,460
So so cool. Yeah, very cool.

1663
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:18,260
You power back up a huge flame shoots out of the wall.

1664
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:20,860
Hagrid's narrating you through all this stuff.

1665
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:22,380
He gives you a spell.

1666
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:25,020
I think that's why the drop happens. That's how you get out of there.

1667
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:27,540
Yeah, you get really. Yes. Yes. Yes. I think that's a second screw.

1668
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:30,580
Is that supposed to be a second screw that's fiery and that always.

1669
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:31,980
I don't know what that flame is.

1670
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:34,300
I think so. I think he's like, oh, there's the other one.

1671
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,900
OK, I believe that's what happened.

1672
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,540
It's kind of hard to tell in the in the ride through videos.

1673
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:40,900
OK, OK. So noisy. That's cool.

1674
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:44,700
And then you do the fastest lunch. Then there's a zero to 50.

1675
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:47,940
They save on a way that most roller coasters could not do.

1676
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:50,700
You know, and like, yeah, think about in credit coaster, it's sort of like

1677
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:54,780
Peter's out a little. I like those little drops and then the swirls.

1678
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:57,460
I think they do a good job of ending it in a fairly exciting way.

1679
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:00,660
But like this might be as a rare coaster where, you know,

1680
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:02,740
one of the coolest things happens at the end.

1681
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:06,100
Yeah. I mean, very few, very few, if ever.

1682
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,580
Do you get on the coasters?

1683
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:08,900
Do you get that launch at the end?

1684
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:12,140
Like most I think most coasters feel like they do the trick when now they've

1685
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:15,460
dropped you to the like the lowest part of the coaster and spin you

1686
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:19,220
to try to get the last bit of the like propulsion out energy.

1687
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:22,100
Yeah. And to make you feel like you're a little disoriented.

1688
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:24,820
Like honestly, that last loop on the Incredicoaster, that's

1689
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,300
other than maybe the the the loop.

1690
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:31,740
When you're going around, my head kind of goes like it's almost

1691
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:34,100
I feel like they're trying to do a different trick on you as opposed

1692
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,740
to just like launching you fast and straight, which is what this does.

1693
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:38,180
And it's a much more pleasurable.

1694
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:40,940
Trying to distract you from the sandlot in the center.

1695
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:43,020
Well, that boy funnel.

1696
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:44,700
That is also an issue.

1697
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:48,740
That's really that's truly put to shame by the thousand trees of this ride.

1698
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:53,580
Right on the other side of the coaster, there are like there is dune grass.

1699
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:57,060
And it's like, honestly, if you just plant more dune grass in the center,

1700
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:58,940
that's all it would like.

1701
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:01,340
I don't know. Just a little trick. Yeah.

1702
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:04,460
Well, I can't believe in all of the renovations.

1703
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:07,300
They didn't put some Incredibles or the big Jack Jack.

1704
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:08,260
That's what we said.

1705
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:12,780
I mean, I'm sure I am sure somebody proposed that.

1706
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:16,020
But this is a giant Jack Jack trying to grab at the coast.

1707
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:18,260
Like it just makes too much sense.

1708
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:22,660
And I'm sure they put it some or an under minor burst into the ground.

1709
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:25,500
That's not really the story, but I like that under minor. That's great.

1710
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:27,020
That's fine, too.

1711
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:32,420
That comparing the Incredicoaster to this where like, yeah, that centaur is far away.

1712
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:36,340
So, yeah, OK, I'm not 100 percent sure if it's a statue or an animatronic.

1713
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,220
It doesn't seem to be moving a lot.

1714
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:42,260
But like one of those with a solid lighting cue, that's great.

1715
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:47,300
All of them at the Incredicoaster are just stationary statues.

1716
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,900
That's kind of a bummer. Yeah.

1717
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:51,540
Well, it's it's again, we I want to just defend the image.

1718
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:53,940
Of course they wanted to make something like move.

1719
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:56,420
Yeah, but the budget. I know you're not running them down.

1720
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:59,300
I'm just saying we know we know the budget.

1721
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,700
Well, and we know what you're doing, shape back.

1722
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:06,700
Well, we're here clearly initially must have come from Lasseter.

1723
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:09,820
So it's another we can conveniently blame it on him.

1724
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:10,980
Blame Lasseter.

1725
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,820
I insisted on statues and not animatronics.

1726
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:16,180
Mm hmm. I wanted to blame Chaypec.

1727
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:20,780
And then I wanted to say that will the Mike Lysander Shadow Council,

1728
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:24,540
the three of us will be put in charge of the parks.

1729
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:27,420
Change your ways, Bob.

1730
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:29,980
Bob Chaypec will report to us.

1731
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:32,900
Do it because it's delightful, not because of the bottom line.

1732
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:36,580
He is Bob.

1733
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:40,500
Bob Chaypec has to go to our version of Mexico to go to talk to us.

1734
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:42,260
That's how it'll work from now on.

1735
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:44,780
But in this one, we win.

1736
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:46,380
Yes, but in this one, we win.

1737
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,140
Yes. Yes, that's the important distinction.

1738
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:53,860
He doesn't get all of the spirits of past presidents of parks in his head.

1739
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:55,380
He. Yeah. Yeah.

1740
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:57,980
And our lightning wins.

1741
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:58,940
We shoot him with lightning.

1742
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:01,180
We shoot Bob Chaypec.

1743
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:01,940
But it's like lightning.

1744
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:04,580
It's an electricity of ideas and creativity.

1745
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:07,140
Yeah. And then he becomes like spirits.

1746
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:12,300
Is this the future of parks that will or may I still change my ways?

1747
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:15,860
In instance, in honesty, if we were in charge of the parks,

1748
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:18,780
would we bankrupt the Walt Disney Company within six months?

1749
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,140
I think the answer is yes.

1750
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:21,340
I think we would have green light.

1751
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:25,580
So much stuff, so much cool stuff like the parks would be so good

1752
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:29,980
for a few months before they had to close because we spent so much money.

1753
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:33,660
That is what is cool about Eisner.

1754
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:36,740
I think that it's going to be the Disney decade.

1755
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:39,860
And then in two years, he blew through all of it.

1756
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:44,460
Yeah. Well, now that second half was rough, but boy, we were flying high.

1757
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:47,060
When I manipulate them into spending a billion dollars

1758
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:50,780
to bring back both Touchstone and Club Penguin,

1759
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:52,900
I'm going to argue with you on that one.

1760
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:55,340
I feel like I don't care about that.

1761
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:58,740
I was not a Club Penguin kid, but I am fascinated by it

1762
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:00,780
because it does seem like some kids spend a lot.

1763
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:03,180
Do you know this was like the online game?

1764
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,780
Yeah. Pre social media thing.

1765
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:11,660
I would advocate they like sell Fox back to the Murdochs, sell ABC,

1766
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:14,620
sell so many different things they have that are boring,

1767
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:15,980
that are boring, just as fun.

1768
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:17,220
The parks. Yeah.

1769
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:19,500
I mean, like, get the billions, get billions of dollars,

1770
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:21,420
sell Star Wars back to George Lucas.

1771
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:24,580
They can still I want to still be in the park, sell it back to George.

1772
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:28,500
And then let's just use all the money to make Westcott.

1773
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:34,020
And then the rise of the true source of power, the return of Go.com.

1774
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,260
The Go.com never left.

1775
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:37,140
Yeah, that's true.

1776
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:40,620
Powering the servers, still powering the Disney servers.

1777
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:44,180
I think what we really want is to be in charge of the Oriental Land Company.

1778
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:46,060
Oh, my gosh. Tokyo.

1779
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:49,500
So we could say, hmm, I think triple spending.

1780
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:51,740
And everyone will say, yes, very good.

1781
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:53,060
And then it'll happen.

1782
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:56,900
I think we probably are needed the least there, but it would be fun to

1783
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:59,660
be an easier road. Yeah.

1784
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:01,460
Well, they just bought in Florida.

1785
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:04,940
They just bought that chunk of property that has like a body of water.

1786
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:08,900
Do you see this? Like Disney bought a chunk of land that does have water on it.

1787
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:12,260
And there were some people fantasy casting online going like,

1788
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:15,500
build Disney Sea, build like in America.

1789
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:16,820
Yeah.

1790
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:19,820
That's weird because like they did like they made up

1791
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:21,740
with a body of water in Disney Sea.

1792
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:24,700
It's not like it'd be like, oh, it would be very cheap to make Disney.

1793
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:28,420
Well, I have here's one of my ideas that I would have pitched

1794
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:30,700
or make Bob Chepik do, Disney Swamp.

1795
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:34,500
Sure. Orlando Disney Swamp.

1796
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:37,940
Tokyo Disney Sea, Orlando Disney Swamp.

1797
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:40,420
I think that's you can still do a similar.

1798
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:42,300
It is pretty good.

1799
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:45,500
It's the Swamp Thing live there.

1800
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,700
Yes, he does. They own.

1801
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,580
No, no, it's DC. No, yeah.

1802
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:50,660
They'll buy Swamp Thing in some sort of a train.

1803
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:51,980
Man thing.

1804
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:54,180
Yeah, they own an identical character.

1805
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:56,540
There's a Marvel comics character, a man thing.

1806
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:57,300
Great man thing.

1807
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:58,780
He's from the swamp, I think, too.

1808
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:02,500
You could do a ride where you like recreate how we meet Kermit

1809
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:03,820
in the Muppet movie.

1810
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:05,580
You like see him singing. Right.

1811
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:06,860
Rainbow Connection. Yeah.

1812
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:09,060
And like go through Kermit Swamp home.

1813
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:11,700
Entire Emmett Otter world.

1814
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,740
Yeah. Now we're Disney Swamp.

1815
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:17,500
Shared universe with Pizza Rizzo and the Regal Eagle barbecue.

1816
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:20,140
This is too soon to call for Regal Eagle barbecue.

1817
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:23,100
We should probably do an Orlando Disney Swamp shirt

1818
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,940
that looks like they start seeing him in the parks.

1819
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:27,940
Yeah.

1820
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:30,820
I would wear the Disney Swamp shirt.

1821
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:33,860
Sure. Maybe we need to do an episode where we flesh it all out.

1822
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:36,180
That's a good idea, too. That's coming in 2020.

1823
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:37,180
Yeah, great. Yeah.

1824
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:38,660
We'll design all of it.

1825
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:44,500
So you get through the fastest launch and then you land and you see

1826
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:49,860
a beautiful unicorn and as Hagrid says, Oh, and look, she's a mum.

1827
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:51,820
She's a mum.

1828
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:53,020
Ain't she?

1829
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:55,220
You know, a little baby unicorn.

1830
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,700
That's wonderful. Very cute.

1831
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:57,700
Yeah.

1832
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:00,940
In the pre-show video, he's talking about all the creatures.

1833
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:02,420
You'll see it at the very end.

1834
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:07,940
He like this very, very funny, odd delivery where he goes, and if we're lucky

1835
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:12,580
or if we're lucky to lure one in a unicorn.

1836
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:17,060
I was just like, I don't know what it is about the delivery,

1837
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:20,940
but he just like leans forward a little like he's telling you a secret.

1838
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:26,660
And I don't know why I found that so delightful or just so interesting.

1839
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:28,780
But I was like, it's kind of cute.

1840
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:30,780
Like he's telling you a little secret.

1841
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:33,180
He's telling that's 100 of his closest friends.

1842
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:33,820
The secret.

1843
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:37,020
That's like a different version of my thing with Optimus Prime,

1844
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:40,180
where it's like he's addressing you and you feel like special.

1845
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:45,380
There's a restaurant called Howlin' Rays in Los Angeles that we've been to.

1846
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:48,380
And one of my favorite things is that if the owner is there,

1847
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:51,900
oftentimes he'll do a thing where he goes like, I gave you extra pickles.

1848
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:54,500
And then he puts like his finger to his mouth like he's don't tell anyone.

1849
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:57,140
And you feel like you're like a free side.

1850
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,420
Yeah, like here's some free fries.

1851
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:02,100
And he goes, and then you're like, wow, he likes me.

1852
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:02,820
This is cool.

1853
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:04,540
I know. I like we have a secret now.

1854
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:07,140
And it's what Hagrid is doing with the whole with every guest.

1855
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:09,980
Yeah, like we know we're in on it now.

1856
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:14,100
It makes you and look and like dig deep into the sidecar.

1857
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:16,700
There's a couple of pickles for you.

1858
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:18,780
There's a couple of pickles for you.

1859
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:21,140
Shh, keep it quiet.

1860
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:22,900
Don't tell the motorcycle driver.

1861
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:27,740
That's the way to make the sidecar a better experience is there's secret pickles.

1862
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:29,860
Oh, my God. Yeah.

1863
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:31,180
Secret pickle compartment.

1864
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:33,340
That is that would be a true innovation.

1865
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:36,340
I've heard actually, though, on Rise to the Resistance, there are secret pickles

1866
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:38,900
in the vehicles. Oh, wow.

1867
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:42,380
So I mean, food service in a ride is a whole other

1868
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:45,820
arena hasn't been tapped.

1869
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:50,820
So that would be I mean, if is that is that the secret at the end?

1870
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:53,900
Do you get to eat a meal amidst the bad ads?

1871
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:55,980
Oh, yeah, maybe. Maybe you.

1872
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:58,340
Yeah, I think that I don't know the end.

1873
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:03,020
But yes, you have a full three course meal served to you in the right vehicle.

1874
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:06,420
And they're eating big burgers themselves.

1875
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:08,540
Oh, wow. So it's so.

1876
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:12,700
Yeah. So all the all the bad guys are all eating and you're eating too.

1877
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:16,660
And then the resistance comes and they it's sort of like a Thanksgiving

1878
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:19,340
where they bring their food at the end.

1879
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:21,140
That's the end of the ride.

1880
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:25,340
It's sort of a rebels and first order Thanksgiving.

1881
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:26,620
How did we not?

1882
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:31,020
I mean, it's a spoiler to say this isn't the end of the Skywalker story,

1883
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:35,980
but it it does not end with a Thanksgiving style reconciliation

1884
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:38,780
between both sides. That would have been a nice ending.

1885
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:42,860
That would be the evil people turn good and they break bread.

1886
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:45,260
They break self rising bread.

1887
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:46,380
Oh, yeah.

1888
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:49,940
Oh, why haven't they have the self rising bread in the land?

1889
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:53,300
That's like when everyone likes the self rising bread in Force Awakens.

1890
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:54,740
Well, portions. Yeah.

1891
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:58,900
Possible to do not with the wizards and imagineering.

1892
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:01,980
Anyway, we should probably talk about Harry Potter some more.

1893
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:04,060
Yeah. I mean, that's the ride.

1894
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:05,180
That's things that happen.

1895
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:07,340
And they're yeah, it's amazing.

1896
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:10,020
What can I say? It's just like it's it's full of surprises.

1897
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:11,340
And you really got to do it.

1898
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:14,300
I think it's the epitome of a our friend, Andrew Grissom, was saying, like,

1899
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:16,860
I've watched the right through and I don't really like get it.

1900
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:18,980
It does. I've watched the rise, the resistance right through.

1901
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:20,260
And that seems very exciting.

1902
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:22,540
This one I don't get. I'm like, because you got to go.

1903
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:26,220
You got to feel those forces and zip through that forest yourself.

1904
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:29,060
I've heard from other people that they were like, I watched it.

1905
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:30,660
And it looks a little bit underwhelming.

1906
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,780
But it's like it's just it's not.

1907
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:34,460
It's not. I could I could see.

1908
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:35,980
I think my sister watched it, too.

1909
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:39,540
And she was like, well, it seems like there's not a lot of stuff in between.

1910
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:42,900
But it's like this the zipping through

1911
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:49,820
with these launches on this specific vehicle is so fun and thrilling.

1912
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:53,140
Sure, it would be nice if it was loaded with robots,

1913
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:56,140
but it's like you're so excited to be on that little. Yeah.

1914
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:58,620
Like it's still a roller coaster.

1915
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:01,700
The story coaster like this is also like the only like

1916
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:04,780
there's only a handful of I mean, this is this is sort of ringgits

1917
01:22:04,780 --> 01:22:07,700
was kind of the precoast cursor to this.

1918
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:09,820
And Guardians will be the next big one.

1919
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:11,100
I think that's coming.

1920
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:14,020
That'll be there. That's really the test is if that tops this.

1921
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:15,060
I don't know.

1922
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:16,900
I don't really know what's in it. So it's hard to say.

1923
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:21,220
If you are going to go on this, I'll say this.

1924
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:26,180
Do check the operating hours.

1925
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:28,700
So this is a big thing.

1926
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:31,060
Universal kind of hedging their bets with this.

1927
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:35,540
I looked up in the app a few days ago, like on the first or second.

1928
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:40,660
And in the app, the page for Hagrid's does still like have a disclaimer.

1929
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:43,940
May open later and close early,

1930
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:47,580
which is sort of what they were doing when we were down there in October.

1931
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:49,900
It's not like they were expanding hour by hour.

1932
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:52,740
But at the time we were there, they were only running at five hours

1933
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:54,540
in an operating day. Yes.

1934
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,300
And I think they were.

1935
01:22:56,300 --> 01:23:01,180
And part of that was it wasn't operating at full peak capacity.

1936
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:05,420
They were like you can run multiple trains running at once.

1937
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:07,180
At different parts of the ride.

1938
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,420
But they were still trying to get up to that level.

1939
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:14,500
And the blog Orlando Rising got data from touring plans

1940
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,220
or friends of touring plans.

1941
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:21,460
So on average, the month of November was the most successful month of the ride.

1942
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:25,820
They had it broken down by percentage of operating day that Hagrid's was open.

1943
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:28,940
November, the average was about 72 percent.

1944
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:33,060
So if Islands of Adventure is open 8 a.m.

1945
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:37,900
to 8 p.m., 72 percent of that day, Hagrid's was up and running.

1946
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:43,620
But the first month or like the first few weeks of like end of January,

1947
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:46,780
it was only open 46 percent of the operating day.

1948
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:49,380
And if they're not running it at full capacity,

1949
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:52,980
that's why you would see multi hour lines opening day.

1950
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:56,340
The lines were estimated eight to 10 hour waits.

1951
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:59,980
She's and I tried at some point you wouldn't be able to.

1952
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:02,580
If you got in a 10 hour line at noon,

1953
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:05,100
you're not going to get on.

1954
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:07,540
Yeah. And this is it's an interesting.

1955
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:14,540
It's a conundrum because like, well, if you try this is one way to open a ride.

1956
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:19,220
And what you get is news stories about people waiting eight to 10 hour rides.

1957
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:22,100
And guests go, that must be a really good ride.

1958
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:27,260
But then Disney, when we were at Galaxy's Edge opening day, pretty smooth.

1959
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:30,460
And then you get a lot of guests posting on Twitter and Instagram

1960
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:32,540
and Facebook having a good time.

1961
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:35,180
And people go, oh, that must be a pretty good thing.

1962
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:38,580
So I don't I don't know that one is better than the other.

1963
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:42,340
Well, you mean as far as a like a line is always a good marketing tool. Yeah.

1964
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:45,340
That's what like that's what that place,

1965
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:47,420
Hall and Ray's, who I was just talking about, always has a line.

1966
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:50,260
Always has a huge like hour long hour, two hour long line.

1967
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,820
So, yeah, as far as you're like marketing is concerned,

1968
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:55,060
like when you go 10 hour line, I got to do it.

1969
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:56,820
I got to go and do this thing.

1970
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:59,460
So you think it outweighs that there's people who are certainly upset

1971
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:00,620
they didn't get on this thing.

1972
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:01,380
I'm not saying that.

1973
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:05,020
I'm just saying that it's an interesting it's interesting

1974
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:09,940
that Universal has opted to continue the sort of old tradition of that,

1975
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:12,820
whereas it does look like with what Disney's doing in Florida,

1976
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:15,580
at least for Rise of the Resistance, it's like it's all

1977
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:20,500
first in the first thing in the morning, joining a boarding queue,

1978
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:24,500
like when they opened the land and they were in.

1979
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:26,620
So you got to get there immediately.

1980
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:27,700
That's how it's working.

1981
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,940
So they've done it a couple of different ways.

1982
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:30,740
They've switched it up.

1983
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:32,300
They've done in Orlando.

1984
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:35,660
They've I think they started out just doing it where as soon as you got

1985
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:38,460
into the park, you would be added into a queue.

1986
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:42,140
And now I think they're doing it where it's completely sort of random.

1987
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:44,260
It's like you get a reservation. Come back at this.

1988
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:48,100
So, yeah. So basically, like there's no incentive now in Orlando

1989
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:50,020
to get there very early.

1990
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,220
OK, you get there, right.

1991
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:53,060
You have to be there right when it opens.

1992
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:57,940
But it's like it used to be there was like at least like they would form

1993
01:25:57,940 --> 01:26:00,700
some sort of a line starting, you know, what, at 2 a.m. or something.

1994
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:03,780
And then you would sort of just join in the virtual queue

1995
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:06,020
and then it would tell you to come back when it was open.

1996
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:09,700
But it's interesting that they're universal is not doing that

1997
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:11,020
because they could they have.

1998
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:15,020
And in early promotion for this ride, they said it would use the virtual queue

1999
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:17,260
system that they have set up for multiple rides.

2000
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:19,620
They still have not put that into place.

2001
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:22,100
Yeah. So it's interesting because I don't wonder.

2002
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:26,260
I wonder if any of the galaxy's edge, like, quote unquote,

2003
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:29,980
disappointment in the summer for Disney was that they never

2004
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:32,460
they organized everything too well.

2005
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:37,380
If it was like they had just made it like a crazy, you know, Mad Max style line,

2006
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:42,140
like insane insanity, if he would be like, oh, my God, you wait for eight hours

2007
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:42,860
and then you get in the light.

2008
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:44,220
This has got to be the greatest thing.

2009
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:46,620
And it would have made it like more exciting to people.

2010
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:48,220
I don't know. I'm not exactly sure.

2011
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:50,780
Is it equally? Yeah. Are people upset by a giant line?

2012
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:52,380
Is there ever a 10 hour line?

2013
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:54,380
That's is that one of the biggest in the history?

2014
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:59,340
I mean, Indiana Jones, Indiana Jones, Indiana Jones, Star Tours.

2015
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:02,660
I mean, well, I knew as much as Indiana Jones.

2016
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:05,100
I think I may have waited in a three hour.

2017
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:10,020
I waited four hours for Gringotts, I think, opening summer three and a half, four hours.

2018
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:12,060
We waited really long for Guardians.

2019
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:15,580
We we we got in a line that said 90 minutes and I think we waited

2020
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:17,420
like three and a half hours.

2021
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:21,660
Yeah. Do you remember how soon after Indy opened or was it?

2022
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:24,340
I was there pretty soon. Yeah.

2023
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:26,060
Yeah, yeah.

2024
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:28,300
It gave me plenty of time to cry.

2025
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:31,820
Because once I saw a video of what it was going to do, I was like,

2026
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:33,540
I don't want to do it now.

2027
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:36,620
And my dad was like, we're not going to go backwards.

2028
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:38,700
And like, get the fuck out of here.

2029
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:40,300
Did you like it, though, still? Yeah. Yeah.

2030
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:43,620
Yeah. Yeah. I just saw that video, the video in the line where it's like

2031
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:47,620
shaking mildly, I was like, no, I was like screaming.

2032
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:50,980
My screams echoing across the temple.

2033
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:56,220
You mean you mean 90s night vision isn't like particularly appeal.

2034
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:59,900
Like that doesn't draw a child in the shaky like half lit.

2035
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:02,580
That's what scared me. Yeah. Yeah.

2036
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:06,220
I thought it looked like I was worried I was going to be in a cop's

2037
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:08,540
esc experience.

2038
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:10,620
You're going to be arrested.

2039
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:12,020
I'm just thinking about it now.

2040
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:16,660
Hagrid and Sala are very similar in their folksy friendly kind of like sidekick

2041
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:20,500
style, and they talk to you while they're on the ride and they kind of

2042
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:22,300
guide you through the journey.

2043
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:24,740
True. Yeah. It's like sputtery vehicles.

2044
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:28,980
And they they're you're kind of they talk to you while you're on it.

2045
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:33,460
And it's a little wonkier than maybe they expect even.

2046
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:34,460
But you get through.

2047
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:37,540
They kind of have. Yeah, they kind of have an apologetic like at one point

2048
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:40,260
in the ride, Hagrid does say it's hard to hear.

2049
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:44,900
He says, I never was very good at magic,

2050
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:47,740
which you never want to hear in a magic class.

2051
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:49,900
You never want to hear.

2052
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:51,660
Really hear that.

2053
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:56,420
There's also, of course, a great overlap and crossover

2054
01:28:56,420 --> 01:29:01,180
that this is a ride at Universal Studios where you are in line

2055
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:04,260
and they tell you and you're in a forest and they tell you you're going to get on

2056
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:09,220
some magic flying bikes and have an incredible and see incredible creatures.

2057
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,900
It really is a cousin to the adventure.

2058
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,260
That's good. I never thought it's a soup.

2059
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:14,940
It's a souped up adventure.

2060
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:17,180
It really is. They could soup up.

2061
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:20,180
If you know Harry Potter goes out of style, if J.K.

2062
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:24,060
Rowling keeps tweeting weird stuff.

2063
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:28,260
Yeah, she has not tweeted since her transphobic shit.

2064
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:29,700
Don't tweet, please.

2065
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,100
A few weeks ago.

2066
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:32,860
Let us think that you're OK.

2067
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:36,100
You know what I found out about her recently, because I haven't read those books.

2068
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:39,100
I do remember this character from the movies is not into that much.

2069
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:42,700
There is one Irish character in the book, like explicitly labeled.

2070
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,140
And his name is Seamus Finnegan.

2071
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:46,940
And he likes blow.

2072
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:49,180
He likes explosions.

2073
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:52,700
And the books are set in the time frame where the troubles in Northern

2074
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:54,500
Ireland would still be going on.

2075
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:57,140
And it's like, oh, come on, man. Really?

2076
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:59,060
Oh, that's interesting.

2077
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:00,540
I did not know anything about shame.

2078
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:03,220
It's finnicky. They may as well called him Patty O'Malley.

2079
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:06,100
And it's like you Irish, you like blowing stuff up.

2080
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:08,140
Like that is wonderful.

2081
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:11,940
Thank my heritage. Great. Well, well, I'm saying, yeah,

2082
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:14,380
I'm saying if Harry Potter likes just goes away, you can maybe just

2083
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:15,580
re theme this to T.

2084
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:19,340
Oh, just move all the robots are this being just like a mega

2085
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:22,820
mile long version of the T adventure. That's pretty good.

2086
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:26,140
And that show building is like that's the dying planet.

2087
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:27,500
And yeah.

2088
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:32,260
I mean, when they make when when all the principle, when everyone in T dies,

2089
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:34,180
who made it, E.T.

2090
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:36,100
to or the remake of E.T. will happen.

2091
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:37,740
And we got E.T. to this.

2092
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:39,100
Oh, yeah, you're right.

2093
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,540
We didn't even talk much about that.

2094
01:30:40,540 --> 01:30:43,420
People were tweeting that at me and us. Mm hmm.

2095
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:45,100
There was a lot of commercial.

2096
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:46,220
I woke up and there was so much stuff.

2097
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:47,740
I was like, did they do something with botanica?

2098
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:48,580
So you kidding me?

2099
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:51,740
And then I checked in like, oh, it's just regular E.T.

2100
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,940
Boo. It was a cast, right?

2101
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:55,460
Comcast. Yeah, yeah.

2102
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:59,620
I kept seeing the abbreviated one back east because both my parents have Comcast.

2103
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:03,020
E.T. comes back home and then you watch and then the guy like

2104
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:06,740
scrolls through an app and old show E.T.

2105
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:09,620
old episodes of The Blacklist.

2106
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:14,060
I don't understand why, like Spielberg is like no sequels to E.T.

2107
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:18,420
But if but yes, a 10 minute cynical commercial for

2108
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:20,820
fucking cable.

2109
01:31:20,820 --> 01:31:25,620
He's like, yeah, well, it's also seemingly OK with the Jurassic World franchise.

2110
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:28,260
Well, he never cared about that as much, though.

2111
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:31,660
He was there was always there were always he made Lost World and I mean,

2112
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:34,380
he made a yeah, he made a hero and then three.

2113
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:36,580
So I think he was never that precious about it.

2114
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:40,300
But that's I'm just wondering what the deal was with that, where it's like,

2115
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:43,900
oh, yeah, we'll make a 10 minute commercial, but I don't want to make a bad movie.

2116
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:45,220
I mean, he doesn't have to direct it.

2117
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:48,500
But but I'm saying I'd rather have a bad movie than that commercial.

2118
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:51,300
Sure. But with the Green Planet Botanicus.

2119
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:53,060
Yeah, that's the only way to do that.

2120
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:54,420
The only way to do it. Yeah.

2121
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:57,700
What I like about this ride, too, I was reading like they're saying that

2122
01:31:57,700 --> 01:32:02,020
this ride will only get like cooler and more immersive because, you know,

2123
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:04,500
the trees will grow out, which I think is pretty cool.

2124
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:10,380
Like in 10 years, like the forest will be like, you know, very whatever.

2125
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:12,420
What is the word? Full grown?

2126
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:14,700
Yeah. I mean, California adventure.

2127
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:17,820
You look at the trees and the, you know, by Grizzly River.

2128
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:20,540
All of those have grown quite a bit in 20 years. Yeah.

2129
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:25,020
And you know, there's not a lot of Universal Studios that you would call beautiful.

2130
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:27,980
That's not the word. A lot of it is exciting and thrilling and fun.

2131
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:29,820
You wouldn't call it like, wow, that is like.

2132
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:34,060
But all of the Harry Potter stuff has been so photographable. Yeah.

2133
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:35,700
What is it looking so?

2134
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:39,980
I think the greener, I mean, this and Pandora and the resistance

2135
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:46,180
forest in Galaxy's Edge, like the greenery, greenery and water features.

2136
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:49,580
Like I do have an extra like oomph for me,

2137
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:53,820
just because I think naturally humans like green space and like water. Yeah.

2138
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:57,260
And like some of the best parts of theme parks from the very beginning,

2139
01:32:57,260 --> 01:33:00,700
from the Jungle Cruise and for sure Disneyland in 1955.

2140
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,020
What's the most successful stuff?

2141
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:04,260
I think the Jungle Cruise and the Rivers of America.

2142
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:06,300
And yes, there's always a place for that.

2143
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,740
So it's a proud tradition.

2144
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:10,700
Yeah. Sorry. Oh, no, no, no, no.

2145
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,460
I was just going to say, I mean, just looking through,

2146
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:15,900
I know we we did not go walk through the queue, but the queue like has

2147
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:21,500
like much like, you know, Flight of Passage and Indiana Jones.

2148
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:23,620
And it's got a lot of different like parts to it,

2149
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:26,180
which are really cool and immersive.

2150
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:28,260
I don't know. We don't we don't need to talk so much about

2151
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:31,660
because I didn't walk through it, but I just want to highlight that as well.

2152
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:34,140
Sure. Yeah. A little bit of like and there's like these cool,

2153
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:36,580
like cozy little rock parts of it.

2154
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:40,500
And there's a little room right before you get on and you look up the ceiling.

2155
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:43,420
It looks like the motorcycles on top of the building.

2156
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:44,860
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2157
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:46,860
That's very cool. Video projection.

2158
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:52,460
I think, you know, they they truly Disney has

2159
01:33:52,940 --> 01:33:57,220
they had to do Galaxy's Edge and they had to do Pandora

2160
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:01,580
because if we're in a little arms race here, I think the addition of this thing

2161
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:07,740
now you add the the the the two campuses with the train in between

2162
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:11,700
Hogwarts Forbidden Journey, the train, both of those train stations,

2163
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:15,140
which I've seen in person, they're they're so cool, so immersive.

2164
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:17,940
That train attraction is great.

2165
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:20,620
Gringotts is amazing. Diagon Alley is amazing.

2166
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:25,980
I mean, the the full Harry Potter campus, I think you have to say is

2167
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:28,300
I'll say is better than Galaxy's Edge.

2168
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:31,540
And that's a little unfair because it's further along in it.

2169
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:34,900
Yeah. Yeah. And it is this multi park thing.

2170
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:40,020
But like, like, I feel like this ride, I don't think they had to do this ride.

2171
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:42,780
I think I know like the Harry Potter campus was

2172
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:45,060
both of those lands were incredible already.

2173
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:47,580
And you put this on top and it's like, I don't know.

2174
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:49,460
I don't think I think they're winning the war right now.

2175
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:54,420
Yeah, they definitely had to retire Dragon Challenge because that

2176
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:57,180
I wrote that in 2017 a month before they took it down.

2177
01:34:57,340 --> 01:35:00,140
It was feeling pretty rough hurting people. Yes.

2178
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:03,340
Yeah. And that was the one that was injuring your decapitations.

2179
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:04,380
And yeah, yeah.

2180
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:07,300
They I mean, we'll see a rise to the resistance, I think, is going to go

2181
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:12,820
a long way in satisfying things that people don't necessarily feel about

2182
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:16,700
Galaxy's Edge. But don't you feel like rise to the resistance?

2183
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:20,900
You add that. OK, now Galaxy's Edge equals

2184
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:25,660
original Harry Potter Hogwarts side. For sure.

2185
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:29,860
Like, I don't I think the fact that there's this entire double section,

2186
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:34,340
which I think maybe doesn't need that.

2187
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:38,460
Maybe maybe the hotel will make it like, oh, now it's like an undeniably.

2188
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:40,020
Yeah, I know so much there.

2189
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:44,020
I mean, it's this a whole other podcast, but it's it's a it is a difference

2190
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:50,540
between using an exact thing from the properties also,

2191
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:54,700
which I think goes a long way to for Harry Potter to be so successful.

2192
01:35:55,180 --> 01:35:58,860
But like I'm saying, like, it's actually Hogwarts and you've seen it from the movies.

2193
01:35:58,860 --> 01:35:59,820
You've seen it from the books.

2194
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:02,140
And now you're there as opposed to Galaxy's Edge, where there's elements

2195
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:04,500
where it's like the Millennium Falcon is there and you know that.

2196
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:09,100
And that's I think I would say arguably the probably what everyone likes.

2197
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:12,020
The best in the land is just seeing the Millennium Falcon.

2198
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:15,460
Yeah. The thing, you know, the thing, you know, you know, in it now,

2199
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:19,100
I think you do have to give them credit because like, where would they put it?

2200
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:21,740
Like, where is the where's the Falcon been parked?

2201
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:24,780
That's grander than those spires.

2202
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:28,780
Yeah, that cove that they built like, like, while you're right,

2203
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:30,540
that it's the fact that it's the thing that we know,

2204
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:33,940
and that's what we love to take pictures of it like it's not the same.

2205
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:38,380
Like Tatooine is like sad, you know, yeah, like desolate.

2206
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:40,780
And you don't want to be there. Right.

2207
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:44,620
So, yeah, I I mean, we've had this discussion before.

2208
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:49,900
I do think that it's a mix of like it's not what we haven't seen this before.

2209
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:51,980
It's not beautiful.

2210
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:56,780
Like like there's something obviously with with Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley

2211
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:58,500
is a little more like perverse.

2212
01:36:58,500 --> 01:36:59,900
And I mean that in a good way.

2213
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:01,820
But like Hogsmeade is so charming.

2214
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:06,500
It's a little town and like just like the visuals of it are so appealing

2215
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:09,700
versus just Galaxy's Edge when you're like in the first order area

2216
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:13,460
with the ship, with the Kylo Ren ship from the Colin Trevorrow

2217
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:17,100
script ship, which I'm talking about is that that ship

2218
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:20,300
that Kylo Ren comes off of was from the Colin Trevorrow version

2219
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:23,540
of Episode nine that didn't get made because early on in the process,

2220
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:26,420
they said, well, do you have a ship that and he goes, oh, I have this Kylo Ren ship.

2221
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:29,940
Does it look much different than the ship he is in in Force Awakens? No.

2222
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:34,020
Looks like a TIE fighter shuttle cross, like what they've been combining

2223
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:36,340
the same five designs for years. Right.

2224
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:39,500
But if you like, if you go like over that area, you go, oh, OK.

2225
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:43,820
All right. There's some like, you know, fascist banners

2226
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:45,900
and there's a big ship and the ship is cool.

2227
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:49,420
But like, yeah, you don't get you don't get a feeling like you get

2228
01:37:49,420 --> 01:37:52,780
going into Hogsmeade, which I do think you would get either way.

2229
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:55,860
You would get that feeling whether you knew Harry Potter or not.

2230
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:59,820
You'd go to like a quaint little town with a cool castle in the distance.

2231
01:37:59,860 --> 01:38:04,500
Sure, sure. So I'll give it up to especially let's let's take it to night.

2232
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:08,460
Let's add fireworks into the mix when fireworks are going off around the spires.

2233
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:09,700
Oh, yeah. There.

2234
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:12,460
Yeah, I think it's unfair to say it's not beautiful.

2235
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:14,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There is that area.

2236
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:18,100
So it nature to a couple parts of Galaxy's Edge.

2237
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:20,180
But we don't want to say there isn't anything.

2238
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:21,780
No, I'm not trying to.

2239
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:24,700
I'm not trying to put down Galaxy's Edge as a failure or anything.

2240
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:27,660
We'll talk. Let's we'll talk more about this on the rise episode.

2241
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:30,540
Sure. To see how we try to do as soon as we can.

2242
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:33,500
Now, Reiser's has to throw this argument because it's open in Florida

2243
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:34,260
and we haven't got to do it.

2244
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:37,300
Maybe that's the best right in Orlando now. Yeah, right.

2245
01:38:37,300 --> 01:38:41,620
But do we think it's this is it is it is it currently Hogwarts taking rise?

2246
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:44,220
I think it's definitely the most technologically advanced.

2247
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:48,860
And I think it's a good preview for the direction Universal is going in,

2248
01:38:48,860 --> 01:38:52,460
because like Secret Life of Pets say what you will about that second

2249
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:54,260
movie not doing very well.

2250
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:57,820
That ride has pets animatronics on it.

2251
01:38:58,180 --> 01:38:59,940
Sure. They're on. They're talking about that.

2252
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:02,300
They're building a city street facade.

2253
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:03,660
They're going there.

2254
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:07,940
They have heard it seems like they have heard some of the criticism of like

2255
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:09,300
too many screens. Yeah.

2256
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:10,860
Yeah. Need some robots.

2257
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:14,580
And I've seen it's like, yep, here's people posing with the robots.

2258
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:15,980
Here's universal people.

2259
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:17,820
Yeah, that's good. That's yeah. Yeah, you're right.

2260
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:18,780
That's a start.

2261
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:20,660
Physical stuff, because you can take pictures of it.

2262
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:21,940
Yeah. Screens.

2263
01:39:21,940 --> 01:39:24,380
I don't know. I still really like Spider-Man.

2264
01:39:24,820 --> 01:39:26,260
I was thinking it could be.

2265
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:27,540
Maybe it's Spider-Man still.

2266
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:29,060
Spider-Man still up there.

2267
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:32,820
That also technologically innovative, like new grant.

2268
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:34,140
So like, yeah.

2269
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:36,460
So this is my this is in my top five.

2270
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:39,100
I really have to sit down and think about what the order is.

2271
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:43,780
Sure. But it's it's really great and really both.

2272
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:45,980
Like you got a lot of cool stuff to look at.

2273
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:47,780
You get a cool vibe from it.

2274
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:50,500
And the ride system is super, super fun.

2275
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:54,660
Yeah. Anything in Walt Disney World better than Hagrid's motorbike?

2276
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:59,860
I don't know. I really like I really like Everest as far as thrilling.

2277
01:39:59,860 --> 01:40:01,740
I really like Everest.

2278
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:06,780
This does rank this higher because of more and it might be that higher.

2279
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:09,380
But I do like, yeah, that's it.

2280
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:12,620
That's such a tough question, because Everest itself is so impressive.

2281
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:17,540
The Tower of Terror was the thing, I think, like kind of fell in that all over.

2282
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:19,580
It could be that last time there.

2283
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:20,780
I'll say this, too.

2284
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:25,460
Hagrid's when I checked like Friday afternoon, down to 90 minutes.

2285
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:27,220
So they're getting there.

2286
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:28,100
That's good.

2287
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:29,500
I ran in the corner.

2288
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:33,740
But truly, if you want real insurance about getting on a startup podcast,

2289
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:35,260
do it for a couple of years.

2290
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:38,180
See how that audience grows and then maybe someone will help you.

2291
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:41,500
And then Hagrid will reach his hand out and cast a spell.

2292
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:43,900
Boys. A line cutting spell.

2293
01:40:44,860 --> 01:40:46,860
And I've got a secret for you as well.

2294
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:48,860
Pickles. McGruff's name is Scruff.

2295
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:53,620
The nephew is named after Maine McGruff.

2296
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:54,740
You were right all along.

2297
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:56,380
He's Scruff Jr.

2298
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:59,140
That's his name. His nephew is Scruff Jr.

2299
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:01,220
Well, does that do it?

2300
01:41:01,220 --> 01:41:04,940
Did we survive the first podcast the ride of 2020?

2301
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:07,060
Big stuff coming up.

2302
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:08,300

2309
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:33,540
I think by now we've put up a pretty fun episode about the Disney

2310
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:35,340
World Millennium Celebration.

2311
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:38,020
Yes. The bullshit they were doing around ninety nine, two thousand.

2312
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:39,500
That's a fun episode.

2313
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:41,500
We're going to talk a medjaneering story.

2314
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:47,660
And of and of course, soon enough, a bunch of stuff about Marlon Brando, I guess.

2315
01:41:48,380 --> 01:41:50,500
Was the other thing we said long ago.

2316
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:52,420
It was a real idea.

2317
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:54,620
What are you to them, this episode or before? Yeah.

2318
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:57,420
Yeah. Well, we talk about McGruff too, obviously.

2319
01:41:57,420 --> 01:41:58,900
Oh, McGruff too. Yeah, that's it. Yeah.

2320
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:00,340
Yes. Yeah. McGruff too.

2321
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:02,660
Probably on Patreon, unless it's just too big.

2322
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:04,100
Yeah, we'll see.

2323
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:05,300
To be contained.

2324
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:06,820
I know we got to lure people.

2325
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:09,220
I mean, yeah, that's true. I forgot about the other

2326
01:42:10,180 --> 01:42:14,020
developments in that there's been two or three different developments in that.

2327
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:16,900
So multiple McGruff multiple McGruff.

2328
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:19,540
What a way to start 2020 iteration.

2329
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:20,740
So we'll see.

2330
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:24,100
And none of none of what we're getting has been attained illegally.

2331
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:26,620
None of it is bootlegs. Right.

2332
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:31,500
Don't buy counterfeit cassettes or write a fair sale.

2333
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:33,820
That's the legal. Right.

2334
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:37,940
Yeah, I think the FBI warning is important.

2335
01:42:38,980 --> 01:42:42,380
Don't skip past the FBI warning on any videotape.

2336
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:47,220
If you fast forward through it, you're as bad as the worst murderer in jail.

2337
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:50,940
And make sure to stand and salute the FBI warning on all analogs.

2338
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:56,780
And watch the national anthem as you watch and read all of the copy

2339
01:42:56,780 --> 01:43:00,460
and make sure to watch Jack Ryan on Amazon video.

2340
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:04,500
Thank you, Jack Ryan. Thank you, J. Edgar Hoover.

2341
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:09,340
Thank you, John Krasinski for your portrayal of Jack Ryan.

2342
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:11,100
True patriot.

2343
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:13,060
Uh, hey, thanks for listening, folks.

2344
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:15,020
We'll talk to you next week. Happy New Year.
