1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,380
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,880
Welcome back.

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,840
When we last left Mike, Scott and Jason, they were getting ready to talk about Barry and Richard,

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,500
who were trying to avoid our security guards, Brad and Colin.

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,300
But might they run into General Hospital's John Engel?

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,880
Let's check in with the boys now.

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,280
That's an intro that will make no sense to anyone here on Podcast Thread, the Second Gate,

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:51,140
unless you've already viewed today's topic, which is available to view on YouTube, several copies.

9
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:59,200
I believe the creatively titled Disney's California Adventure TV special.

10
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,580
Or opening special, one of those.

11
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,540
That's what IMDB said.

12
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,860
They really swung for the fences with that one.

13
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,920
Official intros, Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan.

14
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,820
I'm here, yes.

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,320
John Hingle.

16
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,040
You will finally hear the name.

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,920
You've waited for it.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,420
Engel.

19
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,740
Just taking an H off of that.

20
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,400
I believe it.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,100
John Engel.

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,140
John Engel.

23
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,800
I think.

24
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,340
I mean, here, do you want to just, we can say some further context,

25
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,000
but I do have polls, just the full intro to this special,

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,000
which if you don't know is the special that accompanied the opening of Disney's California Adventure

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,980
in February 2001, right around 23 years ago, around this time that you're hearing it.

28
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,460
Happy 23.

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,720
And boy, were things different back 23 years ago in a number of ways.

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,640
We'll get into that.

31
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,680
But let's mainly to clarify Engel or Hingle, let's hear this opening.

32
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,800
Welcome to our very special look inside Disney's newest theme park,

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,740
Disney's California Adventure, right next to Disneyland in California.

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,860
Joining us tonight are spin cities, Barry Bostwick and Richard Kind.

35
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,560
From Whose Line Is It Anyway?

36
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,620
Colin Mochrie and Brad Sherwood.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,840
From The Emperor's New Groove, Patrick Warburton.

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:24,540
From General Hospital and Port Charles, Jackie Zeman, Nancy Lee Grant, John Engel, Aaron Hershey and Kiko Ellsworth.

39
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,600
And a special appearance by the director of the Toy Story films and A Bug's Life, John Lasseter.

40
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,780
And now, Disney's California Adventure.

41
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,980
He's the and.

42
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,880
Yeah, he's the and.

43
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,120
He's the scene stealer.

44
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,600
And he is, let's be clear.

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,440
That's true, yeah.

46
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,240
He certainly does.

47
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,760
It's a very, to quote what they say in this,

48
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,520
you know, it's a very animated scene.

49
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,280
I think they say that two or three times.

50
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,780
They use that phrase a lot.

51
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,360
Yeah.

52
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,140
Well, you are a very animated guy.

53
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:52,920
John Engel.

54
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,780
I'm so sorry.

55
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,100
John Engel.

56
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:04,080
If I could go back even a step before that, because I watched the upload copy with like the 22nd CG,

57
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,320
like Disney, generic Disney pre-roll from the time of the credits,

58
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,820
which I had to watch a couple of times before I realized what I was looking at.

59
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:19,140
And it's like a CG circus tent that you the camera zooms into.

60
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,080
And then it's just filled with like video clips playing all around you.

61
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,580
OK.

62
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,160
And it's like a big as if it was on a big CG metal tower.

63
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,780
How's that CG looking?

64
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:36,300
Well, it looked fine when you were watching the video clips, the circus tent.

65
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,400
That's why I had to rewatch it.

66
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,120
I'm like, what is that?

67
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,520
What is that building?

68
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,440
And then it dawned on me.

70
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:43,980
Yeah.

71
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:50,440
I liked it because it was very like Regal Cinema's AMC movie strip man.

72
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:50,980
Right.

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,660
Oh, yeah.

74
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:51,900
Yeah.

75
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:52,300
Yeah.

76
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,380
That's a nice area.

77
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:01,560
That's that's all that's early, not early CGI, I guess, but that's that's early 2000s stuff that is not reprehensible to me.

78
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,200
There's some charm to it.

79
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:11,820
You can tell people spend hours and money like for that 20 seconds of CG and video montage.

80
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,240
Sure.

81
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:12,460
Sure.

82
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,880
That was the equivalent of making Avatar Way of Water.

83
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,400
Basically.

84
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,800
The time took just as long and just as much money.

85
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,480
Another year.

86
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,020
Sorry.

87
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,540
You have to hold back the opening of the park.

88
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,140
Yeah.

89
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,660
Yeah.

90
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,060
This I I actually did not see that.

91
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,880
I'm interested to see that, too, because I feel like that would have given me more of the feeling of watching.

92
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,520
You know, a special at this time of gather round America.

93
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,020
Yes.

94
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:43,920
There is a brand new theme park to open right next to Disneyland, something that will only be said seven or eight times throughout the special next to it.

95
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,640
Seven or eight times.

96
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,800
I couldn't find the air date, but I believe this aired in January.

97
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,980
DCA opens in February.

98
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,960
Does that sound right?

99
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,780
Yeah, I was looking for this, too.

100
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:05,320
And I could not find it for the life of me, mainly for some specific information, which was I was like, did this air on ABC or not?

101
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,640
Was this a wonderful world of Disney?

102
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:07,780
Right.

103
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:07,960
Right.

104
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,040
Right.

105
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,080
Because there there is no Eisner intro.

106
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,640
Eisner is in it, but you do not get a hello.

107
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,780
You do not get this circus tent intro that you saw Jason recognize.

108
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,980
I think that this may be a Disney Channel original.

109
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,800
I think that might be the only venue.

110
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,720
I don't think this was on on network television.

111
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,320
They wouldn't do the full court press.

112
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,580
This is a big deal.

113
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,360
You think.

114
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,120
But I don't know.

115
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,380
It's so short.

116
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,440
You may know.

117
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,540
I think I think Wonderful World of Disney.

118
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,220
You got to fill two hours.

119
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:36,700
Yeah.

120
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,840
Unless it was paired with something else.

121
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,540
I just couldn't find the proof.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,740
I went to some website and skimmed through all the listings every Sunday for the first half of the year.

123
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,540
Guide listings.

124
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,120
Yeah.

125
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,700
Some site tracked it, you know, when what?

126
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,560
Which private practice aired?

127
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,420
You know, a rerun of private practice was only viewed by 17 million people.

128
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,640
Those those kind of stats.

129
00:05:59,420 --> 00:05:59,420
Yeah.

130
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,040
A lot of millionaire back then.

131
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,920
That's what you find.

132
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:09,080
Kind of the intro I saw did have a very like early 2000s Disney Channel aesthetic.

133
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:15,120
But then that's even weirder how many daytime soap actors are in this.

134
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,720
Sure.

135
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,980
I mean, there's everything about that is weird that they that the restaurant is there,

136
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:29,260
that they are leaning on the star quality of Can I Quickly Pull One That Is Not John Engel,

137
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,020
that, you know, Kiko Ellsworth.

138
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,100
We got you got Aaron Hershey.

139
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,360
I like soaps are I mean, they're an alternate universe.

140
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,380
That's like it's kind of the way actually,

141
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,860
I think like CBS primetime is now where you're like, who's that?

142
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,540
Never heard of them.

143
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,580
Well, they have been on 130 episodes of a show that people actually watch.

144
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,580
OK, well, never heard of the Hawaii Five.

145
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,560
Oh, the Hawaii Five.

146
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,160
Oh, remake.

147
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,860
There are children who are like entering middle school and they were never in a world without this.

148
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,580
Yes, they were born when Hawaii Five.

149
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,880
Oh, remake started and then they had a whole childhood.

150
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,780
And now adolescence is coming as Hawaii Five or Magnum P.

151
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:09,980
I.

152
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,060
remake is wrapping up.

153
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,660
Generational wealth has been accumulated by people that work on Hawaii Five remake.

154
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:18,880
Absolutely.

155
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,600
So much money has been made.

156
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,300
And every two years I go, well, that's still on.

157
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,160
Uh huh.

158
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:24,800
Yes.

159
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,780
Every two years.

160
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:32,880
Even though even though they like every two weeks make like more than we could dream of.

161
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,040
For months and months.

162
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,440
Taylor Willie and Scott Kahn.

163
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,840
Scott Kahn and Taylor Willie are like oil tycoons.

164
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,720
They're like, oh, they have that much money.

165
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,580
They have old school generational wealth.

166
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,500
You know, this came up with me and Jay the other day because we were talking about the Emmys.

167
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,460
And I think she watched some of it.

168
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,500
I didn't really see.

169
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,260
I just saw clips and she was like, oh, they had a bunch of cast reunions like Grey's Anatomy.

170
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,200
And I'm like, well, that's not really reunion.

171
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,980
Grey's Anatomy is still on the air.

172
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,080
And he did need like a lane like what?

173
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,860
Like she's like, no, that's not true.

174
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,140
And I'm like, no, it's still on the air.

175
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,800
Like, yeah, I know I kind of that occurred to me while watching that.

176
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,380
They almost presented that within the piece like.

177
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,460
And of course, we're still at it.

178
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,480
You are.

179
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,560
Are you sure?

180
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,960
And this is this is errors.

181
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,280
This is televised.

182
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,060
Yeah.

183
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,700
Similarly, you know, there was just OK.

184
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,320
Wait, my my lack of soap knowledge.

185
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:43,820
I think OK, I think what John Engel is is I think he's one of the quarter mains, which is the family Edward quarter main.

186
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:50,320
And that is the family that like that's the dynasty that has dominated all of all my children.

187
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
Yeah, I think.

188
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,220
And I I was watching like hotel TV.

189
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,120
It's the only reason you were in it.

190
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,340
There was a prime recently.

191
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:06,000
There was a primetime All My Children anniversary special where they kept having like a door would open and then four people would be there who were not even ID.

192
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:12,480
This is how much it's like you, the audience knows they don't say their own names is not a blower third says their names.

193
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,300
Here I am.

194
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:19,840
And some of them are like big wind ups with like a massive push in and then up to a person I've never seen before in my life.

195
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,080
And not only that, they're so sure that, you know, the quarter mains that they're like, it's crazy being a cue.

196
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,560
They're that familiar with it.

197
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,700
I loved the special.

198
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,520
I'm like, they still make stuff like this.

199
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,280
Just like specials about something I don't know one droplet about.

200
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,500
That was my mom's show.

201
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,460
That was All My Children.

202
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,600
Oh, yeah.

203
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:38,780
Yeah, yeah.

204
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,760
Jason, what kind of house were you?

205
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,180
I think it was All My Children.

206
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,580
I got really into it one summer.

207
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,300
Oh, really?

208
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,420
Because Mother, do you have the cues are at it again?

209
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:56,140
Yeah, because I just like serialized and it's very, you know, it's soapy, you know, it's very pulpy.

210
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,720
Who were your people on there?

211
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,380
Who were your favorites?

212
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,720
I have no recollection.

213
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,760
You can't name a character?

214
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,360
Erica Cain?

215
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,140
I couldn't name the quarter mains, but I know a few.

216
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:14,100
Well, I so I went down to rabbit hole reading about it a little because I was like, is Erin Hershey a Pennsylvania Hershey?

217
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,180
She is not.

218
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:26,880
Oh, but she she married her castmate, Brad Presley, and his Wikipedia has a very funny line of like he was born the week Elvis Presley died.

219
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,920
They are unrelated.

220
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,560
Like, okay, really odd.

221
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,200
Like, it's that meme.

222
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:39,780
It's that meme that's online now where they say like so and so died in this month in this year and then so and so was born.

223
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,840
Welcome back.

224
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,920
Do you know what I'm talking about?

225
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,740
I'm telling you about a thing online.

226
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,440
Mr.

227
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:45,900
Meme.

228
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,860
You know what I'm talking about?

229
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,980
I think I've seen one of those.

230
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,580
It'll say like, oh, say Elvis Presley died whatever day and year and then it'll say so and so was born on the next day or the same day.

231
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,000
I forget.

232
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,140
And then it'll say welcome back Elvis Presley.

233
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,260
And it's a joke and you can do it with many different things.

234
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:01,540
Exactly.

235
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:01,920
Right.

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,200
Yeah.

237
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,420
Yeah.

238
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,540
That's a thing that youth culture is participating in.

239
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:25,500
You know, I've seen a lot of like the theme park one I keep seeing is like when 50s Primetime Cafe opened, if you went back this many years, we are now at the point where if you went back that many years, you would hit step by step and family matters sort of thing.

240
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,100
Sure.

241
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:26,860
Okay.

242
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,220
But that's not an easy to digest meme or anything.

243
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,460
That's not like a cool young person meme like Mike has been.

244
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,420
I just brought up is something you would know.

245
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,780
It's more like time is enough time has passed.

246
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:45,000
You had a big opportunity to be cooler and younger than Mike and you failed as we all do at the altar of Mike's school.

247
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,400
Well, he's the coolest of any of us.

248
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,020
That's not true.

249
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:55,060
He usually is the youthful knowledge about TikToks and skippity toilet or whatever the hell that character was he brought up on the Barbie episode.

250
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:02,940
I was complaining about a thing because you know everyone if people make TikToks then it becomes a YouTube short and Instagram reel.

251
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,780
This thing where like the end of the short video is also how the video starts.

252
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,200
And I was like, Jane, do you know about it?

253
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,260
She's like, yeah, of course.

254
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,240
It's a trick.

255
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:23,960
So that way you don't realize it gets the video's artificial views counts gets the view counts up because people don't realize the video is just restarted.

256
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,800
But it's really unnerving.

257
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,320
I have noticed this.

258
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,220
I hate it.

259
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,460
You're talking about that videos just start over from the beginning?

260
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,000
No, like the end shot is the same as the beginning.

261
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,860
So you don't realize you don't even realize the loop has happened.

262
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,420
So I mean, it's kind of a clever editing trick, but it's like, I don't know.

263
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,680
We should try that with this podcast.

264
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,340
Huh?

265
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,840
We should try that with the podcast.

266
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,880
We should end with hello.

267
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,580
We have to end with hello and then trick everybody into listening twice.

268
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,420
Oh, sure.

269
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,160
Or the theme song.

270
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,080
Maybe you have to put.

271
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,380
We'll look.

272
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:58,880
We'll experiment.

273
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,380
We'll figure it out.

274
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,220
It'll be seamless.

275
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,240
You'll hear they won't.

276
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,260
They won't even know.

277
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,540
Yeah.

278
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,080
But so all right, this is this is the opening special that they made to

279
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,020
promote new California adventure.

280
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,480
Unclear.

281
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:26,980
I've seen that aired in April and Disney Channel, which if that's the case, it wasn't even on to their like maybe a term when they finished it, they did some test screening and they're like, you know, no rush on this is fine.

282
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,940
Whenever you get to it, whenever you got to.

283
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:37,720
If you've got a block where you're not already committed to a Lizzie, even Stevens split up, drop it wherever you may have aired it to in the morning.

284
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,160
Whatever.

285
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,400
Yeah, I guess.

286
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,040
Yeah.

287
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,960
When I'm thinking of the Disneyland opening day special and the other specials, it does feel like maybe the star power was a little higher.

288
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:57,160
Not that I dislike these stars and maybe that's wrong, but it does feel maybe like everything about, of course, California venture opening was like, this isn't quite as good.

289
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,620
Well, you've got four stars of prime time, maybe three shows fronting.

290
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,640
That's true, but we're not talking the top stars.

291
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,300
Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's very Bostwick really.

292
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:16,020
I mean, it's very fun to imagine a Disney Channel special being like, you know, Richard Conbert, Bostwick, Colin Mochrie, Brad Sherwood, your favorite kids.

293
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,460
There are no former presidents involved in this opening day special.

294
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,180
There are no, it's missing some star power.

295
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:31,460
I mean, we're not far from Disneyland 35th, which we did an episode about where they keep, they love the list so much they say it over and over again.

296
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,520
It's Tony Danza, former president Ronald Reagan and Ernest and the Muppets.

297
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41,740
Yeah, that's more, again, I'm not putting down the very talented people on this show.

298
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,060
Sure.

299
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:49,580
But I'm just saying everything about it does maybe add up to what you're saying is that this may have been quietly played on Disney Channel.

300
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:58,280
Well, that special I'm describing and many of the great specials that I love of kind of early Eisner, I feel like it's very Disney decade.

301
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,560
It's the optimism.

302
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,180
We've got money to spare forever.

303
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,080
Euro Disney is going to take us to the stratosphere.

304
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,300
So let's give every star whatever.

305
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:16,700
There's a special we never even talked about that where the story is Michael Eisner trying to going from trailer to trailer, trying to find a host for a special that he's doing.

306
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,160
And everyone in it is it's like so stacked.

307
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,700
It's whoopie and bet and Robin Williams.

308
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,860
And I think that's maybe the one with Baby Sinclair.

309
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,540
I'm not sure.

310
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,020
Right.

311
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,380
And I don't even know what it's for.

312
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,800
And it's so like they just kind of mill about and know what's a bit.

313
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,460
No, I don't think I can do it.

314
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:33,800
All right.

315
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,300
Well, bye.

316
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,900
And then this one, they are like trying to really sit.

317
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,380
No, Barry Bostwick.

318
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,140
You know, we got Barry.

319
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,080
He's going to be here for the whole hour.

320
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,800
A lot of worry about worry.

321
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:49,380
The young actors of Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place did not return our calls.

322
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,160
They didn't need to.

323
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,560
Too hot careers.

324
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,840
Too hot at the time.

325
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,140
That's how Lasseter gets highest bill, like the biggest splashiest part of the introduction.

326
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,140
And why he gets a full like a scene.

327
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,800
He does like a sketch.

328
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,040
He's the reason we get his.

329
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,460
Really?

330
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,840
That takes you back to that.

331
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:18,900
When they decided like this guy's got the chops, he's going to be he's going to make the rare move, the Eisner move of behind the scenes person into being on camera.

332
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,480
Really, I guess closer analogous Spielberg.

333
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,100
Yeah.

334
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:27,420
Where now we got a lot of things where Spielberg's hamming it up and they saw Lasseter and like, look, he's got his fun energy.

335
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,780
He's got the stories of his toys and his shirts.

336
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,860
And he's got it would be very interesting.

337
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,980
I wonder what the Disney company looks like.

338
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,380
This is not for a different podcast.

339
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,840
What does it look like if he didn't drink too much and love hugs?

340
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,840
Like, what would he just still be running Pixar or would he be like, he's the CEO.

341
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,780
Isn't he?

342
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,780
Oh, that's my question.

343
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,800
With all this struggle there.

344
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,920
I think unless he doesn't want to do that, he wants to be hands on.

345
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,820
Here's a scene.

346
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,600
Edit, edit.

347
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,060
You know what I'll do?

348
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,560
I'll use technology to make your voice less enthusiastic.

349
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,640
That's what I'll do.

350
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,720
John Lasseter wants to be hands on.

351
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,620
Oh crap.

352
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:03,980
Wait.

353
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,300
OK.

354
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,180
Now just edit that.

355
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,040
Make me sound sad.

356
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:13,300
The cynical part of my thinking says that he's especially gone because Eiger was thinking

357
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:13,740
that.

358
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,160
Oh, because Eiger is a little Machiavellian kind of guy.

359
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,740
Sure.

360
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,120
So an opportunity arose to get rid of John.

361
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,440
He should have gone anyway.

362
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,240
I'm just saying.

363
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,480
I wonder if that is my that maybe would be what happens.

364
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,140
We're like, let's put a creative person fully in charge.

365
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,960
And that is a certain.

366
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,820
I don't know.

367
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,440
You think he at some point as he handed a manila envelope with far away spy photos of

368
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,420
Lasseter giving hugs and he's like, I'll file these away.

369
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,320
I believe this is what I need.

370
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,340
Oh, yeah.

371
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,720
With his old minder, his god, fuck, I forget her name.

372
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,380
She was one of my best person.

373
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,760
Yeah.

374
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,700
No, no, that was the CFO.

375
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,240
OK.

376
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:03,720
But Eiger, I think his like media relations person like also worked for like one of the

377
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,640
New York governors, one of the various creep New York governors.

378
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,900
Take your pick.

379
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,060
Zinia Mooka.

380
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,020
Her name is Zinia Mooka.

381
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,820
Yeah, we talked about her either.

382
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,720
But I do think I certainly think Eiger has is like Professor X files on everybody that

383
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,600
works in the company with all their weaknesses and all the dirt and that, yes, he could get

384
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,740
rid of them if he wants.

385
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,440
He's he's he's he's a very boring man, but he's very, very calculated.

386
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:40,220
Zinia Mooka is now the chief brand officer and communication or chief brand communications

387
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,200
officer at Tick Tock.

388
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, she's all about the looping video.

389
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,400
Zinia Mooka, Zinia Loop Looper.

390
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,160
I've never seen this woman.

391
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:58,760
Wow.

392
00:18:59,360 --> 00:18:59,660
Huh.

393
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,220
All right.

394
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,000
Now we know Zinia.

395
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,280
Yeah.

396
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,240
I believe she she showed up in the show in the Disney war book.

397
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,440
Influential senior policy adviser to governor of New York, George Pataki.

398
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,780
Pataki is pretty clean, I feel like.

399
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,200
You never hear about George Pataki.

400
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,960
You don't put him on your creep list?

401
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,260
Well, compared to who was the guy whose brother worked at CNN.

402
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,560
I'm cutting off any more grasping for names.

403
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,240
We got to talk about this special at some point in time.

404
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,540
If you come up with it, feel free.

405
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:36,640
Cuomo.

406
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,360
Oh, you meant him.

407
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:38,900
Oh, yeah.

408
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,600
And then there was the toe sucker.

409
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,960
Who was the toe sucker?

410
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,400
Was that Anthony Weiner?

411
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,540
No, no.

412
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,080
The other guy who resigned in disgrace, the bald guy.

413
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,860
The toe sucker?

414
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,940
The toe sucker.

415
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,040
Who was sucking on toes?

416
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,940
The toes belonged to a Democratic operative who worked on the Buddha judge campaign.

417
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:56,980
This is too much.

418
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,360
The toes belonged.

419
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:58,940
Who's the…

420
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,060
You know, the one who says Buddha judge.

421
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,940
Just give it a little Buddha judge.

422
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,400
Sorry, a boot age age.

423
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,300
I forgot that.

424
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,940
That is the Kirtak pronunciation.

425
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,540
Certain Buddha judge.

426
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,780
Well, we'll find out who the toes belonged to.

427
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:16,660
We'll find out the name of the person the toes belonged to, and then we'll talk about it after we talk about this special.

428
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,540
Who's the toe owner?

429
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,680
It's just interesting that the course, the different timelines that could possibly have happened.

430
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,720
If Johnny was less of a creep or not a creep at all.

431
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,100
Or based on his performance in this special, Barry Bostowick was given the keys to the company.

432
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,980
Or give Bostowick the CEO job, and Bostowick would have taken over.

433
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:39,960
He handled a scene with the CEO, aka the big cheese with incredible grace and poise.

434
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,620
I believe that's correct, yes.

435
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,900
So, alright.

436
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,580
Premise of special.

437
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,580
Well, actually before premise.

438
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:57,900
I mean, it's antics with Barry Bostowick and Richard Kind that take them all around the park as they're on the run from these security guards from Who's Line.

439
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,000
This is all directed by Jerry Rees, a name that you see a lot.

440
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,360
I mean, it's like 20 things were directed by this guy.

441
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,060
Back to Neverland, the thing with Walter Cronkite and Robin Williams.

442
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,780
That's something we should talk about at some point.

443
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,760
All the pre-tapes of Alien Encounter.

444
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:17,960
Michael and Mickey.

445
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,580
How have we never done Michael and Mickey?

446
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,880
That little intro piece where they round up all the characters.

447
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:31,000
And one of the most nicely rendered Mickey Mouse's I've ever seen.

448
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,820
Interacting with Michael Eisner.

449
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,920
And then the rock and roller coaster pre-tapes.

450
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,920
This is the guy who called action on the Stephen Tyler Shocker.

451
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,820
On the Shocker.

452
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,180
Dinosaur.

453
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,320
He did the pre-tape for Dinosaur.

454
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,520
The Wallace Langham videos.

455
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,540
Did he do the Soren pre-tape?

456
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,300
Don't know.

457
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:51,960
Maybe not.

458
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,780
Sounds dangerous though.

459
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,520
Wow.

460
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,100
He just captured the Warburton performance in this.

461
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,520
I guess, spoiler alert, from the show.

462
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,180
But the Warburton performance of the character he plays in the pre-show is spot on.

463
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,220
It feels really the same day.

464
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,840
He was locked in.

465
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,720
A character radically different than the usual Petrified.

466
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
So different.

467
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,520
He had a method.

468
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,800
He got into that character.

469
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,440
This is a maestro situation.

470
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,940
Heath Ledger, Joker style living in a plane.

471
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,700
I'm sorry, I forget.

472
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,300
Did you say Jerry Reeves most famous directing credit?

473
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,060
No, maybe not.

474
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,000
Brave Little Toaster?

475
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,160
Wow.

476
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,380
Big one.

477
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,120
Yeah.

478
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,220
No, incredible.

479
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,560
I think it's supposed to be from Cream Command 2.

480
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,620
But, you know, the name I've registered as the guy who directed tons of live action stuff.

481
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,140
This is kind of later than a lot of that.

482
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:48,000
And according to his website, Jerry Reeves was called four days before the shooting of the special.

483
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,340
I believe that.

484
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:49,860
Yes.

485
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:58,540
Can you imagine that the tight plotting, intricate blocking, had to be scrambled together?

486
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,260
Also name checks that opening.

487
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,240
And this is a thing that I like about this a lot.

488
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,860
The opening and the narration throughout is by Corey Burton, voice of A Zillion Things.

489
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,360
But that's clearly the voice of the parking lot tram.

490
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,560
He's clearly doing the exact same mode.

491
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,620
And when you hear that, I mean, that's not a California Adventure thing.

492
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,560
That's a like, you know, whatever.

493
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,640
That's that's a 2001 resorts refresh thing.

494
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,820
And then you got more Burton as the same the chief flight attendant.

495
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:39,860
This really the special, I'd say the main value of it is that it is like a piece of media that expands the DCA averse.

496
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,780
Yeah, 1.

497
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,280
0.

498
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,520
Yes, specifically.

499
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah, if you want more with the vibe of DCA 1.

500
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,820
0, you get it here.

501
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:52,660
And it really does give you the vibe of I wasn't there opening year, but I was there a couple of years later.

502
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,420
And it really feels like a little bit of a time machine.

503
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,940
Yes, colors in the graphics, the music it can.

504
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,140
And it conveys that there's not a ton like yes, there's a we're stretching.

505
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,620
There's a lot of stretch.

506
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,980
Yeah, a lot of stretch of a park.

507
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:18,460
I feel like there's a good amount of time where they are using a photo or video of the compass.

508
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,860
It used to be in the Esplanade in in the ground.

509
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,820
Yeah, I think that they've gotten rid of it at this point.

510
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,460
I think that's pretty inoffensive.

511
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:30,760
The compass.

512
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,700
Yeah, the compass.

513
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:37,640
I don't think you're right, but I don't like it as like the background of something I'm watching on TV.

514
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:47,940
No, but I'm saying like, well, compared to the gaudy letter, I know he means he means this the kind of pastel.

515
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,560
Yeah, like all of the graphics are put on it.

516
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,020
They just filmed from above.

517
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,580
Oh, yeah.

518
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:52,740
Yeah.

519
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:52,960
Yeah.

520
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,760
It was like the centerpiece between the two parks.

521
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,200
But right.

522
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:03,840
I remember that in California, which is like it's a bunch of like, I mean, it's I kind of like it now as like what looks it.

523
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:10,860
This should be like the cover of a like a soft jazz album from 2001.

524
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:11,820
Yeah.

525
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,460
All the music you hear in the wine area.

526
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,420
This would be the album cover that is that gives me the fee.

527
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,080
The two thousand.

528
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,100
It gives me the one point.

529
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,700
Oh, feels.

530
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,940
Are you saying you like it?

531
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,540
I like it.

532
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,560
Yeah, I like it.

533
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,080
OK.

534
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,180
You think this is like a less offensive version of some of these early 2001?

535
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:34,500
Yes, I'm saying this is more defensible, I think, than the big California letters.

536
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,300
Well, I like the big California.

537
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,400
I like the California.

538
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,980
You like California letters more.

539
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,980
So you're anti-California letters.

540
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,380
No, I was coming into prepared to defend this.

541
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,960
And I thought we were going to jump on the California letters, I guess.

542
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,580
You know, I never you know, I think of all of those bad things at the front.

543
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,100
That's not the worst.

544
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,100
I don't like the postcard mural stuff.

545
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,160
I hate those walls.

546
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,380
I'm glad those are gone.

547
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,800
I hate the sun icon.

548
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,040
Golden Gate Bridge is not the worst thing to me.

549
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:14,160
And actually, I just for the first time in person got to see San Fransokyo,

550
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,620
which now has a future Golden Gate Bridge.

551
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,780
And that's kind of good.

552
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,620
That's a little bit.

553
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,560
I'm kind of glad that there's a silly Golden Gate Bridge back in that park.

554
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,920
And there's like fun music playing too.

555
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,500
There is really fun music.

556
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,100
And I was like, oh, I like I'd like maybe I like this.

557
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,360
I don't think this is some.

558
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,680
I didn't need anything over there.

559
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,260
But who's been better ish over there for quick service?

560
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:38,980
Sure.

561
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:44,600
Yeah, it's I don't think it's some like revolutionary redo.

562
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,360
I'm still a little like, why did this happen?

563
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,280
I mean, it's not a bad thing at all.

564
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
It's better.

565
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:54,220
I think it's a similar thing to Pixar Pier, where I go, yeah, I guess I like that they did it.

566
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,260
I like that they did it.

567
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:55,400
Sure.

568
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,360
I just wish that they did much bigger things.

569
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:02,120
Yes, that would be the consensus, I think, maybe all three of us, I guess.

570
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:13,300
But, you know, when we we did an episode right at the the 20 year mark of the opening that was about DCA 1.

571
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,020
0 in general.

572
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:21,380
And there was a discussion in that of what else has the vibe of DCA 1.

573
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:21,800
0?

574
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,920
What what else is 2001 core pre 911 core or whatever you want to call it?

575
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,840
And it's it's it's kind of intent.

576
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,860
It's tough to I like all the examples we thought of.

577
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,460
I think people gave us good ones online.

578
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,400
But this special is it the hardcore?

579
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:46,040
It is the hardest are 2001 core because you're you're watching these it's these actors in big billowy bowling show.

580
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,680
Everybody's got a bowling shirt on Mickey kind of included.

581
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,600
He do.

582
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,480
You're done.

583
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,460
And then the only one who isn't is Eisner.

584
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,080
They literally like I think they got Richard kind of they said which of these two shirts do you want?

585
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,440
He picked one and then they gave the other one to Mickey.

586
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,860
Like that was what I think the process was like for you, boss.

587
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:10,620
I was in like a casual sport coat like he escapes relatively unsaved.

588
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,580
He looks good.

589
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,380
He looks not wearing the bowling shirt, but that's he's the CEO.

590
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,400
He's maybe the only person in this.

591
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,160
And I mean, just people in the background.

592
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,080
This is the most bowling shirt Hawaiian shirted out piece of media ever.

593
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,660
Did Drew Carey influence this?

594
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,240
All this with like a bowling shirt?

595
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,320
Yeah, you know, it almost in the way that like, you know, somebody with a strong aesthetic like Christopher Nolan,

596
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,200
where he's the executive producer of something and he didn't wasn't on set, but you feel his.

597
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,660
We got to make sure it has his vibe.

598
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,840
This feels like if it said executive producer Drew Carey at the beginning.

599
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,440
Yeah, you would believe it.

600
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:44,700
Yeah.

601
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,160
Yeah, for sure.

602
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,320
Cory core is also not I think that's a good alternate name for this vibe.

603
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:55,140
It's also you also have the whose line guys who he didn't like discover, but he brought that to America.

604
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,220
And I forget what's going on with.

605
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,320
I mean, Colin, both of them just are like mini carries.

606
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,380
I feel like they are like one in the same, even though they want to find the other.

607
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:14,300
But the one Brad Sherwood especially is like reminded me of how fucking so many sideburns at this time.

608
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,540
There was always sideburns.

609
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,820
Yeah, I had sideburns.

610
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,000
You had sideburns.

611
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:19,500
Yeah.

612
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,520
How do you know?

613
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,400
How does that happen?

614
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,240
I can I can grill someone about this.

615
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:24,540
Yeah.

616
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,340
Were you after somebody's vibe?

617
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,800
Was it just like everyone has them?

618
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,900
So I have to ask that is great question.

619
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,940
I don't remember.

620
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,880
I didn't even ask.

621
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,560
Maybe it's just like I do.

622
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,300
You are a boy.

623
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,260
It is now you need sideburns.

624
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:41,760
I certainly remember trying to cut my hair or get my hair to look like like David Duchovny from the X-Files.

625
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,780
I remember that.

626
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,240
Whoa.

627
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,420
Actively happening.

628
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:50,820
But and everyone had like sort of sort of similar hair to him, I guess, at the time.

629
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,500
And then everyone had like parted in the middle.

630
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,640
This is like junior high.

631
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,740
But as far as the sideburns, yeah, that's a good question.

632
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:03,420
I don't remember specifically, like consciously having the thought that I need longer sideburns.

633
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
Everybody had them.

634
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,560
Yeah.

635
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,300
So you watch old clips of Conan and he's got them and his guest has them.

636
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,800
The whole all the Max Winfrey seven of them.

637
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:20,860
No, it's just such as just this little tell anyone out there is making a period piece from that era or anything.

638
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,820
That's that's the little that shows that you dotted the eye.

639
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,180
Yeah, like this this the cover.

640
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,980
This is a pretty good.

641
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,940
I forget what season specifically, but like this kind of Duchovny, he's kind of got it parted to the side.

642
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,400
You wanted to do that.

643
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,500
But it's kind of like a swoosh a little bit.

644
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:39,880
Yeah, because I mean, I definitely had like more of a middle part to swoosh is going on in junior high.

645
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:40,540
That's close.

646
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,280
That Duchovny is closer to Conan than I would have thought.

647
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,300
And I see a little bit.

648
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,140
Yeah.

649
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,380
Yeah.

650
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,060
We'll swoosh.

651
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:54,300
That's kind of the most conscious like memory I have of trying to let me see if this is this is still a little bit of a side.

652
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,060
But that's sort of what the vibe was.

653
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,460
How close do you feel like you got?

654
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,920
I don't think I think I don't know.

655
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:07,360
I wasn't so happy with it, but I had that hair for years, I think.

656
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,220
So, yeah, I don't know what the sideburns such a good question.

657
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,720
Who started that?

658
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,760
Has anyone documented this?

659
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,000
Is it late ketchup from Luke Perry?

660
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,340
Oh, maybe.

661
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,800
And the tall hair and Jay, it's like somehow it took years for that to like, right.

662
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,040
Right.

663
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,060
He had pretty big sideburns.

664
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,920
And some puffy hair, too.

665
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,440
Is there like, I don't know what to call it, like ska?

666
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,020
Did ska do that?

667
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,180
Or like, I feel like some of the characters on Mission Hill were animated with sideburns.

668
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,240
You know, that aesthetic, which I guess is just very similar to the damn clowns.

669
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,900
It feels kind of, yeah, it's kind of Kevin Smithy.

670
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:49,460
Or Mr.

671
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:49,980
Show.

672
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,440
I feel like there's some sideburns.

673
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,320
I think this was Onkirk's side.

674
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,900
And they were like, yeah, there are like posters for that.

675
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,220
They're bowling shirt guys.

676
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,560
Like, how do we bring ourselves to America?

677
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,800
That was their shit.

678
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,460
Like we're coming out with the weirdest comedy show you've ever seen.

679
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,740
We better put on bowling shirts or no one will watch this.

680
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,380
The Barenaked Ladies wore bowling shirts.

681
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,180
They're completely this vibe.

682
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,800
And they, I, Steven Page, I recall very strongly having sideburns.

683
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,200
Yeah.

684
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,900
Like big sideburns for a while.

685
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,840
Gosh, I don't know.

686
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,200
What happened?

687
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,800
I would just love to know like the order.

688
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,360
I'd just love to see this style family tree somehow laid out.

689
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,740
Just figure out the evolution of it.

690
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,220
Evolution in the film starring David Duchovny in which he has sideburns.

691
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,580
Oh, I was so excited for evolution.

692
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,740
I was so disappointed when I actually saw it.

693
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,220
I was like, oh no.

694
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,280
I don't think this is good.

695
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:45,820
What was Duchovny and Julianne were Orlando Jones and Sean William Scott?

696
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,500
Sure.

697
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,160
Yeah.

698
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,820
Strong cast and his sci-fi.

699
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,580
It's the watch of its era.

700
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,200
And it was advertised from the director of Ghostbusters, you know.

701
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,320
Can't go wrong.

702
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,680
Never made a bad one.

703
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,880
So with this vibe, let me just say before we get too deep into it,

704
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,820
with this vibe being strewn throughout, I've seen this special before.

705
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,500
I have always found this special to be extremely irritating.

706
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,080
I am quite annoyed by it.

707
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,120
It wasn't the worst to revisit it.

708
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:27,900
But for every bit that I love, like that 35th anniversary one that I mentioned

709
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,480
or the Harry Anderson one I've watched a zillion times, this is…

710
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,800
You know what's a big part of it for me, and I still haven't really synopsized the story,

711
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,260
but you've got Barry Buswick and Richard Kind are trying to…

712
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,220
They parked their car in a bit.

713
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,640
It's a series of events where security guards are after them, and that's the Who's Line Is It Anyway guys.

714
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:54,400
And it's that style of comedy, which today is all comedy, where the cops are funny too.

715
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,200
They gotta be funny too.

716
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,360
Like the hosts are like, well, we really gotta explore the…

717
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,640
And then the security guards, well, we really gotta attract those guys now.

718
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,560
Like everyone, just someone needs to be a straight man.

719
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,180
Someone needs to calm down.

720
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,040
And then I don't…

721
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,860
Music all very unpleasant, I think.

722
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,120
Is it like, I'm trying to remember even…

723
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,200
Well, I just watched this today, and it was like…

724
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,180
It's pretty circus-y.

725
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,560
It's all in that Paradise Pier kind of family.

726
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,820
I mean, at some point you hear the full…

727
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,400
You know what I don't mind as a piece of music

728
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,180
is the original California Screamin' music?

729
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,680
That's the zenith of kind of digital Pro Tools-y…

730
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,880
That's a Pro Tools Calliope.

731
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,980
That's completely right.

732
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,840
Like carousel music filtered through 2001 Mac.

733
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,000
Yeah, yes.

734
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,120
Not all of it is bad, but all of this is bad, I would say.

735
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,940
I think it's a lot of park music, because they use Soarin' music.

736
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:53,880
Yes, yeah.

737
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,100
And then Tinkley Piano that feels very…

738
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,280
Yeah, yeah.

739
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,540
Napa Wine Zone.

740
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,180
Yeah.

741
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:05,520
There's a moment where they stare at Grizzly Peak that has some nice music.

742
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,060
I think maybe they're still using some Soarin' music in here.

743
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:08,740
Yeah.

744
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,760
Obviously Soarin' music is the best music in the whole world.

745
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,600
It really stands out when you're hearing a bunch of this.

746
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,840
You know what's the one…

747
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,520
They play this a lot.

748
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,580
It's kind of like…

749
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:20,220
You'd think I would like this because I like the Beach Boys,

750
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:25,760
but I'm not very fond of the Calliope Beach Boys music that used to play at Calvary,

751
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,140
but I found that pretty irritating.

752
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:32,640
And then this special has this very summertime blues that they play a lot.

753
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,080
I was going to say it.

754
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,440
Do not like it at all.

755
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:39,720
Yeah.

756
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,040
At all.

757
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,080
Yeah.

758
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,000
It's just a subtle…

759
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,120
If the music was not so…

760
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,520
If it wasn't the auditory equivalent of bowling shirts,

761
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,560
maybe I could handle the silly broad acting a little bit easier.

762
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,340
I feel like I mostly know that from like commercial…

763
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,680
Like,

764
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,940
New Uncrustables!

765
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,520
Like, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches!

766
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,600
Eat your freezer!

767
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,520
That's the de-evolution of…

768
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,860
Surf music is kind of gritty and punk.

769
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,020
Early surf music is something kind of cool about it, and then decades later…

770
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,120
Blah, blah, blah, blah!

771
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Don't get rused!

772
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,060
Chocolate!

773
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,240
Yeah.

774
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:26,320
Who created using the guitar like that?

775
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,620
Dick Dale?

776
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,960
Dick Dale, probably.

777
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:29,600
Possibly, yeah.

778
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:29,880
Oh, is that the…

779
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,020
Did everyone see this Dick Dale video that's going around, right?

780
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,760
He's playing on top of the Disneyland, or on Space Mountain.

781
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,700
On Space Mountain.

782
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,360
There's this whole…

783
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,960
We don't have time to get into it, but I heard this…

784
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:38,300
No, I heard this.

785
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:38,580
I think this…

786
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,940
Imagine you're Eddie Soto.

787
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,000
Soto.

788
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,220
Soto?

789
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:48,160
He told a whole story online of why it happened.

790
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:55,320
Actually, I think I listened to a podcast with him where he said that the original plan was to get him to play on top of the Matterhorn.

791
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,520
Really?

792
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,620
I didn't see this.

793
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:01,960
And then he didn't bother to tell anybody from events planning at Disneyland, and that when…

794
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,540
This is on the Tomorrow Society podcast, so I don't steal their story.

795
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:06,960
Okay.

796
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:14,900
But he didn't tell events planning, we're going to put a famous guitar player up there, and they were like,

797
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,540
No!

798
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,160
That can't…

799
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,180
We're not insured to put someone on top of…

800
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,960
The mountain climbing is a big, laborious thing.

801
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,380
Yeah.

802
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:28,620
He's going to just stare his little gator with a guitar, and he's going to do something up there.

803
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,580
If he trips and falls, that's it.

804
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,500
If given the options, I would also pick Space Mountain.

805
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,540
That is more architecturally sound.

806
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,340
There are way too many imaginary interviews where they're like,

807
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,040
Yeah, Matterhorn, kind of piece that together.

808
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,080
Probably not too even.

809
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,820
It's like, oh, what's this thing?

810
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,460
Like standing on top of a coral reef.

811
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,440
It's like, yeah, we taught ourselves mathematics.

812
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,700
Who designed all the ride?

813
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,540
I am terrible with names nowadays.

814
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,060
Bob Gurr?

815
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,680
Bob Gurr.

816
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,000
Bob Gurr in the Imagineering story is like,

817
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,660
Well, I had to learn calculus.

818
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,140
It's very impressive.

819
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:13,500
What he describes that someone could just pick it up and then design it,

820
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,120
and then have other people go like, yeah, this is correct.

821
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,640
This is mathematically and structurally sound.

822
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:28,060
That said, the Imagineer, the Matterhorn has had way too many aftermarket,

823
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,840
like way too much stuff done over the years where it's like,

824
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,080
I don't really want to see the basketball court.

825
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,240
Thank you so much.

826
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,360
Yes, that could be a trip and fall.

827
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,920
Yeah, you just take one step and go right through that thing.

828
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,260
But you know, then it resulted in Dick Dale playing on top of Space Mountain.

829
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,540
Which is, I hadn't seen that.

830
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,600
Like, there's a little video of it.

831
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,540
I knew about it and didn't know there was video.

832
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,100
And I think Eddie sort of posted it.

833
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:57,800
But the two thousand, like just the half, like how many half-lifes of the original cool surf rock are we at here?

834
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,320
Yeah.

835
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,800
And is this going to, I mean, everything comes back around maybe.

836
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:09,420
But will there be a time where people are like, oh, I do like the sound of all this shitty music.

837
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,100
I don't think it's this.

838
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,000
I don't think it's the worst era for in-park music ever.

839
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,120
Yeah.

840
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,260
It really, like the standard is not.

841
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,420
It's pretty bad, I know.

842
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:27,500
And I'm a person who now is into and apologetic for like, you know, 90s New Age, essentially from Epcot in the 90s.

843
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,980
So somebody somewhere maybe, I don't know, that Disney circus music is pretty terrible.

844
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,300
It's really bad.

845
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,740
Yes.

846
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,400
And it's gone from the park, right?

847
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,080
There's no place where it still exists.

848
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,360
I don't think so.

849
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,120
But that's a little different.

850
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,300
That's like a compilation.

851
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,100
Nobody made that for the park.

852
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:53,740
Right.

853
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:57,660
And the restaurant still has, I think, that I haven't been in there in a while.

854
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,520
Which was?

855
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,300
Oh, oh, early.

856
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,180
I was there with my family a few months ago.

857
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,420
I didn't really notice music.

858
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,700
I feel like you notice it in the quick service.

859
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,560
Yeah, maybe more.

860
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,860
Or around at California Adventure.

861
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,540
The upgrade in music certainly happened when they pumped all that money in.

862
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,400
Because Cars Land has good music.

863
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,680
It's a lot of pop music.

864
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,400
Yeah, yeah.

865
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,820
I'm not going to go out of my way to listen to Daddy's Little Fatty or whatever.

866
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,740
Or Suitcase in a Dream.

867
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,840
You don't live in our house.

868
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,880
We've got Bob Wills on.

869
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,700
I wait until I'm there and then I…

870
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,180
We've got Bob Wills on all the time in the house.

871
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:34,880
Bob Wills.

872
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,200
We're a Bob Wills house.

873
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,280
We're a Bob Wills house.

874
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,700
Yeah, we listen to him and Tom.

875
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,340
Your poor daughter.

876
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,180
But Tommy, we were at Bob Wills' house growing up.

877
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,660
She loves Bob Wills.

878
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,780
She loves old time country music because it goes boom, boom, boom, boom.

879
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,360
Like that little country beat.

880
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,460
So she starts wiggling.

881
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,840
She likes that more than some of the 90s rock I try to make her listen to.

882
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,080
She's not in a third eye blind?

883
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:55,960
Not yet.

884
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,940
You have to, Mike, you absolutely have to get your teenage daughter into third eye blind.

885
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,620
She'll be screwed socially if she's not.

886
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,260
She's going to like, how's it going to be?

887
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,500
See, now I know you don't like the rest of her, but Jane is pretty good.

888
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,380
Jane is kind of good.

889
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:19,300
She dances to old time country, but she also recently loves Staying Alive by the Bee Gees.

890
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,880
She dances, she has five different moves even.

891
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,880
She does when Staying Alive starts.

892
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,660
Oh, that's cool.

893
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,840
I'm all for that.

894
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,720
She dances like arms, wiggles.

895
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,040
It's very cute.

896
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:36,000
But yeah, no, she demanded more of Bob Wills and the old time music.

897
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,980
All right, I've got another little bit of music to play, but I think maybe before that we should set the scene.

898
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:47,800
Let's start weaving the dense narrative that somehow Jerry Rees was able to put together in only four days' time.

899
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:58,420
So once the little opening is done and that Cory Burton intro, then you get some of the coolest shots you've ever seen.

900
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,860
Where I think it is that music.

901
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,880
I think it's boogaloo doogaloo doo doo doo doo doo.

902
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:12,060
And you see two badasses, Barry Moswick and Richard Kine, in their biggest billowy shirts you've ever seen in an open top car,

903
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,000
driving up to those California letters.

904
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,680
And you know you're off to a very pleasant time.

905
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:27,600
And they talk about how, you know, what's weaving us through this special is that they don't know what's up.

906
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:33,740
They've been called to the Disneyland Resort because they have a very important meeting with the Big Cheese.

907
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:43,660
And again, a theme I've been saying this Big Cheese runner, I think Big Cheese is said 29 times.

908
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,080
I don't know.

909
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,420
Is this used in another special?

910
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,420
Must be.

911
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:55,720
Had I just watched, I know I've watched this before, but I feel like I've heard this gag from Eisner era,

912
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,320
where they're like, Michael, we came to see you.

913
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,740
Oh, I'm not the Big Cheese.

914
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,660
It's him.

915
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,700
I don't know.

916
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:07,500
Listener, just take a guess right now if you haven't watched this and don't intend to.

917
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,640
Who do you think the Big Cheese is?

918
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,100
Do you think it's Michael Eisner, Disney CEO, that they assume?

919
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,840
Or could someone else be the Big Cheese?

920
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,880
Is this somehow telegraphed from second one?

921
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:21,860
What a reveal.

922
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,280
If you don't know, I guess.

923
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,640
It's Rattigan, of course.

924
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,840
Oh, that brick mouse detective, I'll get him you.

925
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,980
Can you help me very in mid-june?

926
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,120
That would be exciting.

927
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,240
Let's live action remake that.

928
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:38,900
Oh, yeah.

929
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,740
I'll work for scale, you know.

930
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,620
Are you playing Rattigan?

931
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,360
I'll do any.

932
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,220
Yeah, I'll do Rattigan.

933
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,840
Let's do Rattigan.

934
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,580
I don't remember.

935
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,720
It's a good thing you're willing to work for scale because from what I've heard about the Disney company, you will be.

936
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,380
Yeah, yeah.

937
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,100
Well, that's what I've told other realists.

938
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,220
It's very funny looking back that Disney bought Marvel

939
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:04,380
because the comics industry reputation of, oh, Marvel is very cheap.

940
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,180
You know, Marvel will take forever and will pay you very base rates.

941
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:16,240
The entire industry and every other industry all turning into the same thing.

942
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:24,320
No, but like comics, a world of like Hucksters and Carnies, like if Marvel's got that bad of a reputation.

943
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,300
Yeah, yeah.

944
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,840
A world of Hucksters and Carnies, like original California adventure.

945
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:29,420
That's right.

946
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,920
Like I'm just repeating you, like all industries?

947
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:34,760
Okay.

948
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,600
So our hosts have shown up.

949
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,960
Barry Bostwick, both of them on Spin City at the time.

950
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:44,720
I didn't know.

951
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,360
You remember this, Mike?

952
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,600
This seems kind of up your alley.

953
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:55,220
Do you know that Barry Bostwick was in a music group in the 1970s, a group called The Clowns with a K.

954
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:04,260
And the premise of the band is that they are all in clown makeup.

955
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,400
And this was what this was.

956
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:07,740
The fuck?

957
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,560
Yeah, this is a band that was in it.

958
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,740
This is one of those things that's just said really casually in a Wikipedia.

959
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,220
We're like, oh, he was in a band called The Clowns that was brought to you by Barnum and Bailey.

960
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:18,940
What?

961
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,100
You can't just say that.

962
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,380
Barnum and Bailey doesn't have bands.

963
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,100
What are you talking about?

964
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:27,380
And not only that, this was put together and that song was written by Jeff Berry, writer of Sugar Sugar.

965
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:27,980
Oh my God.

966
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:32,340
This was like they were trying to manufacture a band Archie's Monkey style.

967
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,680
Barnum and Bailey said we got to get more uxters.

968
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,620
We got to get into the band business.

969
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,300
Mike, you're looking at The Clowns now.

970
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,220
How is this never come across anyone's desk before?

971
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,400
Barry Bostwick's band with The Clowns.

972
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,580
As you said a couple of months ago or something, we keep discovering crap.

973
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,240
And maybe this isn't even crap.

974
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,640
Crap with a K like The Clowns.

975
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,080
Yeah.

976
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,280
I like these outfits, I'll be honest.

977
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,440
This is the thing where there were 30 singles released every week.

978
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,180
And so a lot of them are just lost to the ages.

979
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:02,920
Nobody paid attention.

980
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:03,360
Yeah.

981
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,060
Nobody tracked them.

982
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,220
Nobody has the digital rights.

983
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,220
Nobody kept a copy.

984
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,180
Yeah, he's in The Clowns.

985
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:17,660
The writer of Sugar Sugar, Jeff Berry, who was also a co-writer on all the Spectre, River Deep Mountain High, Be My Baby, Chapel of Love and The Clowns.

986
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,780
The Clowns.

987
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:19,120
Yeah.

988
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,440
So look into The Clowns on your own time.

989
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,020
This is terrifying.

990
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,000
Yeah.

991
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,980
Is that a scary photo?

992
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,000
Yeah, I'm less into that.

993
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:26,300
Yeah.

994
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:34,100
When they were all white, there's something kind of, you know, for kind of a pre-Klaus Nomi to make one of the most obscure references I've made on the podcast.

995
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,160
I shout out to my Klaus Nomi fans out there.

996
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:39,960
Is the song good?

997
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,340
Do you know?

998
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,100
What's that?

999
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,980
I think I listened to it and it was like fine but boring.

1000
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:44,380
Okay.

1001
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,640
That's I believe.

1002
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:54,140
So we got a member of The Clowns and then we got Richard Kind, who at this time has just done a Bugs Life that will come into play later.

1003
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,580
Richard Kind, there's a story about him.

1004
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,360
I don't know if you know this.

1005
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:58,920
I don't know.

1006
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,120
Kind of an interesting little tidbit.

1007
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,980
Basically, he was good friends with George Clooney.

1008
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:15,520
And then one day, Richard Kind was summoned to a room with 13 other guys, one of whom was Randy Gerber, which isn't central to the story.

1009
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,380
But it's part of it.

1010
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:23,460
And basically, he was handed a suitcase, luggage, luggage, to me luggage of a million dollars.

1011
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,820
Just for being friends.

1012
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:25,300
Yeah.

1013
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:25,860
Wow.

1014
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,360
It's an interesting story, huh?

1015
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,800
With a lot of really, I think, memorable details.

1016
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:36,940
I have a lot of less interesting story about him getting a litter box full of human shit, but I won't tell that right now.

1017
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:42,220
It seems like a lot of people knew that story and were like very freaked out and like adding.

1018
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:43,680
And knew more details than we said.

1019
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1020
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,440
This is a famous tale, I guess.

1021
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:46,920
Right.

1022
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:50,080
So so many Richard Kind stories to get through.

1023
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:58,920
But the main the Richard Kind story today is that he's looking for the big cheese and they seem to not even know that there is a new theme park right next door to Disneyland.

1024
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:06,500
One thing about this special that I think is odd is that in every case, that parking lot tram comes in a lot.

1025
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,520
He's at the beginning and then it's every commercial break.

1026
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:18,900
And I swear they are talking to they're talking to the audience like we are dumb because it's they are constantly reiterating story and also that California Adventure is next to Disneyland.

1027
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:19,690
It is constantly.

1028
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:28,020
We left Barry and Richard as they were being chased by our security guards through Disney's California Adventure right next door to Disneyland.

1029
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:36,560
Disneyland, remember, is right next door to Disney's California Adventure, the new park where Barry and Richard are being chased by our security guards.

1030
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,280
Well, they end up at Disneyland right next door to California Adventure.

1031
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:50,380
I guess what is the what the reasoning could be behind that is like they really want to stress that you if you're going to Disneyland, you may as well go to this place anyway.

1032
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,080
Yeah, maybe.

1033
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:52,760
Yes.

1034
00:48:52,980 --> 00:49:00,440
In case if you're really not paying attention and you kind of just like you're not a fan of the stuff you and you're like you're on your way into Disneyland.

1035
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,740
What if you're dealing with five kids and you don't even look up and see that there's a new California Wetters?

1036
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,140
Yeah.

1037
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,040
Just like scurrying them in there.

1038
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,140
Let's go get the train.

1039
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,560
Maybe you wouldn't know.

1040
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,360
I don't know.

1041
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,500
Maybe they feel like they have to do they have to underline this put in bold.

1042
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,080
This is for dummies to know.

1043
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,320
Yeah, I think that is I mean, yeah, either that or just whoever was noting it.

1044
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,600
Eisner or something just he lost the plot.

1045
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,900
He was like, where is it again?

1046
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,720
I know it's around Disneyland, but maybe we need to make sure I forgot.

1047
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,100
You don't even have to walk.

1048
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,860
You don't even have to get in a bus or anything.

1049
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,120
Yeah, it's no it's basically you're basically.

1050
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,400
Already there just 80 more dollars.

1051
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,200
It's one big park.

1052
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:44,060
Yeah, they might be counting on casual viewers, you know, tuning in halfway through or whatever.

1053
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:44,760
You got to recap.

1054
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,900
We got to recap.

1055
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:54,180
There's also I you know, I I don't know if you wanted to go through it, you know, storyline wise.

1056
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,900
Do we have to?

1057
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,380
Yeah, that was my thinking too.

1058
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:07,320
They when they're first walking in, they say you've got a nice little park here to Colin McHarey and Brad Sherwood.

1059
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,960
And they go little.

1060
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:15,800
This is fifty five acres, which it is one of the smaller parks in Disney's portfolio.

1061
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,080
It is a smaller park.

1062
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:22,480
And I had never heard this phrase this phrase this way.

1063
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:28,920
And I don't think really stuck around, but they say why there's like 22 rides.

1064
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:33,660
They say rides, which is weird because they're so sticky about the attractions.

1065
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:38,160
They say there's 22 rides and shows and parades and stuff.

1066
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:38,700
Why?

1067
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,040
I don't know.

1068
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,840
They make it seem like there was a bunch of stuff.

1069
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:42,880
Three rides.

1070
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:49,440
They specifically say it's the same number of rides and shows as Disneyland when it opened in 1955.

1071
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,820
Oh, so that's fine.

1072
00:50:52,620 --> 00:51:00,960
Certainly stand theme park standards haven't changed since 1955 when there was a significant amount of it was just dirt.

1073
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,520
You know, just dirt fields or empty sidewalks that let you nowhere.

1074
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:09,080
And they just call it a fun town.

1075
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,700
What's that big pile of dirt there?

1076
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:15,680
Holiday, holiday, holiday town, the big hill.

1077
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:17,580
Yeah, no.

1078
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,920
And they also like they say how many things there are.

1079
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,600
And then Brad Sherwood says each one is different.

1080
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,520
OK, we're a little.

1081
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:26,880
He says it a lot.

1082
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:27,480
He does.

1083
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:42,140
But it's like, yeah, boy, they're these poor guys who let's get the top improv guys on TV to really do up to plead to the audience to not be mad about what they're getting at Disneyland's new park.

1084
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:48,360
Hey, it was fine with me like a 13 year old, you know, a chubby 13 year old nerd in Pennsylvania.

1085
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:53,680
It's like that's who they wanted to attract, you know, and many soap stars.

1086
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,620
And they're all from different shows.

1087
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:59,180
That's pretty impressive report.

1088
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:10,520
What Charles Charles and all my children, Aaron, she would eventually leave for Charles and then come back on to Port Charles.

1089
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,680
No, she would come back on like Charles.

1090
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,360
That was the most frantic dive for the phone.

1091
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,940
I don't know what I thought I was.

1092
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:23,680
I'm like, Jason, the audience is dying to know what soap opera you went back to.

1093
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,080
So what is the first time you stepped foot in California?

1094
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,600
Venture 2006.

1095
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:28,340
2006.

1096
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:28,720
OK.

1097
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:35,600
But like so it got you by the time you were 18 years later, a college student with not much money.

1098
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,100
Yeah, but it's worse than a 13 year old.

1099
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,460
But not all of it.

1100
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,400
This is important context.

1101
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,740
Yeah, thank you for that.

1102
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:48,960
But you know, the newest park you had been to was Islands of Adventure at that point, right?

1103
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,120
Yes, at that point.

1104
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,000
So then you're going to 1.

1105
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,860
0 Disney California Adventure.

1106
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,380
Didn't you feel a bit let down?

1107
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,320
I mean, I don't know what California is like.

1108
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,820
I certainly had expectations.

1109
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,720
You were grading on the biggest curve.

1110
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,760
I didn't know.

1111
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:10,160
And then when I first came out here and went to Disneyland for the first time, like, holy shit, this is great.

1112
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,740
There's so much.

1113
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,660
Maybe maybe you liked the vibe.

1114
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,420
OK, that's that's that's part of it.

1115
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:25,160
Well, it wasn't until the second or third time that I made California Adventure and me and my college roommate Jack.

1116
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:30,500
Hi, if you're listening, he we blitzed through it all by like 11 a.

1117
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:30,680
m.

1118
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,300
or noon and it's like, well, I'm glad we bought a park.

1119
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,920
Brad Sherwood implied that there was much to do.

1120
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,720
So basically, why are the security guards mad?

1121
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,160
I don't know.

1122
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:41,400
They do.

1123
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,480
That is a very good question.

1124
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,500
They're like tracking Eisner's day and like, no, no, it's a very tight schedule and you can't.

1125
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:48,340
Yeah.

1126
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:53,040
So they're trying to stop Barry and Richard from exploring all 22 ride shows and attractions.

1127
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:59,540
Yeah, they don't because they say like we have some VIPs that wandered off or there's a sentence like that sounds like that.

1128
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:05,380
And this is this is one of the clips that I have is that what really there's like this siren song that calls to them.

1129
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:10,620
They're listening to kind of the you know, going on and on about what attractions they have.

1130
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:17,440
But then they like they turn as if seeing the most beautiful woman alive and they like, ah, we must with them.

1131
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,620
They propel forward.

1132
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:22,940
And this is what's calling them is this weird parade happening in the center of the park.

1133
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,980
And here, boy, we've already discussed challenging music.

1134
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,320
Get ready for this one.

1135
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,580
Very sexual.

1136
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:58,620
Granite Mountain.

1137
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,200
What's that?

1138
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:03,240
Why do we hear so much of that song?

1139
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,840
And then I don't know where to begin.

1140
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:10,020
I don't know what in my head there is with something called Eureka.

1141
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,180
And maybe that is your is that the case?

1142
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:13,860
Eureka.

1143
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,600
You do an episode on Eureka.

1144
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,620
I'd love to do all the weird words.

1145
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,420
Eureka, luminaria.

1146
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,380
Oh, yeah.

1147
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,560
The power of blast.

1148
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:27,700
These are all things I remember from unpleasant California adventure from people online going, I hate this place.

1149
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:33,560
But it's like it is a big yellow California shape.

1150
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,420
And then it goes to then there's just like four people holding big.

1151
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:45,400
It's like giant headdress cape things with faces of Californians like a movie star.

1152
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,240
It looks like Lady Gaga and sunglasses.

1153
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:52,320
And I don't know what I don't know what I'm looking at.

1154
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,700
And then like a lady in a headdress.

1155
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:55,540
What is this?

1156
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,480
This is this parade does not match the song.

1157
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:02,500
I would walk past this as fast as humanly possible.

1158
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,660
It's a very sultry song for a parade.

1159
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,780
Like, I don't know why.

1160
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,640
What can I do to hold you?

1161
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:15,260
Yeah, when I get you in my arms, I'm going to do so much stuff to you.

1162
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:25,500
This seems like a license like like someone there was a thing going around Twitter a while back where people were trying to track down a song from one moment from the X-Files.

1163
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:26,180
OK.

1164
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:42,260
And no one could find it because I think it was just like, oh, they would send out CDs of like generic like copyright free music or licensable music where it's like hard rock country bar song.

1165
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:46,300
You're saying it was sort of a generic track or a royalty free?

1166
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,240
That very much seems like a generic track.

1167
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:53,320
It seems like that parade seems like in the Tapestry of Nations.

1168
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,420
Yeah, but yeah, we're still in that Millennium.

1169
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,540
I hate things like this.

1170
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,680
But this makes.

1171
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,860
This style of parade.

1172
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,360
It's all this post Tamer Lion King.

1173
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,760
Like they're still in love with that.

1174
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,000
I hate it.

1175
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:12,980
This this makes Tapestry of Nations look like Main Street Electrical Parade.

1176
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,380
Like this makes Epcot Millennials celebration look really good.

1177
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:24,100
I I want to shout out also this is a rare special where there are credits.

1178
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,540
Somehow people credit themselves at the top of this.

1179
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,980
And I was really struck by the type of the credit.

1180
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,520
Original music by Wow and Flow.

1181
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,880
I also wrote this down.

1182
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:34,620
Yes.

1183
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:37,040
That might have some maybe that's an original.

1184
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,140
That's a wow and flutter.

1185
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,900
They had that line around the wow and flutter lab.

1186
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,400
They had to get that in.

1187
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:47,180
In one week, Mike will walk in here and be like, I really like flutter.

1188
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,460
I was listening to flutter solo work.

1189
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,820
I don't like it.

1190
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:52,160
Wow was not good.

1191
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,040
Wow is bad.

1192
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:54,940
No, no, no.

1193
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:55,580
Wow is not good.

1194
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,040
But flutter.

1195
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,300
My daughter has been dancing to a lot of flutter.

1196
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,440
She loves flutter.

1197
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,120
So now it's security guard hijinks.

1198
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,540
They're bumping into each other.

1199
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,180
We spend a lot of time.

1200
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,480
We go.

1201
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,880
We're killing a lot of time in the Hollywood area.

1202
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:13,560
They have to.

1203
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:19,920
This is the thinnest soup that there is where they have to really make this seem like this is something because this is something I remember from when it opened.

1204
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:21,760
I still I was in it the other day.

1205
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,880
I'm still that animation lobby.

1206
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:30,240
We spent a lot of time being convinced that like basic it's a room where they play clips of the movies.

1207
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:30,780
Yeah.

1208
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:34,660
So what am I supposed to and it's OK now.

1209
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:37,160
Now that it's one of like 80 things to do there.

1210
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:37,500
Yes.

1211
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:45,940
But at the time like I'm sorry one of the primary things about this park is that you have a big screen with clips of your own movies.

1212
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,000
But why are Barry and Richard so excited about this?

1213
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Which everyone spent the 90s acquiring on the chunky white VHS is the chunky white VHS boxes.

1214
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:01,400
You can come see them now in bigger four by three on vacation.

1215
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,680
It was more money to see Bambi's mom.

1216
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:04,060
Yeah.

1217
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,980
And this is like the first this is what they're like leading off with as far as things to do.

1218
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:14,440
And boss Wicke and kind spend a lot of time in there it seems like.

1219
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,100
Yeah.

1220
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:24,600
Many minutes featuring this part which if I really think the biggest thing about it is just like using so much time on this special to talk about this.

1221
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,100
This is the thing you walk by.

1222
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,280
Yeah of course.

1223
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:33,700
But as if like you know one of the big things to do here is watch the movie on a big wall.

1224
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,600
You're like oh yeah OK.

1225
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:36,220
Yeah.

1226
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:50,840
Well it's like an act like by ratio like now I like a Galaxy's Edge opening special done like this would be like what's like a you know like like some of those droids that rattle around outside the store would be a full 30 minutes.

1227
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:51,280
Right.

1228
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:57,600
Data pads would be you do like like we have four entire sketches about data pads.

1229
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:07,320
Yeah they may as well have just done like a word wieners five minutes before instead of this because at least that's like a hot dog place and I'm working a little different than another.

1230
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,300
Dogs I love them.

1231
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:10,140
Well yeah I'm watching my figure.

1232
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:10,540
Right.

1233
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:11,760
Next season of Spin City.

1234
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,460
I won't fit into this.

1235
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,680
I won't fit into even a billowy bowling shirt.

1236
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:18,320
I'll have to go to a quadruple XL.

1237
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:21,420
And he only needs a one.

1238
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:21,840
No right.

1239
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:25,280
It's just I'm just saying that's the style of how you were at the time.

1240
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,280
Take whatever size you are add three.

1241
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:27,860
You're good.

1242
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:28,540
Exactly.

1243
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:29,760
Can you get scaky pants.

1244
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:33,520
Can you see the Muppet vision sign in the background.

1245
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,420
Where did that come later in there.

1246
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:39,480
If you don't know if they even maybe maybe there's a maybe the security guards in front of it at some point.

1247
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:42,680
No no but I'm saying that open with the park Muppet vision.

1248
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:43,720
Yeah.

1249
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:43,960
Yeah.

1250
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,160
Okay.

1251
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,280
They could have wondered in there and talk to Kermit and Fozzie.

1252
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,460
To eat up some time.

1253
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,680
That requires calling them up at people.

1254
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:53,280
Yes.

1255
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,000
Relationships not good at the time.

1256
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,980
They have to put the movie in but that I don't think they're they're not sending the characters.

1257
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:02,380
It's already a decade old.

1258
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,180
It is a decade old.

1259
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:06,400
I'm just saying we were talking about the stars.

1260
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:07,700
It's a better thing.

1261
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:09,460
It's a better thing to do.

1262
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:15,580
But also I feel like maybe they were like do we want to talk about how we just threw a 10 year old movie in here.

1263
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:18,260
Like that's not exactly like oh it's a new thing.

1264
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:23,180
They want to talk about how they threw a three year old movie right into the bug theater.

1265
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:23,840
That's true.

1266
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:25,160
I'll get to that.

1267
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:29,500
But then you also get a you get so much soap opera bistro and you go through.

1268
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:29,840
Yeah.

1269
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,060
OK.

1270
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:31,260
We have five stars.

1271
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:36,440
We have five soap opera stars and you need to watch whose line Brad Sherwood security guard.

1272
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:42,420
Think that it's one of those gags where the guy doesn't know that it's a character and not a real actor.

1273
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:42,740
Right.

1274
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:47,480
And you watch it play out a new five times in a row.

1275
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:48,900
No no no.

1276
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,340
I'm you don't understand.

1277
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,660
I'm not Alexis.

1278
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:53,620
I'm Nancy Lee Gron.

1279
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,100
That is a character that I play on TV.

1280
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,020
No no no.

1281
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:58,340
I want to do Alexis.

1282
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:03,860
And then again and they keep when they pan over and there's another guy and then another guy.

1283
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,580
I got scared that they were going to be like 17.

1284
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,580
We're going to keep going down the stable.

1285
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:09,400
I.

1286
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:10,000
Yeah.

1287
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:10,760
I don't know.

1288
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,020
This would it.

1289
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:14,000
This wouldn't happen in the old specials.

1290
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:15,180
No.

1291
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,100
It would have been better.

1292
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,080
They would have done it with more than four days.

1293
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:22,460
Although I don't think you know what a lot of those didn't we talk about didn't land us to have the same situation.

1294
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:22,940
Yeah.

1295
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:23,760
All right.

1296
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,460
Never mind.

1297
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:35,200
But I'm saying that was written by that pro the like guy did all the the you know big bang and all the Muppets that was written by like I don't know who wrote this but I don't.

1298
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:35,960
Boy.

1299
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:43,160
It's just funny also that it's like I'm not saying it would work with bigger stars but it also would have been bigger star like that.

1300
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:50,220
I don't know your attention that you're like wow I'm watching this guy instead of me if you're like no it's a really specific type of person who's really into John Engel.

1301
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:51,040
You're right.

1302
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,760
And also John Engel is on your television every day.

1303
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:58,300
I was John Engel is popular like Susan Lucci was like famous famous.

1304
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:58,700
Yes.

1305
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:01,160
In a way that other soap stars weren't.

1306
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:01,300
Yes.

1307
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:03,380
Was John Engel no offense to Mr.

1308
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:03,980
Engel.

1309
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,100
I don't think so.

1310
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,220
I don't think so either.

1311
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,700
So it's just an interesting choice.

1312
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:09,740
I have the Aaron Hershey update.

1313
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:10,800
Thank God.

1314
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:11,640
We've all been.

1315
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:19,060
She reprised our Alison Garrager on General Hospital in 2013 for four episodes.

1316
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:23,920
Alison returned to poor Charles along with her son Rafe Jr.

1317
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,560
But was soon murdered.

1318
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:30,620
It was just we brought her back.

1319
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,400
It's a big she's coming back.

1320
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:33,340
All right.

1321
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:33,980
Four.

1322
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,240
That's one week.

1323
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:36,180
That's cool.

1324
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,900
You're on for one week maybe.

1325
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:39,420
And then murdered.

1326
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:40,380
Murdered.

1327
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:41,460
OK.

1328
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,960
That's well if it's where the story must go.

1329
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:44,620
Yeah.

1330
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:46,060
All right.

1331
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:49,460
Well still jury's still out on who the Toes belongs to.

1332
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,760
Oh it's Elliot Spitzer.

1333
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,840
Elliot Spitzer was the Toes sucker.

1334
01:03:55,180 --> 01:04:00,840
Liz Smith was the Democratic consultant that the Toes belonged to.

1335
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,660
And this is all public.

1336
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:03,060
This is in the site source.

1337
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,220
Well it's in your post.

1338
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:07,260
So you know take it with a grain of salt.

1339
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:14,880
But Liz Smith pops up every now and then on Twitter and has some of the worst takes you've ever seen.

1340
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:17,360
And then no one thinks about her for six more months.

1341
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:17,880
OK.

1342
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,160
Well you're keeping her name alive.

1343
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,220
That's right.

1344
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:22,140
And the Toes are alive.

1345
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:24,440
Zariah Dukkow whatever her name was.

1346
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,180
Zinni Amuka.

1347
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:26,240
Zinni Amuka.

1348
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,180
That almost rhymed with what it is.

1349
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,320
I think the worst.

1350
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:31,720
I don't know.

1351
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:37,700
I kind of like you know what it reminds me of like John Forsythe and those universal things kind of like fuddy duddy old guy.

1352
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:43,080
I kind of like in a way when he says again we've done two rounds of this if not more.

1353
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,380
I'm an actor not a character.

1354
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,220
And then then it gets to this line.

1355
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:52,460
It's useless to try to convince you that I am an actor.

1356
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:57,400
I am John Engel and I just play the role of Edward Quartermaine.

1357
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,260
It's useless to try to convince you.

1358
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:07,640
There's also a moment where one of the actresses says like I heard the food is fabulous.

1359
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:14,740
And I'm like that is the only positive thing I have ever heard about the food at Soap Opera Cafe.

1360
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:22,440
This really shows you the stretch that it was because like also when he walks in and he's like wow it's the Chandler Mee.

1361
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,840
It's the mansion set from All My Children.

1362
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,740
It's Telly's from General Hospital.

1363
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:31,000
One Life to Live's Landview Country Club.

1364
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:35,920
So where we're I mean the only way they could possibly play this is by having a character who's insane.

1365
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:40,920
We're now painting only a demented security guard.

1366
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:46,780
Maybe he works just like graveyard shift and gets tapes of these.

1367
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:47,600
I don't know.

1368
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,480
Why else would you know every ABC soap opera?

1369
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,360
No one likes all of them.

1370
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,600
Maybe like one of them.

1371
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,920
Yeah there's favorites.

1372
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,320
There's tribalism in your soap opera fandom.

1373
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:04,280
Shout out to Brad Sherwood though in this special has to do a lot of physical stuff.

1374
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:07,920
Like is running around jumping around.

1375
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:10,580
It's a real John Wick.

1376
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,520
Yeah it's a real John Wick.

1377
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,920
Yeah because of the Grizzly Challenge Trails.

1378
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,800
He's doing parkour.

1379
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,720
Running around in a tire.

1380
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:26,120
There's a good bit of physical comedy where he's got like the arm full of like souvenirs or carnival prizes at the end and he keeps dropping them and trying to pick up.

1381
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:28,950
Must Wicked Kind do a little physical at the end too.

1382
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:39,340
Somebody needed to direct someone down in this.

1383
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:44,960
Everybody's just like making faces and rolling their eyes and shaking their heads.

1384
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,600
And yeah one person needed to be less.

1385
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:56,680
Well and they missed a golden opportunity with that Grizzly Peak Challenge Trail to have Richard Kine caught in a rope ladder or big net.

1386
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,420
I feel like that's pretty good.

1387
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,140
Wouldn't you want that?

1388
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,860
Wouldn't you want to see him miserable in a big net?

1389
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:07,680
Do they have a big net there?

1390
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,720
Yeah they got everything.

1391
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:10,660
Yeah I don't know.

1392
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,800
Yeah you can stage somebody being stuck in the net.

1393
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:17,220
We can get tangled in the net.

1394
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:20,420
Or they get hurled off those sliding tire things.

1395
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:21,780
Yeah that's true.

1396
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,860
Those death trap sliding tire things.

1397
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,060
Yeah I'm all tangled up.

1398
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:29,800
Not even a suitcase full of a million dollars would help me now.

1399
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:34,140
Yeah there's so many antics.

1400
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:40,360
The antics really are doing the heavy lifting in the show I feel like.

1401
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:44,920
But it's not enough to, then you're not getting anything like good enough to, it doesn't distract you enough from it.

1402
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,140
They don't have a lot to show.

1403
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:48,780
And here's something that occurred to me deep into the special.

1404
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:55,040
Is that we clear out the Hollywood area with like a ton of so much soap, so much animation.

1405
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,660
You know what you don't see one second of?

1406
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:58,900
Superstar limo.

1407
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,120
That's a very good point.

1408
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:01,460
That's how bad it was.

1409
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,280
In a special where they got nothing.

1410
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,140
They got nothing to show you.

1411
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,760
They skip a ride.

1412
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,600
That's how bad, they knew we could not.

1413
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,340
They already were ahead of it.

1414
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,500
Like this thing, we are going to open.

1415
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:17,440
Maybe it is going to open because we need to have people go somewhere.

1416
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,620
If we are not going to tell anyone that it's there, we're not going to tell anyone to go there.

1417
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:23,780
Maybe they'll get lost and never end up there.

1418
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:25,060
It's in the corner of the park.

1419
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,020
That's our hope.

1420
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:29,540
Maybe we'll put trees in front of it and no one will know there's a ride.

1421
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:37,220
There is a simple animatronic of Drew Carey, then the star of one of ABC's most popular shows.

1422
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:41,660
Well there's other Regis, other people that were involved in the promotion to do.

1423
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:47,960
We got so much soap opera cross promotion and no primetime superstar.

1424
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,400
The wife of eventual suitcase recipient, Randy Kirkpatrick.

1425
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:52,420
Yeah.

1426
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,700
Do you think they shot it?

1427
01:08:56,660 --> 01:09:00,620
And that the footage made it look so bad.

1428
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:03,000
It was such a dark carnival.

1429
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:07,440
Zooming in and out of fisheye lens of a grotesque Jackie Chan.

1430
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:13,540
Because you would think they would be like, well we have to at least shoot some of it and we'll dress it up a little bit

1431
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:17,440
and we'll still say, oh there's another ride you can go on and get good shots of everything.

1432
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:21,400
And then they looked at the footage and they were like, this looks like a fucking nightmare.

1433
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,180
We cannot put it in here.

1434
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,340
So that's why we're going to do a lot more of the animation wall.

1435
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:32,980
Can you call Wow and Flutter, can they give us a song to just cover a full minute of stock footage?

1436
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:34,460
We are now padding.

1437
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,920
We are at the padding point.

1438
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:42,480
And can we get the voiceover guy to remind people of what the story is at every act end and beginning?

1439
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:42,780
Right.

1440
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,400
That will kill a lot of time as well.

1441
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:49,260
That is like when I edited on a clip show or people would get into sport related accidents

1442
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:55,140
and you would have like there would be a recap at the start of every like commercial break that ended

1443
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:58,780
and it would recap what happened last break or last segment.

1444
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:03,620
And there was no reason for it, but it would just be an extra minute or two that it would eat up.

1445
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:06,420
So you wouldn't need as many clips going forward on the show.

1446
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,420
Apparoles of streaming.

1447
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:11,260
You can't kill time the way you used to be able to.

1448
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:14,580
People need to like come back from commercial.

1449
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:17,940
We can like lull people in with a minute of fucking crap.

1450
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:23,180
What am I watching now?

1451
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,960
Have you considered the option of HBO streaming with ads?

1452
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,160
Oh, yes.

1453
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:30,100
Everything's got ads.

1454
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:30,840
Ads is back.

1455
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,480
Ads are back.

1456
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,820
Ads are everywhere.

1457
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,320
Even Prime Video, owned by Amazon, are like, yeah, well, hey, brother.

1458
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:43,800
Ads are back.

1459
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:47,300
We got some ads now, but you can give us three more dollars, mom.

1460
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:51,660
We broke the industry to realize that it needed to go back to the way it was.

1461
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:53,000
But not pay anybody.

1462
01:10:53,160 --> 01:11:00,740
I do think, superstar limo, you look at the photos that exist online that are so terrifying and shitty looking.

1463
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:05,220
Imagine what, like, I guess low definition is actually better.

1464
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,640
And then I was going to say, imagine what it looks like in this low definition recite.

1465
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:11,920
But actually, it probably looks better than high def.

1466
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,120
Oh, yeah.

1467
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:14,440
You have timed it.

1468
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:14,980
Yeah.

1469
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:15,640
Yeah.

1470
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,160
As opposed to camcorder.

1471
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:17,560
Yeah.

1472
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:23,600
Still, they tried to film in there and Barry Buswick's projectile vomited onto Regis's face.

1473
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:28,060
It flashed me back to my clown days.

1474
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:31,680
Everyone, they're freaking me out.

1475
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:32,360
They're clowns all around me.

1476
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:35,220
So no superstar limo.

1477
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:40,380
But you go over to, we've been told that there's three themed lands, but then you go to Condor Flats.

1478
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:41,200
You're like, what's that?

1479
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,340
I don't know, not a land?

1480
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,620
No, it's a mini, it's within.

1481
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:48,240
It's golden California or something.

1482
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:50,100
And then in it is Condor Flats.

1483
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:52,040
I'm so glad they got rid of Condor Flats.

1484
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:55,240
But the, here, really some of the meat of it.

1485
01:11:55,240 --> 01:12:07,900
You get extra, Patrick Warburton, your chief flight attendant, which reveals, you see him outside of the ride and then he takes them through the, they try to convince you that the queue is something good.

1486
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:09,680
Like it's the hall of aviation.

1487
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:15,740
Well, they stretch that a lot too, where they really like, they give you a little of the queue in this special.

1488
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:16,740
The spirit of St.

1489
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:17,120
Louis?

1490
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:18,300
That's right.

1491
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:18,700
Bill?

1492
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,140
In California.

1493
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:22,440
Patrick, could you try that one more time?

1494
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:23,380
A little slower.

1495
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:26,440
Okay, we lost a whole ride that we can't show.

1496
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:30,120
Whoa, did they recreate a replica of the spirit of St.

1497
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:30,300
Louis?

1498
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:34,240
Well, no, we have a 12 by 19 black and white print.

1499
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,100
We got a framed photo.

1500
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,660
We got a lot of photos.

1501
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,380
Yeah, well, what are the artifacts you have?

1502
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:43,540
Well, we have sentences on the wall.

1503
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,640
There are sentences that you can read, which no one will.

1504
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:48,720
No one cares.

1505
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,920
No one who will ever go on this ride will ever read the sentences.

1506
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:56,340
You can imagine how bored you'd have to be to read the sentences.

1507
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,160
I really like his delivery.

1508
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:04,500
I feel like he gets like, you know, something where the sense of humor is like dialed up and broader than broad.

1509
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:08,680
He does kind of a light, I like his thing, the, well, I hate to brag.

1510
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,980
I say I hate to brag.

1511
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,340
But I, that's all right.

1512
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:13,000
That's good.

1513
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,680
That's him being actually funny.

1514
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:15,500
Yeah.

1515
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,380
And it's great.

1516
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:22,380
Just seeing this going, OK, there's a little more worlds for pre-show videos.

1517
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,580
You know, you don't get that a lot.

1518
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:29,220
So just going, oh, there's ancillary material for the pre-show ride that we like.

1519
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:33,180
It's akin to seeing Rex go off and do something else.

1520
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:39,080
For example, he calls everything a little beauty.

1521
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:39,740
Exactly.

1522
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,000
He says it again.

1523
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:43,040
That is just a thing he says.

1524
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,140
Something else is a little baby.

1525
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:52,400
He's a hardened, just planes on the brain.

1526
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,400
That's what I am.

1527
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:54,560
But I got a sensitive side.

1528
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,780
I call things little beauties.

1529
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:58,120
How much improv do you think is in this special?

1530
01:13:58,380 --> 01:13:59,420
Oh, maybe entirely.

1531
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,160
Maybe that was the design.

1532
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:01,980
I wonder if you can even realize that.

1533
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:03,960
Maybe the Hussle guys weren't hired until the day before.

1534
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:04,620
Yeah.

1535
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,480
So I wonder if that's the thing Patrick says.

1536
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,280
He calls things little beauties.

1537
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:08,900
Maybe.

1538
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:12,980
I don't know.

1539
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,080
Yeah, I wonder.

1540
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,440
It's one of his little ticks.

1541
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:21,840
There's a, in the animation workshop set, there's a Richard Kine moment I like a lot

1542
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,540
where the person working there goes, well, you seem very animated.

1543
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,280
And Richard Kine, it cuts to him.

1544
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,180
And he's like, yes, I've been told that before.

1545
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,740
Like he just stone-faced.

1546
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,020
And I'm like, yeah, it's pretty good.

1547
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,920
That's a solid reaction shot.

1548
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:39,340
Do we go by the part of, I want to go back to this one second.

1549
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:44,460
But do we go by the part where they draw Mushu mashup with Richard Kine?

1550
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:49,100
The Eddie Murphy dragon Mushu from Mulan is mashed up with Richard Kine.

1551
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:50,920
I can't be mad at that.

1552
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,400
We should post that.

1553
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,020
Just a screenshot of that.

1554
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:55,380
And Mushu is mad.

1555
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:59,080
An animator draws that mashup of the two characters.

1556
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,300
The two, one real man and dragon.

1557
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:05,580
What a funny, you know, and you didn't even need AI to do it.

1558
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,140
I was going to say though, what of, I guess Rex is the answer.

1559
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:12,020
Like what other pre-show video do you want to see a little more?

1560
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:12,940
Is it Dr.

1561
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:13,460
Seeker?

1562
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:14,860
Is it Grace?

1563
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:15,700
Is it Dr.

1564
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:16,220
Ogden?

1565
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,020
Is it like, what else do you want?

1566
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,120
Who do you want to see?

1567
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,260
They feel kind of covered to me.

1568
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,500
I feel like I get their vibe.

1569
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,920
I'd like to see some more Dr.

1570
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,360
Seeker hijinks, I guess.

1571
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:31,280
Watch them like try to steal candy from the vending machine at Dino Institute.

1572
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:37,100
I'm going to see if Chairman Clinch survived that hostile alien planet he got teleported to.

1573
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,180
Do we want to really see that?

1574
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:41,720
Yeah, we'll see him suffer.

1575
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:46,540
I mean, you know, probably suffer in the long term.

1576
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:48,760
He exploded into 700 pieces.

1577
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:50,840
Died on the way back to his home planet.

1578
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:51,640
Gotcha.

1579
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:55,380
I mean, I would like to see one of the ET Adventure intro.

1580
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,560
My answer for everything will always be ET Adventure.

1581
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:58,860
Well, we want to see more of Steven.

1582
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:00,660
Of course, yeah, more Steven and more ET.

1583
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:03,360
And in the first one they ever did, they were in a movie theater.

1584
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:10,980
And it ends on a big triumphant note where ET says, be good actors and music fanfare closes out.

1585
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:16,840
But I would like to see that then you cut wide and like, well, let's go home, ET.

1586
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:21,520
And then the two of them, Spielberg and ET just slowly shuffle down the row.

1587
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:26,180
You watch them just leave a narrow movie theater row.

1588
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:30,220
It takes them seven minutes to get up the real time.

1589
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,920
Do you want to stop for a bite?

1590
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,240
Well, no, Kate was making chili tonight.

1591
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:37,880
So we're going home.

1592
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:44,360
ET not invited.

1593
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:50,780
You live in the shed, so I guess you're invited.

1594
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,160
You're never not invited.

1595
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:53,840
You can come in.

1596
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:54,960
Just tap on the glass.

1597
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:57,240
Your finger.

1598
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:04,940
Then, oh, I also like that there's a real stretch of a line that we're in.

1599
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:07,640
But wait, we can't go to all those places.

1600
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,440
The big cheese.

1601
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:09,740
Do we have to be with a big cheese?

1602
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:14,400
I don't think the big cheese.

1603
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:19,060
Like air quotes that are so big they make a thud sound.

1604
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:20,760
We're wide here, miss.

1605
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,500
Then you see scenes from Soarin' Over California out of order.

1606
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:26,840
Yeah, yeah.

1607
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,780
Why would, why?

1608
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:31,900
They make it look like snow lands on you, which it does not.

1609
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,940
So Extra World, that's great.

1610
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:41,820
Then you go to commercial, then you come back and the narrator, this is the, of all the lies that are told in this special, this is the most egregious.

1611
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:48,380
They're about to go to one of the most beautiful areas of the park, Bountiful Valley Farm.

1612
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:52,440
And then they show a beauty shot of a bunch of bread.

1613
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,880
Yeah, I think.

1614
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:55,800
I guess so.

1615
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:56,900
Glistening bread.

1616
01:17:57,060 --> 01:17:58,440
Am I wrong or was it like a fruit?

1617
01:17:58,680 --> 01:17:59,280
Could be.

1618
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:00,000
I don't remember.

1619
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:00,840
I think it was bread.

1620
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:05,820
You hear what they say, the big cheese thing to a farmer woman and she's like, well, you came to the right place.

1621
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:07,500
California has many varieties.

1622
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:17,160
At least, even Epcot, look, I'm not a big fan of living in the land, but at least I'm like, they actually grow stuff there.

1623
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:21,420
And so you, it is educational and you, they aren't making anything in this place.

1624
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,660
They're making the bread that they give you right after you get it.

1625
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:27,620
They're not growing cheese at the farm.

1626
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:29,080
No, they're not growing cheese for sure.

1627
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:35,360
This is another time recently where I provoked, like, what are you talking about?

1628
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:39,420
When I started saying like, oh yeah, well, it's Venger's campus.

1629
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:40,940
And before that it was Bugsland.

1630
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:42,600
Before that it was Bountiful Valley Farm.

1631
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:45,840
And Jane's like, what is Bountiful Valley Farm?

1632
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:49,420
And I'm like, oh, it was like tractors you could climb.

1633
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,140
They didn't work or do anything.

1634
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,680
I'm just trying to clarify this.

1635
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,640
My son would like that now.

1636
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,920
I will give them credit.

1637
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:57,940
They would like that.

1638
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:05,340
We would have been there for an hour when we were there the other day, but that's a low, like, a bar should be higher than three year olds.

1639
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,860
You could buy seeds.

1640
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,800
I guess you can buy seeds at Grizzly Peak Airfield now.

1641
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:11,900
Can you buy seeds?

1642
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:15,780
For a while you could buy like a pack of seeds at Grizzly Peak Airfield.

1643
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:16,100
Really?

1644
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:16,980
For what?

1645
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:17,700
What kind of things would you plant?

1646
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:19,840
Like California plants, I think.

1647
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,980
Wow, we need to buy seeds in the sea.

1648
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:25,160
Jason, you need to buy the most marked up seeds on the planet.

1649
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:29,200
We missed buying like a potted plant at the land.

1650
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:29,580
Right.

1651
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:31,020
We walked right by it.

1652
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:34,520
It was at the kiosk that I always ignore when I get out the rock.

1653
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,280
You get an AP discount on seeds?

1654
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:37,840
I bet you do.

1655
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,400
I don't know why you wouldn't.

1656
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:42,340
Two cents goes to one.

1657
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:43,300
Yeah.

1658
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,660
Do you got this bread shot?

1659
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:45,920
I'm looking for the bread shot.

1660
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,680
They're in the Bantua Valley.

1661
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:49,320
Were you just hungry?

1662
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:51,020
I'm hungry right now.

1663
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:51,960
I'm just imagining it.

1664
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:52,500
Oh, geez.

1665
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:53,960
Let's keep going.

1666
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:55,520
Do you want the other hand of this cliff bar?

1667
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,500
I do not.

1668
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,780
You do not hallucinate a shot of bread.

1669
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:02,580
Listening bread.

1670
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,100
Where the fuck is this bread shot?

1671
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:04,700
Keep looking.

1672
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:05,500
We'll keep talking.

1673
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,420
You just say when you got it.

1674
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:10,980
They go into what is in Bantua Valley Farm.

1675
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:14,660
In the farm area, they have the movie, It's Tough to Be a Bug.

1676
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,560
That's what I forget is that Bugs Land came later.

1677
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:18,700
I totally forgot that.

1678
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:21,960
They had the bug movie, but in the farm area because bugs would be in a farm.

1679
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,980
And the other part, bugs are in a tree.

1680
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,180
Boy, this is confusing.

1681
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:28,700
But they go in and who do we meet?

1682
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:29,960
But Mr.

1683
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,040
Hug himself, John Lester.

1684
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,560
John Lester gets a whole…

1685
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,140
Lots of Hug and John.

1686
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:37,920
And then gets an entire scene to ham it up.

1687
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,540
And this is really where it gets ridiculous, where you've been following two guys in four Excel shirts.

1688
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:45,440
And then they walk in and find another one.

1689
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:46,080
Like when…

1690
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:47,700
This is a real…

1691
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,420
This is three Spider-Men pointing at each other.

1692
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:53,280
Everyone's dressed the exact same.

1693
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:54,540
You know what's funny?

1694
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:56,320
I think I'm looking at oranges.

1695
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:57,960
I think I looked away.

1696
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,340
I think I thought this was bread.

1697
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:00,300
Thought oranges were bread.

1698
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:01,360
But I believe it's oranges.

1699
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:02,940
Oh.

1700
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:04,580
It does kind of look like…

1701
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:11,080
It looks like in a fast food commercial where they're showing a shot of subway bread.

1702
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:11,980
I got you.

1703
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:12,600
It's oranges though.

1704
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:16,260
Unless this is a real dress scenario.

1705
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:17,360
Look at this photo.

1706
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:18,180
What do you see?

1707
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,060
Glistening bread or glistening oranges?

1708
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:22,900
Those are two.

1709
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,020
Those are the primary.

1710
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:27,660
Bread and oranges are the main characters you would meet at DCA 1.

1711
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:27,920
0.

1712
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:28,660
That's true, yes.

1713
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:31,020
You wouldn't see the real, the characters we like.

1714
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:33,200
And a cardboard cutout of Robert Mondavi.

1715
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:37,120
When bankruptcy was declared, that was the first thing to go.

1716
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:37,600
Get it out.

1717
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:38,400
Grind it up.

1718
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:40,840
This is John Lasseter.

1719
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:42,140
He was my director.

1720
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,320
And Richard was great.

1721
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:46,440
He was amazing.

1722
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:47,740
Everyone's screaming.

1723
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,900
The Lasseter arm flap.

1724
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:52,380
Wow.

1725
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:53,620
Barry Bostwick.

1726
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,380
He just goes really method with how moved he is to meet Barry Bostwick.

1727
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:02,180
I think Barry Bostwick was in a well regarded George Washington miniseries or something.

1728
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:03,260
Is that what it was supposed to be?

1729
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:06,060
I've never seen what Barry Bostwick's good in.

1730
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,440
Maybe Rocky Horror.

1731
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:08,280
I don't know.

1732
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:10,780
That's fine.

1733
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:15,480
But I feel like they were pushing him in a lot of these kind of things.

1734
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:17,360
I'm like, he's just this hammy guy.

1735
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:18,920
I don't want to be proud of this guy.

1736
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,260
But Lasseter acts like he's meeting the Queen.

1737
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:24,480
It's like, Barry Bostwick.

1738
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,140
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1739
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:27,160
I'm a big fan.

1740
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,760
He's like shaking almost.

1741
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:33,240
Then you watch these three pasty guys in giant shirts and circus tents.

1742
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,100
That's why the circus tent was at the beginning.

1743
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,020
And the sound guy in the corner.

1744
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,080
Yeah, they got to Dave and I.

1745
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,260
Then a quick shot of Dave.

1746
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:40,600
Dave.

1747
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:41,500
Dave.

1748
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:44,640
They promote an old movie.

1749
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,520
You get to be a bug.

1750
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:49,860
Yeah, I know this has been out for a long time.

1751
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:53,040
And then here's really the…

1752
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:57,220
This is really the part to know.

1753
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,040
They ask, what's the quickest way to get out of here?

1754
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,760
And then Lasseter does a like eyebrow.

1755
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:08,280
He does the kind of thing like Tim Kallpakas is really good at with like nine layers of irony.

1756
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:11,340
But Lasseter does it for real.

1757
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,380
And like, hmm, guess what I'm going to do.

1758
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:18,000
And then a spider comes down.

1759
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:18,900
They are scared.

1760
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:22,380
And then they scream and then he, you'll hear it.

1761
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:33,200
A big echoey Lasseter laugh, which I took the liberty of looping on QuickTime player.

1762
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:46,420
That plays in the minds of many former female employees at Pixar.

1763
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:48,560
The Walt Disney Company.

1764
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:53,200
It doesn't play in the restaurant in the lamp light.

1765
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:54,880
Lamp light.

1766
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:55,240
The lounge.

1767
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:56,760
I always forget.

1768
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:57,840
It's not lamp lighter.

1769
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,540
That is what Lin-Manuel is.

1770
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:01,760
He's a lamp lighter.

1771
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:07,000
He has a different job than chimney sweep.

1772
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:07,980
Not chimney sweep.

1773
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:09,420
No, he's a lamp lighter.

1774
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:10,280
He's a lamp lighter.

1775
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:13,940
I'm going to veer this car before we get into turning turtle land.

1776
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:16,060
So I'm going to turn away from turning turtle.

1777
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:24,380
So security, you guys do Topsy Talk with a spin-off podcast on your own time.

1778
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:28,940
This line is so bizarre.

1779
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:30,400
Am I hallucinating this?

1780
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,700
No, I don't think, no, I think this is real.

1781
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:41,800
Our security guards won't be able to track anyone down as Barry and Richard screams get lost in the excitement of Paradise Pier.

1782
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,080
Yes, that is, I guess clocked as well.

1783
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:55,660
Our security guards, the screams of fun-filled coaster riders will blend in with possibly abducted children or people in real trouble.

1784
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,580
They won't be able to, it'll be a fog of screams in which many will die.

1785
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,380
A cacophony of screams will be confused.

1786
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:05,060
Which for pleasure and which for pain.

1787
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:08,460
That's why they close that back entrance to Paradise Pier.

1788
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,160
You know, the security just going to be dragged of it.

1789
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:12,240
Because of all the screams.

1790
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:13,220
Because of all the screams.

1791
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,780
They'll be haunted by those screams until they die.

1792
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:19,080
Then you get a full ride through of California screaming.

1793
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,640
They think it's a shuttle or something.

1794
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,700
I think, hey, boy, we're almost to the end, I think.

1795
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:23,020
Oh, that's good.

1796
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:23,700
And they're scared.

1797
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:25,280
They're special, yeah.

1798
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:25,840
Yeah, hey.

1799
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:27,340
As I was scrolling through, like, oh, good.

1800
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:28,720
The special's almost over.

1801
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:29,240
Hey, yeah, yeah.

1802
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:29,620
I know.

1803
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:32,160
I was like, oh, wait, it's not an hour hour.

1804
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,300
It's like a 42-minute hour.

1805
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:34,520
So that implies commercials.

1806
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,680
This is a clue.

1807
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:39,040
So wait, because Disney Channel was paid.

1808
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:39,480
Yeah.

1809
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:41,320
But this must be post the era.

1810
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:43,380
It did become like a channel with commercials.

1811
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:47,120
Well, they would have commercials for Disney products.

1812
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:48,220
Oh, you're right.

1813
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:49,000
OK, OK.

1814
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:52,440
But nothing else because children might be watching.

1815
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:53,480
Yes, true.

1816
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,900
So well, hey, we made it to Eisner.

1817
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:57,540
We get to Eisner.

1818
01:25:57,740 --> 01:26:02,260
Ultimately, they find the big cheese, or so they think.

1819
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,160
Listeners, get all your guesses ready in your head.

1820
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,200
Who might that big cheese be?

1821
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,880
And then we get a little, Eisner's

1822
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:11,780
talking to a group of people.

1823
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,420
He's like, I think it's going to be great.

1824
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:14,800
He mutters something.

1825
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:16,820
And that's going to be great.

1826
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:19,700
They show that he's a nice guy because he insists that they

1827
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:21,120
call him Michael or not.

1828
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:22,800
That's a little touch.

1829
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:23,580
Had to get that in there.

1830
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:25,700
Little CEO, relatable guy, right?

1831
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,680
Yeah, because he's not relatable at all.

1832
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:30,780
He's barely human.

1833
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:31,560
Yeah, yes.

1834
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:32,360
Please come on the show.

1835
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:32,720
No, no.

1836
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:33,300
Yeah, yeah.

1837
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:37,100
So we were told to meet the big cheese.

1838
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,460
I'll just play the clip.

1839
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:42,060
Yeah, we were told to meet the big cheese at the Disneyland

1840
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:43,260
Resort.

1841
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:44,500
The big cheese?

1842
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:45,100
I'm not the big cheese.

1843
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:45,960
I wish I was the big cheese.

1844
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,340
This is the big cheese.

1845
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:49,620
Oh.

1846
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:51,320
Hiya, fellas.

1847
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,800
Gee, I've been looking for you all day.

1848
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:55,200
I'm sorry, Vicki.

1849
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,220
You wanted to see us for some reason?

1850
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,720
Well, I want to give you a personal tour of Disney's

1851
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:01,800
California Adventure.

1852
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:05,980
Oh, what do you say we start with a ride on California

1853
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:06,760
Screaming?

1854
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:08,960
Here we go.

1855
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,120
They both tip.

1856
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,140
They fall backwards.

1857
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:12,080
They've passed out because…

1858
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:14,040
I like that the legs come up.

1859
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,160
Yeah, the legs come up.

1860
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:18,060
This is after, by the way, Richard Kine.

1861
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:20,680
It's like, please, I just want to sit down.

1862
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:22,660
We've done so much.

1863
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,340
We've done stuff all day.

1864
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:24,700
And I'm like…

1865
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:26,080
A big full day.

1866
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:29,220
Certainly some college friends won't get through all of

1867
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:30,240
this in 90 minutes.

1868
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:37,080
Really, you have to use your imagination because Mickey

1869
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,960
would easily find them in the park, I feel.

1870
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:39,960
You know?

1871
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:40,860
There's nobody there.

1872
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:41,840
No one's there.

1873
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:42,920
It's empty.

1874
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,080
There's not much to do.

1875
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:45,840
They're in the biggest shirts.

1876
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:48,500
Beat the cat.

1877
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,220
Richard Kine is very loud.

1878
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,180
There's just no way.

1879
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:53,140
Wait, yeah.

1880
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:55,940
These two are screaming at each other all day.

1881
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:58,300
Other guys who are trying to find them are screaming at

1882
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:59,200
each other too.

1883
01:27:59,200 --> 01:27:59,660
Yeah.

1884
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,140
There's nowhere, there's nothing to do.

1885
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,520
Just plant yourself on a bench and you'll find they'll

1886
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,860
wander by within an hour.

1887
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:05,180
Yeah.

1888
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:09,380
Disney handlers very rarely let VIPs out of sight.

1889
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:10,600
Yeah.

1890
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:12,160
He had meetings maybe.

1891
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,360
Like, oh, Montavi's trying to bail already.

1892
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:17,800
Let's kneecap him.

1893
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:18,340
Who cares?

1894
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:20,180
They don't care what wine they're drinking.

1895
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,320
Montavi's crap.

1896
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:25,420
I'm sorry, it was stripping copper wire from rocket runs.

1897
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:29,400
What is this shit?

1898
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:31,260
B-roll from Superstar Limo?

1899
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:32,840
Oh, fuck.

1900
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:34,540
We're not going to be able to use this.

1901
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:37,320
How much did the Diasaur movie cost?

1902
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:38,660
Fuck me, run.

1903
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,420
God damn it.

1904
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:45,000
You scared the shit out of me.

1905
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,320
I haven't slept in months.

1906
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,340
What is this fucking B-roll?

1907
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:50,460
Is this bread?

1908
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,780
Does this look like bread?

1909
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:52,860
This is fucking oranges.

1910
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:56,720
We got to tell Reeves we got to run this in car correct.

1911
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:58,940
If it's an orange color, an orange.

1912
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:00,320
If it's bread color, brown.

1913
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:01,160
It's simple as that.

1914
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,820
It's got to be orange like Garfield.

1915
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:05,560
It's got to be Garfield orange to read.

1916
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:08,420
Can't be this middle of the road shit.

1917
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:09,640
Did we buy that yet?

1918
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:10,780
Buy Garfield.

1919
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:11,560
Figure it out.

1920
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:13,460
Michael's got to give me.

1921
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:14,000
I want that.

1922
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:15,460
Why don't I own that?

1923
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:18,300
Fuck, forget the Muppets, Michael.

1924
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,080
Talk to Jim Davis.

1925
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:22,000
That shit should be sealed.

1926
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,160
Mickey, we just bought the Family Channel.

1927
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:26,200
I don't know if we can buy anything else.

1928
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:29,000
I need an orange cat.

1929
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:33,680
Figure out how to get the fucking 700 Club off the Tempium Slat.

1930
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:37,120
What do you mean they have a lifetime contract?

1931
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:38,100
That's insane.

1932
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:39,700
I bought the whole channel.

1933
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,000
That means every time.

1934
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:42,580
Don't they know God is dead?

1935
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:43,660
I'm their God.

1936
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:49,540
Mickey was, he's wearing a hat as well.

1937
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:51,360
He's wearing like a baseball hat.

1938
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:55,720
There was this premise that the characters are on vacation, and that's what we're dealing with at the moment.

1939
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:56,280
Right.

1940
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:57,140
That's a bad price.

1941
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:00,000
Look, that is how I dress when I'm in the theme parks.

1942
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:01,980
You're not Mickey Mouse.

1943
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:04,140
You're not Mickey Mouse.

1944
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:07,340
I'm just saying Mickey should be wearing a more fun outfit than that.

1945
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:08,820
That's what I'm saying.

1946
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:10,860
Maybe he's having fun wearing it.

1947
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:11,760
He's relaxed.

1948
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:15,820
He's wearing it for the same reasons as Barry and Richard.

1949
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,700
It breathes if it's a hot day.

1950
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:19,420
That's true.

1951
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:23,160
If it's wet, you can just wring it out like a towel.

1952
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:24,760
Plenty of fabric.

1953
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:28,580
Just kind of like edge into a different part of the shirt and you won't be wet anymore.

1954
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:32,940
Can we start a rumor that the original version of California Adventure had a bowling alley?

1955
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:36,660
No, not Splitsville.

1956
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:38,100
A different bowling alley.

1957
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,120
That feels right.

1958
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:42,400
Over in Hollywood area, there was a bowling alley.

1959
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:44,620
It was called Hollywood Bowl Wink Wink.

1960
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:47,340
I was about to say what it would be called.

1961
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:48,960
It's so perfect and annoying.

1962
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,580
Just there was a bowling alley and you had to pay.

1963
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:51,620
Hollywood Bowl.

1964
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:52,800
It was an upcharge.

1965
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:53,860
You'd have to pay.

1966
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:56,040
But there was a full, there were 20 lanes.

1967
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:56,780
Yeah.

1968
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,460
And there was an intro video.

1969
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:09,240
It's all these bad, it's the bowling graphics, but all the pins look like starlets on a red carpet.

1970
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:09,660
Yeah.

1971
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,040
They love shit like that.

1972
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:15,980
There's so much shit like that with the 1930s, generic 1930s actress.

1973
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1974
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:23,140
So the Hollywood Bowl, somebody, one of our listeners could just add it to the Disney's California Adventure Wikipedia.

1975
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:31,660
And then the ball, this might not be on brand for them, but the ball is like fatty Arbuckle rolling down the stairs and crashing into the…

1976
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:34,360
On the actual screens?

1977
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:34,880
Yeah, yeah.

1978
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:35,440
Okay, okay.

1979
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,140
Yeah, it's a tribute to classic Hollywood.

1980
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:37,380
Okay.

1981
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:38,560
Yeah, yeah, good, good.

1982
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:45,060
Also, can we just, let's just do an imitation here.

1983
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:50,920
Let's all, you know, away from Mike, away from the microphones rather, but the, of the reveal.

1984
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:53,440
I'm not the big, I wish I was the big cheese, I'm not the big cheese.

1985
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:57,520
Let's just do Barry and Richard's reaction to who is the big cheese.

1986
01:31:58,040 --> 01:31:59,620
Like, this is the big cheese.

1987
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:01,600
Oh!

1988
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:05,880
Like, and then Richard kind of is like frozen.

1989
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:12,620
He's like, ah, like he's got a big smile on his face, but he also looks kind of scared or shocked as well.

1990
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,680
I don't think we had a lot of take twos in this thing.

1991
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:19,300
Yeah, and he's just like, like incredulous that Mickey's here.

1992
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:24,280
Well, he thought it would be animated and post and he's like, why isn't one of the ones from the park?

1993
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:27,240
Yeah, you're saying he was thrown off by that.

1994
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:27,860
Yeah, yeah.

1995
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:29,940
He's a cartoon character, but he's alive.

1996
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:30,840
I thought he was a word.

1997
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:41,320
So they faint and then they, and then you just have reaction shots of Eisner and Mickey watching security guard jokes for a while.

1998
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:41,820
Yeah.

1999
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:46,380
A lot of Eisner just rolling his eyes and what?

2000
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:47,480
What's this?

2001
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:50,100
Can I say I think Eisner's acting is actually okay here?

2002
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:50,580
Yeah.

2003
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:52,720
When you go, I don't think you got to watch these reaction shots.

2004
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:56,540
Well, but I like the big, not the reaction, how much is a big cheese line, I guess.

2005
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:57,900
Where you go, it's not even natural.

2006
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:59,020
Like very natural.

2007
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:01,400
It was a Robert Altman style delivery.

2008
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:02,480
Yeah.

2009
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:03,920
Really sort of stream of consciousness.

2010
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:08,640
It's not a precise reading of the line, but it feels like a kid rolled off his head.

2011
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:12,820
There was a lot of people in, Mike Leiser might have been in shortcuts of such a big cast.

2012
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:14,500
Sure, he might have been.

2013
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:14,940
Hollywood inside.

2014
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,640
Oh, I was confusing that with a player, nevermind.

2015
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:20,400
Maybe he's just playing a part.

2016
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:23,880
Maybe he's the player, maybe he's an Imperial own companion, who knows?

2017
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:33,020
The for as big as the bowling shirts are, the inverse is the security guard outfits are so slim cut.

2018
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:36,300
Like they're so like wrapped in those things.

2019
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:40,480
Because they were just real out for they didn't know that there was no time for a fitting for Colin and Brad.

2020
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:41,200
No, for sure.

2021
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:43,680
Boy, I hope those improv guys are in doke-k shape.

2022
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:44,460
Ah crap.

2023
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:48,180
Why didn't anyone tell us no improv guys have ever been in good shape?

2024
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:48,700
That sentence.

2025
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:57,740
These outfits look better than the usual security guard of blousy white shirt and giant wide brimmed hat.

2026
01:33:58,720 --> 01:33:59,800
It's not the most intimidating.

2027
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:01,900
The wide brimmed hat.

2028
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:04,640
I'm trying to think of what a good what's the best example of that?

2029
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:06,860
Like the security guard with a big wide brimmed.

2030
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:09,240
No, I'm talking about the actual Disney security guards.

2031
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:10,140
Oh, you're talking about the real ones.

2032
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:10,940
I see.

2033
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:13,340
Well, some of them are.

2034
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:16,600
Let's ending here.

2035
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:17,900
The little walk away.

2036
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:19,300
The bizarre ending.

2037
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:20,680
Yeah, yeah.

2038
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:25,220
It's a, you know, it's a timeless timeless parody.

2039
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:30,800
So, Mickey, it's just you and me and I love that ride and I want to go on it with you.

2040
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:33,200
Okay, boss.

2041
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:34,200
Okay, boss.

2042
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:38,580
You know, Mickey, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful theme park.

2043
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:40,000
You betcha.

2044
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:47,880
Now that that statement is just funny to meditate on.

2045
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:59,220
I mean, it's very it's a real like, you know, sword you can wield against them in when the park was then it opened and did very bad for a few years.

2046
01:34:59,220 --> 01:34:59,560
Right.

2047
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:05,940
But now that I've had so many good times there, it's like it's it's my park.

2048
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:07,860
I just did a family vacation.

2049
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:09,360
We didn't feel like Park Hopper.

2050
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:10,520
We're like, we're going to choose one.

2051
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:11,780
We chose California Adventure.

2052
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:12,500
It's ours.

2053
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:14,500
I now I watch that.

2054
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,700
I get a little wistful.

2055
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:18,380
Was it a beautiful theme park at that moment?

2056
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:18,880
No.

2057
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,960
But is the statement technically correct?

2058
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:21,740
The statement is correct.

2059
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:24,080
The beginning of a beautiful theme park.

2060
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:25,980
Ultimately, I think it is true.

2061
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,820
As usual, Michael Eisner was correct.

2062
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:28,780
As always.

2063
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:30,880
He was never wrong.

2064
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:33,840
The nod to Casablanca at the end.

2065
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,220
Kind of confusing, but okay.

2066
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:39,740
I mean, yeah, it's a good Casablanca reference.

2067
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:40,680
Kind of a go to.

2068
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:48,220
After they shoot a Nazi and he throws a bottle of Vichy water in the trash to go like, traders, fuck you.

2069
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:51,480
And they walk away arm in arm down the airfield.

2070
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:53,560
I think this will be the start of a beautiful.

2071
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:55,180
That's him and Claude Reigns.

2072
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:55,900
Yes.

2073
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:58,480
Yes, because he said goodbye to Ingrid Bergman.

2074
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,760
She put her on the plane.

2075
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:00,160
Yeah.

2076
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:02,620
So, yes, they've parodied this.

2077
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:04,100
Save me from the Nazis, Michael.

2078
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:10,940
Yeah, they kill Richard Kind of Boswick and they shoot them both in the gut.

2079
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:12,460
Well, he shot security guards.

2080
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:13,540
Security guards.

2081
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:14,900
They both had.

2082
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:15,560
Eisner's neck.

2083
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:16,740
Please call me Michael.

2084
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,500
Guys, kill him.

2085
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:21,400
Tell them not to call me that.

2086
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,840
Spin City has been canceled.

2087
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:27,740
We're in the Sheen era Spin City here too.

2088
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,260
Oh my God, I forgot about the Sheen era.

2089
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:31,360
Was it still going or was it a cancel?

2090
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:34,200
I don't know when the trade off from Fox to Sheen happened.

2091
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,860
It's late 90s, I think.

2092
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:36,300
Really?

2093
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:37,020
I could be wrong.

2094
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:37,880
Only a few.

2095
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:39,000
I don't know.

2096
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:42,220
Just to confirm, you're saying Charlie Sheen took over?

2097
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:42,940
From Michael J.

2098
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:43,160
Fox.

2099
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:43,820
From Michael J.

2100
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:44,080
Fox.

2101
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:45,840
I totally forgot about that.

2102
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:51,460
Charlie Sheen on Two and a Half Men to tie it all together, maybe the last remaining bowling

2103
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:53,320
shirt sideburn guy on television.

2104
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:54,700
Yes.

2105
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:55,740
Very true.

2106
01:36:57,340 --> 01:37:00,740
Although, yeah, what's the anger management show?

2107
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,260
I feel like he was still wearing the same outfits.

2108
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:04,640
So that lasted.

2109
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:06,700
It made that look last a little longer.

2110
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:07,720
All right, Michael J.

2111
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:09,440
Fox 2001, he was done.

2112
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:10,180
No, wait.

2113
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:14,320
Charlie Sheen is listed from 2000 to 2002 and Michael J.

2114
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:17,140
Fox has listened to 96 to 2001.

2115
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:19,720
So it is around the era of the trade off.

2116
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:22,000
In the time of the, okay, okay.

2117
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:30,520
Oh, right.

2118
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:31,900
You remember?

2119
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:36,060
The writer of My Dad's Sperm.

2120
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:37,300
My Dad's Sperm.

2121
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:38,820
Well, how did it feel?

2122
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:43,740
Oh, and then you just watch aerial footage and then get more dubbed over security code.

2123
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:44,560
That's a 912.

2124
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:46,580
I thought that was a 394.

2125
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:48,420
Oh my god.

2126
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:52,060
It's not a special.

2127
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:53,300
It's a stretch shul.

2128
01:37:56,860 --> 01:37:58,340
Very good way to put it.

2129
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:05,060
Yeah, it is sadly one of my least favorite watches of any of these types of specials.

2130
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:07,300
Now, I agree, but we've watched worse things for the show.

2131
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:13,720
I think we've watched things that are better technically, but more boring.

2132
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:14,540
Yeah, for sure.

2133
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:15,740
This isn't boring.

2134
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:19,100
It gives you a headache, but it's not boring.

2135
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:21,640
Everything about it is unpleasant, but it's not boring.

2136
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:23,360
Yeah, and ultimately.

2137
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,560
Is Fuzzbucket better than this?

2138
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:26,440
Would you rather watch?

2139
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:27,800
Oh, I'd watch this above Fuzzbucket.

2140
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:29,020
Yeah, I would watch this above Fuzzbucket.

2141
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,480
Fuzzbucket's really in the bottom of the…

2142
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:32,780
I feel like maybe I've blocked out what is the worst thing we've…

2143
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:33,760
You know what?

2144
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:36,660
Fucking live action Aladdin.

2145
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:37,920
That is truly…

2146
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:40,660
I wouldn't say that.

2147
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:42,560
I forgot we saw that in theaters.

2148
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:42,840
We did.

2149
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,120
We did an episode of that.

2150
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:45,740
I hate live action Aladdin.

2151
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:50,820
And from what I've seen, I didn't watch the entire thing, but Haunted Mansion.

2152
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:51,420
Haunted Mansion.

2153
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:52,020
My god.

2154
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:52,500
I haven't started.

2155
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:53,180
I haven't tried.

2156
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:53,680
Fuck.

2157
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:54,480
Don't.

2158
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:55,420
Don't.

2159
01:38:55,600 --> 01:39:04,000
I really think that if the audience really wanted our doors pounded down to do an episode about that, it would have happened by now.

2160
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:08,280
It's such pain, and I don't think it would be a funny episode.

2161
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:10,200
It's brutal.

2162
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:11,220
Maybe not.

2163
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:16,060
I mean, would you rather do an episode on that, or would you rather watch more Father of the Pride?

2164
01:39:16,780 --> 01:39:17,000
Oh.

2165
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:18,760
I watched all of it.

2166
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:19,280
I know.

2167
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:20,300
What was wrong with you?

2168
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:20,980
What happened?

2169
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:24,900
Maybe your tolerance for early 2000s stuff is just higher.

2170
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:24,900
Oh, my?

2171
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:25,260
The Pride?

2172
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:25,840
Jason loves you.

2173
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,140
You were in such better spirits.

2174
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:28,960
It was crazy.

2175
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:30,820
That was your time.

2176
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:32,280
The glory days.

2177
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:36,520
Well, I found the DVD, and I was like, I just need…

2178
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:38,620
I think it was…

2179
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:41,040
Was it early pandemic, or was it pre-pandemic?

2180
01:39:41,620 --> 01:39:44,740
There was no way that would have happened pre-pandemic.

2181
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:51,660
The context was, now that we are fucked, we can do stuff like this.

2182
01:39:52,560 --> 01:40:00,440
The days have to pass somehow, and rather than reading names of the list of the dead, we can watch Father of the Pride.

2183
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:06,360
I think I got two-thirds through, and I was like, well, I may as well finish.

2184
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:07,280
I'll reprise the word.

2185
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:08,040
Maybe that's the worst.

2186
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:13,300
I remember that day so vividly, as far as how dark it felt.

2187
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:14,580
That day felt dark to me.

2188
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:16,080
It made me feel feverish.

2189
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:18,000
It made me feel like I had it.

2190
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:21,300
I felt hot and sweaty, and I never left the house.

2191
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:25,800
I was convinced I had early serious cold.

2192
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:41,220
I was starting to lose it because I forgot that in the past, they would often make a whole season of TV and just air it in any order at various times.

2193
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:42,580
That was the problem?

2194
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:43,500
Well, it's not…

2195
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:48,100
Not what was happening or what the characters were saying or how it looked or what they did?

2196
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:55,480
I'm saying, no, that was all bad already, but I was just trying to find a consistent episode numbering for my notes.

2197
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:58,780
And I'm like, why am I not finding the right one?

2198
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:02,360
I'm fucked if I don't number this right, the audience will tear me limb from limb.

2199
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,740
Well, because we divided it up.

2200
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:06,880
Oh, you tried to know which one to watch.

2201
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:15,860
Well, one day we'll rank what maybe our most unpleasant watches were.

2202
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:17,140
Yeah, I don't…

2203
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:20,160
Have we maybe blocked out whatever the actual answer is?

2204
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:24,880
I think it's Father of the Pride.

2205
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,020
For the two of us, Jason…

2206
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:28,120
I think it's Father of the Pride.

2207
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:28,700
Jason liked it.

2208
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:30,240
Let's be honest, you're pretending.

2209
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:31,120
You liked it.

2210
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:32,400
Well, I liked it.

2211
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:35,320
There were no safe spaces on my safe TV.

2212
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:37,240
You liked Father of the Pride.

2213
01:41:38,180 --> 01:41:38,960
That's one of your favorite shows.

2214
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,020
We figured it out.

2215
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:40,600
We figured it out.

2216
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:41,580
All right, let's get out of here.

2217
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:42,940
