1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Warning, the following podcasts may contain

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
accidental testosterone checks,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
bad food that scarred an entire city,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
podcast host blood feuds,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and spoiler alerts for a restaurant?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Ah, but not just any restaurant, it's Casa Benita,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the greatest restaurant in the world!

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
On today's podcast, The Ride.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
a podcast about theme parks

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that might be heading for its

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
most sincere episode.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Whoa!

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Wow!

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's my joke, at least on my part.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I am Scott Gardner, who I think is

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm going to be talking to,

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
given what we're talking about

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and what I got to experience.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Any jokes or jabs or cynicisms

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
are going to have to come from Mike Carlson.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay, I'm here. Will I cry on this episode?

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
From hearing a tale?

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, see, I don't know, sincerity

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I think comes in a few. It doesn't mean

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't think I'm...

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I came close to tearing up

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
in one part of this experience, I actually did.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't think it's going to cause tears

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
for anyone else, such as Jason Sherrod and I.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
More sincere than the Ocean City boardwalk.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That was pretty sincere.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Tearing up, naming dots pastries, you know?

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You were lit up in a way.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I was lit up.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I didn't even get talking about so many

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Thetlissaka subs, all these wonderful places.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You've been pacing around for the last week

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
going, I'm going to find a reason to say

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
seven more of these restaurant names.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I will insert them somewhere, come hell or high water.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You were more jacked up than talking about

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Toon Lagoon or Marvel Superhero Island.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You were so revved up.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Did you start punching walls and stuff?

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I did start punching walls.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I was jacked up enough.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I took care of a lot of outstanding

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
medical bills that I hadn't gotten around to paying.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Wow, just a flurry. They're flying around the house.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Just a tornado and then they're all done.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Writing personal checks.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Just five or six personal checks.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm going to take care of it until they stop bothering me.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
If you didn't hear last week's

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
episode about the Ocean City Boardwalk

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
with Alan McCloud, Alan talked about

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
that's an area that you grew up with Jason

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and have a lot of nostalgia for.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Alan was talking about how it's new nostalgia for him.

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It feels so classic that it made him feel

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
like he grew up with this place.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's how I feel coming out of this experience

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
with Casa Bonita.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's as if it implanted memories.

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Some of the teariness that I'll talk about

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
is the emotion I felt experiencing.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Wow, I'm going to do this thing finally.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm getting this entirely from a TV show.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Which is just a credit to what these guys have done.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
On the note of that TV show,

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I was thinking how, given that South Park

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
is a big part of what we're talking about,

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
that I should perhaps rip off another podcast

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and say hi-de-ho to Clifford Nation.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We are today talking about Casa Bonita

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
per their own copy, but this would also be my review.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The greatest restaurant in the world.

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
A staple of the Denver area since 1974,

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
attributed in a 2003 episode of South Park

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and today owned and recently rescued

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and renovated by South Park creators

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Trey Parker and Matt Stone.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Here's a question at the top.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Is this a me thing?

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Am I the only one of the three of us

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
who's had a lingering obsession with this place?

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Or have you guys also dreamed of it?

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Have you followed some of this story

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
of Trey and Matt's purchase and renovation

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
of this restaurant?

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, I followed it for sure.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I do remember in 2003 this episode coming out.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes, that's a big one for me.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I think the story can emanate from that episode

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
because it's certainly where my awareness of it began.

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's kind of like right when I started watching South Park,

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I wasn't into it in the early days.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I found it really abrasive and I was kind of late

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
getting the memo that, oh no, it's actually really smart

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and clever and great stories and how sharp it had become.

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It was season seven that they did this episode

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and there had been a wave of episodes

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
that were getting a lot of press

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
for being so current and satirical

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and they'd begun that production process

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
of doing it with only six days before air

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
so it can be relevant in a way

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
like only SNL can otherwise.

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That was the hype of South Park at the time.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Then they do this Casa Bonita episode

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
which has nothing to do with anything.

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This is not topical.

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This was not about George Bush or the Iraq War or anything.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This was just pure silliness with the kids

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
that heightens to this crazy degree.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This was my episode of the show

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
regardless of it being about a themed experience

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
although I'm sure that helped.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I watched it too at the time

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and I thought it was fake. I didn't know it was real.

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I thought it was made up a place

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and I liked all the specifics of it but I didn't know

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and I don't think at the time I looked into it.

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's kind of my journey with it as well

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
because it's so hyperspecific what they go into

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and you just are wondering

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
did they just invent the craziest most specific thing

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
that a kid would be obsessed with

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and a horrible kid like Hartman would be

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
this place that would drive him to commit fraud

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and endanger and entrap his friend.

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Like cliff divers.

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That didn't seem like a place. That didn't seem real.

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's so specific that you think maybe it has to be real

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
but how can that be real? What do you mean?

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
There's a Mexican restaurant with cliff divers.

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'll start getting into that but let me just say

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
at the very top

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and if I haven't done this already

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
sometimes we like to build suspense

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
with our reviews of an experience

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
if you missed this I got to go to Casa Benita

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
in Denver a couple weeks ago

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and sometimes we like to kind of like well did we like it

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and actually oh and then I don't know then it made me sick

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and it was a terrible experience.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I cannot do any building of suspense in this episode.

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This place fucking rules. It was so great.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I kind of already spoiled it on Twitter. I was so high

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
off of this place. I can't pretend

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and part of the reason I want to get that out right at the top

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
is it's very complicated to get into Casa Benita

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
as I discovered and you know

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
our episodes go a little while. If this is 90 minutes, if it's 2 hours

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't want you to wait that long.

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Listener if you have any thought that you want to go to Casa Benita

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
get it going right now. Don't wait till the end.

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't wait till the plugs. Go to Casa Benita

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Denver right now and sign up for the

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
mailing list and eventually maybe in like

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
9 months to a year. It's going to be a while.

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But I don't want you, you know you add 2 hours on top of that

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
that's an extra. You might miss an entire night with that.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So go there. You guys too. If you have any thought

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll forgive. If you guys want to stop talking for a couple minutes

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
go sign up for that waiting list.

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I would encourage it.

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You know it's complicated. It's weird. Then you have to like

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
claim it and then buy plane tickets after the fact if you don't live there.

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
If you're anywhere close, if you're drivable

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
get on it right now. Let me just, I just want to like

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
hype this place up as much as possible right at the top here.

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah that's, I mean I wonder how long that'll last. How aggressive

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
it'll be for it. Maybe for at least a decade. I don't know.

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I don't know. It could be. I don't know.

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I just saw, now I'm getting algorithmed like

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
local Denver news stories about

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
what's the deal and how do we get in. And I think maybe they're even

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
maybe considering right now still like previews technically.

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh really? Yeah I think possibly

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and I think they might change this process and make it a little easier

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
to get into sort of soon. But

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
either way I think you want to play it safe.

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You're gonna need, wherever you're listening to this episode

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
you're going to need to travel to Denver.

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If you don't do anything else, if you stay there one night and turn around

190
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and do it all in one day the way I did San Jose a while back.

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Just whatever, however it's got to work for you.

192
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Get it done. Yeah. Get to Denver. This thing is

193
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
exemplary. It sounds great. I would love to go.

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah I think you know if you honestly

195
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
if you start looking for like family vacations

196
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
that's kind of where it came from a little bit was like

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
well we want to get him used to planes because we don't have to travel

198
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
anywhere to go visit family but he thinks planes are neat.

199
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So we wanted to give him a fun little plane ride. It's why we went to San Jose

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
last year. We thought well Denver's a little bit further

201
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and then we can go to Casa Bonita

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
but then a bunch of other complications happened.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Highly highly encouraged and also

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
listeners to motivate you

205
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
to go to that website and sign up right now there are 600,000

206
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
people ahead of you. Jesus Christ.

207
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And you add, yeah that's the stats.

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Are they only open on weekends right now?

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
No I don't know if it's every

210
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
night. I was there on a Thursday.

211
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It might not be every day of the week.

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm honestly not sure about that but yeah that might limit it

213
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
a little bit. And no walk-ins I'm assuming.

214
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I can't imagine. I mean unless

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
it is like a you know like what happened

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
when we went to Blue Bayou

217
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and like there was a lot of stress

218
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
about like wait you gotta book that six months in advance and then

219
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Magic Mitch just pulled it right then and there.

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well didn't he just say hey can I get in?

221
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
No there was like a I think it was like checking

222
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
it might have been Kyle I'm not sure. Somebody pulled

223
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
it like Mitch just saying like come on

224
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
let's just try let's try and it did work.

225
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He does have a he has a magic in that regard.

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So anyways

227
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
as kind of we were saying the South Park episode

228
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
November 12th 2003 season seven

229
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
episode 11 kind of

230
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
where this place was popularized was where

231
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
a lot of listeners might know it. It's probably where all three of us know it

232
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
from. Let me play a quiet low

233
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
quality version of the of the scene

234
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
that maybe made a lot of people first aware

235
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
of this place. Apologies for the quality.

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:12:15,000
That's that pretty much.

237
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah I mean before you even like gotten

238
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
into the story just that like hyper description

239
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
from Cartman is very like

240
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
what are we talking about? The Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.

241
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The Disneyland of Mexican restaurants get like Cliffjumpers

242
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and Black Park's Cave and it's like such a perfect thing for him to be

243
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I know it all about. I also want to say

244
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
as I play that clip that I'm going to try my best to say

245
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Casa Bonita throughout this episode

246
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
but please understand that for 20 years

247
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
this has been in my head in Cartman's voice

248
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Casa Bonita, Casa Bonita

249
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
so it's hard to unscramble that

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I also noticed in an interview

251
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
with NBC News about the opening of this place

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
that Trey Parker also calls it Casa Bonita

253
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
well that makes sense

254
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
he does the voice is

255
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
whitefied in his head so I'll try my best

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
but that clip has been in my head for so long

257
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and that song wanting to feel as excited as he is

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
by this place

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
so the story becomes that he's not

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Cartman doesn't get to go

261
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
because Butters has been invited instead

262
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
the long suffering Butters and this is one of the great

263
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Butters torture episodes where

264
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
in order to get to go to Casa Bonita

265
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Cartman convinces Butters

266
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
that there is a meteor on the way to Earth

267
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and he has to stay down in a bomb shelter

268
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and later in a refrigerator

269
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
with a broken off handle in order to survive

270
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
the apocalypse he has to stay there

271
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
at least till the end of the week once this Casa Bonita event

272
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
has passed

273
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
at the end of the episode they arrive

274
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
it's finally time for Casa Bonita

275
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and the police show up there after Cartman

276
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
before trapping Butters and

277
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
frauding the city

278
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and Cartman then has to do a speed run

279
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
through everything in the restaurant

280
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and this is one of these just delightful

281
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
like getting to watch him as quickly as possible

282
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
all of the many fun attractions that this restaurant

283
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
apparently has again we're all watching this we don't know if it's real yet

284
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
or not but it's so like

285
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
wait a minute so they've got like a whole indoor city

286
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
and there's like a little bridge when you come in and then there's

287
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
a puppet show and there's cliff divers

288
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and there's black rights cave eww scary

289
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and sopapias whatever

290
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
sopapias are I didn't know about sopapias before this

291
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I didn't know about sopapias no

292
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
okay cause that sounds like something you would pull out in an episode

293
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and we go what are you talking about and you go well you never had sopapias before

294
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
we had them on the show all the time I don't think I've ever had sopapias

295
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
period sure I could have seen it

296
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
this is not something I have seen at a restaurant

297
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
personally yeah and in the

298
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
in the episode you can't really tell what they are cause it's

299
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Cruddy South Park animation so they're just like little

300
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
white things I don't know what I've wondered

301
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
for decades what sopapias are that's probably my

302
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
favorite part of it where Cartman's in a mad dash

303
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and the police are after him and he sits down and he

304
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
raises a flag manically up and down

305
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
and says sopapias is sopapias place and

306
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm just like what is what could have

307
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
possibly inspired this level of mania

308
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
from from the guys

309
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
like I mean well I mean and just the question of is this place

310
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
real or not that's really the big thing as you were saying Mike

311
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
that you wondered at the time

312
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
so I feel like I remember some

313
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
moment of discovering yes it is real and there were YouTube

314
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
videos you could watch of the

315
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
pre-COVID pre-Trey Matt and Trey

316
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Takeover

317
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
so real stuff about the place founded by

318
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
a guy named Bill Waugh who is just like

319
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I forget if he's from Colorado or not

320
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
but he had just traveled to Mexico

321
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and fallen in love with the culture and the food and

322
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and all the specific like subcultures

323
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Puerto Vallarta and Acapulco and he wanted to bring

324
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
all of these cultures and his travels

325
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
to America in a bigger way than just a

326
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
regular Mexican restaurant so he starts this chain

327
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and it was a chain there were a ton of these

328
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
let's say Oklahoma City

329
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Little Rock Tulsa

330
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
then this one in Lakewood Colorado

331
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Fort Worth kind of briefly

332
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
so there were a ton of these I don't think all of them had

333
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
all of the bullshit

334
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
but at the base it was just like a fun especially

335
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
well themed place

336
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
first one and then Denver's 74

337
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I was talking to

338
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Josh Fadum about this who

339
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
grew up in Oklahoma and he had fond memories

340
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
of it he raved he didn't know any of the other stuff

341
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
didn't know that it was on South Park didn't know about the Takeover

342
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
but his memories were so fond

343
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
and he just voluntarily like so papillas

344
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
the so papillas are so great

345
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
this holds alright so and I think it was a big big birthday party place for him

346
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
he also mentioned a place called Crystal's Pizza

347
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
which I guess was also in Tulsa

348
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
or maybe Oklahoma City

349
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
this place do a Google image on this this looks incredible

350
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
this is like a weird like Victorian turn of the century

351
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
it looks like a casino for kids it looks nuts

352
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
it's a pizza place but like arcade

353
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and a make your own Sunday bar and a cartoon theater

354
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
where they would just be playing Pinocchio or whatever

355
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and it's great for kids but apparently it's like

356
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
became like the middle school make out spot in the later

357
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
senior years of the place

358
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
this that's Josh mentioned that independently

359
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
it was just like similar place started by the same guy

360
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Bill Waugh so he was just this entrepreneur

361
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
of like passed away

362
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
passed away yeah like maybe

363
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
five years ago or so

364
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
so this guy like clearly brightened

365
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Oklahoma and Colorado for

366
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
tons of kids but especially with this

367
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
and especially with this location which is built out of a former department store

368
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
52,000 square feet

369
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
the best and biggest of any of them

370
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
the main crazy feature being a 30 foot tall

371
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
waterfall and lagoon

372
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
with cliff divers with cliff diver shows

373
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
every 20 minutes to half an hour

374
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
you ever seen cliff diving anywhere

375
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I like only know this from themed bullshit like this

376
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
or the Mexico boat ride I mean I've seen like

377
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Instagram like you know when you're surfing through

378
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Instagram they show you random things and I'll see some sort of like

379
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
extreme sports I'll see like bike guys that have like the

380
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
POV of like a little camera on their bicycling

381
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
mountain sure sure I see stuff like this

382
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
but I don't see a cliff I don't seek out

383
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
cliff diving I just see it on accident

384
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
algorithm wants me to see it

385
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
and I'll say okay I'll take a look at this

386
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I've seen footage of like people on

387
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
vacation doing it

388
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I feel like like maybe smaller scale

389
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
there's one video I feel like I always come across

390
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
on the internet with a dog who can

391
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
cliff dive like a little dog who like

392
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
his owner like hauls him from the water

393
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
or so and it runs along and like jumps

394
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
out and into the water

395
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
wow wow okay that's good

396
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
it's too bad that's just like a dog that's out there not something they can charge

397
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
tickets for yeah Jason is that a cliff would you want

398
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
to because you're a height miser oh that's right would you want

399
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
is the water part of it I think the water part

400
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
of it is too much you'd rather have a bungee cord

401
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
attached to your leg yeah

402
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
you would bring back up because I guess

403
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
if I had little floaties on or something

404
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
or an inner tube it would the impact would probably

405
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
deflated oh yeah I don't think little floaties

406
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
hold up when they smacked against water

407
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
yeah they would not hold whatsoever yeah

408
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I also I never particularly liked

409
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
diving into even like pools

410
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I like jumping into pools but like

411
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
diving I was never terribly good at I can't do it for

412
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
shit I've always been awful at that yeah I always smack

413
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
something yeah yeah yeah just a big flap

414
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
belly leg yeah it's

415
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
it's just yeah just nailing my penis

416
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
on that dive yeah nothing like when you're

417
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
holding a whole dick flap right on top of it yeah

418
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
big hard flappy bottom body of water I wasn't able to

419
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
dive until I started backyard wrestling in high school

420
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
and then I was able to dive off of the low diving board

421
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I don't know if I might have reverted I might be too scared to do it

422
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
now I don't know can you go off the top rope or did you

423
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
well we didn't have a real ring oh okay

424
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
so it was like we would go off the top rope with like

425
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
what with an elbow no no like

426
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
like a frog splash yeah

427
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
swan ton bomb

428
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
well I have been in a ring in the last ten years

429
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
and I think I did do a swan ton bomb off

430
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
the top rope but it was there was a mat also on the ring

431
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
oh okay so I didn't do it on the canvas a little unforgiving

432
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
that canvas it sure is

433
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
you're telling me I took a shoulder block from a guy

434
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
from a real professional wrestler and I fell on my back and I went

435
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
holy shit do this in front of crazy I did

436
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
in front of a real life pro wrestler who's a friend of mine

437
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
but you did there was this was on a show this was this was not a show

438
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
thank God because I would have been embarrassed it would have been

439
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
embarrassing to see how much I was like wheezing after I

440
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
took one back bump on the mat

441
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
yeah I mean you say that but I

442
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I imagine any of us would be wheezing oh my

443
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
God yes instantly there would be no way yeah you'd really

444
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I guess you build up the tolerance for it but jeez

445
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
so we're saying we're not proposing

446
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
any sort of PTR wrestling events in the near future

447
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
well I wouldn't go that far I wouldn't say

448
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
we're not proposing that this is news to me

449
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
well I'm not I'm just saying like even though this hurts and it's not

450
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
good for your body especially this advanced age

451
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
not ruling it out is all I'm saying I'm not saying I have an idea

452
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
either I'm just saying you said that phrase and I went well

453
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
like the feeling of of officially boxing out the notion

454
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
of a podcast the right wrestling exactly yeah

455
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I don't want to put it off the table yeah

456
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
who do we who are we evenly matched against

457
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
it's a very good question I mean I know for trio

458
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
podcasters but like let's be honest the sloppy boys are in

459
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
better shape than we are hmm probably that's true

460
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
and they do like aggressive rock and roll shows so

461
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
they must be that maybe they have some real these are some rock

462
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and roll out of us with their rock and roll energy

463
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and they have high tea I bet too for there were all the similar

464
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
ages but they were probably more aggressive than us too

465
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
you just had your tea checked and it was it was accidentally checked

466
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
but like because somebody wasn't the doctor wasn't sure why this nurse

467
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
ordered the full tea but I got my tea checked and I was just

468
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
normal and I was disappointed about it

469
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
because you thought it'd be high I don't know what I want

470
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
you thought the nurse put in the test because

471
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
she's like oh man this guy must have

472
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
high tea I gotta know what his tea is

473
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
she was on the phone

474
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
look I'm not going to hit on him yet but

475
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
if I get that if the tea is what I suspect

476
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
let me see those stats

477
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and well maybe I'm going to have to like get his phone number

478
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
from the files this interaction with the nurse was on the phone

479
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I want to be very clear about that

480
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
from the sound of this guy's voice

481
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
his tea must be through the roof

482
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
wait I misinterpreted that you mean you were talking on the phone

483
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
to them no I'm saying the nurse who ordered all the blood work

484
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
was on the phone it was not somebody I was in person

485
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
with so she didn't get to see you meant she was distracted

486
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
like she was on the phone while putting in the test

487
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
but then that might be even better if she's talking to you

488
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
on the phone and she's like yeah I gotta know the tea's

489
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
coming through the phone I gotta test this

490
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
if I could just swab the air around the receiver

491
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I think she checked the wrong box on a computer I think that's

492
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
really what happened but my tea is normal

493
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
that was not the point of any of it but my tea is normal

494
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
but I bet those sloppy boys have high tea

495
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
that's what I'm guessing so that being said

496
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
now we're the underdogs in the match yeah that's true

497
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
so we're obviously we're going to be the

498
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
guys in that we're going to come from under yeah we're going to work from

499
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
underneath oh they're going to they're barely going to boo the shit out of them

500
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
of course yeah look at these three weaklings

501
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
fighting these aggressive aggro guys

502
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
that's what that's what's going to sort of be the narrative of the match yeah

503
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
this is our we've now we've suddenly painted them as the roughest

504
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
the roughest three dudes yeah we know yeah

505
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
of course these guys are wild you have no idea we've been

506
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
around them and these guys are they are they are loose cannons

507
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
they might just like yell or something yeah these guys

508
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
one of them drives a car there's not even a roof

509
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
on the car yeah

510
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I mean it's a good look it's a good match up and we should think about

511
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
doing it that's all I'll say Jason you want to

512
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
weigh in on that how anxious are you to get into the ring right now

513
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
it is the sort of

514
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
thing where it's like I would be fun to hit someone with a cane

515
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
but I'm like oh shit I need that back

516
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm going to need a hard grip on it

517
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I guess I do have a back up at home so

518
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
well we should get a cane that will like it's a breakaway cane

519
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
yes we should get you like a stunt cane and then yeah you can

520
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
smack it over someone's head and break it sure

521
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
you want me down doing headshots immediately

522
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
oh yeah we're not we're going to like we're going to

523
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
we're using props and we're playing dirty oh okay yeah

524
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
well but it's a stunt cane too I guess it's a breakaway yeah

525
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
it should be fine

526
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
get hyped for this this is

527
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
well we said it here it's a one sided

528
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
one sided podcast one sided for now we just started

529
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Scott started the feud he brought up the sloppy boys

530
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
trying to think of another trio he's right he's right

531
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
that's the match

532
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
smartless is not going to you know

533
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
well maybe we should take a couple shots and see

534
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
you're going to have to hit Bateman with a cane

535
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I mean I feel like Bateman would be down for it

536
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
oh okay he's a pro

537
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
you know cause your answer was pro

538
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I asked why he'd be down for it and you said pro

539
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
he's a pro totally different he's a pro is a great

540
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
answer of why he'd be down for it yeah it was a compliment

541
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
why does that make him down for wrestling I'm a little nervous that

542
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
of the three he's probably had some

543
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
training and fighting like stage fighting

544
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
stage but stage fighting

545
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I mean you get a little bit of real fighting

546
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I don't like how Jason's dropping the kayfabe here and acting like he would be

547
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
into the act of fake fighting we're trying to start a real

548
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
feud here yeah yeah you gotta say yeah I'll bean

549
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
that motherfucker with my cane I'm gonna yeah I'm gonna

550
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm gonna try down to Ozarks right and you're

551
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
gonna be like I don't I saw his movie Bad Words or

552
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
whatever it sucked like you have to start like a real feud here you can't be like

553
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
well I think you'd be down to have some fake fighting

554
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
that's not how you do a wrestling angle yeah okay

555
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
smartless you're gonna be legless when we're done there you go

556
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
that's what you do ooh that's good that's a good guess yeah

557
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
why is it so blue in here Ozark huh

558
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
there you go why is it so blue what is this the sky

559
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
great now that's good now the feud has begun

560
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Bateman you're no pro right no way you're gonna be

561
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
down to get in the ring with us exactly yeah right now

562
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
okay I got a good diss

563
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
coming up ahead in the notes here because so

564
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
alright so obviously

565
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
early cause like 70s

566
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Casa Bonita must have been just like

567
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
the dreamiest funnest place and I think by their

568
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
own admission this like this is what Trey and Matt grew up

569
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
with I think this place was like without precedent

570
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and immaculate and if you're in the Denver area

571
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
you're not close to Disneyland or whatever

572
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
like this is the best thing you got and I think it's far

573
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
beyond Chuck E Cheese or whatever too

574
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
this place clearly next level restaurant

575
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
where you get a Cliff Diver show unbelievable

576
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
but I think 90s into 2000s

577
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
are not kind to this place by like 2000

578
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
it's falling on hard times in the current restaurant there's like

579
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
a little history of the place that you can read

580
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
and the fact that they were willing

581
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
to be upfront about this

582
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
and put this on a sign in the rest and own

583
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
up to I honestly speaking of

584
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
feuds I feel like Trey and Matt are like kind of like

585
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
like picking a fight with the previous owners

586
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
a little bit cause this is how they summarize

587
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
the 2000s for this place diners express their

588
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
disappointment sharing tales of bland sauces

589
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
soggy tortillas reheated dishes and expensive

590
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
hospital visits people

591
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
it is definitive that that's really got so bad that people

592
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
went to the hospital it became apparent that the primary

593
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
focus lay on creating a memorable experience rather than culinary

594
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
delight or even tolerable food the restaurant

595
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
suffered numerous rumors of serving subpar

596
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
food and one persistent rumor about dog food

597
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
quickly earning the nickname casa no

598
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Ida whoa wow

599
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
yeah this is real like in a way that I feel

600
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
like you know a Disney thing is not going to like they

601
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
like you know we I think we shy away from the dark

602
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
moments in history of our themed experiences

603
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
but they put it right there because they want to show off how far it

604
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
came wow yeah so this place

605
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
you know it is a basically

606
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
it was a heavily themed restaurant where the food was

607
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
at best terrible and worse could

608
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
give you food poisoning and at this point I feel like

609
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
you guys might be disappointed that

610
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
it's no longer that way well

611
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
the ideal Mike and Jason restaurant well

612
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
it's less exciting the way where it's consistently

613
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
good food you don't have yeah you don't have the risk you're not like

614
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
you're not you're not playing the slots but then you know right you know

615
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
the first time oh it's fine it's good okay

616
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
well you're not rolling the dice next time you know what you're getting

617
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I know what you mean I guess they have kind of lost the sense of adventure

618
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
that's right yeah yeah the great blandening

619
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
of the casa no Ida experience I said

620
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
this I said this a couple of months ago I think we were talking about this on the show

621
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
is that they didn't have ovens

622
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
uh-huh everything was steamed yes

623
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
all the food was steamed not really discovered

624
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
by Trey and Matt until they were

625
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
owned it and went in the kitchen to start figuring out what they had to do

626
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
right and it was just so much more than they thought like it was

627
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
in such bad shape it was so strange the way everything was laid out

628
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
and by the way the menu has not radically changed

629
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I mean they just serve basics it's tacos

630
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
and enchiladas how do you make those entirely

631
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
with steam I don't know it's confusing

632
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
but yes it sounded like a real strange thing it was already dangerous

633
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
too I'm sure you probably get to that yeah yeah but like it was everything

634
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
was very dangerous set up in a way where like you're like the people

635
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
could easily get set on fire the cliff divers

636
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
very dangerous the way they were doing it yes yeah

637
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
employee like a constant endangerment to employees

638
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
at minimum just like

639
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
guests possibly breathing toxic fumes

640
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
and as I said you know

641
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
the tantalizing to you guys but not to everybody

642
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
risk of getting food poisoning yeah

643
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
here are some quotes about

644
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
the previous food situation

645
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
wait let me find okay this is from

646
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I think it was in a Denver Post article

647
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Victoria Gagnon it was 57

648
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
there's got to be a place in hell for people who serve

649
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
food like that oh wow she said after

650
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
she and her family got food poisoning after a visit to

651
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
in 2013

652
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
the diners are condemning the food

653
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
preparers to hell wow Matt Stone

654
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
said the previous owners deferred

655
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
maintenance in an almost superhuman way

656
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
they just didn't take care of anything and they ran it completely

657
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
into the ground

658
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
the previous owners are named on the sign summit family

659
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
restaurants I do feel like

660
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I feel like Trey and Matt

661
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
were genuinely angry about the arc of

662
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
this place they say in an

663
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
interview how what they are doing now

664
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
their ownership of this place is not a joke

665
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
it is it's very sincere to them because they are

666
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
upset that the place had become a joke right

667
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
because it wasn't when they grew up with it and I

668
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
kind of like that they're just like calling out

669
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
summit fucked up they

670
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
ran it into the ground it was already in a lot of trouble

671
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
obviously COVID was like the final

672
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
slam on this place but I think they were in plenty of trouble

673
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
even before that sounds like it yeah

674
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and this also goes back to how like Matt and Trey are like

675
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
sincere theme park guys like these type of guys

676
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
yeah and you've noted that before

677
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
we've talked about like the imagination episode

678
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
which clearly nods to the imagination

679
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
yeah yeah and the song imagination

680
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
obviously a nod to Epcot

681
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
and that's what I will

682
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
that's what I was so excited about once I discovered

683
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
like the full deal with this place what you're describing

684
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
their sincerity them being theme park people

685
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
has never been more evident than when you're in this place

686
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
it is that is what is so exciting

687
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
about what they did here so anyways the place is not

688
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
doing great through the 2000s

689
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
and I think it's propped up almost entirely by their association

690
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
with South Park so this episode airs in 2003

691
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
per YouTube video

692
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
filmed a while back the people then at

693
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
the restaurant say how they could count on a

694
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
10% boost in

695
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
in business anytime the episode

696
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
like so they would track oh that one's back up and reruns

697
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
well which is all the time I mean like

698
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Comedy Central now almost entire they kind of only show

699
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
South Park so that things probably air in once a week

700
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
or so and like the next night like clockwork

701
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
so they would have to staff differently they would

702
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
they would bring more people on knowing

703
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
that that episode had just aired

704
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
yeah so the association becomes

705
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
like very deep

706
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
South Park's offices where they make the show

707
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
has been called Casa Bonita for a long time

708
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
and then pandemic

709
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
this thing closes August 2021

710
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
they announced that they are purchasing the restaurant and saving it

711
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
which almost certainly would have just gone under completely

712
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
so they have paid 3 million dollars to

713
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
own this thing outright they start

714
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
getting into what it's going to take to

715
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
to renovate it and you know

716
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
make it everything you know like plus it up but also just

717
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
like make it basically functional for

718
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
for guys like to get it up to modern health code standards

719
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
the initial estimate is 10 million dollars

720
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
they are going to have to put into it to get it to be the way they

721
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
want it that expands and expands it ends up being

722
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
40 million dollars they put 40

723
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
million dollars of their own money into this place

724
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
the cost of a motion picture yeah yeah

725
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
yeah they could have self-financed

726
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
a new Team America easily with that money

727
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
yeah yeah but they are

728
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
they've done some very canny moves with like

729
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
licensing their back catalog

730
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
did they didn't they do

731
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
where like a lot of the new South Park are

732
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
are made for TV movies essentially

733
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
and like they sold those to one streaming service

734
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
and they chop it up into episodes and sold it to another

735
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
streaming service well it's all on both I mean

736
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
South Park's moved a couple of times it was all on Hulu

737
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
it was on their own site South Park Studios and now

738
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
the new movies come out on Paramount Plus but the archive

739
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
lives on Macs and anytime

740
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
that is resold I mean I don't know the numbers but it's like

741
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
they own half of it they it's like so it's the

742
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
the greatest margins of ownership yeah

743
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
yeah it's very modern television history they will

744
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
you know hey I try to sell animated shows

745
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I watch the process everybody tries to make sure

746
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
that no one will all lawyers work together

747
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
to make sure nobody ever gets a deal remotely close

748
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
to what these guys have ever again

749
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
yeah so they've every anytime and it's going to keep happening

750
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
they keep moving from venue to venue and they will make

751
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
half a billion dollars every time it happens

752
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
it's crazy yeah these guys are so

753
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
loaded and so much of what excites me about this

754
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
is using their loadedness

755
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
just to make a fun thing happen for us

756
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
for the world and for the town they grew up in

757
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Trey Parker said somewhere it would have been

758
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
they would have spent much less money and had a lot more

759
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
fun if they had used this money to go hang gliding

760
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
over volcanoes but instead

761
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
they pumped it into a restaurant where apparently the stats are

762
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
they would need to get like a million

763
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
guests every night in order to turn a profit

764
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
on this plate I don't think they can fit that many

765
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I think we're dealing with a thousand tonight and yeah

766
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I mean it's doing gangbusters but still how do you make

767
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
like 40 million it seems hard yeah

768
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
yeah it's the kind of margins

769
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
that we usually are talking about

770
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
when we're mourning a restaurant that has gone away

771
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
we're talking about a place that was so crazy

772
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
it was never going to work and yet

773
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
just because of their finances

774
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
we're able to tell like this is a brand new thing

775
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
that I mean I'm sure they want to make their money back

776
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
but I don't think they have to immediately

777
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
like it is not we're not remotely in the territory

778
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
we're usually talking about but like yeah how in the world was

779
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
NBA City ever going to get out of the red

780
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
it's great it's magical

781
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
and there's no there's no there's no like awful bullshit

782
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
companies involved and it's just these two crazy guys

783
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
it's the only time when mega rich people like

784
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
they do a cool like we've talked to Quentin Tarantino effect

785
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
like he's preventing these theaters from being turned

786
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
into like apartment buildings or condos in LA

787
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
it's like that's when if that's the only time I like it

788
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
when somebody has a ton of money like this yes yeah

789
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
just like if you're going to do something fun okay great yeah

790
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
yeah I think the only thing comparable absolutely

791
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
is Tarantino yeah I know and that like

792
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
they're putting their money where their mouths are

793
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
and like doing things that reflect their sensibility

794
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
you know Tarantino giving back to

795
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
film and these guys giving back to

796
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
crazy Colorado bullshit it's wonderful

797
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
so all right what other details in there

798
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
a lot of this money went to unsexy stuff

799
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
it went to like HVAC system plumbing

800
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
electrical gas

801
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I think they were they were talking about a book of Mormon

802
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and how during or kind of anything they do like if they're

803
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
they if they're going to spend a lot of money they want it to show up on screen

804
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
they don't want it to go to boring between the lines kind of stuff

805
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
but in this case it had to like it was never

806
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
they just had to like replace the table tops

807
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
because they were filthy and yeah just old meals

808
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
are caked between the tiles after decades and decades

809
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
so all this boring stuff but again you're in there and you

810
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
really feel it and I'll get into that but yeah Matt Stone said

811
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
we're talking about just health and safety stuff like so someone won't

812
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
die yeah I imagine

813
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
there was a lot to be redone for the cliff diving

814
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Porsche like I'm sure yes that pool

815
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
and stuff needed a redo that's

816
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
that's definitely a huge area

817
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
okay apparently if you went there

818
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
you know circa 2019 maybe for decades

819
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
and decades decades

820
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
horrible chlorine stink right around there

821
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
especially but probably through the entire restaurant

822
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
and you just like took that as a given like alright I'm going to have fun

823
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
but it does smell in Casa Bonita I can attest

824
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
it does not smell today it was ice cold

825
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
water those guys had to do that show

826
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
and then just and then dive straight into

827
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
so they've they finally put in heaters

828
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
for the first time in history so the divers are comfortable

829
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
and then here's also from Denver

830
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Post other features like the old cliff diving pool

831
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
actual physical hazards it turned out that divers once they leaped into the

832
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
pool could only exit through a 30 inch wide

833
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
underwater tunnel brimming with pipes

834
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
then they emerged from the water into an electrical room

835
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
oh god yeah I read that that's

836
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
that's pretty wild said somebody I don't have the first name

837
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
shoemaker who was helping with this process there were 200

838
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
amps of power directly to the left when I

839
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
saw it I called Matt and told him this is the most

840
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
dangerous room I've ever seen

841
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
of any type of room

842
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
he has never been in a room with as much

843
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
capacity to murder people room full of spikes is

844
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
less dangerous yeah this is like this is a Batman

845
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
villain trap right this was their day to day was

846
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
something yes if it wasn't people

847
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
if you were pushing the people off instead of them

848
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
diving on purpose that's the only shift you'd have to make to make this

849
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
a literal torture device that's crazy yeah yeah

850
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
so insane so they did all of these

851
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
and imagine and like their feet like

852
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I'm sure they thought this was a risky dumb thing

853
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
when they got into it they're probably like I don't know

854
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
a lot of money will we ever see it back I don't know and now

855
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
we got to put in money for innovation then that number quadruples

856
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
and in the middle of this they are probably like

857
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
what the fuck are we do why yeah

858
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
how was this really that important to us

859
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
and they made an episode recently

860
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
that depicts their that kind of

861
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
like is a stand in for this process I'd seen

862
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
this episode and didn't realize that's what it was

863
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
where Cartman buys a

864
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
hot dog restaurant wait he's living in a

865
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
hot dog already in recent seasons he and his

866
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
mom fell on hard times and they had to move into a hot dog restaurant

867
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
and then he flips it into like a fancy

868
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
restaurant with water slides and zip lines and stuff

869
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
and I didn't realize while watching it that it is all an allegory

870
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
for the annoyance of having to

871
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
having to do this just the relatable story

872
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
of when you buy a restaurant and then the cost

873
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
overruns are enormous

874
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
so anyways that brings us to today there's articles for a long

875
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
time about like you know

876
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
when is this going to open and is it going to open is it going to be

877
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
more complicated than we thought but also rumors

878
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
are flying that they fixed the food finally

879
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Dana Rodriguez the lead chef

880
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
is like a lauded Denver

881
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
chef so maybe that's finally been fixed

882
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
they've plussed it up thematically in a huge way as all this is forming

883
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm like I want to figure this out I want to understand

884
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Cartman's excitement I want to see if they fixed it today

885
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I got to get here so

886
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
as I was saying I wanted to take my son on a reasonably short plane

887
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
trip so we bought we bought plane tickets to Denver now

888
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
to figure out Casa Bonita went to the website huh

889
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
there is nowhere to get tickets or reservations

890
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
wait you just sign up for the mailing list and that's all

891
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
you can do and you don't know when they're going to email you back

892
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
and I reached out to some other people who I know went like

893
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
our friend Doug Jones my friend Joe Carnegie and they're like

894
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
oh yeah I booked mine as soon as the website was up and running

895
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
god crap shit how did they know about this

896
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
and I didn't know about it so now I'm trying and I complained about it

897
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
on an episode of the show is there any way I could figure out

898
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
and I have the plane tickets already like there's no way this will

899
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
line up I guess 600,000 people

900
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
are in line ahead of me do I have to cancel this trip what do I do

901
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
friend of the show Landon

902
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Zachheim heard my plea

903
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
who you know from immersive style he's like a

904
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
he's a film festival he was there with he was there

905
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
at the Minotaur incident oh he was one of the participants

906
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
yes and he was despite that he did not

907
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
turn his back on the podcast the ride boys

908
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I would have understood he didn't shock us all up as

909
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Minotaur fearing cowards that's right he wanted to help out

910
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
he worked a few angles with his connections in the

911
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Denver area he was trying to figure out a way so helpful

912
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
like I really want to figure this out for you I said why

913
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
this is so nice of you why and he said

914
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I just want to hear that episode of podcast the ride

915
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
bless you Landon here we are now

916
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
really tried his best

917
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
and emailed a ton of people for me none of it ended up working out

918
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
this was just like an unscalable wall I thank

919
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Landon for trying everything but in all

920
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
that time I never canceled the trip and then suddenly

921
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Joe Carnegie one of the people who told me the deal with the

922
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
mailing list said guess what my date is

923
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
up I can't do it anymore

924
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
do these dates happen to work for you for a table

925
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
for three for cliffside dining

926
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
and I said that is exactly when I am booked

927
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
to be in Denver and I got to do it thank you

928
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Joe you rescued this experience and you get that it was a table

929
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
of three so it could be a family thing I could take

930
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
my four year old son to experience cliffside

931
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
dining a miracle so great

932
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
so we we go to Denver we

933
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
spend a few days there find a lot of fun kids stuff to do

934
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
but we build up to this this is the last night this is the

935
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
the main attraction and we head over to Lakewood

936
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
kind of west of downtown Denver

937
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
in the episode of the show

938
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
when Cartman and everybody

939
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Kyle's mom when they arrive at Casa Bonita you can see

940
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
in the background like it's a subtle thing that

941
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
everything in the background is all like pawn shops and strip

942
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
clubs and stuff it's just a subtle thing that's not

943
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
referred to and I was like is that going to

944
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
be consistent with the deal with this place and sure enough

945
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
the entire drive in through Lakewood is just like

946
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
seedy motels and vape stores

947
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
it is like it is nothing like it is not like

948
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
some charming drive up to this this charming place

949
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
and then you you get there and it's just in a

950
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
strip mall that's just like a Ross and a dollar tree

951
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
and a Planet Fitness could not be less

952
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
glad it's just right next to like a big dentist's office

953
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
but shining above all of that this beautiful

954
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
pink tower what a pink oh

955
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
it's a perfect yeah such a 70s pink

956
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
they apparently had to try 27 shades of it

957
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
to get the right kind of pink

958
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
it's like it's I mean it's like the Carthay Circle

959
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Tower it is a theme park weenie

960
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
a shining beacon over Lakewood

961
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
it's so beautiful right away I feel like Cartman

962
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
and I'm not even in there yet spectacular

963
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
fountain outside which was also completely redone

964
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
all of these thankless things they did this fountain was going to

965
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
crumble entirely but they had to

966
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
and the mood outside is just

967
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
amped up everybody is buzzing it's

968
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
families that just came out of their families who can't get wait to get

969
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
in there like boy the spirits in this place

970
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
which is what I've just I just tried to retain

971
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
and keep it here in this episode get inside

972
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
we gotta go straight to the bathroom just the bathrooms are great

973
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
the tiles just the choice of tiles and the

974
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
colors and I'm like if I like the bathrooms this much

975
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
this is going to be unbelievable yeah

976
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
then get a bigger better sense of the lobby it's like this little it's like this

977
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
indoor village and this you know this little flags and the strings of

978
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
flags and fruit carts it is immediately

979
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
so Epcot Mexico Pavilion

980
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
and like rendered in that it is like

981
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
clearly instantly theme park quality

982
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
if this place was ever kind of like funny

983
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
cruddy like a miniature golf course

984
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
or something not today this is like

985
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I don't know who they got to work on this production

986
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
design wise but it is so high caliber

987
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
it's incredible it's also got

988
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I feel like the coziness and the intimacy of like one of my

989
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
favorite little parts in theme park them and I'm so sad this

990
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
place is gone the little town in the

991
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Norway ride when the ride is over

992
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
little town that you have to rush through to go see the

993
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
boring movie right right

994
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
you know what I shouldn't call such a shot I'm fond of the boring movie

995
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
but we have to admit it's a boring movie I when I was

996
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
younger I thought you had to watch it to get out

997
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
yeah yeah and and I think in later

998
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
years they had the doors a little more propped open

999
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
but as a kid

1000
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
crack a light so you know I could leave

1001
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I didn't know I thought like well the doors must be locked

1002
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
we had to be respectful and watch this movie

1003
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I think I thought that about all theme park doors like there's no way

1004
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I can leave I assume it's just steel clonk

1005
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
it's prison doors and then I understood how

1006
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
fire safety in public places

1007
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
works yeah sure yes and like that you know

1008
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
people with little kids need to be able to exit due to a freak out

1009
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
and go to the bathroom whenever they want but I know what you mean

1010
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
the little town you would the boat would pull up in

1011
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
that is what it is about that

1012
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
it's like so cozy and you know it's an unload area

1013
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
so you don't get to spend any time there

1014
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I could have just like we sometimes we talk about like where would you want to get a drink

1015
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
in a theme but I would just I just want to like pull up a chair

1016
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
in that little town and just sit there for a while

1017
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
just watch boats come in and out

1018
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
yeah that was not an option nor do I know what a

1019
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Norwegian cocktail would be

1020
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
do they drink schnapps I feel like a lot of

1021
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
countries in Europe let's say schnapps it just defaults

1022
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
to a schnapps or some sort of liqueur

1023
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I mean it's got to be a beer culture

1024
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
right you would think I would think so but I don't know

1025
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
that's not something I learned about in the Norway

1026
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
yeah that one's really looming Norway Maelstrom

1027
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
that's a big sneaker that we've never

1028
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
gotten to yeah that's a family favorite

1029
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
the neighboring country

1030
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Finland I learned about

1031
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
and then never bought or tried

1032
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
the Finnish long drink

1033
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
which is a can they sell

1034
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
in America they sell cans of it now

1035
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
and an early investor was

1036
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Miles Teller so when we were on our

1037
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
celebrity liquor trick I was going to show up one day

1038
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Finnish long drink and when I went to buy it

1039
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
it was out they didn't have it

1040
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Finnish long drink

1041
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Finnish long drink I think it goes back to

1042
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
there was an Olympics

1043
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
after World War II in Finland

1044
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
but like alcohol was still kind of hard to come by

1045
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
so they figured out a way to

1046
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
mix a liqueur with like grapefruit soda

1047
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
to make it stretch a little more

1048
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
so I think it's like a grapefruit soda like

1049
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
liquor drink and is Miles Teller Finnish

1050
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
why is Miles involved

1051
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
he was at an event where they were giving out

1052
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
samples and he really liked it so he bought in

1053
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
okay well I would love to see him

1054
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
reprise his type of role as maybe he could play

1055
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
himself in a mini series like the offer

1056
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
that is about him putting together the deal

1057
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
to make the Finnish long drink

1058
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
the offer is on Paramount Plus?

1059
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I can only hope

1060
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I forgot all about the offer

1061
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
but I do newly have Paramount Plus

1062
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
watch Ninja Turtles

1063
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
and watch the offer

1064
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
which Ninja Turtles are you going to watch?

1065
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I'm like last year

1066
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
you gotta go straight to the offer though

1067
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I think I can play this part

1068
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
that sounds good

1069
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
not a bad impression of that

1070
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
anyways we got

1071
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
end of Norway ride vibes right in the lobby

1072
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
it's cozy I look in a window

1073
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
and there's a little retro TV

1074
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
it is an ad from the 70s

1075
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
for Casa Bonita starring

1076
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Ricardo Maltobon

1077
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I'm missing the L

1078
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I was like Maltobon

1079
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I just wanted to make sure we were talking about the same guy

1080
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
no Mike I'm talking about Ricardo Maltobon

1081
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
without an L obviously

1082
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
like a different off brand Ricardo Maltobon

1083
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
he's a white guy

1084
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I'm sorry I meant Richard O Maltobon

1085
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
less exciting

1086
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Denver's hottest henchman

1087
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
he was big in Denver's theater

1088
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
this is the man of course that starred in Fantasy Island

1089
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
and was con on Star Trek

1090
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
villain of naked gun

1091
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I didn't know he did ads for this

1092
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
you have to look through kind of like a frosted window

1093
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
and then the TV's kind of fuzzy

1094
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
and that's where I'm like oh I see what they've done here

1095
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
they have just kept the 70s-ness of it

1096
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
and probably amped it up

1097
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I imagine this place felt kind of eternally 70s already

1098
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
but just probably due to not replacing anything

1099
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I don't think it was like a choice

1100
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
but in that way that we kind of just want Disney

1101
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
to say tomorrow land equals 70s or 80s

1102
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
or whatever

1103
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
that's just what it is don't run from it

1104
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I feel like what they've done here

1105
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
they just decided it is perma 70s let's not fight it

1106
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
and it's this like dreamy 70s

1107
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
it's like a storybook 70s

1108
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
it's the most pleasant sun-hued 70s

1109
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
mixed with like vibes of Tony Baxter's New Fantasyland

1110
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
it is so charming storybook

1111
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
and with some of the atrocities we've seen of like recent flipping

1112
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
you know what was in my head was like

1113
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
boy we really gotta update Ralph Brennan's jazz kitchen

1114
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
for modern you know

1115
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
they don't understand all these railings and this New Orleans vibe

1116
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
what do modern people want?

1117
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
well they want like plain white walls

1118
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
and the word jazz written on the wall

1119
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I don't think we talked about this on the show

1120
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
that is so brutal what they did to Ralph Brennan's jazz kitchen

1121
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
at downtown Disney

1122
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I haven't walked around there but I was just there the other day

1123
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
and it does the personality is gone

1124
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
with some like the odd agenda

1125
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
of like modernizing

1126
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
and that being I guess that a restaurant has to look

1127
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
like a Property Brothers flipped house

1128
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I don't get it and I think we're gonna look back

1129
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
and go like the atrocities that we have committed

1130
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
ripping out all the personality

1131
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
when you should just like enhance what it is

1132
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
start with its core and then like make the core shine

1133
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
and maybe I'm wrong I think they

1134
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
think they're making it more fall in line with the future

1135
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
aesthetic of that downtown Disney which is very like

1136
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
and that's okay I like that some of that downtown Disney stuff is kind of

1137
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
retro from the 60s that's close to what I'm describing

1138
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
because that'll sort of stay timeless

1139
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
and feel modern but future but retro all at once

1140
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
so I feel like they're like well if we make it like this at least like it's white

1141
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
it falls into like the color scheme of what the art

1142
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
shows I don't know to me it just looks like

1143
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
you know it looks like a frozen yogurt shop from 2009

1144
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
yes I don't disagree it's like it's out of date

1145
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
in the wrong way I don't disagree

1146
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
there's a new like entry sign I just saw

1147
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
went up for downtown Disney

1148
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
and I saw it describe this that's okay yeah

1149
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
it's entry modern but I was like that's just the

1150
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
isn't that just the Dodger Stadium sign

1151
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
oh maybe a little did you see

1152
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
the Din Tai Fung is really coming along

1153
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
where is it it's right where the movie theater used to be

1154
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
so you come in there and there's a big and they have a it's a big building

1155
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
it's really well themed okay and I was like very

1156
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
we walked in there like a couple weeks ago I was like very impressed

1157
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
so that's something to look forward to

1158
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
it seems like a mixed bag some of these redos at downtown Disney are all right

1159
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
because look downtown Disney not all of the aesthetics

1160
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
were I'd say we've I'd say we quest

1161
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I'd say we questioned a lot of the aesthetics all over downtown Disney

1162
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
and the replacement and I forget the name of it for the

1163
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
bar for your beloved and I can't think of the name of the old bar

1164
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
oh yeah Centrico Centrico

1165
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
fuck Centrico yeah it kind of looks nice it's probably fine

1166
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
yeah it looks nice oh wait kayfabe no fuck Centrico

1167
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I will I'll I'm gonna get a lot of

1168
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
equipment ready to burn it to the ground on opening day

1169
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I feel like there were and maybe there's not like a little fire pit but there were people

1170
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
just kind of chilling out there's more room sort of to hang out out there

1171
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
and it felt like when you're when you see people like having a good

1172
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
time at a place and it feels like a fake commercial where they're all just like

1173
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
laughing and like you're looking at the concept art right

1174
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
but that's what was happening when I was we were walking by there I was like

1175
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
everyone's having such a fun time here it's almost hard

1176
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
to reconcile the places at downtown Disney being

1177
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
actual places where people gather right and have fun

1178
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
right but that's what was happening so I mainly

1179
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
associate a lot of them with like families of eight being like

1180
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
we need to be fed yeah this is we are

1181
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
absolutely mowed down by this day

1182
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
yeah but no that's not always yeah I saw

1183
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I saw people and they were not maybe they were in their 30s

1184
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
the early 30s and they were having a blast wow

1185
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
and then there was a chime and they all stopped what they were doing

1186
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
and turned and looked at you oh everyone

1187
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
in downtown Disney did that yeah it was just

1188
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
the horror movie it became like an 824

1189
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
horror movie where it's just like unnerving

1190
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
right not super scary yeah that was a tell

1191
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
that maybe it's still not a normal place

1192
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
until that was fine yeah

1193
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
anyways I just love that they

1194
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
embrace the 70s it is the 70s and then

1195
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
we are ushered up to our

1196
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
cliffside dining location which by the way I have to

1197
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
if listeners if you would tend to go to this place

1198
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
it's a little bit extra I think just spring for it I think you gotta

1199
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
do the cliffside dining you know

1200
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
because if you're they went in Rome I think you gotta do it

1201
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
and so now we get this like incredible entrance where we're like going

1202
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
upstairs and there's like tiers and you start to get a sense

1203
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
of the of the space and how many like little

1204
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
areas and rooms there are in this

1205
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
in this restaurant and then we arrive

1206
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
in kind of like the main atrium where you can really

1207
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
see everything and it were two steps in

1208
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
and we go holy shit they did it it's

1209
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
perfect you can tell it is there was no question

1210
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I think we were like there's still a possibility that we

1211
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
get in and it's kind of cheesy or that maybe they actually did

1212
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
cheap out a little bit on the renovation not at all

1213
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
the vibes are incredible we have both

1214
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
our jaws are both dropped from second one

1215
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
we we go we walk past a mariachi band

1216
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
and which is I remember from Cartman's speed

1217
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
run that he like stops and dances for two seconds and then

1218
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
keeps going and I stop and dance for two seconds and then

1219
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
keep going and we get to our cliffside dining table I think as

1220
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
soon as we land there is a cliff diving show

1221
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
in progress it's insane

1222
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
it's so great I think you can watch it from down on the

1223
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
bottom and there's like and they call it a splash zone

1224
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
it's a splash zone you will get you you can get wet and you do

1225
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
get wet but you can also watch it from up on the top

1226
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
this moment especially and I'll post

1227
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
a video of this there is a moment where

1228
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I grab my son to take him

1229
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
all the way to the edge as close as we can get to

1230
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
get a full vantage point of the cliff diving and the diver

1231
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
walks he climbs just onto rocks it's not even

1232
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
like sea world style like you can see the little platforms

1233
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
they just walk on like jagged looking

1234
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
rocks bare feet they just

1235
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
explore wherever they want and one of them

1236
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
comes up two feet away from us

1237
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
and you know Aaron's not trying to like

1238
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
be a cinematographer here but the

1239
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
built in lighting is so

1240
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
immaculate on camera it's just this

1241
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
cascade of glowing and amazing

1242
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
theatrical light and then like twinkling

1243
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
stars all over the ceiling which I know they didn't have before

1244
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
they didn't have any of this before lighting incredible sound

1245
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
incredible they like pumped Broadway

1246
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
stage money into this place it is

1247
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
so Disney level it's insane

1248
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
and then watching the cliff dive my son's been talking about it

1249
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
ever since he's never seen anything like

1250
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
cliff diving and let alone how close you get

1251
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
it's just again

1252
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
we're heading into half an hour of me going and then this was great

1253
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
and then this was really great I feel

1254
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
if you're sensing I feel insecure about just how

1255
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
sincere that I know I'm really thrown

1256
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
off guard here but what else can I do it's just like

1257
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I think I knew it would be

1258
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
cool but I still thought maybe it'd be like cheesy

1259
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
cool and the fact that it feels absolutely

1260
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Disney caliber that was the shocker

1261
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
to me and then the cliff side dining seats are next

1262
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
to rock walls so you're next you're

1263
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
in a fake rock it's like it is somewhere between

1264
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Mexico Pavilion and Pirates of the Caribbean

1265
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I will say there's absolutely quarters of this

1266
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
that feel like the caves in the beginning

1267
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Pirates of the Caribbean and I can't believe they pulled that off

1268
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
it sounds like nonsense when

1269
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
they say it in South Park it's the Disneyland and Mexican restaurants

1270
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I bet at the time that was said kind of in jest

1271
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
but now it just is it fully is

1272
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
that it's been it's incredible that's that's wild

1273
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
yeah I would be so interested to know like because there's

1274
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
not a ton of great footage of it inside from

1275
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
30 40 50 years ago no not really

1276
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
yeah so I do wonder like obviously it looks I'm sure

1277
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
it looks ten times better now I do wonder what it looks

1278
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
like opening day yeah I I don't

1279
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
know and yeah I don't have the best sense of the vibes

1280
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
previously I mean I think this place I think some of the

1281
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
magic of it is it's like modern money supporting

1282
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
really good bones and the the photos

1283
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I saw made it the old those photos I could

1284
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
find made it clear that like all these features were

1285
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
there you know they're like here's the little like

1286
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
here's the town square and a fountain and a

1287
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
dedicated so papillas stand and then

1288
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
like the every beat of black parts

1289
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
cave which I will get into was all there they may

1290
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
have fully ripped it out and started over but I

1291
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
don't think they reinvented the space or I mean

1292
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I think they they like pretty perfectly recreated

1293
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
what they had been ripping out you know right

1294
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
so I'm sure it was awesome when

1295
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
it opened I mean just like it's what you want out

1296
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
of it's in the league of I'm trying to think of like the

1297
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
best Disney example this it might not be this but like that

1298
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Snow White redo I think is wonderful yeah

1299
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I think you know it doesn't stray far from

1300
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
the ride that was probably there in nineteen fifty five but

1301
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
they subtly use modern technology

1302
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
they don't like make it fully screen ride but they just like

1303
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
support and amend and I think it's

1304
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
insane that I'm putting this in league with like

1305
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
some of Disney's best ride redo's yeah I

1306
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
absolutely do well and also I

1307
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
think it would be harder to make something that would continually

1308
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
impress like I guess what I mean is like

1309
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
you have to sit there and eat so you're watching everything

1310
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
and you're existing by it for an hour or whatever

1311
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
yeah you got time to stare right and so like see all the

1312
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
seams yes right because like a ride I'm sure

1313
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
there's fake rocks that we love that you would sit

1314
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
and eat a meal by them and by the end you would be like well the some

1315
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
of some of the magic might be gone because I can see that it's

1316
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
actually a little cheaper the paint isn't so good oh absolutely

1317
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
yes and it requires like a like a blue by you

1318
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
which I completely does hold up like it's got to be

1319
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
but it started in there what's that dark in that blue by you

1320
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
that's true that's true well you know it's it's dark in here

1321
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
too yeah but like I'm not as dim

1322
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
they definitely aren't like hiding any yeah yeah now

1323
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
one thing I will say

1324
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
about like you know you just said

1325
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
well you know because you like you know you

1326
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
sit there for a while you sit there for an hour this is not

1327
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
necessarily true I feel like the what they encourage

1328
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
essentially is fairly quick turnover

1329
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
because there's so much interest in this place yeah

1330
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
but also alright the

1331
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
food this is a big question yeah what did you have

1332
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
well here I'll get into it but just vaguely

1333
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
let me say the foods not

1334
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
great they didn't get it to grow interesting

1335
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
now we're not in dog food territory we're not in casa

1336
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
noita territory but it was pretty quickly

1337
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
broadcasted I would say that the food might not be great

1338
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
because here's how this played out the reservation

1339
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
was at 6 p.m. and we got there a little earlier

1340
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
so we were seated at 6 p.m. we ordered

1341
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
the food arrived at 6.08

1342
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
wow really jammed this out

1343
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
and I feel like that communicated this place is

1344
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
not about the food you will yeah you know eat up enjoy

1345
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
it'll be fine but

1346
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
the fact that it was out that quickly and that there are constant

1347
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
PA announcements for all the other things there are to do

1348
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
kind of let us know oh I see

1349
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
food is like a technicality here we provide it

1350
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
it's like at a wedding or something but probably it's more

1351
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
about the other stuff gotcha

1352
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
so yes food wise

1353
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I mean this is something

1354
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I talked to Doug about this he was like because he

1355
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
got to go a couple months prior I think I asked him about

1356
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
food and he said I think he said fine

1357
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
but boy if you ask around Denver if you're in Denver

1358
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
and you talk to locals and you just bring up I'm

1359
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
here for personally for Casa Bonita they will

1360
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
all say oh that food oh Jesus that food

1361
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
and we experienced that we went to a Trader Joe's

1362
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
and we got exactly that and somebody said it that Trader Joe's

1363
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
you know what I don't think they fixed it

1364
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I still don't think it's any good so Denver

1365
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
is definitely like a Denver thing they were they are so

1366
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
like they have not forgotten how terrible that food

1367
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
and so much of the like mystery of this place

1368
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
is did they get the food better and like kinda

1369
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Erin's was worse than mine she got something

1370
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
vegetarian and she said it was like a

1371
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
serviceable microwave meal

1372
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
and it's not Taco Bell quality even

1373
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
well look we're on different I don't know what to say to you

1374
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
to that because you put Taco Bell in the highest caliber food

1375
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
did you eat the big Cheez-It yet Mike?

1376
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I have not had the big Cheez-It Taco Bell thing yeah

1377
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
there's a big Cheez-It at Taco Bell

1378
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
can we put an inch amount on that

1379
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
like I think like

1380
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
if you've ever had a Crunch Wrap at Taco Bell

1381
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
it's kind of like I would say it's like this big right here

1382
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
and I think the Cheez-It's sort of a similar

1383
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
like this you know when Steven Spielberg's making the lens

1384
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
when he's sort of imagining a shot in a movie

1385
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
with his fingers imagine an onset

1386
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
of Last Crusade finger frame forming

1387
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
with Steven Spielberg if you want to Google the image search that

1388
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
that's about how big the Cheez-It is

1389
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
a Cheez-It in Steven's hand like that too

1390
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
if somebody wants to make that I would appreciate it

1391
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
you were making me wistful for the magic of cinema

1392
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
just doing those the hands

1393
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I guess you could do two you could do these you could do this

1394
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
there's a big Cheez-It so you can get the big Cheez-It in a Crunch Wrap

1395
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
or you can get it as a Tostado

1396
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
or you can just buy the big Cheez-It

1397
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
have you done it? I haven't yet

1398
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
you have a disgusted face but I don't think you meant to convey that

1399
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
no I was just burping yeah

1400
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
oh you were burping that was a disgust

1401
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
did you have a couple of sodas this morning?

1402
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
no Jason's been saying he's been meaning to eat more big Cheez-Its

1403
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
we'll get there

1404
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I have been eating organic Cheez-Its though the Annie's organic Cheez-Its

1405
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
that I've been buying from Sprouts

1406
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
or you gotta go organic with your Cheez-Its

1407
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
you do you know the ingredients are organic

1408
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
that means good for you that means healthy

1409
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I just get Cheez-Its but I like the extra toasty ones

1410
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
they need a little extra burnt a little more carcinogen in there

1411
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,000
you throw them in a fryer you put a little oil on

1412
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
oil and butter if you want it really crispy

1413
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
you do it yourself you throw them in the oven

1414
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
you make them extra

1415
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
extra toasty and then I crisp them up

1416
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
that's a bummer though

1417
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
maybe it is Taco Bell quality

1418
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I just don't know how to answer that because I know you regard Taco Bell very highly

1419
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
as far as garbage food

1420
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
it's high up there

1421
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I would not call it garbage food

1422
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I think it's kind of common

1423
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I feel like I've had a lot of experience with the

1424
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I've been here for decades Mexican restaurant

1425
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
where the food is not that good and it makes you feel kind of bad after the fact

1426
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
where you just feel the like cake thon gunk

1427
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
in the back of that maybe like oh well part of it

1428
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
being open forever means they haven't replaced this or that

1429
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
so I was not surprised when I heard that the food wasn't great

1430
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
and nor like look I will go back to those places

1431
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
maybe this is my area of the city walk

1432
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
loyalty where your guys willingness

1433
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
to go back time and time again to places that make you sick

1434
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
or try to put plastic in your food

1435
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
maybe I feel that with because I do just like the

1436
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
ambiance of a classic Mexican restaurant

1437
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
which made this the ultimate

1438
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
it's probably why this of all things really spoke to me

1439
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
you're describing like what I call like

1440
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
margaritas enchiladas sit down Mexican restaurant

1441
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
as opposed to just like a taqueria

1442
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
yeah yeah yeah

1443
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
where it's maybe it's dim and there's decor and the walls full of stuff

1444
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
yeah it's a little dark

1445
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
there's stained glass probably some inherent kind of 60s 70s feel

1446
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
because it's when a lot of them opened

1447
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
maybe a lemon rind with like 151 they light on fire

1448
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
sure I haven't had that but that sounds fun

1449
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
I forget where that's in like Echo Park

1450
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I forget the name of that place

1451
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I don't know if it's an Acapulco or an El Torito

1452
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
like some of the local chains

1453
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
probably closer to that which I and I have plenty of fondness for El Torito

1454
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
I will like tolerate that kind of

1455
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
but it's shockers that like I can't believe I didn't like the chips

1456
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
the chips is kind of my big

1457
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
tortilla chips are I try to eat healthy in every other area

1458
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
so that I can just shovel tortilla chips

1459
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
you know possibly multiple times a day

1460
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
wow I didn't know this

1461
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
yeah fair enough

1462
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
but I will absolutely go to town

1463
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
what type of chips like what are you have a brand do you have multiple brands

1464
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I mean lately it's just like I try to go

1465
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
it's like Trader Joe's unsalted gluten free

1466
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
like let's step it down as many levels as we can

1467
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
but I still am going to eat like the full meals worth

1468
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
for no reason it's the biggest thing I should watch

1469
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I will just like absolutely tear them up

1470
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I was shocked that these I did not want more of them

1471
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
so I'm like oh man are we in a bad territory because Aaron didn't really like hers

1472
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
mine I went with Carnitas tacos

1473
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
which was recommended by a

1474
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
food blog that I read and I definitely liked it more than Aaron did

1475
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
fine totally fine I think this is a place

1476
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
where the sauces are doing a lot of heavy lifting

1477
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
so if you go here make sure that you're doing something that is sauce forward

1478
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I think Aaron's was rescued by it being Christmas style

1479
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
just make sure you're seeing a sauce

1480
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
in that listing because like I think that

1481
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
I think we're dealing with pretty basic I think like inherent

1482
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
flavor and juice of meats is not

1483
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
necessarily incredible what do you mean

1484
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Christmas style is that like a wet burrito

1485
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
green sauce red sauce I think so now I have to remember

1486
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
because I didn't have something

1487
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Christmas style I know I've had that somewhere

1488
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I thought it means that it has a little piece of reindeer in it

1489
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Aaron famously vegetarian

1490
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
but she makes an exception

1491
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
for reindeer

1492
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
she makes an exception for Christmas spirit

1493
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
what is it I know I think your

1494
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I think your description was fairly accurate

1495
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
yeah red and green sauce

1496
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
but it's fun you know like not bad

1497
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
and I didn't feel bad after the fact

1498
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I've seen reviews and I've seen vloggers

1499
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
go to this place and get it out of the way

1500
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
as I got stuff out of the way at the top of this they started by saying

1501
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
and I'll tell you all about the food spoiler didn't make

1502
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
me sick I think the possibility was

1503
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
so high before that Denver locals like that's

1504
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
the first thing you have to address is I'm like

1505
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I understand I'm like probably everybody wanted to be here

1506
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
it's so fun I'm sure it was fun even pre-train Matt

1507
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
but like if that possibility is so high

1508
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
again other than for you guys who I feel like would have been

1509
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
at the prior version on a monthly basis that's true yeah

1510
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
extra steam please I would say

1511
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I'm trying to figure out

1512
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
how to steam carnitas Scott good move

1513
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I think carnitas usually pretty safe

1514
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I think the worst thing you can do to it it's just dry

1515
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
it out yeah well I think that's how it was

1516
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
but then they put like a decent that's what you see

1517
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
yeah that's what the steam is well that's moist

1518
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
yeah maybe I might have liked it more if they'd I hope they didn't take out

1519
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
all of the steamers they should have in tribute to the

1520
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
to the original process they should have kept a few steamers

1521
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
but anyway it is also also shockingly

1522
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
neither of us really cared for the drinks

1523
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
we found the drinks pretty sugary and like

1524
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
okay that's too but so we're a little like oh we're loved but are we

1525
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
are we in the territory of theming is good but the foods

1526
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
not great and it's improved but there was nowhere to go but

1527
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
up from like you might go to the hospital

1528
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
the drinks were redeemed a little bit later by

1529
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
again this is from the same review said to avoid the

1530
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
margaritas and get something called El Diablo which is

1531
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,000
a mezcal drink and that I thought was

1532
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
actually spectacular I thought it was a really good drink so again

1533
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
being that mine are stolen from another

1534
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,000
food review I thought they're they're fairly vetted

1535
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I don't think I could speak to don't take my food recommendations

1536
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
but I took mine from another one so listeners if you're going

1537
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
El Diablo and carnitas tacos and what

1538
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
strain of sticky Colorado Cush

1539
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
did you enjoy beforehand

1540
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
yeah yeah

1541
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
no I got the yeah I got the Grateful Dead

1542
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
specific varietal yeah they've been working up some

1543
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
personally approved yeah yeah yeah

1544
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
that's what the guy did you see the new store I met

1545
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
send it the guy who snuck a bong into

1546
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
the sphere and got been banned

1547
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
and has been banned from all Madison Square

1548
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
MSG oh no Mike's

yeah and I haven't been put on there thank God but I

1551
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
won't try the bong now I know Dolan's no list is really

1552
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
something given that his yes list contains some of the

1553
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
worst human beings who have ever walked the earth

1554
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
yeah

1555
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
anyways you

1556
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
also you don't have to get all your drinks at the table because there are four

1557
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
bars all over this place which I don't think there were before

1558
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
on the way out the door a local said that there are

1559
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
activations that when you order a drink asked about

1560
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
the activation and I was running out of time and I

1561
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
didn't get to do it so I don't know what it is so listeners

1562
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
when you order a drink ask about the activation

1563
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I really want to know what that it's some something with lighting or something

1564
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
pops up some little secret I don't know I wish I knew

1565
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
now we're starting to review this thing not

1566
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
in the best terms food wise but we're being kind of forgiven

1567
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
because we're in the best mood ever yeah

1568
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
and then the soap appears

1569
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
stage comes the soap appears are free

1570
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
with the meal as our sodas I thought that was funny

1571
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
free with the meal

1572
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
but so

1573
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
soap appears change everything these are this is everything

1574
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
that Cartman made them out to be this

1575
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
it was like the definition of great taste in your

1576
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
mouth on the way out the door I don't care that we were disappointed

1577
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
by the first step these are incredible I don't even know how

1578
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
to they're like Mexican pastry bites

1579
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
and they're so soft intent like they're hollow inside

1580
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
so they just like crumble as soon as your mouth

1581
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
touches them and it oh my

1582
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
god just so so delicious and like

1583
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
like covered in hot like that like they're all just like

1584
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
fried up they all just do like a little fire bath and then somebody's like

1585
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
squirting honey on it as it goes

1586
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
just like really simple I think this is like a

1587
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
three ingredient item I don't know how they do it

1588
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
but like these are they're they're unbelievable

1589
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
and this was the most satisfying in terms of like what

1590
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
South Park promised soap appears soap appears please

1591
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
watching his like drunkenness on them

1592
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
and and the flag and you get to do the flag I don't know if

1593
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
this place invented the flag I don't know if they

1594
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I mean obviously they predate Bubba Gump I don't know the

1595
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
history of the thing that waves the server down

1596
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
but it's great and they put new flags

1597
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
at every table the beautiful that are like

1598
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
like really well chosen fabric

1599
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
a beautiful pattern the logo I love the

1600
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Casa Bonita logo so much I found the flag

1601
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
so charming I wanted to take one home with me and I did

1602
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
they sell the flag wow smart

1603
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
flag at home and my son plays with it and we play like

1604
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
let's play dinner time and he raises the flag and we

1605
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
it really stuck with him and that's all you want is you know

1606
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
my you just want experiences that they are still talking about weeks

1607
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
later you're talking about so many aspects of this

1608
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
as am I that's what happens when my daughter wants to watch

1609
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
the Chuck E. Cheese me and my friends video again

1610
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
as she comes up to me and she goes she just starts

1611
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,000
flapping her wings like Helen Henney and then points at the TV

1612
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
that's the signal she just flaps

1613
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
she gets this like little smile on her face

1614
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
and she starts flapping and then she points to the TV and I go

1615
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
you want to watch me and my friends with Chuck E. and she's like nods

1616
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
wow yeah wow geez well

1617
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
she's a Tiki Room fan now as well because she went there

1618
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
so then she'll go like Tiki Tiki Tiki like she'll say it a little bit

1619
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,000
but then she'll like if you just play the song on the

1620
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
like boombox then she will be like

1621
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
and she'll point to the TV she wants to watch the video

1622
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
of the Tiki Room wow wow so she'll give

1623
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
there there's yeah she will do the thing where she's like remembers

1624
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
this I don't know that she really remembers being there in person

1625
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
but she should she should probably some if she

1626
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
remembers those things obviously are memorable to her I think

1627
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
the this morning because I was

1628
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
refreshing my memory on some of this stuff and of the South Park

1629
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
episode and I was like filming that scene off

1630
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
the TV and then my son said

1631
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
can we watch the one with the guy running from the police

1632
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
yes we can yes he remembered

1633
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
watching the clip of Carpenter doing the speed running

1634
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
he knows that he was there

1635
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
so anyways soapapias highly

1636
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
recommended I don't know where else in the world serves soapapias

1637
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I'm sure there are places I've just never been to one before

1638
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
but like so much better than the little white

1639
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
triangles that were depicted on South Park

1640
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
like truly transit really really great dessert

1641
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
did you guys eat a plate of them and then call

1642
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
more call for more soapapias I wanted

1643
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
to really badly just to do it I think

1644
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
they aren't endless I think it's like a dollar more

1645
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
which is still the price is right on that yeah and you could go up

1646
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
to the dedicated soapapias stand at any point

1647
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
and just like purchase them piecemeal even once

1648
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
you've left your table because by the way when you leave your table

1649
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,000
the table is done don't leave a jacket

1650
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
there as a blogger said it's not your home base

1651
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
for the night you what you know if they see

1652
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
nobody there they're turning that table right right there's

1653
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
600,000 people to get through you can hang out inside

1654
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
you can go to the little yeah yeah that's what you

1655
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
do you can stay in it as long as you want

1656
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
and that I guess is the area that I'm getting into I'm going to

1657
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
back up a little bit to the cliff diver presentation

1658
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
because there's something important that I forgot about first

1659
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
of all these divers are so great not just with the dives

1660
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
which are obviously very impressive and that they're on these precarious

1661
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
rocks and right next to us so cool

1662
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
also part of it that they're wearing these

1663
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
very 70s like

1664
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
burnt orange shorts that are

1665
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
specifically what Trey and Matt remember

1666
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
and they requested these to be made again to just

1667
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
keep it firmly in that 70s zone

1668
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
so the shorts are custom and they're so you know

1669
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,000
besides the dives themselves it's wrestling they've

1670
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
got the audience in the palm of their they they hype everybody up

1671
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
yeah like almost do it and then they don't

1672
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
they like just like everybody is

1673
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
enthralled with their every move these

1674
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
guys are so great the interplay the way they work everybody

1675
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
up and then there's

1676
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
there's an aspect of this and this is what and here's

1677
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
maybe a little bit of spoiler I might I'm going to issue a few

1678
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
spoiler alerts because I think the audience deserves to have some

1679
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,000
things that I don't yeah run for them I were

1680
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
in like Tokyo Disney territory there's things that I don't want

1681
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
to say right because I think it's fun to just

1682
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
discover this so I'll issue one of those right now it's a small thing

1683
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
but pretty cool there are as I said

1684
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
PA announcements throughout this like

1685
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
kind of encouraging the flow and like you know

1686
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
to go check out the other things to check out the puppet show and then also

1687
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
like hyping people up for the cliff diving and

1688
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
these PA announcements are done by

1689
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Trey Parker himself oh that's funny he put his

1690
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
own voice into it and I am such a fan

1691
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
of him vocally and I'm such a fan of that

1692
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
thing he does where it's like aware and like

1693
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,000
cruddy on purpose and being just like you know this

1694
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,000
like full of shit announcer guy and he gets to do

1695
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
that thing that he's so good at and it plays

1696
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
all night every night in this restaurant

1697
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
the part of me that so badly wanted to be in the fries

1698
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
electronics I'm like god damn it this guy

1699
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
did it he did like exactly my dream

1700
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
like creating a place where his voice

1701
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
is the voice of everything in the place yeah that's awesome

1702
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
and like and it just it adds to the comedy

1703
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
of it because it's sure he's got

1704
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
that tongue-in-cheek thing about the way the way he pronounces but

1705
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
also it feels really sincere

1706
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
too it's just it's like the awareness that it needs

1707
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
so that you to communicate that yes the place is a little

1708
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
hokey but we're all going to just have fun with the hokeyness right

1709
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
and there's stuff like he there's a big

1710
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
buildup you know sometimes the divers just do like a fun

1711
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
show with music and then there's one where there's suspense and the music

1712
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
is a little bit scary and he builds it up and like all

1713
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,000
right ladies and gentlemen your attention to the cliff

1714
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
lagoon the our divers are about to attempt

1715
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
the never before the most dangerous stunt in all the world

1716
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
the bala de canyone and and the

1717
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
silence we need silence please focus everyone

1718
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
and then then the diver gets to like you know

1719
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
he like cracks his knuckles and gets ready and like you know

1720
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
brings everything down for a second everybody silence

1721
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
get a pin drop and then cannonball

1722
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
and then he just does a cannonball that's funny it is like

1723
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
and that's a thing that I think is funny but kids

1724
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
get that is a for everybody that is

1725
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
them writing just good theme parky stuff

1726
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
so great and then also he's

1727
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
guiding traffic to the other stuff are you on your way to

1728
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
the puppet show you should be it starts in three minutes

1729
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
and now that's my son's hearing that and now he's starting to tug

1730
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
our sleeves and like yeah are we gonna miss the puppet show I don't

1731
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
want to miss the puppet show yes all right he's becoming like

1732
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Cartman I don't want him to be like Cartman any other capacity but you know

1733
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
what I mean in that one I wanted to be like Cartman in

1734
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,000
that one moment but without the crimes

1735
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
so anyways now we're starting to explore the other stuff oh wait shit I

1736
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
forgot that also while you're even though we were only at the table for like 20 minutes

1737
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
you get so much stuff happening there's the cliff diver shows

1738
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
and you're raising the flag but then also

1739
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
like a monkey walks up a monkey comes up to you

1740
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
and he's wearing the diver shorts

1741
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
like the divers he it's like communicating that he

1742
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
wants to be a diver too and he asks

1743
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
their name and then he spells your kids name

1744
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,000
in sign language and then he spells his own name which is

1745
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
moco so we got original characters is a real monkey

1746
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,000
no no it's a guy oh you know what

1747
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
it was important to clarify because with everything I've described

1748
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
certainly possible

1749
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
it's possible they just have a loose monkey in there

1750
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
I'm glad you asked that no it's a guy in a suit

1751
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,000
and the suit is like it's a get like you know

1752
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,000
you know that they can pull things off really well and not hokey

1753
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
so you know it's a choice that you can just see the

1754
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
break from the head to the body

1755
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
and this clearly was a tradition of

1756
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
I think the monkey would like go get in fights next to the waterfall

1757
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
and like punch the cliff divers off of the cliff

1758
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
and stuff like that and Trey has said he wants

1759
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
to go there sometimes and do shifts as moco

1760
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,000
sure it could have been him I don't know

1761
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
maybe that was the moco I think there were

1762
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
balloon animals there was like a I didn't even understand

1763
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
this story that like a female pirate

1764
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
was going around like recruiting pirates and that was just

1765
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
too confusing to us and food was coming and like

1766
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
we'll talk to you later pirate so I don't know you can follow the pirate plot line

1767
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
now we're getting it's like now it's we're in immersive

1768
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
territory yeah really

1769
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
so then we start walking around let's go see what else

1770
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
there is to do you go into a little town square

1771
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
there is a wishing well I just walk

1772
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
past it listener don't walk past the wishing well I found

1773
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,000
it in a video later there's a face down at the bottom

1774
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
there's a guy talking to you at the bottom of the wishing well

1775
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
there's so many I missed a lot of things and I was there

1776
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
for a while then we get into

1777
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
kind of like the main entertainment zone

1778
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
which is home to the puppet show and

1779
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Black Bart's cave the puppet show

1780
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I will also issue a spoiler alert

1781
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
because they don't

1782
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,000
allow you to film it wow they're really

1783
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:44,000
strict about not filming this puppet show I

1784
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
not exactly sure why that is but I don't

1785
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I want to respect their rules and like I guess

1786
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
they just really want people to come experience it for themselves

1787
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
yeah a puppet show one of the things in Cartman

1788
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
speed run I think he doesn't have time to do it I think the

1789
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
cops block his way so I got to see

1790
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,000
it and he didn't the puppet show is

1791
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
so much fun it is a little like

1792
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
puppet show variety show hosted by

1793
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Mexican food again the narrator is

1794
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Trey Parker and he does a big build up of

1795
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
ladies and gentlemen your host a taco

1796
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
and then it's a mix of pre-recorded stuff that

1797
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
they do and then live performers

1798
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
who are there right operating puppets in this weird way

1799
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,000
where it's like they're pulling the trigger of a gun like you just

1800
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
see like they just have like a black glove

1801
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,000
over some kind of black mechanism and they're just pulling it back

1802
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
and forth so they're like they're operating a puppet gun

1803
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
and then you get like little variety show

1804
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,000
acts with like there's a chip

1805
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
that does a cliff dive into

1806
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
a really teeny bowl of salsa

1807
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
and a big build up to that and then when he hits

1808
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
it goes black and they're screaming an ambulance

1809
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
sounds like he didn't make it and then

1810
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
whatever Trey Parker narration like oh no so sorry so sorry

1811
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
I had to see that not only is his voice in it

1812
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
there's like a living rock

1813
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
and a tree and it's their two voices

1814
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
and we are now in country bear jamboree territory

1815
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
this is where I started to get like really

1816
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
emotional I knew that they made this restaurant

1817
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
look nicer I knew that they fixed the paint

1818
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
and made the food better I didn't know

1819
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
that this is Trey Parker's opportunity to do his own

1820
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
country bear jamboree so cool

1821
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,000
again rich celebrities

1822
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
spend money they spend their money on the most inane

1823
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
shit and like brand expansions

1824
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
who is doing anything as cool as setting up their own

1825
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
personal country bear jamboree

1826
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
that's the dream yeah that's the dream

1827
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
they really did it they did it and it's what whenever

1828
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Cartman comes into a lot of money he does stuff like this

1829
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
he bought an amusement park at one point so that he didn't

1830
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
have to ever wait in line he turned his hot dog

1831
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
place into a fun restaurant they like they did what

1832
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Cartman did yeah it's crazy

1833
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
so that anyway the show is just so fun my son and I

1834
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
are both laughing like Walt Disney's dream

1835
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
it works for both of us it's bringing us all together

1836
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
then they encourage all the audience to say

1837
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
more sopapias please together

1838
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
and then from the ceiling of the puppet theater

1839
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
comes a sopapia swinging

1840
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
on a swing like swinging teddy bear wow

1841
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
really yeah yes they fully do

1842
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,000
real country bear jamboree stuff I was gonna say

1843
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
up until that point you could

1844
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
maybe a plausible deniability that that was country bears

1845
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
or that they're in like there's other versions of shows

1846
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
yeah they're in Chuck E. Cheese territory or something

1847
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I still have yet to find some sort of an interview with them where they

1848
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,000
just talk about like Disneyland and stuff yeah

1849
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
and I don't know that they're I don't

1850
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I'm not gonna guess that they are nerds to the degree

1851
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
that we are but I think they took trips that had a big impact

1852
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
on them could they name all of the bear rugs

1853
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
probably not I know the full history

1854
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
of Figment but clearly they locked into

1855
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
that song I think they had like really formative

1856
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Disneyland or Disney World trips

1857
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
that like added for all of the first four South Park

1858
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
being like super cynical

1859
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
and super dirty and profane and whatever

1860
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
there is like just sincerity at times to the

1861
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
entertainment and to the storytelling and I feel like I don't know

1862
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
I think they have that theme park gene in them that probably helps

1863
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I'm just curious yeah about how far it goes

1864
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
because it's clearly pretty far

1865
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I mean yes I was thinking about you as soon as I saw this

1866
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
and you having identified that like alright

1867
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
it felt like a sequel to them doing a clear tribute to Journey into Imagination

1868
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
yeah they have put money

1869
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
into a Swingin' Teddy Barra tribute

1870
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
yeah the Journey into Imagination specifically

1871
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
because like you know we've seen country bear parodies here and there

1872
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,000
there's a country bear parody in The Critic that I really like

1873
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
and when Duke has his own country bear

1874
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
like Jambri in his office I don't remember this

1875
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I forget I think he's talking to Jay's I forget the name

1876
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,000
of some of the characters Jay's girlfriend what's her name

1877
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,000
yeah I remember and he's talking about how you know us southern people

1878
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
people all think that we're a certain way or whatever and then he hits a button

1879
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
and then like these janky robots come home

1880
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
like where are the bears who sing for Duke do da

1881
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
and then one of the bears burps and I think Duke goes like that dumb

1882
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
belching bear or whatever really funny

1883
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
so like there's stuff like that but I don't know

1884
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,000
the Imagination one always hit me as like wait a minute

1885
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
so you've never seen a reference to that anywhere

1886
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,000
and again it's the thing you had you could only

1887
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,000
it wasn't even in the other parks you had to go to Disney World

1888
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
exactly yeah Dreamfinder specific country bears made it into like the popular

1889
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
like the lexicon yeah calling things a Jambri

1890
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
is like kind of you know kind of like

1891
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
you don't have to be a theme park to know that but

1892
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
but now it's called musical Jambri because they're worried people don't

1893
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
know what a Jambri that's what the new version and that ride in Tokyo is

1894
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
called fairy Tinkerbells whatever

1895
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
busy buggies is that what it's called I kind of almost like

1896
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,000
that one I just don't understand fairy

1897
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,000
no I know it's the same we really don't understand we haven't communicated

1898
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
that Tinkerbell is a fair like superhero

1899
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Avengers campus yeah I guess they

1900
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
just do some testing and there's like five percent of the audience doesn't know

1901
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
it so they're like we can't take any chances finding Nemo parentheses

1902
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,000
fish submarine voyage yeah

1903
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
that it does feel like the way it's going where you're like it's called

1904
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
country musical Jambarino really

1905
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
does it have to be called that Matterhorn Mountain with a

1906
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
monster inside right Matterhorn

1907
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Mountain like a thing you can see

1908
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
on earth for real

1909
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,000
rocks but not really right

1910
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Alice Jay Sherman's girlfriend is

1911
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Alice oh thank God thank you I was checking

1912
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,000
just to make sure it wasn't Helen oh yeah

1913
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,000
she's pretty well developed

1914
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
yeah anyways

1915
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
also the sopopea

1916
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
which it was as I said the shining

1917
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,000
part of the meal the sopopea being the

1918
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
beauty of the show was so the

1919
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
glamorous the Miss Piggy of this was

1920
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
so perfect and it also came right after another one that's like

1921
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,000
the beef combo and the beef combo just like

1922
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,000
looked like what the food really looks like yeah

1923
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
done very like it's just like very mundane

1924
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,000
kind of brown food and it kind of like couldn't figure out anything funny

1925
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
to do and that felt like their comment on like kind of

1926
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
the plainness of the food sure but the sopopea is the star

1927
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
of the show the elegant sopopea

1928
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
I was so excited in this moment my son is having

1929
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,000
so much fun I am like I just I'm so

1930
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
high on how well they pulled this off and

1931
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
the personal touches from them and then I get to

1932
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
walk a couple of feet and go into Black Barts Cave

1933
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
again I've never been in this place before I

1934
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
didn't grow up with Black Barts Cave why am I

1935
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,000
tearing up the site of Black Barts Cave

1936
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
all I know this from is an episode of South Park

1937
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
where it's said really flippantly by the worst child on earth

1938
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
well Black Barts Cave scary and he goes through it and

1939
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
it specifically looks terrible it's like a very

1940
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,000
as they portray it on the show it's an almost empty room

1941
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
with two skeletons lying on the ground and yet

1942
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,000
just the mythology of this and the build up and that

1943
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,000
we are like you know in another part of the

1944
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
country in a place we've never been and I don't know

1945
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
maybe the maybe the high elevation is making me more

1946
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
misty or something too I don't know what it is but

1947
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,000
either way I swear I tear up in a way that I haven't

1948
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
maybe for a themed experience since like

1949
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,000
opening day Galaxy's Edge where they were all

1950
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
applauding as we were coming in or being in Disney

1951
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Sea and seeing the volcano for the first time Black

1952
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Barts Cave made me feel that way and now

1953
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I'm like dashing in there and

1954
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
dragging my son and missing the fact that it's very

1955
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,000
dark and he's afraid of dark places and there's

1956
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,000
signs that say like maybe too scary for youngins

1957
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
and he's like what is this I'm like don't worry about

1958
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
it's gonna be fun and then Aaron has to go up and like

1959
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
no Scott no he's like this is

1960
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
clearly too scared he's scared and he's not even in it yet

1961
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
okay fine sorry I am so just determined

1962
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,000
to get into Black Barts Cave I have blinders on

1963
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,000
so he is seized back to the front of the line

1964
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I go in it myself boy is this not disappoint

1965
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
this is like it's like the Snow White ride it's like

1966
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
it's like the way those Fantasyland rides are kind of

1967
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,000
like claustrophobic like the way like I forget which one

1968
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,000
is more like cavern and you're just like going through little turns

1969
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,000
and it's really creepy or it's a little

1970
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
bit and you know actually you know what it starts a little bit Snow White

1971
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,000
and like Dwarves Mine and all that and then it becomes

1972
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
like Mr. Toad because they

1973
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,000
had to do a little bit of like figuring out okay

1974
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,000
the people who thought of this did not do any math about what

1975
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Black Bart is but we have to because like

1976
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
wait hang on he's like is he

1977
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,000
a pirate or is he an old west guy and why does

1978
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,000
he if he's an old west guy then why does he have a cave

1979
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
and why like it was just it was too many mythologies at once

1980
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
and I think they did a little clarification but I think Trey Parker

1981
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
like they put like the head of South Park's story on this

1982
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
like the guy who conceives of the stories for the video

1983
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:44,000
games right he is working out the story

1984
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
of Black Bart's cave and I think Trey ultimately encouraged like

1985
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I think it is just ten things all at once I think let's just

1986
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
like lay into the confusion and that yeah you go into an

1987
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,000
it's an old west guy's cave but

1988
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,000
then there's a dragon in it and you go into the

1989
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
dragon's mouth and it has a beating heart so what

1990
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,000
like you sense that they were just like I don't know

1991
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
just like kitchen sink throw it all in whatever

1992
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
they kind of see the idea that like

1993
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Black Bart is like hiding his treasure and

1994
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,000
putting up fake booby traps to stop you from going

1995
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
in to get it and like so there's like jump scares

1996
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,000
which I'm glad my son got out of there but the jump scares

1997
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
are fake and set up by Black Bart so you don't

1998
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
get his treasure and you keep hearing like

1999
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,000
full throttle Trey Parker voice as things pop up

2000
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
and like there's no treasure in here turn back

2001
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,000
and then you get

2002
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,000
to the treasure and it is like

2003
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,000
it's very pirates and there's this wonderful shimmery

2004
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,000
light and it's gold and glowy everywhere so it's

2005
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,000
like coins and gold bars but then also

2006
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,000
a 70s evil Knievel lunchbox

2007
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,000
so it's like a 70s child's idea of what the

2008
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
ultimate treasure would be. That's funny. But then

2009
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,000
it starts to say like say your prayers varmint you're done fur

2010
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,000
and then you go into a very Mr. Toad hell

2011
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
dragon's mouth. Again they've

2012
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,000
like they've already done their pirates in their Mexico pavilion

2013
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,000
and now there's like a tiny walk through that's like a fantasy land

2014
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,000
ride. Wow. I am just so lit up

2015
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,000
and then like alright

2016
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
well I guess we're wrapping up and it's almost bedtime

2017
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000
so we better get out of here. Wait what's up those stairs?

2018
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Giant arcade. Still an arcade to go

2019
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,000
and we walk up the stairs okay here's arcade and

2020
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,000
a shooting gallery and a root beer bar.

2021
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,000
There's root beer on tap.

2022
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Now I'm interested. No he's crying he's crying

2023
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,000
he's tearing up. I'm just sobbing.

2024
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Root beer on tap what a good idea

2025
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,000
for kids that's awesome and they don't get to go to bar

2026
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,000
I always love that I feel like I don't ever

2027
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
drink root beer but I romanticize the idea of it

2028
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,000
like I wish it was more like I imagine

2029
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,000
where it's big and frosty and cold mugs

2030
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
do either of you get

2031
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,000
root beer at restaurants I guess but

2032
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
he pours root beer in a cereal every morning. I love it on tap

2033
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
yeah I love like real tapped root beer.

2034
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Where else are you getting tapped root beer?

2035
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,000
You see it so rarely I feel like maybe nots

2036
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
or like places. Maybe somewhere yeah.

2037
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,000
That do root beer float do like

2038
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
a lot of root beer floats in a frosty mug.

2039
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,000
There was an A&W in Woodfield

2040
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,000
and I feel like maybe actually I don't

2041
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I'm trying to remember in my mind they had that but maybe it wasn't

2042
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,000
maybe it was shitty. I think I was driving

2043
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,000
from Ithaca to Pennsylvania once and I pulled into

2044
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,000
an A&W I went inside and it was just

2045
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
like it was bad unlimited no well the food was

2046
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
nothing yeah but they had a keg of root beer

2047
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,000
and they gave you a frosty mug. Oh a keg

2048
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,000
and you did a keg stand on it.

2049
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Doing a keg stand on the sugar root beer yeah.

2050
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,000
I'm thinking like well you know what like the

2051
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,000
video the old video game Tapper that

2052
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
factors into Wreck-It Ralph oh yeah yeah

2053
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Is that beer or is it root beer? Do they make it root beer

2054
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,000
because it's for kids? Probably right? I don't know the answer.

2055
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,000
I'm not entirely yeah I'm not entirely sure but I always like

2056
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,000
I guess I've never thought about this before that like

2057
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,000
you know you can't drink I didn't want to drink beer when I was a kid but I love the idea

2058
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
of like kegs, wood going up to a

2059
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
bar, saloon style like I wanted

2060
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
like the 1910s idea and that a guy with

2061
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:38,000
a twirling mustache and a bowler hat would serve

2062
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,000
it to me like root beer as the in between

2063
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,000
of like it's like a I don't know I don't know like

2064
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,000
a bar that a child is allowed to be at that also

2065
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:50,000
feels like the old west. Yeah maybe Huckleberry Hound is

2066
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
around he's on the. That absolutely works yes.

2067
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,000
The cowboys of Mumaesa did not drink alcohol

2068
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,000
but they certainly sidled up to a bar

2069
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,000
or two in their day. Did they make a point of being

2070
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,000
straight at were they specifically sober and talked about it?

2071
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,000
I don't know if there was any beer in the world.

2072
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Mumaesa was a dry mesa. Baby X's on their

2073
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,000
hands if you're wondering. This is a question I guess

2074
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,000
in a lot of cinematic universes

2075
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:20,000
do they have alcohol? Which is

2076
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,000
it's very satisfying when it's answered like Star Wars and then when

2077
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,000
you maybe get to go experience it to some extent for yourself.

2078
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
I mean everyone has a different answer.

2079
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,000
I don't know we could go through them quickly but

2080
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,000
the MCU does but it's they you know

2081
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Tony Stark was drunk in one scene in Iron Man 2.

2082
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Okay. That was as close as they were getting to his

2083
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:44,000
demon in a bottle alcoholic arc. Is there a prominent like and I'm not

2084
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,000
talking about like getting a beer on Earth in the MCU

2085
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
which is like one of the planets have a drink.

2086
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Is there a prominent MCU like weird space drink?

2087
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Oh that's a good question. I don't know that off the top of my head.

2088
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
And if not would you like to invent one? Yeah I mean is like

2089
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Xandar. Is there some sort of Xandarian drink? Maybe.

2090
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
I'm trying to remember. I mean in Star Trek

2091
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,000
there's Romulan ale. That's the big one.

2092
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,000
It's an illegal drink. I don't know if it's

2093
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
been made legal in other like other future Star Treks

2094
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,000
or I should say recent Star Trek. Picard has a

2095
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,000
winery. Picard has a winery but wine yeah wine is

2096
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,000
legal. Yeah. But Romulan ale is like absent

2097
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
or something. Oh I see. Oh that's kind of exciting.

2098
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
There's like somebody will pull it out behind like I got a little of this.

2099
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Has there ever been a physical place like the Vegas Star Trek experience

2100
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,000
where you could get Romulan ale? You could get it at the Star Trek

2101
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
experience. Wow. But I don't know if there's a current place.

2102
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,000
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

2103
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Got my hands on some Romulan ale. I really really

2104
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,000
want to go on a Star Trek cruise or finally go to start

2105
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,000
the big Star Trek con in Vegas in August. I don't know that

2106
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
I'll do it this year but. It's never occurred to me that you would go on a

2107
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Star Trek cruise. I mean I remember your enthusiasm

2108
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,000
similar to mine in this episode when we talked about the Star Trek cruise

2109
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
but I don't think I thought through that you kind of want to do it.

2110
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,000
I do want to do it yeah. All the oldest

2111
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,000
character actors are there.

2112
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Mike's recipe for good party as we know. Yeah.

2113
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Free alcohol and possible presence of Armin Schimmer.

2114
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Armin Schimmer. I think he'll be at both. I think he's doing

2115
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
the rounds. So yeah yeah for sure.

2116
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Well they have to serve some equivalent of Romulan ale you would have to imagine.

2117
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Yeah so right. Maybe it's not like Paramount

2118
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,000
approved necessarily but someone is doing it.

2119
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Someone is making Romulan ale. Thank God. When Paramount's

2120
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,000
away the cats will play. Paramount though I do

2121
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
think licensed an official Picard winery wine

2122
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,000
at some point. Oh well that'd be worth it. I should try that.

2123
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
This is a whole area I guess. The Star Trek. Star Trek

2124
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,000
beverages. We should see if we can get our hands on them do some taste test.

2125
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Sure. That sounds like an episode to me. Yeah.

2126
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Anyway at this point I thought I was wrapping it up and when

2127
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
I just saw that there was a root beer bar I was like

2128
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
get another drink here we go. And I went and got that old Diablo.

2129
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Oh yeah. And I sent out a bunch of fun with

2130
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Ski Ball and like it was just like well chosen arcade

2131
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
games and there was a shooting

2132
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,000
gallery which was having only done the first

2133
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,000
shooting gallery of my life several days prior.

2134
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I've just never really done them. Like kind of old style shooting

2135
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,000
galleries where there's a little set and they like you activate

2136
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,000
little effects and I discovered in this one which I'll

2137
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,000
get into in a future episode how precise they are

2138
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
and how bad I was at them. So then several days

2139
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,000
later I'm in the Casa Benita one it's very forgiving. Right. They just want

2140
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
you to like turn on all the stuff. Sure. Like you know

2141
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
there's like a big bear and a sombrero and

2142
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
like you know snakes you can make kiss and then a skunk

2143
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:44,000
that spins around and sprays. It has spray in it.

2144
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,000
That's great. It's like beyond like you know

2145
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
deep down in the list of cool things about this. One of the

2146
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,000
coolest shooting galleries I've ever seen. Next to the root

2147
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,000
beer bar this whole zone was so charming and then I

2148
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
saw like an outhouse door that says knock

2149
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:02,000
first and I was like that's a clue. That means I'm

2150
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,000
supposed to knock. And then I told my son to do it

2151
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
and I'm like I bet I know where this is going and quickly

2152
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,000
there were big farts and poop sounds

2153
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,000
and a guy saying I'm going to be a while

2154
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
and this is the most up my four year

2155
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:20,000
old's alley. He has lit up ever since he's been saying

2156
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
let's play knock on doors and we have to

2157
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
respond with poop or fart sounds. So that stayed

2158
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
with he took so many things back home with him from

2159
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,000
this situation. We're just

2160
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,000
like truly in a dead. When we round that other corner this

2161
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,000
is where it starts to click in like I think over the course

2162
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
of really we've done a lot of it this year because this year we've talked about

2163
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Bullwinkles and Rainforest Cafe and all the

2164
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,000
stuff in the city walk Orlando Saga and this idea

2165
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,000
of like the restaurant that's so huge

2166
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000
that it has like twists and turns and corners

2167
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,000
and that's up there and you can't possibly do it in

2168
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,000
one visit. I feel like you know so often these

2169
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
things get worn down and like you know bought out by

2170
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
something else and it gets shittier and like the dream of what it was

2171
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:08,000
like wow there's five rooms and all this stuff.

2172
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,000
This is like the most I've ever experienced

2173
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
this modern day and certainly the

2174
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,000
got to be the only one that is like new

2175
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:20,000
in twenty twenty one or whenever I think it would open

2176
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,000
last year I guess actually to the public but like

2177
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,000
at the height of its power

2178
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
possibly. Yes it is like what we're

2179
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
describing. This genre of restaurant all reached the height of its power

2180
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
in like nineteen eighty three. Right. With the exception

2181
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
of this place. This is the only one that is

2182
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
at its best right now. Right. It's so cool.

2183
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,000
It's everything we want. It's the detail

2184
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,000
like it's all the details and the extra shit

2185
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
that if a computer were to crunch numbers

2186
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,000
is superfluous. Yes. This is the whole thing.

2187
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,000
It's the first to go. How does that help the bottom line?

2188
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Actually it might specifically really hurt the bottom line

2189
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:02,000
and I understand at some point the need to be

2190
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,000
profitable and to run a business that makes sense.

2191
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
I don't care about that but yeah go ahead. Well I

2192
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,000
don't care about it. I shouldn't care about it.

2193
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,000
I understand the concept of that.

2194
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
I understand on some level the idea that you would start a restaurant and want to make money

2195
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,000
on it and that's why

2196
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
I think we've run into this before. The only way

2197
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
we can have these places that we want is if they are going

2198
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
to lose money. Is if they are going to be big financial

2199
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
disasters. God bless these guys

2200
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
for being willing and seemingly excited to set up

2201
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,000
a big financial disaster. Sure. I saw it too

2202
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,000
that like so the weights

2203
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
it kind of makes sense now learning about the quality of the

2204
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:47,000
food that rather than the wait staff

2205
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,000
relying on tips everyone's just making

2206
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
$30 an hour. Yes, yeah. They just like

2207
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,000
really upped the standard of what everybody makes

2208
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
which helps the speed of everything and that's great and

2209
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,000
they kind of retained the staff

2210
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,000
when they bought it and everybody who was still on board

2211
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
when COVID hit they kept them employed

2212
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
and they just like you kept them on the payroll and sent them

2213
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
to like volunteer and go to soup kitchens

2214
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,000
and like places that

2215
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,000
helped the needy. So yeah, they like they employed everybody

2216
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,000
up their salaries sent them out to do charity

2217
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,000
work. Cool. Great.

2218
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,000
So that aspect of it too. They're like they're treating

2219
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,000
people right. At this point the night actually

2220
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,000
is winding down. We got to put the kid out of bed. How long have you been here?

2221
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Two hours and we could have easily we were saying like

2222
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
at least one more. I think there's I think there's possibly

2223
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,000
a four hour version of writing in this place. I don't

2224
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,000
think that would be a stretch at all because then there's entire rooms

2225
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,000
that I missed. If you don't do the cliffside dining

2226
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,000
you probably end up seating sitting in a whole area that I just

2227
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
ran through really fast which was like you're in a

2228
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
mine and there's explosions that go off and there's

2229
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,000
a love tester down there. There's a fortune telling prospector

2230
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,000
named a Sayer Joe. Whoa.

2231
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:08,000
And I don't know what he is but I bet if I put money into him

2232
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
he might talk with Trey Parker's voice too. Probably.

2233
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Like you also part of the dream of this kind of restaurant we've

2234
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,000
we've described in like pine forest and that we've never gotten to go to

2235
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,000
is the possibility of getting lost. And I did get lost.

2236
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,000
I couldn't find Aaron. I don't know where they went.

2237
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
This is exactly what a restaurant big enough that an adult

2238
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,000
can legitimately get lost in there. They pulled it off.

2239
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,000
They did it here. I didn't get to see

2240
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Sor Soro the magician. I don't know

2241
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
what the hell that is. I missed that there is a place

2242
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,000
to take a picture with Cartman that they gave him

2243
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,000
permanently. Whoa really. The booth where he

2244
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,000
ordered sopapias. That just now has

2245
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,000
a big weird Cartman at it and that's kind of the only

2246
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:54,000
real South Park nod. I think they were very

2247
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,000
spare. They put their own voice in but it's like feels very organic

2248
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,000
to the experience. They didn't make it like subtly South

2249
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Park the restaurant. Right. And I appreciate that about it. I think

2250
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,000
there's somewhere where you can find Man Bear Pig but I didn't

2251
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
find that either. Stuff I missed. I barely saw

2252
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,000
something you put money into and a bunch of puppet monkeys

2253
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,000
dance around. I barely got to see the museum. There is

2254
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,000
so much. I've never seen a restaurant

2255
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,000
with this much stuff to do. I think you're underselling

2256
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,000
it even calling it a restaurant. It's like an indoor theme park.

2257
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,000
It is the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants. They absolutely

2258
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,000
earned it. I also I appreciate

2259
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
that they didn't like you know again

2260
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,000
that I don't think these guys are that crass in their need to like

2261
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,000
make money at every turn. They didn't like fill it with like South

2262
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Park merch. I was like will this be then will you get to the end

2263
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
and it's South Park merch. Instead you get to the Mercado. You get

2264
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
to this like wonderfully rendered gift

2265
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
shop and it's so

2266
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,000
many items with the logo on it and

2267
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,000
boy is it a great logo. It's a beautiful website.

2268
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I love everything about it. Just like perfect 70s

2269
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,000
aesthetic. I've never spent more a gift shop in my entire

2270
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:06,000
life. I bought so much stuff. I got the flag.

2271
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
I bought a bar mat for my friend.

2272
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I bought a shirt. It's an old banner

2273
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
like very like 70s theme park style or

2274
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,000
like pennant I guess. Yeah that's what I meant.

2275
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
And for you gentlemen

2276
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,000
I got a couple of Costa Veneta

2277
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
shot glasses

2278
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,000
of the bubble wrap.

2279
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,000
They're kind of like

2280
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:36,000
warm yellow adobe style.

2281
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Yeah really cool. The tower of the restaurant is in the

2282
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000
logo. And it looks old.

2283
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Yeah it feels very 70s but it's made nicely.

2284
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:48,000
You're welcome. Even though I know I made the

2285
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,000
assessment in the moment in the past Mike you have

2286
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:54,000
been flummoxed by why somebody

2287
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,000
would have a shot glass in the home because you're not really doing shots

2288
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,000
at home you said. But I still made the calculation

2289
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,000
that you might be able to get your head around it.

2290
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,000
If you want to have a precise pour.

2291
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,000
It's a perfect yes.

2292
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Exactly a one shot drink.

2293
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,000
If you want to not over pour.

2294
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:18,000
It's usually one and a half tablespoons

2295
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,000
or two tablespoons. So you could

2296
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,000
use it for like measuring coffee too.

2297
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Coffee beans.

2298
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,000
That's true.

2299
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Are you relieved to hear that there are many

2300
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,000
things that you can do that aren't doing a dreadful shot

2301
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,000
in the comfort of your own home? I am relieved to hear

2302
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:42,000
that yes. Many uses you see.

2303
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,000
You could bathe your daughter with it. You could also measure

2304
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,000
out if you want to drink it home you measure out a shot poured over ice

2305
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
or poured in a glass.

2306
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,000
That's true. No need to do the shot act.

2307
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Did I do a shot in the last six months? I feel like I did

2308
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,000
and I can't remember where. I feel like I did but

2309
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I don't remember why. Well that means the shot worked baby.

2310
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,000
I guess so yeah. Well I can also just make

2311
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,000
an upside down hat for one of my plushes.

2312
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:12,000
That's very good yes.

2313
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Or I hate to summon more drunkenness in your home

2314
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,000
but you could put it over the head of

2315
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:21,000
party animal Michelangelo.

2316
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Or party Angelo as I call him.

2317
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,000
And make it look like it's kind of like a lamp shade

2318
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:30,000
over his head. Well it would work for my quarter scale

2319
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Michelangelo because he's this big.

2320
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Perfect fit. I bought guitars for all my quarter scale turtles.

2321
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,000
You bought separate guitars really?

2322
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Yeah because Fender will make a tiny quarter scale guitar.

2323
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,000
So you sized out what will match? Exactly.

2324
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,000
You bought special guitars

2325
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,000
for your four special guys. That's correct.

2326
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,000
And now that's the second round of turtles that have guitars

2327
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,000
because I have of course the quarter scale coming out of our shells turtles

2328
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,000
as well that came with their instruments.

2329
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
But in this case you had to make them

2330
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,000
musicians. Exactly. That's nice.

2331
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Okay well yeah enjoy those.

2332
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:12,000
I just wanted to have the logo in my house a lot

2333
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,000
and have the memories of this place a lot.

2334
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,000
If it's not clear enough I was so blown away by this place.

2335
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,000
I felt exactly like Cardman after the speed run

2336
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,000
after he himself did the cliff dive.

2337
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Just in an absolute daze. Was it worth it? Totally.

2338
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,000
I went 100% there. I didn't want to leave.

2339
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,000
I said goodbye wistfully sadly

2340
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
like I was leaving Disney World as did my son.

2341
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,000
None of us wanted to leave. I'm dying to go back.

2342
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,000
If I could figure out a way to go back.

2343
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,000
This place, I think what's so beautiful about it

2344
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,000
it's like the dream of one crazy guy

2345
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,000
and what happens to the dream of one crazy guy.

2346
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Corporations, it just gets run into the ground

2347
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
by some bland weird entity and it gets worse and worse

2348
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
until it becomes silly and not what it used to be.

2349
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,000
This is the only scenario I've ever seen

2350
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,000
a crazy guy and then two crazier guys

2351
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,000
did something even crazier with it.

2352
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:12,000
I really commend them for it

2353
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,000
and also for, as you were saying, it's in the Tarantino zone.

2354
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Celebrities, look, everybody's trying to be an entrepreneur.

2355
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Everybody's trying to expand their brand portfolio

2356
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,000
and it's all with a bunch of boring shit

2357
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,000
because everybody just slaps their names on

2358
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:30,000
and I'm sorry I don't want to say fighting words

2359
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,000
but things like tequilas, everybody just slaps their names.

2360
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Well, everyone copied a certain couple guys' tequila

2361
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,000
so I agree with you post-Casamigos.

2362
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Some people just slap their names on something

2363
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,000
copying the roguish act of two renegades

2364
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,000
riding through the countryside

2365
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,000
perfectly synced up on the coolest hogs you've ever seen.

2366
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:54,000
It's, by the way, all we're talking about here

2367
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,000
is out of control.

2368
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Every single person has a coffee.

2369
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Robert Downey Jr. has a coffee.

2370
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Dolly Parton announced a new wine.

2371
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Every single person of any prominence now

2372
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:12,000
has some grift that they're in on.

2373
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:15,000
And there's always been that but it used to be cheesy.

2374
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,000
It used to be corny that Ed McMahon had some item.

2375
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Now we want it, we celebrate it.

2376
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
We love hustle and some of these things are fine

2377
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,000
but usually it's a bunch of shit

2378
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:30,000
and at its worst it's celebrities all doing ads for crypto

2379
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,000
and I don't want to get on a high horse about this

2380
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,000
but I was just thinking of the juxtaposition

2381
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:39,000
of today what we encourage, if you made your money

2382
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,000
with creative stuff, you were then supposed to put

2383
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,000
a bunch of money and make a bunch more money

2384
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,000
on just worthless landfill crap, right?

2385
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
That's the idea. It's what we encourage.

2386
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,000
It's what we are dying to get all of our top stars to do.

2387
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,000
In this case, these guys,

2388
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:00,000
they did something that so reflects who they are

2389
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
that is like giving back in a way.

2390
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Yes, it's for profit.

2391
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,000
You got to pay a bunch of money to go there

2392
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:12,000
but it feels like they were like trying to retain

2393
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,000
the magic of the Denver that they grew up with.

2394
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,000
It completely reflects who they are creatively.

2395
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,000
They didn't just slap their name on something

2396
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,000
and go to make a bunch more money so they can invest

2397
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,000
more money in some other crap.

2398
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:30,000
It's just cool. It's really cool what they did

2399
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,000
in a way that in this area

2400
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,000
what famous people do anything this cool?

2401
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Yeah, if you're going to be a millionaire, I guess in this case

2402
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:42,000
they're probably billionaires.

2403
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,000
You may at least be eccentric.

2404
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:48,000
That is valued at a billion at least.

2405
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,000
That's what's insane.

2406
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,000
This is nothing for them.

2407
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:57,000
This is nothing for them.

2408
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Just an easy 40 mil.

2409
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,000
A lark, an eccentric lark.

2410
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Tarantino's rescued two movie theaters at this point.

2411
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Also, there is, I want to say,

2412
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,000
a good on them but a team

2413
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,000
of 25, 30 filmmakers saved the Westwood

2414
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:18,000
historic movie theater.

2415
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,000
That's good. That's cool.

2416
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:24,000
There's 30 of you.

2417
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,000
There's one of him. He rescued two.

2418
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
My question is when is Jason Reitman

2419
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,000
going to start saving some Chuck E. Cheese's?

2420
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,000
On his own.

2421
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Maybe Gil Keenan can help him out.

2422
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:42,000
We know he loves his 80s stuff.

2423
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,000
We're trying to bring back the 80s and his child.

2424
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Put your money where your mouth is and save a lot of those robots.

2425
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,000
I'll give him credit because he does a lot of those stage reading

2426
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:54,000
of scripts at LACMA,

2427
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,000
at the art museum, and I believe tickets for those

2428
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:00,000
that he's usually funding.

2429
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,000
That's the only end to that sentence.

2430
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:06,000
I was going to say funding the art museum, but I'm sure they get to

2431
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:09,000
allocate some of the stuff.

2432
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:12,000
He should pay to flip that art museum into

2433
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,000
a revived Chuck E. Cheese and showbiz pizza.

2434
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Put them all together.

2435
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Only then will I be happy, Mr. Reitman.

2436
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,000
I will say something very Chuck E. Cheese at LACMA.

2437
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,000
There is an art piece that is just a boulder

2438
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,000
and you can walk under the boulder.

2439
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:33,000
I've seen the boulder. That's pretty cool.

2440
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:36,000
George Lucas is doing this.

2441
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,000
He's doing the museum, but you know what I'm talking about.

2442
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:42,000
This giant museum that's being built in LA.

2443
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,000
I don't know what's in it, though.

2444
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:48,000
You've seen the picture, though.

2445
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,000
It's crazy looking and it's huge.

2446
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,000
I think he's financing the whole thing himself.

2447
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Was that supposed to go in Chicago?

2448
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Then it was supposed to go in San Francisco, I think.

2449
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,000
I don't think it will, but it's big enough

2450
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:06,000
to have something fun in it.

2451
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,000
It's going to be good. Something is going to be cool.

2452
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:12,000
He is using his billions.

2453
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,000
I've just started to think that generationally.

2454
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:18,000
A Spielberg or a Lucas have put money back

2455
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:21,000
into the arts.

2456
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Saving things that are important to them.

2457
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,000
When have you seen it in the last decade?

2458
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,000
People spending their creative earned money

2459
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,000
on something really cool doesn't really happen.

2460
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Here's another thing I was thinking about.

2461
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,000
These guys got very, very rich from animation.

2462
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Now they have spent a bunch of money

2463
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,000
on a really risky enterprise.

2464
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,000
A themed enterprise that is partially

2465
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:51,000
to recreate the little town that they grew up in

2466
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:54,000
and to bring back some of the spirit

2467
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,000
of the town that they grew up in

2468
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:00,000
using their cartoon money.

2469
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Does that sound familiar?

2470
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Who else did something like that?

2471
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Maybe a gentleman named Walt fucking Disney.

2472
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Maybe that's who did that.

2473
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Maybe these guys are the only people

2474
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:18,000
following in Walt fucking Disney's footsteps.

2475
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:21,000
You have to have an insanely rich person

2476
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:24,000
that's in charge of all their money

2477
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,000
that just forces something crazy.

2478
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:30,000
I don't know where themed entertainment

2479
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:33,000
would be if the precedent wasn't set

2480
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,000
by Walt Disney to put so much extra crap

2481
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:39,000
in Disneyland.

2482
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Just performers and details and everything.

2483
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:45,000
They got every bit of it right.

2484
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:48,000
You turn a corner and there's this thing over here.

2485
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,000
I've said this before.

2486
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:54,000
If the bar hadn't been set there,

2487
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:57,000
I don't know that we'd ever have anything else

2488
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:00,000
approaching it.

2489
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,000
What comes before Disney is

2490
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Carnivals and Coney Island and stuff.

2491
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,000
You have to include the stuff that inspired him.

2492
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Tivoli Gardens and Knott's was on its way before him,

2493
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,000
but not fully what it became.

2494
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,000
The first out of the gate,

2495
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,000
but really the first modern theme park in a way.

2496
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,000
You're right, if they hadn't set the bar there,

2497
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,000
we would allow theme parks to be

2498
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:30,000
much more rinky-dink, much crudder.

2499
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,000
There's the whole talk right now

2500
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:36,000
because of this union agreement.

2501
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Have you seen this where Disney is canceling

2502
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:42,000
live performances in the park?

2503
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,000
You're speculating.

2504
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Some people are saying, Dr. Strange,

2505
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,000
those performers were AGVA,

2506
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:54,000
which was a contract that was already in place.

2507
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,000
It could be canceling live entertainment

2508
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:00,000
to get quarterly profits,

2509
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,000
quarterly revenue in shape.

2510
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
They canceled Club Pixar,

2511
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,000
which is something that was supposed to run for all summer.

2512
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,000
All that stuff is extra stuff

2513
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:15,000
they don't need to be doing,

2514
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:18,000
but there's still enough at Disneyland that's extra.

2515
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:21,000
I'm just saying you start out up here,

2516
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:24,000
so when they start taking things away,

2517
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:27,000
and they have taken things away in the last so many years,

2518
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:30,000
it's just like, well, they started out here,

2519
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,000
so it's still pretty great,

2520
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:36,000
even though they start canceling stuff that's all the fun extras.

2521
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:39,000
The first things to go are live performers

2522
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:42,000
and people with special skills

2523
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:45,000
or just who are really fun to watch who make the place special.

2524
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Casa Bonita is a new place.

2525
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,000
I was there for two hours, and what did I see?

2526
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Bunch of cliff divers, puppet show, live performers,

2527
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,000
a monkey trainer came up to my table.

2528
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:00,000
I didn't even get to see Sor Soro,

2529
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:03,000
whatever Sor Soro is.

2530
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:06,000
There is a current Ralph Brennan's Jazz Kitchen

2531
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:09,000
that kept one thing.

2532
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:12,000
They kept the cliff divers, but then it's only on Fridays,

2533
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
and it looks like shit.

2534
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:18,000
There is a version where Casa Bonita comes back,

2535
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,000
and it is just a little fun nod

2536
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:24,000
that we sort of nod to that this place was fun

2537
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,000
instead of making it twice as fun as it was before.

2538
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,000
What I'm saying is Trey and Matt did a better job

2539
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:33,000
with the modern Walt Disney Company.

2540
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:36,000
This is the best thing I've done for the show in a couple years.

2541
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:39,000
One of the best things ever. We've been doing this for a while.

2542
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:42,000
This is one of the most excited I've ever been about anything.

2543
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:45,000
I'm just sorry that it wasn't with you guys.

2544
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:48,000
I'm sorry it was a little solo mission, but if you can figure it out,

2545
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:51,000
get there, listeners go.

2546
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:54,000
It is such a special thing and so neat that it can happen

2547
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:57,000
that we don't need to rely on our gods at Disney and Universal

2548
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:00,000
to Dane to do something cool for us,

2549
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,000
that these guys were willing to waste a ton of money.

2550
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:06,000
They described them so they said,

2551
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,000
you have to be as rich as us and as stupid as us

2552
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:12,000
to get something like this done, and I thank them for their stupidity.

2553
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:15,000
God bless you, Casa Bonita.

2554
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:18,000
And I look forward to what is apparently a documentary coming

2555
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:21,000
by the end of the year, Casa Bonita, Mia Moore,

2556
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,000
in which they go into this process,

2557
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,000
I want to know everything about how they put this together

2558
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:30,000
because the word, I said it as soon as I walked out,

2559
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,000
as soon as I left the dim hues of the restaurant

2560
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:36,000
and was harshly let out into the still bright Colorado sun.

2561
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:39,000
It's like it's still light, you're kidding.

2562
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:42,000
And the first thing out of my mouth was triumph.

2563
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:45,000
This is a triumph.

2564
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:48,000
And how great does it feel to see a new triumph

2565
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,000
in themed entertainment in 2024?

2566
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:54,000
It sounds closer to Meow Wolf in execution.

2567
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Yeah.

2568
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Yes, that it's like off the grid,

2569
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:03,000
that the money comes from a weird place, that it is in Denver.

2570
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Now, I didn't get to do that.

2571
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,000
I did not go to Convergence Station,

2572
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:12,000
which is the Denver outpost.

2573
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,000
I did experience the Meow Wolf ride at Elitch Gardens.

2574
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Oh, right.

2575
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:21,000
We're going to talk about that on The Second Gate.

2576
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
We're going to talk about Elitch Gardens soon.

2577
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Elitch Gardens is another thing you can do in Denver.

2578
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,000
But let's end on a positive note.

2579
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Let's make it a hard split.

2580
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:36,000
God bless you guys.

2581
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Thank you for making this great place for Denver

2582
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:42,000
and for America and for the world.

2583
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Wow.

2588
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:00,000
including, I think, Elitch Gardens, although I'm going to have to,

2589
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,000
I mean, like, could be Maine.

2590
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:06,000
It's buckle up for Elitch Gardens.

2591
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Elitch Gardens is something.

2592
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Listeners told me to buckle up.

2593
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:15,000
I guess I can't do Casa Bonita.

2594
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Well, I can still do Elitch Gardens and people went out of their way.

2595
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Listeners went out of their way to communicate.

2596
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Don't do that. If you can't get into Casa Bonita,

2597
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,000
don't just go to Elitch Gardens.

2598
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:30,000
And thank God it worked. Thank you, Joe Carnegie.

2599
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Thank you, Landon. And thank you, listeners.

2600
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Get on that list.

2601
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:39,000
If you didn't do it at the top of the show, do it now.

2602
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Go to the website. Let's get it done. OK. All right.

2603
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:48,000
