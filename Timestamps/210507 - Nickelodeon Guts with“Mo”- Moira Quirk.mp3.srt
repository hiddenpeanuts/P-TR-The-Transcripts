1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,620
Warning, the following podcast contains careless hot dog throwing, mall slime, yogi bear scurrying

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,800
away sound effects, and today we will definitively answer the question, do we have it?

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,360
It's Nickelodeon Guts with Mo, aka Moira Quirk, on today's podcast, The Ride.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,920
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three men who would really

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,400
like President Joe Biden to award them an honorary presidential fitness award for all

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,160
the miles they've lightly jogged at Universal and Disney.

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,800
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

10
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,800
Yeah, lightly is the key word there, but I sure would like some acclaim for it.

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,960
Yeah, if you add it all up, we've done a lot of physical activity.

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,960
That's what I'm saying.

13
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,840
Scott Gerdner joining us always as well.

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,960
That's right, because often you're at the theme parks and you'll look at your step meter

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,240
and it'll be over 10,000.

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,100
And obviously 10,000 steps is the highest athletic achievement that you can achieve.

17
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,960
So to get like 13, I mean, we're major strong men, I'd say.

18
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,800
Yeah. So right now, President Biden, you got some things going on, but nothing is important

19
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,960
as what I've just laid out.

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,440
So please make it happen, sir.

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,880
I assume he'll come on the show to to kind of bestow that upon us at some point.

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,280
Yeah, yeah. We'll take a nice photo like he did with the Carters.

23
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,040
We'll see if we can shrink even even more than them.

24
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,240
I don't I'll look like I'm like nine feet tall, though, maybe against the two of them.

25
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,400
Oh, yeah. Go the other way.

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,680
Yes, be towering over the buttons.

27
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,400
Yeah, for sure.

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,760
So, folks, we have a very so we just did, obviously, that was, you know,

29
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,240
that joke I was thinking about us talking about, you know, Nickelodeon studios,

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,960
kids being active.

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,520
I was thinking about how I was a bad athlete as a child.

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,680
And I want to say we had something very special happen because of the Nick Studios.

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,320
Someone reached out to us and made themselves available to talk.

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,520
You know, from movies, TV, Star Wars video games, which I'm very excited about.

35
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,360
And of course, Nickelodeon guts.

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,560
Ladies and gentlemen, this is more a quirk.

37
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,760
Hello. Hello.

38
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,280
Two handed wave on the podcast.

39
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,680
Let that be known.

40
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,800
That's great. Accurate.

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,200
That's what she did. Yeah.

42
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,000
Great to meet you. Hello.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,280
Hello. Hello.

44
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,640
I'd like you to know that I have also walked the flatlands of the theme parks,

45
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,960
but also all the stairs at Universal Studios Hollywood up and down.

46
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,440
Oh, my gosh.

47
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,360
This is very cool. Starway, not escalator.

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,280
Still stairs just until I was burning

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,880
and nearly crying, but feeling good about what I was going to

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,960
shove into my mouth that in Hogwarts.

51
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,280
OK, sure. Yeah.

52
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,280
Really? One of those flights a couple of weeks ago and was crying.

53
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,800
So kudos to you.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Yeah, I can't even count that high, actually.

55
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,080
Yeah, I bet.

56
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,360
That's really exciting. We need to talk.

57
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,200
We haven't talked as much about staircases at parks as we should.

58
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,760
We've only done a lot like escalator talk.

59
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,080
But that'll that'll that'll start us on the path thinking about

60
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,720
which type of staircases we like at the park and why and which ones

61
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,560
have been maintained well over the years.

62
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,160
Yeah, they're rare.

63
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,680
I guess for litigious purposes.

64
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,800
Yes, they would have to have an elevator or an escalator,

65
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,200
probably in addition to it.

66
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,400
But, you know, we can we need to cover.

67
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,960
There's so much stuff we haven't covered after three years on this podcast.

68
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,600
So thank you for that.

69
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,720
Stairs. Yes.

70
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,600
So, yeah. So you were very nice and you reached out to us

71
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
after the Nick Studios episode, and we were very excited

72
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,400
to talk about Nick Studios in general.

73
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,400
But you revealed very exciting information

74
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,760
that you have a long history with theme parks and performing in theme parks.

75
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,880
Yes, I have pranced around in theme parks for money.

76
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,480
Not just as a visitor, but for hard mullahs. Yes.

77
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,680
Well, that is very exciting.

78
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,240
We love you know, there's an AV club on the onion.

79
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,040
They talk about like roles and stuff.

80
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,280
And I feel like we could do something like that with you,

81
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,200
but exclusively with your theme park work.

82
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,200
Stuff you've done in the theme parks.

83
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,240
So I guess, yeah, I guess give us like a little just maybe background of like

84
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,520
before you even started, were you interested in theme parks?

85
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,160
Did you like this type of performing? How did you get started?

86
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,520
How did I get started?

87
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,680
Well, I think they'd always sort of been a part of my growing up.

88
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,440
My grandmother and my grandparents lived in Orlando, Florida.

89
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,960
You transformed there well.

90
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,120
Yeah. So so what is it?

91
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,440
There's a there's a book, The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy,

92
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,440
and his his biography starts before he was born.

93
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,000
And so even before I was born, I think I had family,

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,120
or maybe in my earliest youth, I had family working at

95
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,120
Walt Disney World when it was opening.

96
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,640
My mother worked in hiring back when it opened.

97
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,600
My uncle, I think he worked on the carousel and my auntie.

98
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,040
She worked in the Swiss Watt shop on Main Street, I think,

99
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,080
and then had a spectacular rise through the world of retail.

100
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,400
And it all started there.

101
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,960
And then Joanne Bogart across the street, part of the Bogart clan.

102
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,200
She was a face character, which was a big frickin deal in Orlando, Florida.

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,760
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

104
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,080
She played Snow White, and I thought that was pretty stinking hot.

105
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,600
And it was funny that she was Snow White because she wasn't.

106
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,200
I mean, she had very, very dark hair.

107
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,640
But the rest, that was illusion.

108
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,120
Yeah. And then after university,

109
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,400
I came over to visit my grandmother for a couple of weeks.

110
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,840
I'm still here.

111
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,480
That turned out.

112
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,600
And yeah, one of the first jobs I got was at Universal Studios

113
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,200
because that had just sort of opened.

114
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,040
Yeah. Wow.

115
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,480
So yeah. So it was in the family.

116
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,360
You had no choice almost, maybe you were just surrounded by it.

117
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,440
It's Orlando.

118
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,920
I don't know what else there is to do there.

119
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,920
I don't mean to.

120
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,720
I don't know what there was there before.

121
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,960
I mean, I guess there was Gatorland.

122
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,960
Have you ever been to Gatorland?

123
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,720
Everyone says we need to go to Gatorland.

124
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,440
We missed. We should have done it last time we were in Orlando a couple of years ago.

125
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,120
But I think next time we got to do it, because I've been told many times to do this.

126
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,560
Yeah, I could either write an entire dissertation on Gatorland

127
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,120
or I could just say very succinctly, it is something.

128
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,080
OK. That's a lot. Yeah, for sure.

129
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,080
Yeah, I think I think that you could have a lot of fun.

130
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,480
That you could be a bit sad, like an old zoo.

131
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,280
But how does it did you watch Tiger King?

132
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,840
How does it compare in terms of shadiness to the

133
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,760
I'm the person in the world who didn't watch Tiger King.

134
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,920
It'll be there. I'll get to it.

135
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,800
Well, just if it's the shadiest thing ever involving animals.

136
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,520
Well, is it how far into shady?

137
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,320
Is it upmarket or is it downmarket?

138
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,960
Is it downmarket?

139
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,440
Do they treat the gators well?

140
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,720
Probably not.

141
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,120
We saw them feeding one and they just sort of threw hot dogs

142
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,360
at the gators. That was like and I just remember a hot dog

143
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,360
sort of landing on the top of the gators head.

144
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,360
It's a gator, so it can't take it off.

145
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,080
So it had to suffer the indignity of being a gator with a hot dog on its head

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,080
the rest of that day, probably.

147
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,760
Yeah, they didn't.

148
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,200
That's sort of a park. Yeah. Right.

149
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,280
I think throwing a picture. Yeah.

150
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,920
Having hot dogs just thrown at you willy nilly.

151
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,120
That's that's the dream of at least one of us.

152
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,000
So yeah, I actually think that's a great honor in Florida.

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,760
If they throw a hot dog at you and it's on your head.

154
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,080
Because that is the confetti of Florida.

155
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah. Yeah.

156
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,880
My girlfriend went to college in Florida and worked in some of the parks.

157
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,200
So, yeah, she she has stories like that, too.

158
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,800
She a Rollins lady.

159
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,440
I I don't know.

160
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,680
You don't have to answer. That's very personal.

161
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,520
I'm sorry. OK.

162
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,480
Yeah. When unlike the hot dog, it went right over my head.

163
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,840
Yeah, it was Rollins. Yeah.

164
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,920
It's like the liberal arts college there in Winter Park.

165
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,840
Oh, no, she went to UCF. OK.

166
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,680
Gotcha. What is it about?

167
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,240
What is it about theme park world that

168
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,160
like brought your whole family to it?

169
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,360
Like, what is it? How does it run in a family?

170
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,760
My grandparents, I've got an American part.

171
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,640
So they were all the Americans who lived in Orlando,

172
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,640
who just went and worked there because that was an easy place to get a job.

173
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,640
So that's that's why.

174
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,760
More of that than the it's not the being enraptured by the magic.

175
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,960
It's not it's not inspiration.

176
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,520
And we love to weave stories.

177
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,240
It's like, oh, something to do.

178
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,560
I'm just being far more pragmatic about it.

179
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,160
But when I turned up, it was just like, oh, there's this place

180
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,360
where I could go and perform.

181
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,000
Yes, please. And so, yeah.

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,040
So I went in and auditioned and got put at the Murder

183
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,480
She Wrote Mystery Theatre, where I got four different characters

184
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,200
dig digging deep for for my days there.

185
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,560
Yeah. Let me know.

186
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,040
We have not done an episode about that somehow.

187
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,520
That's one of the things on the list.

188
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,560
We certainly will.

189
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,360
And then we'll know very well what all of those characters were.

190
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,920
But I think I need the refresher.

191
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,240
I must have seen it once forever ago.

192
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,920
What did what did what did the Murder

193
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,440
She Wrote Theatre call on you to portray?

194
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,120
Well, the Murder She Wrote Mystery Theatre and the Mystery Theatre

195
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,960
was added later to be make it an even more alluring theme park attraction

196
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:43,680
was was a the the story of ADR and post production.

197
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,920
So they explained post production using Jessica Fletcher on her bike,

198
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,280
solving the mystery of Leilani and the Black Pearl.

199
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,120
And that was the film I saw probably for three years.

200
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,680
Yeah. So there was sort of an editing bay

201
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,040
where you played a crazy ass editor and you played a production supervisor

202
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,560
and you also played an ADR supervisor.

203
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,440
And and it was, you know, it was audience participation.

204
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,000
But at the end of the day, it was a place to put people in the call

205
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,560
so that the park wasn't just filled with a big ass long line for for for Kong

206
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,200
and earthquake. Right.

207
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,560
Yeah. Yes. It was to cool everyone off.

208
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,320
So they didn't pass out during the day.

209
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,920
That's exactly primary.

210
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,280
Just all the grandparents who brought their grandkids

211
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,640
and were just stunned and perplexed and didn't understand

212
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,560
why there wasn't a tour that they could get on. Right.

213
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,360
They would sue them with Murder She Wrote and Alfred Hitchcock.

214
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,800
Yes, exactly. Presentation.

215
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,400
Yeah. Yes.

216
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,600
So when you did the different characters, would you did you like

217
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,280
how method work? Did you have specific type?

218
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,440
You're like, well, when the editor is here,

219
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,400
I'm going to play the character like this.

220
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,360
Or was it just like, I'm going to sort of play a fun version of myself for all four?

221
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,320
Yes, it was definitely persona acting.

222
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,080
I mean, you would maybe start with illusions of or just ideas

223
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,960
of really practicing some characters.

224
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,720
And at the end of the day, you had to like punch through several hours of shows.

225
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
And you just would get it done.

226
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,560
And it didn't seem like most sitcoms.

227
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,960
You start with a big character, then it just generally becomes the actor.

228
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,440
It's the same thing.

229
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,640
So basically, I'm saying I was Jennifer Aniston.

230
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,400
That's what I'm saying. I was, of course. Yes.

231
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,600
To us and many people our age, you are the equivalent of Jennifer.

232
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,280
And it's OK. It's as much.

233
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,480
I'll take it.

234
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,080
I thought I'm going to write that on a card so I can remind myself.

235
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,000
You can use that as a pull quote.

236
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,640
Yeah, I can lead it up.

237
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,880
Yeah, right.

238
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,840
And I'll blue tack it on my wall.

239
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:01,160
But yeah, I think I just chose to be a Scottish lady for the first room.

240
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,360
And I practiced my American accent in the in the second room.

241
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,600
And I did someone mad for the third room.

242
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,520
That was fully there was fully in that.

243
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,360
And then the fourth, I just it was just me.

244
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,800
Hello, I'm tired.

245
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,840
But also giving it all giving it my all. Yes.

246
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,160
Of course. Yeah.

247
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,360
This is an audience volunteer thing, too.

248
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,120
Or like, are you are you picking the people or they picked for you?

249
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,960
How's that?

250
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,560
You can pick the people.

251
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,160
You could you could pick the people. Yeah. Sure.

252
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,840
Did you ever if you were in the thick of it

253
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,880
and discovered that you had a dud on your hands or a problem on your hand,

254
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,480
like somebody was like hamming it up too much or making it about themselves

255
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,520
or just by how do you how do you cover?

256
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,120
How do you how do you roll with it?

257
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,400
Oh, my gosh.

258
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,680
This was a long time ago, remember? Sure.

259
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,360
You just there were certain people that you would hurry through.

260
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,800
And just and it was just a very utilitarian show.

261
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,040
And maybe they got more facts that time.

262
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,440
And there are other people who were just lovely.

263
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,560
And it was and it was nice to play.

264
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,360
So it's it's a cake job, really.

265
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,280
And I was there.

266
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,040
I was the at Universal when I was working there.

267
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,600
I was the youngest person there.

268
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,120
I just come out of university and drama school.

269
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,960
And everyone else there had worked at all the other theme parks at Disney

270
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,800
or had been doing sort of bus and truck theater or regional theater.

271
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,280
So this was a place that they could clock in, do some shows, clock out,

272
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,560
and they could perform and then buy a house.

273
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,240
It was just a very that was a very different way to be able to be an actor.

274
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:51,440
So it was a lot of people who were in a in a different period of their life than me.

275
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,720
Yeah. Right.

276
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,840
Well, did you have like because obviously, like a lot of that has

277
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,640
there's improv elements to it.

278
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,240
Was that something you were doing before before you got to Universal?

279
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,600
Or is that like a learn on the job thing?

280
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,000
I guess I I'm

281
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,800
we did some at drama school, and I'd always sort of

282
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,520
I'd had this sort of background in comedy that was always the clubs and stuff

283
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,520
that I joined.

284
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:25,080
But but it wasn't until I got to Orlando that I sort of seriously took improv classes.

285
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,600
And there's a theater company that SAC Theater who did sports.

286
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,560
And and so I was with them for a while and took my classes there.

287
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,040
And then also at Disney as well,

288
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,480
they would play on classes for us if we were there.

289
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,720
Oh, that's cool. Wow. Yeah.

290
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,400
They said Disney was very, very different.

291
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,760
It was a much it was people my age.

292
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,960
So it was people out of university and in their 20s.

293
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,640
And then some old timers who were hanging on to their pennies

294
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,240
for the best and their pensions.

295
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,880
And yeah, so that was a I'm older now.

296
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:09,040
So I think about things like pensions and benefits and stuff and buying houses and stuff.

297
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,520
I think it's the time to be at theme parks, for sure.

298
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,360
Like younger, more idealistic.

299
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,680
I was a tram tour guide at Universal, and it was like the best

300
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,600
still in college job, actually, when I started.

301
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,160
And then you're like, yeah, it'd be hard to think about, like,

302
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,120
what if I started doing it again in 15 years?

303
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,360
I don't know if that's that's the time that I'd want to be

304
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,160
going to have it all ahead of you and not care that like

305
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,240
when you look at the check, like, that's it.

306
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,280
They're like, you're like any money. Fantastic.

307
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,480
Love it. It'll do.

308
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,080
I mean, we certainly have friends who who I mean, we've been gone from Orlando

309
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,640
for so long now.

310
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,160
When did we leave? Ninety five, I think.

311
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,880
Been in LA since 95.

312
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,760
And we still have friends who work there. Sure.

313
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,680
Yeah. Until they were laid off.

314
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,320
Not all of them. Yeah, sure.

315
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,360
Hopefully everybody gets their job back.

316
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,400
Fingers crossed if it still.

317
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,720
I don't mean to be a debbie downer.

318
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,760
I know. It's a crazy time for this stuff.

319
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,840
Yeah, I know the fun topic we picked for our podcast now, like the last year.

320
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,920
It's really thrown into peril.

321
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Of improv it.

322
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,600
Yeah, yeah, it's tough times for the performers. Yeah.

323
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,800
Especially and they're kind of the last thing to come back to,

324
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,000
which is which is a bummer.

325
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,400
Like I went to Universal yesterday and like, oh yeah, that's like every

326
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,640
the rides are back, but not the the people, which is so much the spirit of it.

327
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,360
So yeah, I was just reading about Disneyland today and just you can wave.

328
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,640
You can wave at them.

329
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,440
I'm sure that the characters really love it.

330
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,880
That they they don't get hugged and snort.

331
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,840
My mother said when when Walt Disney World first opened up

332
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
and because she was in high

333
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,400
hearing and dealt with the employees, but she's because they had more bad characters

334
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,240
than they had the big bad wolf.

335
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,440
And I don't know.

336
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,080
I don't know if they sort of set him aside because kids would just kick him in the shins.

337
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,240
Sure.

338
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,440
Yeah, so the big bad wolf, it's good now during a pandemic time

339
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,200
because he can like hide far away.

340
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,480
He can wave and then kids can be mad, but from a distance.

341
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,640
Yes, which is nice.

342
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,400
You didn't have to be anything that kids were taking out aggression on

343
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,160
where you were you were like you were nice characters.

344
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,800
Well, that's true.

345
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,200
Yes.

346
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,360
Yeah, and that's that's kind of how we we first

347
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:59,200
your daughter told us and told our Facebook group

348
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,600
that she was your daughter, that you were her mom.

349
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,600
She's using you for clout.

350
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,080
Young people love to do they love clout.

351
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,880
So yeah, that was that was kind of our first connection.

352
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,840
Oh, OK.

353
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,280
She's just right there.

354
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,800
That's her college right now.

355
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,240
Maybe they're talking about you.

356
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,440
Hi, Millie.

357
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,640
Hello.

358
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,200
Hi.

359
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,520
She's too nervous to be recorded.

360
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,360
She's much more retiring than me.

361
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:31,840
Oh, OK.

362
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,600
Serious person in the family.

363
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,760
We'll wait when we stop recording.

364
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,360
Yeah, yes.

365
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,760
Wait, you told you told us though that she you compare

366
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,360
you heard about our podcast because she has cross checked notes

367
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,480
on opinions that we have about theme park stuff

368
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,120
and opinions that you share about theme park stuff.

369
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,280
There's a there's a chart in effect.

370
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:04,560
We are very simpatico guys on pretty much everything, I think.

371
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,800
Well, as far as bathrooms and best bathrooms,

372
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,560
she said, name your two best bathrooms in a theme park.

373
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,240
And I think I said Alice in Wonderland in Disneyland

374
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,800
and Moaning Myrtle.

375
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,040
Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.

376
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,520
I mean, I'll go there whether I need to go or not.

377
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,200
I always do.

378
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,400
I got to return yesterday.

379
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,040
It was a thrill.

380
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,600
I hadn't heard hadn't heard the moaning in so long.

381
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,520
I made a point of.

382
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,040
Well, not from Myrtle.

383
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,640
Yeah, elsewhere in my life.

384
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,400
Scott's getting older.

385
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,480
Yeah, those are great bathrooms.

386
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,760
We agree on that for sure.

387
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,080
Is what like I guess let's do a real quick like favorite ride,

388
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,360
favorite themed experience in general for you at any of these.

389
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,080
General.

390
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,960
OK, rides favorite favorite rides.

391
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,240
See, well, here's the thing.

392
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,920
I really, really love the whole whole Harry Potter world,

393
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,080
but I can't do the rides anymore.

394
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
It's just too much for me.

395
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,000
It's a choice between vomiting and the rest of the day drinking

396
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,680
sparkling water.

397
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,600
Yeah, so no, it's a great ride.

398
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,640
But favorite ride.

399
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,640
Well, my favorite ride ever in the world was the Hanna Barbera ride.

400
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,360
That was like.

401
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,520
Yeah, yes.

402
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,240
Barbera.

403
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,440
I think Hanna Barbera for me was sort of like the equivalent of Nickelodeon for 90s kids.

404
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,640
It makes my heart swell to think about Hanna Barbera.

405
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,800
And that was a fantastic ride because it had Dick Dastardly and Mudley.

406
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,280
Just it was it was an homage to them.

407
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,360
So that ride and I.

408
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,640
Tying it all together and the fact that it was like this all star.

409
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,400
I liked anything where like everybody gets together,

410
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,560
you know, that like we're going to tie Flintstones and Jetsons and Yogi

411
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,760
and Dick Dastardly.

412
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,920
It just it was just such it felt like such an event.

413
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,480
They're all kind of zoned in on or honed in on honed in.

414
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,240
On Dick Dastardly and Mudley because that was my all time favorite cartoon.

415
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,040
But the interactive area too was hours of joy of just going.

416
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,280
You could push buttons where they did the running away sound like zoop zoop zoop.

417
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,680
Whatever that running.

418
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,120
All of them, all of them just days I could be there.

419
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,080
So if Yogi had like a picnic picnic basket and running away from the ranger,

420
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,840
like you would be able to hit a button.

421
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,200
Yeah, I mean, that's fun.

422
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,960
That's we didn't even I don't think we missed that.

423
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,720
We talked we did an episode about it and Barbara,

424
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,040
but I don't think we talked about this screen.

425
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,800
The whole interactive area was fantastic.

426
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,560
And I love all of the ridiculous fantasy land rides that finish in 90 seconds

427
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,400
with with no end.

428
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:01,840
Right.

429
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,320
A little abrupt, a little abrupt and then daylight.

430
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:05,840
Yes.

431
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,760
Are you disappointed that Snow White has more of an ending now?

432
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,280
That's I haven't gotten to do it yet.

433
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,920
But I haven't seen it.

434
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,720
I will have to go back and have a look.

435
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,160
I have to have a look at that.

436
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,240
That was our last thing that we did before.

437
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,160
If you've heard of it, the covid, we were there

438
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,720
and we'd gotten up at five o'clock in the morning

439
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:34,400
so that we could go and do the resistance ride, which was stunning.

440
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,880
I like theme parks because they're sort of camp

441
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,720
and that that was not camp.

442
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,120
It was really, really just amazing.

443
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,760
It was really amazing.

444
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,760
I think I'm just going to think about that for a day.

445
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,720
Right.

446
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,600
Yeah, that's how we've been doing an episode about it.

447
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,560
It was just like pure gushing, just like, and this was great.

448
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,440
And this was also great.

449
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,240
And this was great.

450
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,000
And it's so much sometimes it's more fun to talk about like kind of bad attractions

451
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,880
because you've got you can more you could poke and prod

452
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,440
and kind of like be a little superior to it.

453
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,240
But I'm no one is superior to Rise of the Resistance.

454
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,560
It's just a perfect experience.

455
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah. And I mean, I like Star Wars.

456
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,920
I'm probably going to go down in flames for this, but I like Star Wars.

457
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,400
I could live without it, but that was amazing there.

458
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,360
Oh, no, you're going to have to cut that out

459
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,000
because I make part of my living doing Star Wars.

460
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,720
Cut that out.

461
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,920
That's right. That's gone.

462
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,840
You just made a terrible error.

463
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,840
I was about to bring it up.

464
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,400
I was going to say.

465
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,040
It's easy.

466
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,800
Harrison Ford says much the same thing.

467
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,920
Yeah. He's Harrison Ford, though.

468
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,440
You know what?

469
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,360
Fair, fair, fair.

470
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:49,840
Yeah, fair.

471
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,760
He's good to go.

472
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,360
He's said yes.

473
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,400
The closest the closest like piece of camp is like the fishman

474
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,120
Lieutenant Beck in the like the first part of it.

475
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,640
And that's it for Rise of the Resistance.

476
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,720
You know, yeah, it's silliness.

477
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,220
He's pretty.

478
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:05,960
Oh, yeah.

479
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,260
Wait, so so elsewhere in Orlando world, there's murder.

480
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:10,820
There's murder.

481
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,380
She wrote.

482
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,940
But you were you did some other attractions as well.

483
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:19,380
Oh, when when they were waiting, I think they were waiting for my costume to come in

484
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,020
for murder.

485
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,060
She wrote God knows.

486
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:26,660
I mean, I think they got it from JCPenney because they had a petite section.

487
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,260
JCPenney in Orlando.

488
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:34,020
But I did also prance around at the earthquake attraction for a little bit.

489
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:42,740
And I may have done the was it the Hitchcock thing for a while.

490
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,140
But mostly it was it was murder.

491
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:45,460
She wrote.

492
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:52,260
But I also worked over at Disneyland for I mean, not Disney Epcot Center doing street

493
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,180
theater there.

494
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,900
Yeah, because of this accent.

495
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,260
So they threw me doing street theater in the UK pavilion.

496
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:07,140
So when you when you say street theater, was it just kind of goofing around with people

497
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,540
or were you doing a full sort of act of some kind of an act that came out?

498
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:16,500
It was it was I can't even remember what the stories were.

499
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,140
I think maybe a Romeo and Juliet kind of one.

500
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,740
Or would have that have been in Italy?

501
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,100
Romeo and Juliet should have been in Italy, shouldn't it?

502
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:33,060
Anyway, some sort of UK ish story that was we we did in the UK outdoors area.

503
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:42,020
And it was a little bit you would pull two people in from the audience and and laughs ensued

504
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,220
in the hot, hot Orlando sun.

505
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:45,540
Yes.

506
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,180
You know, if you can get tourists to, you know, halfway through heat stroke, give them

507
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:52,900
directives.

508
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,220
I mean, you can end up with very funny results.

509
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:55,940
Yes.

510
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,940
So and it was fine.

511
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,020
It was it was a fun show to do.

512
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,620
And it was silly laughs backstage.

513
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:09,700
And yeah, it was it was it was a fine job that I enjoyed at the time.

514
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,460
But yeah, Disney was always trying to offer me a contract.

515
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:18,820
And I was always like, I got paid a bit more at Universal and it was inside because,

516
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,780
yeah, Disney was crazy.

517
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:27,540
And when they there was a time that they said, we're going to recreate your we're going to redo

518
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,140
all of your costumes.

519
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,980
I'm sorry, I'm getting all sorts of texts.

520
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,300
I don't know how to turn those off anyway.

521
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:44,260
They came back and the costume department was very excited to show us.

522
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:50,820
And I'm not kidding, because Orlando is is one hundred and thirty three degrees

523
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,940
plus all of the absolute soaking humidity.

524
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,540
And they had created a costume from the boots up.

525
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:09,140
It was like ankle boots, stockings, bloomers, a petticoat, a skirt that was made out of a sort of

526
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,260
hemp material.

527
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,180
But there was three layers of that to give it, you know, some ploof.

528
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:22,100
And then for my top part, they had given me a blouse made out of the world's finest manmade

529
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,260
non-breathable materials with then a layer on top.

530
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:31,700
And I just sort of turned to them and I said, this is a lot of layers.

531
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,460
Are you sure it's going to breathe?

532
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:40,580
It seems to me that it's going to be a bit hot, to which they replied, well, we figured you were

533
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,860
going to be hot anyway.

534
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:51,300
They're like, what's an extra five degrees or 10 degrees of heat?

535
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:56,740
They considered it and then just went like that.

536
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:03,780
Yeah. And there was so many rules about, you know, there's the whole Disney look as well.

537
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,020
There's all these rules about makeup.

538
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:12,740
And so we all turned up pretty much in nothing to a lick of mascara, let's say.

539
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,460
And they decided, we think we'd like to see you.

540
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:23,620
Some real southern lady came in, wanted to see us with our faces on and took, for example,

541
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:29,060
we said, I remember they put us in this room and they said they were going to give us an

542
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,460
example of makeup that they wanted.

543
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:35,700
They asked for a volunteer, which was a bit ironic considering that was our job.

544
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:41,860
And we normally pick volunteers, but they picked this lady and she was gorgeous, just never wore

545
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,780
makeup, never needed to.

546
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,540
They put her on a chair.

547
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,540
They went to town and made her look like a painted whore.

548
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:58,980
Yes, we all just sort of hung with our mouths open like, what did you do?

549
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,260
Yeah. Well, now she's passable.

550
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,220
Now she can be in public.

551
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,820
Lisa and gave her some blue, some cornflower blue.

552
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,100
Yeah.

553
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,500
Big dull cheeks, rouge on the cheeks and the forehead.

554
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,540
Why do you need it up there?

555
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,980
You somehow can't take the Orlando out of it.

556
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,860
Trying to figure out the backstory of like, OK, I guess if our characters have consumption

557
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,940
or the play, OK, that kind of.

558
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,580
Yes, whatever is.

559
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,700
We're putting on the makeup that a corpse would need because they might be dead soon.

560
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:40,260
You look shinier and sweatier and a lot of pit stains.

561
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,340
That's going to really do it for the punters.

562
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,700
That was the Disney look back then, I guess.

563
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,740
That's what you would call it.

564
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,620
Well, I've changed it.

565
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,500
They're finally getting around to updating the look this year.

566
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:55,940
I know you can have your tats and your tash and your long locks.

567
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,140
It's very exciting.

568
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,220
So I hope that woman you're talking about, I hope she's adjusting to the changes.

569
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,620
OK, yeah, from her.

570
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,340
I like that she had to be restrained, taken to a hospital.

571
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,820
You do it one way.

572
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,060
A slight wrist tattoo.

573
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,340
I never has Satan overtaken the world.

574
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,940
And then you wear sunglasses.

575
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,780
Now you used to not be able to wear sunglasses, which is a bit hard.

576
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,060
Yeah, right.

577
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,100
That's yeah.

578
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,500
Well, and maybe yeah, I wonder if we're here 30 years or whatever it is later,

579
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,940
maybe the next 30 years, it'll be even more progressive.

580
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,500
Yeah, we'll be finally in the 20th century.

581
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:42,900
Who knows?

582
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:48,420
You were talking about like you were working for Disney and Universal.

583
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,100
I'm always curious because a lot of people do both.

584
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,620
Did you have like a recruiter kind of after you at Universal?

585
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,660
Like, hey, you know, you should come over to Disney and we should do something here.

586
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,580
And then people were offering you contracts.

587
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,980
It feels like high stakes like sports agent and team like you're being.

588
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,980
I wish I was known because I never really thought about I was very,

589
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,780
very British and didn't talk about money.

590
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:15,220
But if Disney wanted to offer me a full time contract and had coughed up a bit more money,

591
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,380
I might have said I might have said yes.

592
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:27,060
But but in the end, it was probably better that I just sort of was stayed slightly peripheral and

593
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:31,540
just sort of made my own schedule and stuff like that.

594
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:31,780
Yeah.

595
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,700
Well, and it can't be.

596
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,740
I did leave.

597
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,140
I realized I must leave now.

598
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,100
Right.

599
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,260
Yeah.

600
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:45,060
I would imagine around this time that you also you you start heading into the television world,

601
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,980
but that pulls you out of out of the theme park game.

602
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,580
You were forcibly removed.

603
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:56,740
Yeah, but it was funny because because when I did start working for Nickelodeon,

604
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:01,300
they would get three shows done a day.

605
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,540
It would be about 40 episodes.

606
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,540
So it gets shot pretty quickly.

607
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:15,060
And so, yeah, the first two years I was there in Orlando.

608
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,100
But the thing is, as well, I mean, people always think when you're on TV,

609
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,700
you're making the big bucks.

610
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,460
But I actually made more money working at the theme park than I ever did

611
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,860
working for Nickelodeon until probably the fourth season.

612
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:36,660
Yeah, they were they were not falling over themselves to pay me big banks of cash Nickelodeon.

613
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,300
Viacom.

614
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,940
Viacom, you're kidding.

615
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,980
They weren't they aren't super.

616
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,220
We didn't all get in a room and say, let's do more work.

617
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,380
This is something I wanted to ask about because I just the would like the way

618
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:01,620
everybody yourself included who I watched a ton on Nickelodeon was such a hero to me

619
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,620
and such an icon to me.

620
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:11,220
And I remember if you if I ever saw a Nickelodeon centric person on something else,

621
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:17,780
and I like if you saw Clarissa's dad on something or the one I remember specifically is Mr. Ernst

622
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:23,940
from from Hey Dude, the owner of the ranch on Hey Dude, that he is on an episode of Seinfeld

623
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,900
at some point in time.

624
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,420
And I remember seeing that and going, that's interesting.

625
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:28,980
Why?

626
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,140
Why would he need to do that?

627
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,980
He's already Mr. Ernst.

628
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,780
Is this just like for fun?

629
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:42,340
Like when you get a job post retirement and they don't like I he's assuredly as Mr. Ernst,

630
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,220
he makes 15 million dollars a year.

631
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,700
Yes, he must be doing them such a favor.

632
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,420
Please, Mr. Ernst.

633
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:55,540
Well, his one episode on Seinfeld probably paid him

634
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,100
multi fold what he ever made on Nickelodeon.

635
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:05,300
Yeah, I work with Kirk Bailey sometimes who was on, I guess, salute your shorts.

636
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:12,500
Yeah, and we kind of worked out we had supposed to voiceover together in that world now.

637
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,260
And we both worked out we had people in common.

638
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:22,180
And some outrageous people that I can't tell you about, but I'll say that so that you'll go,

639
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,420
I wish I knew and I'll go, oh, I can't.

640
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,500
But yeah, we we're very happy in the voiceover world.

641
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,340
Oh, sure. Yes.

642
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:39,620
Well, and hey, indoors and perfectly cool, perfectly air conditioned.

643
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,100
Yeah, yeah.

644
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,980
I would do a Nicktoon any day of the week.

645
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,100
I love those people.

646
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,220
Yeah, sure.

647
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,100
I saw you.

648
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,900
You talked about loving the head of Barbera characters, and I was very excited to learn

649
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,900
that you were in an episode of Scooby Doo and got to say the line,

650
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,100
I would have been famous if it weren't for you meddling kids.

651
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,100
Oh, my God, my life was made.

652
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:05,220
Yeah, I didn't realize that was a dream of mine to say the meddling kids line.

653
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,820
And I was like, oh, yeah, I can't.

654
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,460
That sounds great.

655
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,340
Oh, my God.

656
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,460
And I need to adjust.

657
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,660
I'm getting pins and needles.

658
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,420
Um, yeah, I had done my episode.

659
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:21,060
I was the baddie and I picked up my bag and I was leaving and the director just went,

660
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,700
wait a minute.

661
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,500
You were the baddie.

662
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,900
And I said, yes, I was.

663
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,780
And then she said, well, did you say you meddling kids?

664
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,340
And I went, no, because I didn't even know it could possibly be an option.

665
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:36,420
And then behind me, papers started flying and typewriters were hit.

666
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:42,420
And then a sheet of paper was passed to me and I got to say it.

667
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,780
And I emailed everyone I knew.

668
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,460
I tooted that horn.

669
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:51,380
Yes.

670
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:59,300
I would ironically, I would have been famous if it weren't for you meddling kids is probably

671
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,460
a sentiment that other people who have worked in children's entertainment have held before.

672
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,420
I feel that to this day, I tell my children.

673
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,820
You call them metal.

674
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,740
So you meddling kids.

675
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,380
I could have been happy.

676
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,180
No, I don't say that.

677
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,020
Very dark.

678
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,060
That took a dark time.

679
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,140
Sure regret telling you to come on this podcast.

680
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,420
Gallows humor.

681
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:20,900
We're all.

682
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:28,660
There was another episode of of Scooby Doo that I was on and that was where we worked

683
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,980
out what I was going to name my younger daughter.

684
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,340
It was it was decided there.

685
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:34,980
Yeah.

686
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,260
Velma or Daphne.

687
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:44,500
The thing is, my husband is from a little town outside of Flint, Michigan.

688
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,780
He brags about that.

689
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,580
Let me tell you.

690
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:55,860
And Casey Casems, uncle used to run the grocery store in that town.

691
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,060
And so Casey Casem.

692
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,900
Oh, my husband just wrote a little.

693
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,020
I'll finish the story.

694
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:06,340
But Casey Casems uncle used to run the store.

695
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:10,980
So Casey Casem used to come and play every summer.

696
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:16,260
And he and my father-in-law, they used to just play together as kids.

697
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,740
And Charlie, my father-in-law, he would tell us all these escapades they would do,

698
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:25,220
like pretending to lift a rope as cars were driving down the street.

699
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:30,180
And they'd all put on their brakes and they'd laugh and run away like scampish boys.

700
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:38,500
And I walk in for like my first episode of Scooby Doo and I see Casey Casem.

701
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,020
Then I go, oh, they're doing some stunt casting.

702
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:46,100
He's he's going to just do some some guest spot.

703
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,260
But no, he was still playing Shaggy.

704
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,540
Because they do that with men.

705
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,300
The women were replaced, of course.

706
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,740
But is that right?

707
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,180
They kept like Judy Jetson.

708
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,260
They like kind of like kicked out of the movie very like non.

709
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,500
She was over 29.

710
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,940
She was asking for it.

711
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,380
That's a heinous crime.

712
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,580
But yeah, so I said hi to Casey and said, I don't know if you remember,

713
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,420
but you used to play with my father-in-law, Charlie Raina.

714
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,620
And he went, oh, yes, we used to lift up a rope.

715
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,940
And he told me all the same stories.

716
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,420
And I listened.

717
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:24,660
Wow.

718
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:25,860
Wow.

719
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:30,340
Bonding with Casey Casem over his childhood terrorizing a small town.

720
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,180
My favorite Lebanese man.

721
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,340
Casey Casem is my favorite.

722
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,420
Oh, well, well, my husband, you have maybe have to do this

723
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,780
because he just wrote in a little card.

724
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:50,820
He wrote Auto World because my husband's been on every single theme park.

725
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:57,220
But he started his theme park journey in Auto World in Flint, Michigan.

726
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,180
If you have a couple of.

727
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,580
No, but on a world, we have not gone to a world.

728
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,660
Yeah, that's who's done this.

729
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:02,900
Yeah.

730
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:08,820
So whenever you do theme parks about the automotive industry with,

731
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:17,060
with, I don't know, areas where they explained how robots would soon take over

732
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:22,660
all of the people jobs and wonder why that auto that theme park failed.

733
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,460
Maybe that's something you can dig into.

734
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,940
Theme park fails for being correct.

735
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,540
The rare.

736
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,980
Also sad not knowing its audience.

737
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,460
Yes.

738
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:33,780
Yeah.

739
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:34,660
Yeah.

740
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,300
They were very fond of cars at the time in Michigan.

741
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:38,580
Yeah.

742
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,220
Sure.

743
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:46,020
And apparently, did you one time want to know if the people on downtown Disney

744
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,620
performing if they were paid?

745
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,940
Because he can tell you they are.

746
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:55,940
Which people like in which downtown Disney folks are we talking about?

747
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:59,460
The downtown Disney of Disneyland.

748
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:05,700
They have the bands and then they have the magicians and jugglers and comedians and whatnot.

749
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,420
Because.

750
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:06,900
Oh yeah.

751
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,620
Jason was part of a magic act on the way to dinner that one time.

752
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,500
Yeah, we forced Jason to do to be a magician's trick.

753
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:19,860
Yes, I was before dinner to a magic show, as we say in the improv world.

754
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,540
Well hungry and that one grade.

755
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,420
Magic while hungry is a terrible equation.

756
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,820
You know, you're very patient when you're irrationally hungry.

757
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:36,020
So it's a great time to help out a magician on the semi street.

758
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,420
I guess it's not a footpath.

759
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,460
I guess you can't.

760
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:39,780
Yeah.

761
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,940
Jason was like a character in a car, like a Snickers commercial who was so comically

762
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,380
angry that he was hungry.

763
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,580
It didn't even make sense.

764
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,860
And knowing if you were going to eat there that you had probably another hour of waiting.

765
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,020
I absolutely did know that too.

766
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,020
Yes, that was going through my head as well.

767
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,900
There's a lot of forethought going on.

768
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,420
Yeah.

769
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:02,900
Yeah.

770
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,460
We have a video captured.

771
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,380
We can see the anger coming through the screen.

772
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,060
So that'll be cut.

773
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,780
We have that forever, which is most videos of me.

774
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,340
It's fine.

775
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,260
Okay.

776
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,460
So let me ask this.

777
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,180
Of course.

778
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,980
That's the show.

779
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,020
We do.

780
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,060
You fit right in.

781
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,100
Very desultory.

782
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:29,540
Let me ask on the on the guts front, because another thing like in the same way that I

783
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,860
like I assume Mr. Ernst is a multimillionaire.

784
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:40,100
I think it had I bought into the illusion of guts so thoroughly that it probably never

785
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:45,540
occurred to me that you were an actress who got a part rather than like I think I assumed

786
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:52,020
that you having that role must have meant that some crazy like European tribunal must

787
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,180
have chosen you after many rounds.

788
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:54,660
Yes.

789
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,860
Like this is sports.

790
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:01,140
This is like a bunch of like, you know, kind of tan leathery people all after like

791
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,020
nine rounds.

792
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:02,580
All right.

793
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,420
That Moira, she shall do it.

794
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,900
It works just like that.

795
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:15,380
It really makes absolute no sense that I ever did that show.

796
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,980
I think I just must have been very, very different because it really was like when

797
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:26,580
I turned up, I think it was a lot of sort of six foot real fitties, like people you go,

798
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,380
oh, yeah, you look like you play sport.

799
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:33,140
And then I turned up in one.

800
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:37,780
I think I maybe put a baseball pass on, but not for sporty reasons.

801
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,860
Probably my hair was terrible that day.

802
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:47,460
And yeah, I think my first audition was to do sort of play by play of a video of kids

803
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,300
going through the elastic jungle.

804
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:50,820
Oh, sure.

805
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,100
One of the hardest things.

806
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:52,420
Yeah.

807
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,780
Seemingly like that's the.

808
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:58,740
So I might have used terms probably like look at them twinging and twanging and

809
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:02,020
and that probably just sealed the deal.

810
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,060
And I don't know.

811
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:09,540
I think they probably then they had me come back several times to the arena as they were

812
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,500
building that.

813
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,660
And I think there was discussion about would my accent be distracting?

814
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:21,460
Would the fact she knows nothing about sport clearly be a problem?

815
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,900
And somehow I think they just thought it was a bit funny, really.

816
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:28,740
Right, right.

817
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,900
Which was weird because they ended up making me I always thought incredibly school

818
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:37,060
Marmish on the show, but but whatever.

819
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,940
So I just goofed really in the audition.

820
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,740
Serious.

821
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:44,100
Yeah, you were pretty like focused on on the.

822
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,660
Yeah, because they kept rewriting the rules and giving me a card that I had to

823
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,660
memorize 30 seconds beforehand.

824
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,140
So I was like stress.

825
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,260
So you're like authority that you were conveying was actually because of stress.

826
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,340
I've just learned this.

827
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:59,620
These are the rules.

828
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:03,060
Take it from me because I know them from 10 seconds ago.

829
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,780
Yes, of a made up sport.

830
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,980
That's like nonsense.

831
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:09,300
That helps that you know, if you don't know anything about sports, at least they're

832
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,060
the sports were all made up.

833
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:16,420
Well, there was that and I would I would say things that were that were wrong.

834
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:24,340
Like one time I said something about Mike being a bit of a goon and the producer,

835
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:28,260
the executive producer came down and said, well, that's a bit hard.

836
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,700
And and I was just like, what?

837
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,340
He goes, you just called Mike a goon.

838
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,700
That's really harsh.

839
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,700
And I was like, is it?

840
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:43,380
Because I was thinking of the Goon Show with Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan.

841
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:48,100
And he was thinking like hockey sticks and whatever.

842
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,100
So yes.

843
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:55,140
And I would call when they did soccer events, I did accidentally call them football.

844
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:55,940
As they show.

845
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,340
So there was a lot of that.

846
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,340
And I didn't know the rules for anything.

847
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,380
I didn't know the rules to know how they were bending the rules.

848
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:07,700
As far as I was concerned, that was how you played football.

849
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,260
To this day.

850
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:13,940
Yeah, I knew tennis and I knew downhill skiing.

851
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,700
That wasn't going to help me on guts.

852
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,420
As far as you knew, all basketball had bungee cords involved.

853
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:20,920
Right.

854
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,340
Basketball is such a ludicrous sport anyway.

855
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,020
Right now, I need to hear.

856
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,100
Yeah, I would like to hear your opinion.

857
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,060
I guess further thoughts on basketball being ludicrous.

858
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,900
Well, here's the thing.

859
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:41,060
The men are so very tall and the women women's basketball.

860
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:45,220
That was terrible of me, but they're all very, very tall.

861
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,300
And the court is not so very, very big.

862
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:54,740
Whereas if you compare that to, say, soccer, I'm going to say soccer.

863
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,500
That's an absolutely massive pitch.

864
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,740
Simply getting from one end to the other is an amazing feat.

865
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:03,060
Right.

866
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,460
Let alone doing.

867
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:09,300
Now, I'm not going to say that basketball is lacking in skill.

868
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:18,660
I'm just saying the scale of the environment and the scale of the human beings who participate

869
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,980
make it bizarre for me.

870
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,020
I see.

871
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:27,620
So if a basketball court was like four times as big, maybe it would make more sense or

872
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,780
it'd be at least as impressive to watch.

873
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,420
Yes.

874
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:38,020
I mean, I sitting on my fat ass on my couch would like to I would like to render that judgment.

875
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,660
Okay, well, it seems fair.

876
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:41,140
Perfectly fair.

877
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,620
I've actually never heard this about I've ever heard this opinion.

878
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:47,300
So that's I've got tons of opinions about things I know nothing about.

879
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:51,620
Well, that's this that's what the show is for.

880
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,460
Honestly, that's what we do all the time.

881
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,220
So yeah, you mean to tell me that's the case and you don't have a podcast.

882
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,860
I know nothing about this.

883
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:06,340
Well, let me just start arbitrary authority.

884
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,220
That's that's what it's about, which I guess was you on guts too.

885
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:14,580
That like, yeah, I bought you as a she must have been through four years of referee university.

886
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:22,980
And also, I don't have the stature for it because I'm incredibly tiny height wise.

887
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:31,380
And yes, there was just Apple boxes galore that I would stand on to have some sort of authority.

888
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,980
All the kids were about my height.

889
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:39,220
Yeah, so I guess that worry it's not like if you were with boxers, you're never going to

890
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,980
put where you had to like break up a fight, I assume unless that was cut.

891
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:43,940
No, we did.

892
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,580
We did have I can't remember which boxer it was.

893
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,020
We had quite a famous boxer on.

894
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,340
I just saw it in YouTube.

895
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,340
I wonder if Vandor Holyfield was on.

896
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,100
And he was lovely.

897
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,580
And who was the nice who was the nice football boy?

898
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,420
And I say boy, because he was super young.

899
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,460
Because he was like 19.

900
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:06,180
I can't remember, but he was just adorable.

901
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,940
He was the loveliest man in the world.

902
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:11,540
I hope he's had a fantastic life since then.

903
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,340
Yeah, he left.

904
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,100
Well, there's a good human.

905
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,220
That's nice.

906
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,420
Well, all right.

907
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,580
Speaking of a nice football boy, then that's probably what it means.

908
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,220
Whoever this nice football boy is, we wish him the best.

909
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,260
We wish you well.

910
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:24,760
Yeah.

911
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,660
So was the show like was doing it fun at all?

912
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,180
Like it was it intense?

913
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:30,680
Was it?

914
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,460
Yeah, because we did three a day.

915
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:37,140
So it was it was it was a big day.

916
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:43,460
And because they they would just like bring the kids in for the event, the event, the event.

917
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,420
Then then there was moving everything around.

918
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,500
So it was block shots, basically.

919
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,100
Oh, that was my question.

920
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:54,500
I just read that about Legends of the Hidden Temple and that those were maybe kind of frustrating

921
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:58,980
tapings to watch if you were an audience member because it was so broken up.

922
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,340
Dull as dull can be.

923
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,580
I mean, there was audience form.

924
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:09,220
I mean, if there was the drool of all of those rides that you could possibly be going on

925
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:16,820
and being stuck in the extreme arena for hours and hours, I'm sure the parents were fine.

926
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:17,540
They could have a nap.

927
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:23,220
But if you're a kid, I mean, that probably was a tough it was probably a tough call.

928
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:28,740
You once you once it hit minute 31 and you realized, wait, it's not done.

929
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,420
This doesn't take half an hour.

930
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,300
Like when I watch it.

931
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,420
Isn't that sad when when you realize that?

932
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,860
No, we had there was a lot of fun.

933
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:41,780
You know, it's all like the same as backstage shenanigans and stuff.

934
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,020
And and I still have great friends.

935
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:47,540
My friend Kirk, who he's a sports cameraman.

936
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,300
He was a cameraman on the show.

937
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:53,780
And whenever he's here shooting golf, we always get together.

938
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:56,420
In fact, I don't know if you can see the queen behind.

939
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,060
Oh, yeah.

940
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,940
Yes, you do have the queen frame behind or some queen.

941
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,700
That was his wedding gift to us.

942
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:06,260
And I had to write to him and say, I know there shouldn't be winners and losers in wedding gifts,

943
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,940
but you're the winner clearly.

944
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,500
That's true.

945
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,220
There are.

946
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:11,620
Yeah.

947
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:11,860
Yeah.

948
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,180
You don't want to say that, but yeah.

949
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:14,740
Look at her.

950
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:21,140
You never realize about the queen until you have flipping tea tray of her.

951
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,500
She's stacked.

952
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,900
The queen is just stacked.

953
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,300
I don't know how they dress her.

954
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,900
That's harder to see from here.

955
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,780
I guess I could do my own.

956
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:34,340
I think it from me that top chiffonier draw is open.

957
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,180
That's actually a tray.

958
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,180
That's a tray for like serving.

959
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:38,980
Tea tray.

960
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,220
Yeah.

961
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:39,940
Wow.

962
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,820
Back after the coronation, I'm sure there was nothing greater than

963
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,580
serving a cup of tea and some biscuits.

964
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,580
Oh, that's my.

965
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,700
It's going to be walked up to us.

966
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,180
Oh, great.

967
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,540
Oh, hello.

968
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,620
Oh, yeah.

969
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:51,860
Yeah.

970
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,740
Oh, look at the top.

971
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:53,220
Oh, yeah.

972
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:53,940
So, huh?

973
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,220
That's a lot.

974
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,500
Yeah, that's really impressive.

975
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,140
That's I looked.

976
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:00,500
I was happy with it from afar, but now I'm like, well, that's very impressive.

977
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:06,020
Rendered lovingly onto a piece of your raffly tin.

978
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:06,340
Yes.

979
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,620
Dry cake and some tea on that.

980
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:12,820
Fantastic.

981
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,460
Yeah, great.

982
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,900
Now, you did like in watching some episodes recently, you did like,

983
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:23,460
though you if you you found yourself being serious on it, but in the few that I saw,

984
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:27,300
you did like give the business to Michael Malley a little bit.

985
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:34,660
In fact, in one after a particularly like hyper energetic intro he did of all the pieces

986
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,860
and then they got to go through here and then they're going to end up splashing in the pool.

987
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:41,460
Mo, then you I think refer to him as Mike O'Silly.

988
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,100
Oh, did I?

989
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,220
I enjoyed very much.

990
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:45,780
That's pretty good.

991
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:53,140
Halfway through, although sometimes through, I think he was just being incredibly

992
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:59,380
manic and then they just threw to me and it's like and I think I said steady, Mike,

993
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:07,620
and then the executive producer liked that and then I feel like they I got extended on my leash.

994
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:10,740
A little that was allowed to do that.

995
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:13,140
Another one you said, take a nap, Mike.

996
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:13,780
Oh, did I?

997
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:20,820
I think I forgot this was like a like a recurring this was a zone within the show.

998
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,500
The Moira roast.

999
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,180
Full Marmish Moira.

1000
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:29,220
Yeah, somebody should make a super cut of all of these on you and put it on YouTube of all the

1001
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:32,900
like this light light light ribbon gentle.

1002
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:40,340
Yeah, because it's now I got alerted that I think it's playing on the paramount,

1003
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,940
whatever paramount streaming services now the entire.

1004
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:45,860
Oh, wow.

1005
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,820
Yeah, so that's great.

1006
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,100
And I would never do that.

1007
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,380
Is it great though?

1008
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:51,780
Is it?

1009
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,100
I guess that's a question for you.

1010
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,100
Yes, I guess.

1011
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,900
Yes, there's no old footage of me on there.

1012
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,740
So residuals.

1013
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:01,860
That would be fantastic.

1014
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,780
I'll be living in a much larger house.

1015
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,300
Could we shame Viacom into giving residual?

1016
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,420
I'm not even joking here.

1017
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,780
There's a lot of this going on.

1018
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,740
Let's come on.

1019
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,460
This sucks.

1020
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:15,060
I don't think I've got quite Dave Chappelle's pull.

1021
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:19,220
So yeah, just saying I learned my lesson and I'm very happy to be in a union.

1022
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:20,740
Amen.

1023
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:21,380
All right.

1024
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:27,460
What was the around the time it was going on?

1025
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:29,940
Could you even like venture out into the park?

1026
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:30,900
Were you was it like?

1027
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,180
I was working at the park.

1028
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,180
So these are concurrent.

1029
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:34,900
That's the question.

1030
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,580
You would still be doing stuff.

1031
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,140
That's crazy.

1032
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:37,780
Yeah, I could.

1033
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:40,820
I thought I got my job to work for Nickelodeon.

1034
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:42,500
This is a mind blow.

1035
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:46,180
I'm flashing to similarly that I heard somewhere.

1036
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:50,820
I did the important work of listening to an interview with Dan Cortez from MTV Sports,

1037
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:56,740
and he said like he basically he was like a P.A. for his own show

1038
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:01,860
and could not was not willing to not be a P.A. for the show that he hosted

1039
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:05,060
because the P.A. money was better than the hosting money.

1040
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:05,620
Preach.

1041
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:13,460
Yeah, no, I definitely kept my job and they were very nice to let me like have my three weeks.

1042
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,220
I'd say it was shot.

1043
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:18,580
It was shot that quickly that you would just like, let me do my.

1044
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:18,980
Wow.

1045
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:19,300
Wow.

1046
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,820
Because they could make a punch through like three, three a day.

1047
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:23,700
Yeah.

1048
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:28,740
So when kids like notice you when they went to a ride, like would they shot

1049
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,100
like would they be like, hey, wait a minute?

1050
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:37,780
I'm trying to think not the first time, but but later on, I would sometimes sort of get

1051
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:42,260
recognized, but also people always think that you're giant if you're on TV.

1052
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:46,340
And then you learn that everybody in film and television is actually

1053
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,500
it's not surprising to be my stature.

1054
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:50,900
Yeah.

1055
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,780
So you kind of could.

1056
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:55,380
I'm not quite five foot is how I'll put it.

1057
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,900
OK, yeah.

1058
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,780
So you could kind of hide maybe that way.

1059
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:00,820
Yeah.

1060
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:06,260
I wasn't wearing a black and white striped shirt.

1061
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:07,460
That's true.

1062
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:10,100
Kids might not be able to put that together if it wasn't.

1063
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,980
Without that, I was like flipping Hannah Montana.

1064
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,460
Was there ever an urge, though, to be like, you know what?

1065
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,220
I'm going to put the rough shirt on and walk through the park once just to see what happens.

1066
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,860
No, because I didn't.

1067
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,140
I didn't like that.

1068
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:28,340
I'm a very, I'm a very shy extrovert.

1069
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:28,660
Sure.

1070
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,380
Yeah, I hear it up and yeah.

1071
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:31,620
Yeah.

1072
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:31,780
Yeah.

1073
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:32,660
Then you turn it off.

1074
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:38,740
I always found it very weird to get like, I mean, I did a lot of the live tours and

1075
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:45,220
and for Nickelodeon, but they would send us off for the weekend to go to some mall somewhere to

1076
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,300
throw slime on a kid and play a few games.

1077
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:53,860
And I remember going to a bathroom in a mall.

1078
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:56,980
I remember going to the bathroom and just being in the store and just saying,

1079
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:07,140
and as I opened the door, there were like 15 little girls all grinning at me.

1080
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,220
And I was like, I just paid.

1081
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,980
It was really embarrassing.

1082
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:16,740
And they were like, yeah, they wanted my and I think they said, can we have you?

1083
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,180
Can we have your autograph?

1084
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:21,460
And I said, yes, of course you can, but let me wash my hands first.

1085
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,460
And this was before COVID.

1086
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,100
You're her pioneer.

1087
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,100
Yes, I pioneered hand washing.

1088
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,060
So.

1089
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:32,180
What was on the live tour?

1090
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:35,220
And now I'm asking myself why I did not go to this.

1091
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,580
This sounds fantastic.

1092
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:41,860
Love malls, love Nickelodeon, love slime, love you on guts.

1093
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,140
Why did I not go to these things?

1094
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:47,060
You can't answer that question, but what was the what else happened on these?

1095
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,340
I would turn up.

1096
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,500
We would turn up.

1097
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:58,020
I would actually be involved in making slime, which was Baker's.

1098
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,020
Actually, they call it Baker's cream, I think.

1099
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,220
It's what they it's kind of like a pudding.

1100
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:06,180
Okay.

1101
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:11,860
It's called pudding and applesauce and an absolute ton of green dye.

1102
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:16,180
We dyed a couple of tow headed kids, I think.

1103
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,340
Permanently.

1104
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:26,180
Yeah, so I only did the ones where it was just sort of a small mall thing.

1105
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:34,260
Mike can fill more and Mark Summers would go do the massive kind of tours,

1106
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,420
the bus and truck sort of tours of it.

1107
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:37,460
Gotcha.

1108
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:38,260
Yeah.

1109
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:43,620
But you would turn up in a mall, there'd be a stage, play some games,

1110
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,860
dunk a kid and then and then we'd have dinner and go home.

1111
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:48,100
Yeah.

1112
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:52,020
Spend the food court and wait, why are you making the slime too?

1113
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,180
Because I was helpful.

1114
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,220
You wanted the pitch in.

1115
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:57,620
That's nice.

1116
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,660
Naked nations.

1117
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,020
It was just all of us together.

1118
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:02,340
Wow.

1119
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:02,740
Wow.

1120
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,300
Crazy.

1121
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,820
Yeah, that's the mall tours.

1122
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:07,300
I guess I didn't go to any of these either, but like where they're like,

1123
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,540
no, what's on the bigger tour to kids?

1124
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:12,740
Like, do they set up more like of a stage like, or do they?

1125
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:18,980
Yeah, there would be when they did the big tours, then they would have basically concert venues.

1126
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:20,580
Oh, okay.

1127
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,980
Yeah, more like full like that.

1128
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:28,340
And they would actually have props and things from the show.

1129
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:30,340
Yeah, that makes sense.

1130
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:34,420
I always wonder like, because I went to, you know, we've talked a lot on the show about stuff.

1131
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:38,740
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had a live musical performance that I got to go to,

1132
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:42,580
but I do wonder how many of these things, I know it's a very amazing show,

1133
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:47,460
but I wonder how many things like my mom or dad just like were going through the

1134
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:50,340
newspaper and saw like, you know, Nickelodeon Live and they were like,

1135
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,740
let's just put this in the trash so he doesn't see it.

1136
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,300
Yeah.

1137
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:53,860
Yeah.

1138
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:54,260
Let's.

1139
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:57,860
Oh great.

1140
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:58,260
A few.

1141
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,460
Yeah.

1142
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,900
I wasn't treated poorly or anything.

1143
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,780
I'm just saying once in a while, he doesn't need to see this.

1144
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,380
Tax bills coming up.

1145
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:07,620
We don't need any extra expenses right now.

1146
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:13,300
Well, that sounds deeply unfair because as you pointed out at the beginning,

1147
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:18,340
that you weren't on sports teams, so you weren't stealing their weekends that way.

1148
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,900
Well, I did.

1149
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:21,860
Or were you?

1150
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:28,740
A little bit, a little bit, but I'll be honest, I was, I was chosen last in basketball and that's

1151
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:33,380
because my friend's father told his son that I was chosen last in the entire league.

1152
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:37,620
You had that info at your disposal?

1153
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:38,580
Oh my God.

1154
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:40,260
It's crazy to say that.

1155
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:41,460
You know what?

1156
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:49,300
My husband made a very good point because he was also a person who would be picked last

1157
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:54,100
and he said, actually, you're not, you're not ever picked last.

1158
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,220
The person before you is picked.

1159
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:03,220
And then you quietly shuffle over to the people who never wanted you.

1160
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:04,900
Yeah.

1161
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,580
Yeah, that is.

1162
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:07,620
You're not picked.

1163
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:09,060
You just look over there.

1164
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:13,220
There is some comfort though, because expectations are low.

1165
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:18,660
So then like when you're terrified of a fly ball, you're like, well, you knew this was,

1166
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,420
I'm living up to expectations.

1167
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,700
You knew this was coming.

1168
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,820
I'm terrified.

1169
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:23,380
Yeah.

1170
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,740
I had been being out here.

1171
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:28,820
I got hit with a soccer ball in kindergarten, a soccer practice,

1172
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,980
and that colored the rest of my sports.

1173
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:32,580
Rest of your life.

1174
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,100
My rest of my life.

1175
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:35,940
That child will be an actor.

1176
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,780
That child will be a comedian.

1177
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:42,100
He'll be a podcaster, in fact, a future medium of podcasting.

1178
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,300
Did you guys encounter a lot?

1179
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:51,540
There was an oral history of Guts that Sports Illustrated did a few years ago.

1180
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:58,340
And it talked a lot about pulling contestants from sports groups or YMCA groups and that sort

1181
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:03,140
of thing. And the kids all seemed very confident.

1182
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:07,460
Did you encounter many nervous kids like we all were?

1183
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:13,860
No, no, I did not, because they were all super keen to be there.

1184
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:17,540
But I will tell you, and I won't name his name,

1185
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:25,140
but we we were so delighted with him because he was insane.

1186
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:34,660
And like Mike, Mike introduced like the kids all had to say their names and their nicknames

1187
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,220
at the beginning of the show.

1188
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,500
I seemed to call.

1189
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:38,980
Oh, yeah.

1190
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:44,020
And they all they would be like the Brute and then it would cut to this like looking 12 year old girl.

1191
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:51,380
This particular kid, the first kid went and his name was just like, I'm John and I'm

1192
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:56,180
powerful. And then the next one, I'm Katie and I kick butt.

1193
01:02:56,180 --> 01:03:04,020
And then this kid just went like, like animal from the Muppets.

1194
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:05,460
He was just that.

1195
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:12,820
And then he just tore around the racetrack like the Tasmanian Devil jumped over things like he was on

1196
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:14,260
flipping drugs.

1197
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:22,500
He when they got to like the what we called like the second act, Mike had said to the three kids,

1198
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:26,100
what are you expecting in this next heat is this next event?

1199
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,220
It's so difficult.

1200
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,940
And he was saying, I expect you to be the next kid.

1201
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,020
And I said, I'm going to be the next kid.

1202
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,780
Next event is so difficult.

1203
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:37,620
And he was saying, I expect I'm going to have to run really fast.

1204
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:42,420
And the girl was just like, I think I'm just going to be like elbows out.

1205
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:49,140
And he just went, I think I'm going to have leaves flying past my face is what he said.

1206
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:54,740
And that might not be word for word, but it's what I remember because it was something insane.

1207
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:58,260
And we went, oh, interesting.

1208
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:04,820
And then at the end, they had to run and get onto like their first place, second place,

1209
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:06,020
third place podium.

1210
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:08,340
So the first kid runs up, gets his place.

1211
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,580
Second kid runs up, gets their place.

1212
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:15,620
And then he runs up and just jumps over it like the nurse one.

1213
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:19,140
Like, yeah.

1214
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:26,900
Like, and we did find out that he wasn't maybe some like a police group club or something.

1215
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:31,300
And I'm saying this with all sorts of love because he was fantastic.

1216
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,420
He was so happy.

1217
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:39,060
But I think that he maybe did take some sort of meds just to calm him a little.

1218
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:40,500
And he hadn't taken them that day.

1219
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:42,740
And we could tell.

1220
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:46,340
Yeah.

1221
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:49,780
There was going to be a day to get off the meds.

1222
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:53,460
He chose the correct day.

1223
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:59,060
That was well, that was thoughtful.

1224
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:01,940
I mean, you pull a wild card, you get great television.

1225
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:08,900
Well, I think we got, because we'd loved, I think we got pulled and said, you can't be

1226
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,340
amused by this.

1227
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:10,980
Yeah.

1228
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,180
But we weren't on camera.

1229
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:12,820
But I don't know.

1230
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:14,660
I think maybe for the audience or something.

1231
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:17,540
But yeah, that was the best day of my life on Garts.

1232
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:18,980
He was fantastic.

1233
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:19,220
Yeah.

1234
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:22,500
Did he climb the agro crag in like two seconds?

1235
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:22,980
Yeah.

1236
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:24,980
He was at the bottom, then he was at the top.

1237
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:26,740
How?

1238
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:27,460
Yeah.

1239
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:28,980
There was just nothing in between.

1240
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:29,940
Oh, well done.

1241
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:30,900
Manic kids.

1242
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,340
It's a perfect plate.

1243
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:37,540
If only every kid who has energy issues could go work it out on the agro crag.

1244
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:38,260
Exactly.

1245
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:40,500
It would be a great therapeutic place.

1246
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:41,960
Yeah.

1247
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:46,180
Better than if we had the three of us as kids.

1248
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:46,580
Exactly.

1249
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:47,300
I tried to do it.

1250
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,580
With a stunt team around you.

1251
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:49,860
Huh?

1252
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:51,700
With a stunt team around you too.

1253
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:52,740
Yeah, with a stunt team.

1254
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,900
I just think it would have been a little less,

1255
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:58,980
did you have it a little more like, are they anxious?

1256
01:05:58,980 --> 01:05:59,480
Yeah.

1257
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:04,340
Like that is our version of Garts.

1258
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:07,220
I would have climbed the agro crag and my mom would have been right behind me,

1259
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:09,300
making sure I was OK the whole time.

1260
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,860
Just like spotting me as we go up.

1261
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:15,780
That would have been a good episode, honestly.

1262
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:16,280
Yeah.

1263
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,940
To go up in a sort of a stroll, that's sort of fun,

1264
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:22,180
without all the mylar exploding at you.

1265
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:23,060
It's very squishy.

1266
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,860
It was surprisingly squishy.

1267
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:27,460
Like trampoline-ish?

1268
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,140
Like sort of bounced a bit, huh?

1269
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:34,500
So if a kid like ate it, it wouldn't be so bad landing with your face on it.

1270
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:34,980
Yeah.

1271
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:38,660
And there were two guys from the art department who would wait up there,

1272
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:41,700
maybe to throw more mylar, I don't know.

1273
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:47,140
I think I mentioned Muttley at the beginning of our time together,

1274
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:48,820
but one of them laughed like Muttley.

1275
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:49,860
He was amazing.

1276
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:50,360
Yeah.

1277
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:55,240
And they taught me, those two guys in the art department taught me,

1278
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,720
because we all had to wear Reeboks and they always, you know,

1279
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,320
your laces always come undone.

1280
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,320
And if there's anything I learned from Garts,

1281
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:05,560
it was from those two guys who taught me how to tie my shoes in a particular way.

1282
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:09,240
And my shoelaces have never come undone since 1992.

1283
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:10,920
Wow.

1284
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,040
Wow. That's interesting.

1285
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,160
I'm curious to know what that is.

1286
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,400
That's like a superpower.

1287
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,080
Yeah, really.

1288
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,960
I'm still bad at tying my shoes.

1289
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:25,800
Yeah, I was late to that in addition to like, oh, man, he's crying a lot.

1290
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,400
I was also very late to that.

1291
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,400
I was like, the Velcro makes so much sense.

1292
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,360
It's so efficient.

1293
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,400
Why are we ditching it?

1294
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:37,560
But, you know, I didn't have gaffers helping me.

1295
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,000
I didn't have row teasters.

1296
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:39,560
No, you didn't.

1297
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:44,280
Or people to throw mylar on you once you'd had success with your shoelaces.

1298
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:44,840
That's right.

1299
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:52,040
I was reading like a Guts Wikipedia page where somebody pointed out that the,

1300
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:56,440
yeah, right, so there's the piece of the rock that is your trophy at the end.

1301
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,440
This Wikipedia.

1302
01:07:58,440 --> 01:07:59,160
Oh, boy.

1303
01:07:59,160 --> 01:07:59,880
Oh, my gosh.

1304
01:07:59,880 --> 01:07:59,960
Yeah.

1305
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:00,680
Oh, here we go.

1306
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,160
Let me pause and prepare myself.

1307
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:05,480
All right.

1308
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,920
To see one of these things.

1309
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:11,320
This is going to be the best thing I did over Zoom the entire time was see a piece of the.

1310
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,440
I was just going to say, like, I read this thing.

1311
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,480
Oh, here it comes.

1312
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:15,800
Whoa.

1313
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,240
Wait, wow.

1314
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:17,720
Whoa.

1315
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,760
It's lit up too.

1316
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,200
Yeah, it's got my name on it.

1317
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:21,160
Wow.

1318
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:21,720
Wow.

1319
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,320
How does it light up?

1320
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,600
What's it doing there?

1321
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:27,720
That adds value.

1322
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,400
Geez.

1323
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,920
What does it say on there?

1324
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,760
It says global guts.

1325
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:35,160
So that was the global guts version.

1326
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,360
Season one.

1327
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,880
So that was aspirational.

1328
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,360
Mo, on your mark, get set, go.

1329
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:45,640
Which I never said.

1330
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:46,520
It was always a whistle.

1331
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,720
Nickelodeon Studios, Orlando, Florida.

1332
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:51,240
Wow.

1333
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,240
It honestly gave me chills to see that and then hear the phrase,

1334
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,560
the full phrase Nickelodeon Studios, Orlando, Florida.

1335
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,720
And my husband says it's all thanks to him to pay for that.

1336
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:06,760
Yes, you have a disclaimer on your website that I will that you will not sell your agro

1337
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:09,720
crag unless like for a significant sum of money.

1338
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:10,360
Significant.

1339
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,880
I've got my mother to take care of.

1340
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:12,920
Yeah.

1341
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,320
Maybe a listener out there.

1342
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:16,680
Oh, did you go to my website?

1343
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,040
I don't think I've looked at that.

1344
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,800
It probably needs updating, doesn't it?

1345
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:20,840
Yeah.

1346
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:24,440
It's you know, it's the important thing is it's still there as opposed to mine,

1347
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,960
which disappeared apparently seven months ago and I never noticed.

1348
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:28,840
So you're doing better.

1349
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,200
It disappeared.

1350
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,720
I'm on my second account.

1351
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,440
The site that was it was hosting it became not a site anymore and didn't tell anyone.

1352
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,640
I never got an email.

1353
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,800
So yeah, it was months of it.

1354
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,680
My website might look like a MySpace page.

1355
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:48,360
I don't know how old it's been a long time since I've looked at it.

1356
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:48,520
Yeah.

1357
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,920
And God knows what happened to my first Twitter account.

1358
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,120
So now I have a sad second Twitter account that makes me annoyed.

1359
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:55,800
Yeah.

1360
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,720
I do want to ask we've seen your agro crag.

1361
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,560
Do you still have your cable ace award?

1362
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,440
Oh, that wouldn't have gone to me.

1363
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,480
I've become the executive producer.

1364
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:07,880
Okay.

1365
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,560
That's in a Nickelodeon office.

1366
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,320
They probably didn't even know I was on the show.

1367
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:15,800
There wasn't a referee category where you competed against American Gladiator.

1368
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,920
Best full bryon nylon striped shirt.

1369
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,600
Yes, I'll take that award.

1370
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,560
No competition for that.

1371
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,880
What was the so the the the ending of the whole enterprise,

1372
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,800
not only the show, but also the closing of Nickelodeon studios.

1373
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:40,760
How was the how were your emotions surrounding the end of that era?

1374
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,040
Ambivalent.

1375
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,280
I guess the checks helped get you to that point.

1376
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:48,520
Yeah.

1377
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:54,280
By that time, because there's a lot of kids out there who are starting a lot of petitions

1378
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,360
and I guess you weren't you weren't signing them.

1379
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:59,160
Bring back the big stream arena.

1380
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:06,280
I've had such a weird like my favorite and great time with Nickelodeon was was,

1381
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,960
you know, when when they finally opened up Nick Toons,

1382
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:14,440
which was this great building in Burbank, I always used to drive by and go,

1383
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:15,640
that's an amazing building.

1384
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,640
Someone should do something with that.

1385
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,280
And it became Nick Toons.

1386
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:25,400
And so I was very happy to go in and do the shows there.

1387
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,760
It was a nice transition.

1388
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:30,760
I don't think most people at Nick Toons knew that I'd actually worked on camera

1389
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,440
at Nickelodeon.

1390
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,600
It was weird.

1391
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,480
Yeah, I think I was going to make a point, but I can't remember what it was.

1392
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,280
Oh, it was better.

1393
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:51,080
So but when when Nickelodeon or Nick Toons opened, they they had their proper opening

1394
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,240
and they had a massive party.

1395
01:11:54,120 --> 01:12:02,360
And I did get invited as a VIP, having been on their shows for several years

1396
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,920
and being on their cartoon series.

1397
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:10,680
So I turn up good as gold, all happy to go to a party and have a cocktail in the afternoon,

1398
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:11,960
planning a nap afterwards.

1399
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,160
I'm not on the guest list.

1400
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,040
I couldn't get in.

1401
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:17,560
Oh, God.

1402
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:19,640
Can you imagine?

1403
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:23,400
And they enforced it and nobody checked for you?

1404
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,000
No, there was no.

1405
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,120
They said, I'm sorry.

1406
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,160
I'm sorry.

1407
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,600
And I went, don't worry about it.

1408
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:33,160
And got back in my car and we went off and had lunch somewhere else or something.

1409
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:33,800
It was something.

1410
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:39,560
And then my friend, D, D Baker, he was the voice of Olmec.

1411
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,640
So we're good friends.

1412
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:51,160
Well, he said inside the party, there was big mugshots of me, me and Mike, of all of the shows.

1413
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,560
But but only only on a picture.

1414
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,440
I couldn't get him.

1415
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,280
Isn't that bizarre?

1416
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,400
Oh, no, is in it.

1417
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,120
Oh, my God.

1418
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,640
If only you had known and had that to point to.

1419
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,920
There's a picture of me inside.

1420
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:05,720
Can you let me in?

1421
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,680
I'll point at it.

1422
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,600
That's the worst part.

1423
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:12,200
When you're a PA and they're like, oh, they forgot me on the rap party.

1424
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,000
All right, fine.

1425
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:13,480
I'm nobody.

1426
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:16,440
But when you're trying to do the like, I'm in the OK.

1427
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:19,720
So there's in the sixth scene, if you watch, I'm in.

1428
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,560
And it's just like, all right, man.

1429
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:22,040
Yeah.

1430
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:22,440
I know.

1431
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,160
Whatever.

1432
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:27,480
Learned since then that actually getting into the parties.

1433
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:28,920
I mean, I should have been.

1434
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,360
Obviously, there was a mistake.

1435
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:31,720
Clearly.

1436
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:32,840
Yes, I hope so.

1437
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:41,080
But but yeah, it's not an unfamiliar story in the Hollywood trenches of people invited.

1438
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:46,360
That's why you always have the phone number of someone you know will be there early.

1439
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:48,840
That's you.

1440
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,120
Jason, he's already early.

1441
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:52,920
Oh, I'd be happy.

1442
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,440
I'd be happy to let anyone in.

1443
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,200
Who's my phone number?

1444
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:00,680
But no, that that's my trick for not going like, hey, come on.

1445
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:04,040
Like, I hate this restaurant usually.

1446
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:04,840
But come on.

1447
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,600
I at least want to say hi to some people.

1448
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,760
Yes, exactly.

1449
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:09,480
Yeah.

1450
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,600
So you're all right.

1451
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,760
So so Fonder feelings for the Nick, besides this party situation, Fonder feelings for

1452
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:18,440
the Nick Toons building where you've done a bunch of a bunch of stuff.

1453
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:19,320
Yes.

1454
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:19,560
Yeah.

1455
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,040
That's great.

1456
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:25,880
So and actually did they they did a Sanjay and Craig where they recreated Mike and me.

1457
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,240
Oh, really?

1458
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,280
A few years ago.

1459
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:28,920
Yeah.

1460
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:29,560
Wow.

1461
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,880
That's a nice way to tie everything together.

1462
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:32,440
That's so cool.

1463
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:36,680
Yeah, there's a Sanjay and Craig style me rendered.

1464
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:37,880
Yeah.

1465
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:38,360
Wow.

1466
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,080
That's great.

1467
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:39,580
Amazing.

1468
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,120
Yeah, let's see what.

1469
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:45,080
Well, well, now the Star Wars thing.

1470
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,160
Let's let's talk about your place in the Star Wars.

1471
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:54,120
I love and have always loved and ever since I first saw the movie have been astonished by

1472
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:57,800
and and it's really all I can think about.

1473
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:00,680
Yes, of course.

1474
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:01,160
Yes, yes.

1475
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,120
On the record.

1476
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:11,800
We all love Star Wars and the only thing we love more than Star Wars is working regularly.

1477
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:12,280
Exactly.

1478
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,160
All the same.

1479
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,080
When did you start loving Star Wars?

1480
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:17,720
I would say about the time they hired me.

1481
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,040
Yes.

1482
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:19,800
Would be the truth.

1483
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:21,480
Yeah.

1484
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:22,280
Yeah, makes sense.

1485
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:26,360
You've done like multiple video games, though.

1486
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:27,560
Yes, I do.

1487
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,680
I love video games.

1488
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:28,920
Yeah.

1489
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:29,480
Which is fun.

1490
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:32,280
I mean, I've video games in general, but multiple Star Wars games, too.

1491
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:37,640
Is there like a is any of these not just Star Wars, let's say, like any of the video games,

1492
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,800
is there any different than the regular video stuff?

1493
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,160
Is it more fun?

1494
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:41,480
Less?

1495
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:42,760
Is it more work intensive?

1496
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:46,680
It's a different.

1497
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,440
It's a different animal.

1498
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:58,280
And actually, this year, because I was doing video games, I don't know if I would have

1499
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:05,720
gone on the learning curve that I have because they, I think they just needed to continue

1500
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:10,200
their work getting these enormously expensive games done.

1501
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,680
And it was sort of, will you be willing?

1502
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,680
Are you willing to record from home if we send you

1503
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,240
the equipment and tell you how to use it?

1504
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,800
To which I said, yes, I will do that.

1505
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:25,080
And thank goodness for that.

1506
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:28,520
That was blind light with a game called Destiny 2.

1507
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:35,240
Because of that, I knew everything to buy and how to set it up and how to work it.

1508
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:44,280
But it was several weeks of me learning how to use logic and my preamp and just

1509
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,160
it was a lot of YouTube watching.

1510
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:55,960
But yes, like some games, when I did Skyrim, I got that all done in an afternoon.

1511
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:01,640
And then other games, it goes on for years.

1512
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:09,880
There's a game about a boy who's slightly magical that I can't talk about because I've signed an NDA.

1513
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:15,640
But I'm not saying who it is because there's lots of magical people in the world.

1514
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:20,040
And maybe I mean literal magic and maybe I don't because what is magic?

1515
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,800
That's been going on for a few years before it's been released.

1516
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,600
And some games don't let you even talk about it even once it's released.

1517
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,560
It's weird.

1518
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:31,800
Yeah.

1519
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:36,040
Oh, so there's things you can't take credit for for whatever reason, just because of the odd

1520
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,320
way that they.

1521
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:37,880
I don't know.

1522
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,160
They're there.

1523
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,680
That's a funny world that.

1524
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:47,880
But yes, sometimes it's a lot of being shot and that can be.

1525
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:55,000
And other times you're a witch who can only access her powers when she's drunk.

1526
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,520
And that's super fun.

1527
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:00,440
So it's just all different types of characters.

1528
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:00,680
Yeah.

1529
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,240
A very wide range, it seems like.

1530
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,680
It's actually not something I didn't even consider.

1531
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:09,480
But I guess, yeah, like if you're like the characters running and like getting hit,

1532
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,960
you have to do a lot of it's like, oh, my God.

1533
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:17,160
Yeah, that's really I think for me, that's that's the part that's

1534
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:26,920
I'm not going to say it hardest, but it requires a different sort of part of the brain to to work.

1535
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:30,360
And I did have one director who was just great.

1536
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:35,480
And he would say because they know the kind of exact sound that they need.

1537
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:42,600
It's sort of like war scenes and fight scenes that they really do have to orchestrate them in a way.

1538
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:49,080
So sometimes they need a or a and you have to give them that.

1539
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:53,160
So don't be breaking your voice going when they need a.

1540
01:18:54,840 --> 01:19:00,280
Yeah, just get you in the general vicinity of much happier with words.

1541
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:01,400
Words.

1542
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:02,760
Yeah.

1543
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:03,880
Words in my Ballywick.

1544
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:07,240
Makes sense.

1545
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,720
On efforts and grunts.

1546
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:10,600
Sure, sure.

1547
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:13,400
If anyone ever wants to give me sort of line readings for

1548
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:19,320
exactly this sort of sound or efforts that they need, I'm never upset.

1549
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,360
I welcome it.

1550
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:20,920
Yeah, sure.

1551
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:22,680
I've been on the other side of that.

1552
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:27,320
I'm like, thank you for saying that because either I could do a dance,

1553
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:32,200
I could say a bizarre paragraph to try to get to where it sounds like,

1554
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,960
eh, I could just say, eh, it's very.

1555
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,280
I'm more practiced now.

1556
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:41,160
And also with games, you have to understand that

1557
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:46,920
most people just want to get you out of the way so they can keep playing.

1558
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,880
So, you know, you're sometimes an unwelcome presence.

1559
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:54,360
You try and make yourself as welcome as possible.

1560
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:54,600
Yeah.

1561
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:59,000
You're also you have so many credits in the in the like ADR looping world,

1562
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,760
which now what occurs to me is what you began.

1563
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,000
That's the that's the murder she wrote.

1564
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:05,640
I know.

1565
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,400
You had all ties together.

1566
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,600
All tied together.

1567
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:16,360
Yeah, it's actually a fun job and I often go in.

1568
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:21,800
It seems that I have a canny way with news reporters.

1569
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:28,280
I you will often hear me in the background being some sort of BBC type

1570
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,080
reporter newscaster.

1571
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:34,440
And whenever someone calls me and says, do you want to do that?

1572
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,680
I always say, well, yes, I do.

1573
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:41,640
I turn up, I do my job, I sign my contract and I go home.

1574
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,400
Seems like the way to do it.

1575
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:43,720
Dream.

1576
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:50,840
Wait, it's not sexy, but here we are doing a live in the life.

1577
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,320
In a house in L.A.

1578
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:57,800
Well, that's we were we were talking, I think, a little at the start of all this

1579
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:02,760
or even before we started the whole the notion of like is because we I think we built up

1580
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:08,680
in L.A. now, but we built up Orlando is like the dream of dreams because like all the at

1581
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:12,280
least in the early 90s, all the best entertainment is there to us.

1582
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,120
The best theme parks are there.

1583
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:18,760
Some of who became the biggest stars in the world are just starting to hone their

1584
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:22,440
craft at seven years old or whatever it is.

1585
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,480
Are we insane?

1586
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:27,800
Are we insane for thinking that Orlando is this this Xanadu?

1587
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:28,200
What is it?

1588
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:36,120
It's actually because it is and I don't mean this as a dispute, it's a secondary market

1589
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:44,040
where you can go and live affordably and practice and hone your craft.

1590
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:47,160
You can do theater there, you can do improv there.

1591
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,600
All those sorts of things and think about all the people.

1592
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:56,520
I'm thinking about the people that I was there with who were in my sort of coterie at SAC

1593
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:05,160
and at the theme parks and we have, you know, D Baker was there who's in every single Star

1594
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:11,960
Wars cartoon, every who plays Klaus on American Dad.

1595
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:16,600
He's just, you know, he's just amazing in the world of voiceover.

1596
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,080
Wayne Brady was there.

1597
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:25,320
Jonathan Mangum, who's on, is it not the price is right?

1598
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,800
The one Wayne Brady did like his like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1599
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,960
He's like, yeah, yeah, right.

1600
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:33,000
Oh, he was an Orlando guy.

1601
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,040
Oh, they go back.

1602
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:34,440
Okay.

1603
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:42,040
Our friend Claire Sarah's, you know, she's a film writer and does very well.

1604
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:49,960
Our friend Aaron Shaw wrote on Raymond and wrote on The Office and has his Emmy and,

1605
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:52,440
you know, everyone sort of started there.

1606
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:58,200
And then, but the sad thing is, I don't know if it will always be this way, but yeah,

1607
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:03,240
you'd better get yourself to maybe Georgia or LA or New York or Chicago.

1608
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,160
It's just, that's still the way it is.

1609
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:08,680
You're always going to be sort of geographically challenged,

1610
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:12,120
but there's amazing people performing there.

1611
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:17,400
The people that who are still at the parks, I think about who are just fantastic.

1612
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:18,920
Sure.

1613
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:19,420
Yeah.

1614
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,480
Steve Pernick's still there.

1615
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,480
He wrote, he wrote Shelby Wu.

1616
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:24,680
Do you remember the mystery?

1617
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:25,240
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1618
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,280
Yeah, that's true.

1619
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:31,640
So he wrote that and he was the detective in it and he's back in Orlando and he has his

1620
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:34,120
house and his family and performs.

1621
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:34,840
Yeah.

1622
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:35,640
Sure, sure.

1623
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:41,320
Is there, I always ask us of people who performed in the parks, because I'm a little jealous

1624
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,600
I didn't do this when I was younger.

1625
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:46,680
I think it would have been fun to do it, but is there like a thing you did in the parks

1626
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:52,760
that if you were like, it would be fun to do an hour again of this, like to this role,

1627
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:57,320
this murder she wrote or is there anything like that or is it all like, ah, that's, I did it.

1628
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,280
Oh, that's so funny.

1629
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:06,360
We went back to, my husband was doing the Genie Conference, the Magic Conference,

1630
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:11,720
and it was in Orlando and he got, you know, he had his flight and some pay.

1631
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:14,200
Oh, he's, you can just speak words.

1632
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,880
Once the Genie Conference comes up.

1633
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,240
Yeah, he's not a magician.

1634
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:26,600
He was there as an allied artist because he does juggling and performance art and comedy.

1635
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:35,880
But so, so we all went and it was 2017, so I hadn't been there performing and,

1636
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:40,040
and I looked at parts of Epcot and I went, well, that looks familiar.

1637
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:44,040
And then I went, oh my God, I worked here because that's what happens,

1638
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:47,000
lad, when you get older, you forget things and you just,

1639
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:50,680
everything becomes very compartmentalized, I think.

1640
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:53,640
No, I wouldn't go back.

1641
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:54,680
I don't like going back.

1642
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:57,640
There's nothing that I would do again.

1643
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:04,920
But I'm definitely appreciative for that, that part of my life there.

1644
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:05,080
Yeah.

1645
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:05,240
Sure.

1646
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:12,120
It was, and I did enjoy when we went back, I think I maybe enjoyed it more as being

1647
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:19,640
a person with my kids, showing them stuff that I'd enjoyed as a kid and just being such an

1648
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:25,320
old woman about it because I made sure that we all went on the carousel of progress.

1649
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:33,160
I said, we are doing this because I just remember when I was little that you would always go there

1650
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:34,920
because that was the free ride.

1651
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:39,480
You didn't have your A ticket, your B ticket or your E ticket for that.

1652
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:41,480
It was just, you could just get on it.

1653
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:42,280
I don't think I knew that.

1654
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:42,520
Okay.

1655
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:46,040
You could learn about the fine General Electric products.

1656
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,880
That was the big.

1657
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,640
It's sort of, it's a tides of branded.

1658
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:49,800
Yeah.

1659
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:54,440
And also, and to this day, I mean, I don't know where I would put it, but if I ever did

1660
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:59,240
find a machine that you, whatever it is that you wrap around you and then it jiggles you

1661
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,120
and you're meant to lose weight that way.

1662
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:04,360
I mean, a, what a dream.

1663
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:05,400
I hope it works.

1664
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,920
I'm sure it does clearly.

1665
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:08,840
Yeah.

1666
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:15,640
And that I would remember that from the carousel of progress and the dog, the animatronic dog.

1667
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:15,880
Yeah.

1668
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:23,240
I guess I remember the theme parks more for just from being a kid myself and the actual

1669
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:23,880
working there.

1670
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,520
I mean, I love the people.

1671
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:27,480
Yeah.

1672
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:29,640
Peter and Paul vote were there too.

1673
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,720
Amazing people were there.

1674
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:32,120
So yeah.

1675
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:37,960
So when you are at the theme parks, really, really pay attention to who's performing because

1676
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:42,600
they're going to be amazing one day somewhere else.

1677
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:47,240
You might see them on a TV show, even though clearly they're making more, you know,

1678
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,600
why would they do a TV show?

1679
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:52,120
And they've got that gig, right?

1680
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,320
Is that how it gets started?

1681
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:56,200
More dependable living in the parks.

1682
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:59,400
Yes, apparently this is what we've learned.

1683
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,360
We've learned so much.

1684
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:05,160
Yours was more about why would you do one TV show rather than another TV show?

1685
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:05,960
Yeah.

1686
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:09,400
Children can't wrap their heads around the concept of sag scale, though.

1687
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,480
So, you know, it's a lot figured out.

1688
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:20,840
Why would, what's her name, Lucy Lawless ever do anything other than the show shot in New Zealand

1689
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:23,000
for five shillings?

1690
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,560
Why would she then do network television in America?

1691
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,200
I'm really going to have to ponder that one.

1692
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:34,600
Surely they kept, I mean, they kept discovering such riches on that show.

1693
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:39,320
I don't know that the residents of Pawnee are that rich with balloons or whatever.

1694
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:42,620
No.

1695
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:51,800
Well, thank you for taking us on this, this rich, this intellectually rich journey to Orlando.

1696
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:57,560
Random, desultory kind of old womanish type reminiscences.

1697
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:00,920
Oh, no, it was, it was fantastic.

1698
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:01,640
It was a blast.

1699
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,720
More of a Quirk You Survived podcast, The Ride.

01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:04,520
What an honor.

1701
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:05,800
So happy to have you.

1702
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,680
Thanks for putting it out there and reaching out and wanting to be on it.

1703
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,600
Thanks to your daughter for supporting the show.

1704
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,360
That's, that's great news to us.

1705
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,160
You might have us be intern.

1706
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:16,600
What's, oh yeah.

1707
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:18,920
Oh, should we?

1708
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:19,480
Don't let her.

1709
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:22,040
They're starting to pay some internships now.

1710
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:23,320
Don't make the mistakes we did.

1711
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:26,760
We're stalking yourself.

1712
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,600
Let's exit through the gift shop.

1713
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,040
Is there anything that you would like to plug?

1714
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:32,520
Anything I would like to plug?

1715
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:35,000
No, I'm absolutely secured with NDAs.

1716
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:35,480
What?

1717
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:36,040
What?

1718
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:37,000
Instagram.

1719
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,520
Oh yes, Instagram.

1720
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:41,080
Follow my sad Instagram and my sad Twitter.

1721
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,600
They're really quite jolly.

1722
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,280
My name, Maura Quirk.

1723
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:47,000
Okay.

1724
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,440
That's what I got told.

1725
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:52,120
That's what I got told and I am a person who does what I'm told.

1726
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:52,680
Yeah.

1727
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:58,600
So follow me and I put, I put jolly pictures on to make you smile in the morning.

1728
01:28:58,600 --> 01:28:59,320
Well, that's nice.

1729
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:01,080
Or anytime that you look at them.

1730
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,360
They're not just for the morning.

1731
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,160
Oh, it doesn't expire at a certain point.

1732
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:07,480
Like Steven Spielberg's Quibi was going to.

1733
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:09,800
They're nocturnal and diurnal.

1734
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:11,160
Well, that's fun.

1735
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:11,560
Wow.

1736
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:13,000
They work all the time.

1737
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:13,800
That's impressive.
