1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,340
Oh yeah, alright.

2
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,820
Take it easy, baby.

3
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,780
Take it last all night.

4
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:40,380
We ate at American Girl for club three here on podcast, the ride where, look, we don't

5
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,460
really introduce ourselves all the time because you know who we are, but I do notice that

6
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:52,460
a special friend has just appeared while I was doing the intro with Mike Carlson.

7
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,700
I'll introduce you because of your, you can now introduce your friend.

8
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,060
Sharing the mic with me is Kirsten.

9
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:06,380
Kirsten is here, an American Girl doll who belongs to my sister and is definitely like

10
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,380
30.

11
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,780
She's, her character's age is over 100, but she's at least 30 years old as far as her

12
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,300
plastic and her whatever sweater and everything else.

13
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,140
Okay, well it's, you know, 30, I don't know how much that does for us.

14
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,340
That's a little young, honestly, which makes us not that interested here on podcast the

15
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,340
ride.

16
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,300
But over 100, now that's the age range that we like.

17
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,300
That's what we like.

18
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,300
Yeah.

19
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,420
So wow, Kirsten, it's a pleasure to see you again, I say again because we spent a little

20
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,420
time together.

21
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,420
Right.

22
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,420
Well, she's, hi, Scott.

23
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,420
Hey, good to see you.

24
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,060
Gosh, you winked a little bit while you waved.

25
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,700
My eyes closed and opened too.

26
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,700
Hi, Jason.

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,700
Hi, Kirsten.

28
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,900
Nice to see you out of the iron lung that you live in.

29
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,900
Yeah.

30
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:58,220
It was $200 in 1993 for Mike's mom to buy the iron lung.

31
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,220
For the lung accessory.

32
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,180
The accessory that we needed to buy to make a lung.

33
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,180
But you had to.

34
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,580
How do you, we don't want to be around without an iron lung.

35
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,940
You absolutely need your primary accessories.

36
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,860
That and tissues with blood in them.

37
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,860
Yeah.

38
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:18,100
There was a lot of historically accurate accessories that added up to over the thousand dollars.

39
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,020
An iron lung, if you would plug it in and it would suck power from the Carlson house,

40
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,020
half of the neighborhood would brown out.

41
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,020
It actually drains.

42
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,940
That's good because you want, you know, you're not doing the American girl experience unless

43
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,940
you're overspending.

44
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,940
Right.

45
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,940
Oh, yes.

46
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,260
And if something is not, if something is battery powered or doesn't take any power at all,

47
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:43,260
then it's not being, it's not a suck on your own power bills, which is what really helps

48
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,700
you increase those numbers of how much you spent on this set of toys.

49
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,700
Absolutely.

50
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,300
Yeah.

51
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,980
Those were about what I expected when I looked at the online store.

52
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,720
But yeah, the accessories really add up.

53
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,540
It's really where they get you.

54
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,460
And there's one that I'll, that I'll shout out in particular is actually kind of a part

55
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,460
of the assignment.

56
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,380
Um, but Kirsten, I'm glad you're here.

57
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,100
I'm glad you you'll be chiming in.

58
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,100
It seems like you're in there.

59
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,100
Uh oh.

60
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,100
Uh oh.

61
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,100
I'm okay.

62
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,100
Oh, geez.

63
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,420
Doctor says I don't have too much longer, but I'm okay.

64
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,420
Kirsten.

65
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,420
I think she's Swedish.

66
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,420
She should be Swedish.

67
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,420
Kirsten.

68
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,420
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,420
I should have been doing a Swedish voice.

70
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,420
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,420
It's not too late to be Swedish, Kirsten.

72
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,420
Kirsten.

73
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,420
Doctor says I don't.

74
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,420
Right?

75
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,420
That's it.

76
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,980
A doctor says I don't have long.

77
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,420
Well, you were a little less annoying before.

78
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,420
Yeah.

79
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,420
You don't have to be.

80
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,420
You know what?

81
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,420
I'm glad you Americanized.

82
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,420
You don't need to be Swedish.

83
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,420
That character.

84
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,100
There's more longevity to that impression, perhaps, on a podcast than the Yakov, Yakov

85
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,420
Shmirnov voice I was just doing.

86
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,180
Yakov Shmirnov, famously from Sweden.

87
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,180
From Sweden, yeah, yeah.

88
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,940
No, it's my fault for not having the accent.

89
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,900
Kirsten has a consumption cough, but Mike and I are both getting over, Mike had an awful

90
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,620
cold and I had a terrible sinus infection.

91
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,700
I think maybe I had your sinus infection.

92
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,700
It is possible.

93
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,020
It could have been either of us gave it to either of us.

94
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,020
It is possible.

95
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,020
I'm not saying you gave it to me.

96
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,020
I'm saying I could have given it to you.

97
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,020
I don't know.

98
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,020
We don't know.

99
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,420
I unfortunately missed this ad and you know I must have been sick if I was missing out

100
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,420
on a chance to have chocolate mousse because I love chocolate mousse.

101
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,220
There's no way you can get that other than going to Century City, California.

102
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,220
Well, you'd be surprised.

103
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,980
It's hard to find, I think, analogies.

104
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,100
Do you have trouble finding it?

105
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,580
Do you have trouble finding chocolate mousse?

106
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,220
Yeah, I think Trader Joe's are good.

107
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,220
I think you can find it.

108
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,220
I guess so.

109
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,380
It seems like you're skeptical about that, though.

110
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:44,340
So many places just have ganache or different preparations that aren't just like-

111
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,100
There is zero percent chance that there is not, within a mile of where you live, available

112
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,100
chocolate mousse.

113
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,100
I'm positive.

114
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,100
Of course.

115
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,340
Mousse is not some rarity, some rare.

116
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,540
Maybe in Kirsten's time it was, but-

117
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,140
Yes, I can't find chocolate mousse to save my life.

118
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,100
My father needs it for his medicine.

119
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,900
I know that was just a turn of phrase, but just so you're clear, I don't think chocolate

120
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,900
mousse is going to be the thing to save your life.

121
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,860
Oh, that's what my father says.

122
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,460
My father says it's his medicine.

123
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,460
Oh, sorry.

124
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,460
Well, you know what?

125
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,460
Very well.

126
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,460
Actually, you know what?

127
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,180
If that's what he says, they need all the chocolate mousse you want.

128
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,580
I'm sure it's going to help you with whatever it is you're dealing with, and I'm so sorry.

129
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,260
Just one prayer to God and a chocolate mousse and he'll be all right.

130
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,420
He'll survive through the winter.

131
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,980
That's what father says.

132
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,020
Now I'm questioning everything.

133
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,540
Maybe a little more, maybe just double the mousse intake, and I'm sure he's going to

134
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,540
be okay.

135
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,540
Yes.

136
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,500
Yes, he will be fine.

137
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,900
Let me, before we get too far, let me address some Club 3 business.

138
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,460
We are talking about American Girl Cafe here.

139
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,900
The runner-up was a squeaker.

140
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,420
This was really, really close.

141
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:03,420
Number three, revolving restaurant roundup.

142
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:10,460
And only in a poll where there's something else that has my permanent allegiance, only

143
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,340
in this case would I not be really vying for revolving restaurant roundup, which presumably

144
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:21,640
would just be like we pick as many revolving restaurants to talk about all over this great

145
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
nation and world.

146
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,580
I love revolving restaurants.

147
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,580
This sounds great.

148
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,140
We'll revisit this one down the road, I think.

149
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,860
Sure, yeah.

150
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,860
So that's great.

151
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,860
Hell of a poll.

152
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,620
I thought all of these were really great.

153
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:39,340
But the runner-up, which moves to next month, the Beach Boys episodes of Full House.

154
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:47,300
Now you might be thinking Scott's going to make a pitch here to pick that next month

155
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,120
for him, to make that a choice for Scott.

156
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,100
And I say don't do it for me, do it for you, do it for yourselves.

157
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,220
Speaking for myself, I know I'm going to knock that out of the park.

158
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,300
I'm going to make that the best damn episode you ever heard.

159
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,900
And I don't want to put that on you guys too, but I would like to think that the summer

160
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,860
fun will be infectious.

161
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,940
You'll have your toes tapped into the California beat.

162
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,980
You're lobbying pretty hard and you're making it very attractive.

163
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,980
But that's part of this.

164
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,500
That's part of the process.

165
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,060
I can't make anything.

166
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:30,380
I can't make Madam and Wailin' Flowers as attractive as that, I don't think.

167
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,340
You didn't in round one.

168
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,380
Certainly there are vocal folks out there who have been pushing for Madam.

169
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,620
But I don't know if it's a birthday shot, I don't know if we can get it into a poll

170
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,620
again.

171
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,580
Again, it was a last place in a poll of all last places.

172
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,860
I wasn't going to do this.

173
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,980
Mike, for God's sake, what is it?

174
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,940
Do I need to put a timer on this?

175
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,420
Okay, put a timer on me at like two minutes.

176
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,420
Two minutes.

177
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,420
No way.

178
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,380
You're getting a minute, a minute 45 at least.

179
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,380
Okay, I can do it then.

180
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,380
Okay, great.

181
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,380
All right, here we go.

182
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:08,620
A video went viral online of Coldplay playing of a man charging the stage.

183
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,380
I don't know if you two have seen this.

184
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,380
No.

185
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,900
Okay, a man falls off the stage, Chris Martin stops the performance.

186
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,860
This man was protesting something, I'm not sure.

187
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,780
What caught my eye and a friend of mine's eye is that there is a puppet on stage with

188
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,420
Chris Martin during this performance.

189
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,100
He looked into this.

190
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,460
Coldplay has a whole puppet band as of a couple years ago called the Weirdos with original

191
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,460
characters.

192
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,020
They're Henson created puppets.

193
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,140
Here's a picture of them right now.

194
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,220
They also have their own characters that sing songs on like not maybe the one of the albums

195
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,780
in the last so many years.

196
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,380
If you buy a new Coldplay album, you get some fucking puppet band on there.

197
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,580
And I think one of this, I listen to one of the songs.

198
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,580
What happened to Coldplay?

199
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,900
I listen to one of the songs and I know I have time running out.

200
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,420
One of the songs sounds just like Chris Martin is doing the Prince Camille trick and just

201
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,500
pitching his voice up and he's like playing the main weirdo character and I believe that's

202
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,140
the character that was in the video on the concert.

203
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:12,300
I'll say this, maybe my rap on Coldplay, if you can believe it, if you can believe that

204
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,580
someone has this opinion.

205
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,740
The Coldplay is a tad boring.

206
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,620
What you're describing, while it sounds abhorrent to me, is not boring.

207
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,620
Right.

208
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,180
Do you want me to read the members of the band real quick?

209
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,180
You have 30 seconds.

210
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,220
Angel Moon, Donk, Sparkman, The Wizard, and Bruce Cake Mix is their manager.

211
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,740
Well, now you have my attention.

212
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:38,480
Admittedly, you had my attention at Donk.

213
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,580
So I believe they're legit Henson puppets.

214
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,780
I haven't fully investigated who's singing what on which album and which character is

215
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,380
doing what.

216
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,500
But if the audience wants, we can put the weirdos in play in Club 3.

217
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,220
I'm going to be so fucking pissed if this beats the Beach Boys.

218
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,220
So I hate to add-

219
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,220
And what are they, the Coldplay weirdos?

220
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,300
If you were going to submit it and someone has to submit it by parliamentary procedure.

221
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,780
Yeah, let's say yeah, Coldplay dash the weirdos.

222
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,820
Again, if that sounds attractive to you, I can't promise that there's a ton of content

223
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,820
there.

224
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,260
We will make the content regardless of what actually exists.

225
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,740
As opposed to not to make this a versus situation, this will be the most robust report you've

226
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,180
ever heard from me.

227
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,500
You're getting journalism, you're getting a true thorough breakdown.

228
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:38,500
So I can promise materials and wide breadth.

229
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,340
But again, not to, but maybe we are in a little dog fight here.

230
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,340
I guess we are.

231
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,220
What I can promise is if there's not a ton of content here with the weirdos, I will go

232
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,020
through Coldplay's X and Y and explain to you the songs on that album that I like and

233
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,020
why.

234
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,020
Jesus, oh God.

235
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:58,180
Is that the one with the music video with the, is it monkeys or crabs?

236
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,100
Oh, I'm not actually sure about that.

237
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,340
That's the one before Milo Zyloto, I believe.

238
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,300
I listened to that one in college.

239
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,940
So that's all really I can promise.

240
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,580
I can't promise the greatest episode ever, but I will go through Coldplay's songs I like

241
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,620
and we will investigate the characters from the weirdos.

242
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,020
You're telling me that in an episode where you go through the Coldplay songs you like,

243
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,060
you think that might not be the greatest episode ever?

244
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,020
I'm trying to lower expectations so when it's the best episode ever, everyone's really blown

245
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,020
away.

246
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,020
That's my tactic.

247
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:33,700
When everybody, when it finishes and everybody's in para, para, paradise.

248
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,820
Yes, exactly.

249
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,860
The weirdos are out there in the audience now.

250
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,860
It's up to the audience.

251
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,780
Unless Jason has a spoiler he wants to throw in.

252
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,780
No, no.

253
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:48,500
I mean, I thought the weirdo was the guy trying to climb a stage wearing an Israel flag as

254
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,900
a cape eating shit.

255
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,900
Oh, did you just find the video?

256
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,740
But it turns out there was, no, I've watched, I've seen the video, but it turns out there's

257
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,300
a whole band of weirdos on stage.

258
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,820
Yes, and I think he was not going to protest the weirdos being on stage.

259
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,300
I think it was a different thing.

260
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,580
This is, look, I'm not going to, I'm going to be an adult here.

261
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:13,980
I can't start flagging like it's going to be a problem for me if the weirdos beat Beach

262
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,980
Boys Full House.

263
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,260
I'm just like, look in your heart, you know what's best.

264
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,420
The audience will do what's best.

265
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,460
I told myself on the Elitch Gardens episode, I was like, don't bring up the weirdos.

266
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,180
Don't bring up the weirdos.

267
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,900
But it happened here and it had to, I think I'd had to say it.

268
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,140
You make that special for the, you do, there's a couple levels

269
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,020
of play wall and that's the great stuff you get is the weirdos.

270
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,020
The weirdos.

271
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:45,140
It's the Coldplay music video for Adventure of a Lifetime has all these dancing CG monkeys.

272
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,140
I know what that is.

273
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,140
I know that song.

274
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,140
I know.

275
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,140
That's a single.

276
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,140
Are we going to have to talk about that?

277
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,140
I don't know if I like that song.

278
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,860
This is pretty funny.

279
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,660
I mostly know it because they would play it above the big, the big screen above City

280
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,140
Walk and the five, the stage.

281
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,340
And only the finest musical materials get to play there.

282
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,340
Let's just talk about that music video, I think.

283
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,340
Yeah.

284
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,620
It's because there's going to be a lot of debate of like, are these better or worse

285
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,380
monkeys than Kingdom of Crystal Skull monkeys?

286
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,380
Oh, yeah.

287
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,380
Well, that's true.

288
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,380
All right.

289
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,380
Well, if you want to vote for it.

290
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,380
You know what?

291
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,980
You've heard, I think you've heard, Eyeling listener, you've heard everything you need

292
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,100
to hear and also a couple more topics to flesh it out.

293
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,100
Yeah, of course.

294
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,460
Maybe something, maybe something somehow can trans both of them.

295
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,460
We will see.

296
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,460
But that's possible.

297
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,260
This brings us to this one, which has been hanging on since February and we finally made

298
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,380
it here in June.

299
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,060
This is from Jessica American Girl Cafe.

300
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,540
It's a themed restaurant.

301
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:48,140
Our two Disney daddies and one small wooden boy can dine at Century City, each with their

302
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,820
own chosen doll companion.

303
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,020
Sweet cocktails where you can add glitter, check.

304
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:59,020
A set meal where there's a cinnamon roll as part of the appetizer, check.

305
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:06,380
The opportunity to consider buying a doll sized working Pac-Man arcade game, check.

306
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,300
Opportunity is everywhere.

307
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,520
Thank you, Jessica.

308
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,460
And here we are.

309
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:21,460
So yes, we we went to this Mike and the wooden boy sat it out, unfortunately, but Mike and

310
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,660
I went went down there.

311
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,680
I guess before we get into our experience, here's the thing.

312
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,920
I know that, you know, sometimes it'd be a good thing to do kind of like a little bit

313
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,280
of a prehistory of the brand and the place and of what we're talking about, but I start

314
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,360
going through that American Girl Wikipedia is the most complicated thing I've ever seen.

315
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
It's dense, yeah.

316
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,600
And by the time I saw that there was a heading for an entire section that is labeled permanent

317
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,640
underwear controversy, I'm like, I'm tapping out of here.

318
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
It's dolls.

319
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
You know them.

320
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,800
They've been around our whole lives.

321
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,920
We're not getting into the permanent underwear controversy.

322
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
No.

323
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,400
Save that for the fucking Coldplay Weirdos episode.

324
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
We can talk about it there.

325
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,600
We'll kick it to that one.

326
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,320
But you know what they are.

327
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,600
They're historical dolls.

328
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,320
They come from different times.

329
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,840
You don't need us to explain that.

330
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,040
I started in 86 and it's been with us ever since.

331
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,200
And I think it's gotten more and more bougie ever since.

332
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,760
Yes, because it started out very much in like a sort of like this educational actually.

333
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:32,480
It seems like that was kind of the intent early on when, wait, what's the name?

334
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,040
It was on the menu.

335
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,320
The founder's name checked on the menu.

336
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,320
Oh, yeah.

337
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,320
Why when Pleasant T. Rowland.

338
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
Pleasant T. Rowland.

339
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,880
This is shocking.

340
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,320
This is the first mention of Pleasant T. Rowland.

341
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
That is true.

342
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,320
Yeah, we should really have been bringing that up.

343
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
Yeah, I know.

344
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,880
And I think the only reason it hasn't happened before is that I don't think Pleasant T. Rowland

345
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,200
is a guy.

346
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,680
I think Pleasant T. Rowland is fine.

347
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,960
And I think started the company with the intent to educate and is a true philanthropist from

348
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
what I can tell.

349
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:11,160
Maybe people can alert me to stuff I did that wasn't included in the source materials.

350
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,960
It's not good about Pleasant T. Rowland.

351
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,960
It sounds like a villain's name, certainly.

352
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
I know.

353
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,080
That is the most guy name of all time.

354
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
Yeah.

355
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Pleasant T. Rowland.

356
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,400
Well, that's the thing.

357
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,960
I think it's, because Pleasant T. Rowland is a woman, but I think if you made it a man,

358
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
suddenly it becomes.

359
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
It's like an oil tycoon.

360
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Well, hello there.

361
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,240
The name's Pleasant T. Rowland.

362
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Exactly.

363
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
How do you do?

364
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,160
I do better now that I've met you.

365
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Right.

366
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
Pleasant T.

367
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,680
But I think Pleasant T. is fine, and Pleasant T. was an educator.

368
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,320
So there was that initial thrust to this was to like not only kind of fill this age gap

369
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:56,280
between baby doll and adult doll, that being Barbie and the like, it kind of filled an

370
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,960
age gap of doll.

371
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,720
But also there was the idea to like, and then it'll get young girls excited about learning

372
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,480
about different historical eras too.

373
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,480
Yeah.

374
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,980
And there's always been a lot of accessories and clothing.

375
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,640
It's always been pretty commercial.

376
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
It's never, I feel like-

377
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
It's always been expensive.

378
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
Yeah, I think.

379
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
It's always been expensive.

380
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
But it was like a dryer in its vibe.

381
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Much drier.

382
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
Brand, yeah.

383
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,160
Much drier.

384
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,360
But there's a like, Kirsten has like, I hear some people saying Kirsten more than Kirsten,

385
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,400
so excuse me if it's Kirsten.

386
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,120
There's multiple Kirsten books.

387
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,720
All the different characters have books and different other ancillary materials about

388
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,880
stories and things they've done.

389
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,840
And that is continuing into today with the new characters and the different brands.

390
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,320
Why, in the recent past, maybe it was 2015, I don't know when this was, the character

391
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:53,280
Grace, I don't know what era Grace is from, but Grace was in her own movie, Grace Stirs

392
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,680
Up Success, starring Olivia Rodrigo.

393
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,440
Well, well, well.

394
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,880
Starring both of your human conduit to relevance, Olivia Rodrigo.

395
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,960
Wow, I gotta see that.

396
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,240
I'll see half of it.

397
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,680
I'll watch half of it.

398
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,520
Yeah, it's, you're saying like this is a lot, like there's a lot of information here.

399
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:22,280
I combed through the YouTube and there is truly an unlimited amount of videos that they

400
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,640
have produced.

401
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:31,200
Any kind of media you imagine, stop motion with the dolls, animation, CGI animation,

402
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,840
and just for seemingly no reason, things will just switch back and forth.

403
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,280
Everything is posted with like CGI that's bad and weird and off-putting.

404
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,280
And then all of a sudden it's stop motion with the dolls and there's Laura there.

405
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,640
And then there's just footage of like people playing music and the music is actually attributed

406
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,840
to one of the characters, but these two human beings are playing music and not playing the

407
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,840
character.

408
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,480
And I'm not sure there's, cause there's like a character named Tenny, Tenny Grant, who

409
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,880
plays guitar, who was released in the last 10 years.

410
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,440
And then there's like just like singer songwriters playing Tenny songs.

411
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,480
I'm like, but they're not Tenny.

412
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
Where's Tenny?

413
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,480
Why?

414
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
I'm confused by all of this.

415
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,160
So I'm like going through a YouTube trying to decipher like what's been going on in the

416
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,040
last decade and it's impossible.

417
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,300
And then the whole time my daughter is just looking back at me when I would put a new

418
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,120
video on and going, no, no.

419
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,080
And I put a new video on to try to watch something and this is for like little girls, I would

420
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
guess.

421
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,840
And then I go, no, no, every video, not a single video did she like, oh, I'm interested

422
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
in this.

423
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,040
No, she's turn around at this off-putting CGI like American girl, no.

424
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,760
If she had a little more words at her disposal, she would have said, dad, go back to the dolls

425
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,320
you usually play on TV.

426
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
Well, that's right.

427
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,320
Exactly.

428
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,040
There's so much other unnerving stuff she likes.

429
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,960
Father, which one is Tenny?

430
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
I am confused.

431
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,360
She didn't care about Tenny.

432
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,960
She didn't care about any of the songs.

433
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,200
And as soon as I saw Tenny, I got excited because I said, oh, I'm going to like Tenny's

434
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
songs.

435
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
She's got her own songs.

436
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
I'm very excited to like Tenny.

437
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,000
And it didn't happen.

438
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I didn't like Tenny.

439
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Sorry.

440
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Tenny Grant.

441
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,880
So I guess you're finding, we're having a hard, we haven't maybe found our full in to this

442
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:20,080
brand at least before our encounter with the physical race.

443
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:29,280
Now this, I will say, I previously with my son had just been to the Century City Mall

444
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,120
where we were sent on this expedition and we'd ended up in the store and he had a ton

445
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,800
of fun in the store.

446
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,840
So I have recent positive associations with like, well, yeah, because there's like, there's

447
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,200
so many accessory, you know, there's, there's little cars and little trains and there was

448
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,840
a ton for him to play with and for him to not buy.

449
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,840
Thank God.

450
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:58,720
But as Jessica said, this is a, this is a themed environment and it's in a lot of places

451
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,220
that it's in like, I feel like in, in elevated malls, you know what I mean?

452
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:10,600
This is like, cities have their like major American girl outpost, which is probably a,

453
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,120
you know, a more like committed, with more like, a more committed to place with more

454
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,880
like ornate architecture than you're going to find in a lot of typical toy stores.

455
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,400
So this is, you know, I could see why people thought of this for us.

456
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,680
Yeah, no, it makes sense.

457
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,680
Yeah.

458
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,560
These are in the, there's a little more money going around.

459
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,560
They were making sure they put these in a place where people are going to spend a little

460
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,480
more, I think.

461
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:39,320
And there is so, I guess I was just like shocked at how much stuff is still being made.

462
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,640
I guess I really didn't know how popular this brand still is.

463
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,640
Well, if you don't, because we both grew up with little sisters, so we're aware of it

464
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,640
then.

465
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Right.

466
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,760
And then you're newly a dad of a daughter.

467
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,760
So you're only, who knows if she'll get into it.

468
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,400
We missed a lot of middle, right?

469
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,040
Other than sometimes I'll be somewhere like Chicago, or I remember being in whatever it

470
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:06,880
moved malls in Dallas, but wherever it was before, I went into that one for a second

471
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
and like, Oh my God.

472
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,040
There was like a committed, there was like a valet entrance just for that.

473
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
Okay.

474
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
Yes.

475
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,160
This is a, like, I only knew it was a big deal from occasionally catching wind of the

476
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
stores here.

477
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Yeah.

478
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:27,440
I remember growing up the books in the scholastic, like catalogs or book fairs, the boring books,

479
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,440
you know?

480
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
Oh yeah.

481
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
It was all boring to me.

482
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
Very brown covers.

483
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
Did you read them?

484
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
I did not read them.

485
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
Okay.

486
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,440
You never read a single one?

487
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:42,880
I was intrigued because like, clearly there's what we say now is like, clearly there's lore,

488
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:50,960
clearly there's backstory here, but I was reading very boring historical books of like

489
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:58,040
the Marvel comics adaptation of the battle of Gettysburg that they sold at the Gettysburg

490
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
gift shop.

491
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
Really?

492
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
Yeah.

493
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Do you want to put that in the club three poll?

494
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,640
Marvel comics Gettysburg comic?

495
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,440
I don't know where my copy is, but I bet we could find it online.

496
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,800
Put that in, someone nominate that to nominate it.

497
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,920
Don't do it because it might split the vote with Coldplay Weirdos.

498
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,440
Put it in because it should be in on its own.

499
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
Yeah, yeah.

500
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
That makes sense.

501
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Sure.

502
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,160
So yeah, I just, you know, like a lot of things when you're a little kid, you go like, that's

503
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
not for me.

504
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,480
I'm not interested in that.

505
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,440
Now, if I had seen stuff like, and I've said this before on the show, where like there

506
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:39,160
was a Barbie camper that was in like the Sears Wishbook that I really wanted my sister

507
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,560
to get because I knew Barbie was for girls and I wouldn't be caught dead having a girl

508
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:49,600
story even though I wanted to fucking camper and play with Barbie so badly.

509
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,560
If I think if they had, now that they have all this contemporary crap, I think I would

510
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,960
have been more interested in it because they'll have, they have like a big camper kind of

511
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,520
a thing and they have all these like elaborate accessories depending on what the character

512
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
is.

513
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,920
Well, you can get a $600 Hogwarts Express.

514
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,000
Well, yes, that's true too.

515
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,840
And there's Disney versions of the Disney dolls now too.

516
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,120
So if I had gone into this as a little kid, it just at the time I was a dumb little boy

517
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:25,000
who was just like, history is boring, I want space and I want a Ninja Turtle, like all

518
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
that stuff.

519
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:31,840
I had to read a number of like, I wanted to read all those, you know, basic scholastic

520
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,940
books about the sinking of the Titanic.

521
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:42,800
So that way when I went on a Norwegian cruise line cruise to Bermuda, I would just be terrified

522
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,720
the first day or so that we were all about to die.

523
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
And that happened?

524
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:54,440
Yes, it didn't dawn on me that there are not icebergs in that off the coast of the

525
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Carolinas.

526
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
That's awesome.

527
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,920
That's still how you are today because if we're talking about somewhere with a pier

528
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,240
with rides, you're like, this is what happens to piers with rides and then you show us a

529
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,240
photo from 1915.

530
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Or night.

531
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,440
Well, there is some terrible hurricanes in the mid 20th century.

532
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,880
Yeah, they took a lot of amusements.

533
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,760
My favorite book up until maybe I was, well, maybe it's still my favorite book, was the

534
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Mario choose your own adventure book where you would go and pick which warp pipe you

535
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,160
went in at the end of a chapter.

536
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:32,740
Those books were, I light up my brain, I can feel it light up like in more excitement than

537
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,740
anything else.

538
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,320
When I think about that book over any book I've ever read.

539
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,680
I was, I read a lot of the original seventies and eighties ones, which would drive me insane

540
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,740
because I was trying to read all the way through them and get to the end.

541
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,900
So I, yeah, just a lot of made up problems in my head.

542
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,900
That was my childhood.

543
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,900
Yeah.

544
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,980
No, I wanted to live permanently in the Nintendo entertainment system.

545
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,980
Sure.

546
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,980
And so, yeah.

547
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,060
Even when you weren't playing video games, when you were forced to.

548
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,380
Did you never, did you guys never have these?

549
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,380
It sounds familiar.

550
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,180
They were out of like print by the time I started getting them.

551
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:11,060
So like I was desperate to get them all, but they only, I only had a couple because they

552
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,580
had already stopped making them.

553
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,420
Maybe they weren't that popular, but.

554
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,940
Jump pipes in pros.

555
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,940
That's a good idea.

556
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,940
I like that.

557
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,940
And yeah.

558
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,020
So you would jump to like a certain chapter, depending on what your choice was.

559
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,420
And then you would die in the book and go back to the start.

560
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,220
Oh, they just send you back to the beginning?

561
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,220
Yeah.

562
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,220
So I was obsessed.

563
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,740
This is, these are my favorite books.

564
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:36,620
And then occasionally the book would just start flashing the main menu and you would

565
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,180
have to blow in it and like restart it and try to fuck with it.

566
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,140
You would have to blow on the book if it didn't work.

567
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,140
Yeah.

568
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,580
I didn't do well.

569
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,540
I feel like I never even beat the book fairly because then you would go back and like cheat.

570
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,540
Oh, sure.

571
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,700
You're supposed to start at the beginning and do it.

572
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,700
Wow.

573
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,740
But you could cheat and I probably cheated just to see the end of it, but yeah.

574
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,700
So I was a, yeah.

575
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,700
That's not good boy behavior.

576
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,700
I hope you kept that to yourself.

577
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,620
Not smart boy behavior as far as what I was interested in.

578
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,620
The kind of literature.

579
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,540
The kind of literature I remain interested in.

580
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,540
Yeah.

581
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,940
Yeah.

582
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,940
So, so American Girl.

583
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,940
Yeah.

584
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:17,340
They, they, and I think in 2017 I saw is when they start the contemporary characters.

585
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,340
Okay.

586
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,860
So it seems more fairly, like fairly recently that they started appealing to dumb little

587
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,460
boys like me.

588
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,540
That's when they were like, we got to go after the dumb little boy market.

589
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,940
And I think it seems successful.

590
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,940
It seems successful.

591
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,940
Yeah.

592
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,940
Yeah.

593
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,220
I mean, there's still the, the historical component, but they just keep updating it.

594
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:41,340
I mean, the thing that really depressed me and that will depress some of our listeners

595
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,700
too, is that they, I mean, cause they keep stepping up, right?

596
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,780
Like they're, you know, they're like, there's this girl from the seventies and this girl

597
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,100
from the eighties.

598
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,540
And I was pretty dismayed to find that there are these twins who are from 1999.

599
00:27:54,540 --> 00:28:01,260
The 1999 is now like a boy, a way back when, but I, I don't know.

600
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,660
I understand though.

601
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,140
And it's like, when you go into the backseat, wait, I got them.

602
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,860
Yeah, and they are, they're represented.

603
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,980
They have a little like alien with their names, which I like.

604
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,980
That's pretty good.

605
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,980
Actually.

606
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,980
Yeah.

607
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,500
That does kind of, that's an unexpected defining the time.

608
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Yeah.

609
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,500
You would have like an alien sticker probably.

610
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Right.

611
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,500
But one of them is the best.

612
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,140
I think one's like preppy and one's weird and the weird one's like, uh, likes grunge

613
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,940
music from Seattle.

614
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,540
She's the, she's the alt girl.

615
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,540
So weird.

616
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:38,220
To the Quinn of her preppy sister.

617
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:43,100
On that recent historical front, there is a girl Courtney.

618
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,300
She is from 1986.

619
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:51,500
And that brings us to one of the little assignments from Jessica, which I didn't know.

620
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
We were passed to that.

621
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
I didn't see this in the store.

622
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,300
I didn't pay attention to it in the store.

623
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,020
Oh, I definitely like noticed Courtney's logo and vibe.

624
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:03,260
And I like, well, maybe Courtney's my, I think if I had to pick one, I think I'm Courtney.

625
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:12,260
Uh, um, but, uh, the Courtney is the one where Jessica mentioned a working doll sized Pacman

626
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,260
arcade game.

627
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,260
Oh yeah.

628
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,260
Yeah.

629
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,260
And I looked this up.

630
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,260
And in fact, yes, it is.

631
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,620
This is an accessory you can buy.

632
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,520
It's 18 inches tall.

633
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,520
It works.

634
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,900
It's a little joystick.

635
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,900
That's really good.

636
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,700
And, uh, and it is $300.

637
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,700
Wow.

638
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,700
All right.

639
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,700
Fair.

640
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,700
Wow.

641
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,700
Wait a minute.

642
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,700
It's a working video game cabinet.

643
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,700
Yeah.

644
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,860
You're the most picky on prices person of the three of us.

645
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,620
And that's the first thing that you're like, fair, it makes sense for me.

646
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,340
It would probably be just my size.

647
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:50,500
So I just keep it on my nightstand by the mockery of regular sized arcade.

648
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,060
Courtney comes with a little bottle of Quaaludes too.

649
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:57,820
And she's got, if you look closely, uh, like that, uh, shot from Empire Strikes Back of

650
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,820
Carrie Fisher.

651
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,980
Courtney has a little Coke nail.

652
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,980
Yeah.

653
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,380
Yes.

654
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,380
Yeah.

655
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,380
Yeah.

656
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,380
Uh, or catchphrases.

657
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,380
Greed is good.

658
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,380
Yes.

659
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,380
Yeah.

660
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,300
That's, you can get those like one up arcades for like 600 and then I have sitting in my

661
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,820
garage a Simpsons that I bought for 200 that I haven't put up yet, but I have the big box

662
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,820
of it.

663
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,820
So that's still 300 is.

664
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,820
Yeah.

665
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,820
That's the thing.

666
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,820
I think you can buy a real one for.

667
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,820
For 300.

668
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,820
Well, I don't know if it's the right sale.

669
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,780
I'm interested to know how many of these they're selling though.

670
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,980
Because you know, with accessories, sometimes for toys and stuff, sometimes the run of them,

671
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,340
they make so little you would be surprised maybe.

672
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,660
So maybe they only made like 500 of them and that's why it's 300 bucks.

673
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,660
Huh.

674
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,660
I don't know.

675
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,660
I'm not sure.

676
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,660
Yeah.

677
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,660
And I don't know if they have information.

678
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,660
This is your area.

679
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,660
Yeah.

680
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,660
I guess you might know.

681
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,500
And the intention is not, it's like this is, we're not going to like, uh, you know, it's

682
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,540
not going to be some gangbusters line for us.

683
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:57,740
It's just, this is a boutique item and, uh, the girls with the best parents will end up

684
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,780
with that little piece.

685
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:07,180
Are there 2010s dolls who are really into STEM, like the way they kind of force STEM

686
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,860
into like children's toys in the last 10 years?

687
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,820
Sounds like they haven't gotten there yet, but maybe that's coming.

688
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,820
Maybe that's in the lab.

689
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,580
Get some cat eye glasses and a shitty little working laptop.

690
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:25,300
You just put a fucking Chromebook, tiny little Chromebook.

691
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,740
Yeah.

692
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,300
Either generic or you partner with Google.

693
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,420
There is a lot of like partnership in these, I mean, the fact that there is like a genuine

694
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:40,940
branded Pac-Man and Harry Potter is these are, these are deals on a massive scale.

695
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,940
These are licensing.

696
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,140
I mean, it's what Lego did when they, they kind of turned the company around.

697
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:49,540
This might be, I don't know so much about the history of Lego, but Lego kind of turned

698
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:54,260
the corner on the company when they just started doing everything, Marvel, DC, Harry Potter

699
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,700
Yeah.

700
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,700
Yes, Pharrell.

701
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,500
They did all the brands, the major brands, you would assume.

702
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,100
So yeah, it seems American Girl went that way and I'm sure it helped them thrive.

703
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,900
The IP, it infects everything.

704
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,900
Definitely.

705
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,900
Yeah, yeah.

706
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,900
Well, so there's all these areas.

707
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:15,340
There's the dolls, the books is a big area, the movies, your kit, Kittredges.

708
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:19,500
And then of course, these establishments, which really bring it into our territory.

709
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:24,900
I think the first one of the, so American Girl Place is the bigger setting.

710
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,780
Some of which, maybe all of which, I'm not sure, have cafes.

711
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,100
98, the first one opens in Chicago.

712
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:38,020
There's nine locations with dining, including Chicago, Nashville, Dallas, Orlando, and Los

713
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,060
Angeles.

714
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:46,060
This was at the Los Angeles location was at the Grove for a long time.

715
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:53,260
I think it was like Caruso's first essential work, the Grove, fancy little fake town.

716
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:59,140
I don't know what, I didn't know that they left there, but they left there.

717
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:05,180
And that one seemed maybe a little more like ostentatious in a way, you know, like possibly

718
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,180
bigger.

719
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:10,300
I don't know, just like, I think the cafe was bigger.

720
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,380
I think definitely it was a bigger space.

721
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,900
Maybe that was the idea is like, we still need to be, so we're going to do business

722
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:21,580
but I don't know if we can afford like three massive stories at the Grove.

723
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,580
I'm not sure.

724
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,580
Don't know.

725
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:28,740
But they are now at Westfield Century City, which has come up on the show before because

726
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,580
it's the former home of Dive, the Spielberg submarine restaurant.

727
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:37,580
I also recently learned that it is the birthplace of the Planet of the Apes in the fourth film

728
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,980
Conquest for the Planet of the Apes.

729
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,700
Of the Planet of the Apes.

730
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,700
Conquest.

731
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,700
Oh really?

732
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,460
You know, because those are 20th century Fox movies.

733
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,660
Which is right, the lots over there.

734
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,460
Yeah, and that's why it's Century City, I believe.

735
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:54,500
So I think they're, so yeah, pure proximity makes sense to go over there.

736
00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:00,300
But it's also, yeah, it was kind of a new mall at that time, I think, like early 80s.

737
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:07,820
And it, so they use it to fill in for dystopia and because it's a little futuristic, but

738
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:13,100
then it's a weird, like literally, spoiler, at the end, there's a speech that's like,

739
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:19,940
From here, from this point, we will all start a Planet of the Apes.

740
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,340
And then it goes wide and this kind of like stores in the background.

741
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,740
So it is weird, it was in my head, I just watched that, thanks to Griffin naming that

742
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:32,500
his favorite Planet of the Apes, I'm glad I watched it for that reason, right on Griffin.

743
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,660
And it is, so walking around there, that was in my head for sure, like whoa, this is where

744
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:40,540
it all began, in that timeline at least.

745
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,100
That's cool.

746
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:49,360
But so yeah, it moved there in September 2023, and it gave us license to go there,

747
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:54,540
we got to go to a place we ignore because it's really inconvenient to get to.

748
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,820
It's so inconvenient to get to.

749
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,500
I know that seems weird if you look just at a Google map.

750
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,660
Yes, it's not inconvenient to get to at two in the morning.

751
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,660
Right.

752
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,660
Very easy.

753
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,660
But it's so...

754
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,700
I don't think it's open then.

755
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,140
Hard to get there.

756
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:14,420
And I still was like prepared, I'm like okay, so I'll leave some time, it'll be fine, and

757
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:19,300
then, sorry to be in LA complaining about traffic person, but oh my god, god that was

758
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,780
crazy.

759
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,180
And then getting back was even worse.

760
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,180
It was so bad.

761
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,180
So bad.

762
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,180
It was so bad.

763
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,180
Oh my god.

764
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,180
What happened?

765
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,180
It felt like a two hours, I don't know.

766
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,500
It was three in the afternoon, why was that so bad?

767
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,100
I don't know, it said like it's gonna take 90 minutes and then it took like two hours

768
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,540
10 minutes to get like 20 miles, to move 20 miles.

769
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,540
Yeah.

770
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:49,140
Oh yeah, I ended up like, it was just, I just did an entire stint down sunset, all the way

771
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:55,340
down the full sunset strip, which was thankfully a pretty engaging, oh wait, well you know

772
00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:01,460
what, before I get into that, I guess there's something that we have to reveal about this,

773
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,540
about the trip that we took.

774
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:09,900
With our little wooden boy not there, we also made a decision, here's the, you know, okay,

775
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:16,340
there's a way, could it have been us adults sitting at this doll restaurant with our little

776
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:21,440
dolls in their little seats, it could have been this, certainly, would that have only

777
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,520
served to make us very uncomfortable and the server mildly uncomfortable, although I bet

778
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,620
it happens more than you think, so it's not actually that weird, but then also, here's

779
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,540
something to say about the American Girl Cafe.

780
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:41,420
My old boss, Conan O'Brien, filmed a remote there a number of years ago, that is without

781
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:48,100
a doubt the funniest piece of comedy that will happen where a person without a child

782
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:52,660
goes to eat with a doll at this restaurant, so like, you know what, we're not gonna be

783
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:57,700
in that territory, we have children, let's take our children, let's go with our kid,

784
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:04,700
let's do this in not a bizarre way, maybe someone will get genuine enjoyment out of this,

785
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,060
so we did, both of us took our kids.

786
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:14,460
Children, Lindsay was in my place, did, was Lindsay an American Girl doll girl growing

787
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,460
up?

788
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,460
No.

789
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,460
Or did she hate them?

790
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,460
She don't hate them, I don't think.

791
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,460
She was indifferent?

792
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,860
She was a little too old for it and just never did it, so she doesn't really, yeah, she didn't

793
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,540
really have any, like, affection for it at all.

794
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,860
Did you take that doll with you when you went there?

795
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,420
Well, what a good question you ask, Jason, what a good question you ask.

796
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,420
Oh no!

797
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,460
You didn't warn me there was something you wanted to talk about that wasn't the weirdo's

798
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,460
face.

799
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:44,340
I would say as far as me being on time, I'm okay, I fight against my programming sometimes

800
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,500
when it's like, I gotta be on time, I gotta be on time.

801
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,100
When you add Lindsay and the baby in, it makes it a lot harder.

802
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,100
It's a lot of possibility.

803
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
It's a lot of possibility.

804
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,500
I even was a little, I was like, enough things, I even said, maybe let's all aim, let's try

805
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,500
to be early.

806
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,380
Which I did, which got me there on time.

807
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:03,180
If I hadn't tried to be early, I would have been there late.

808
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,820
I was walking around the house, every ten minutes going, we gotta be on time.

809
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,540
I was doing this, we gotta get on time.

810
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,020
I'm like, oh, we're running a little late.

811
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:18,020
I was picturing a very harsh headmistress saying, you are late, what do you mean here?

812
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,740
Your girls are already in class, so you can't join them.

813
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,380
The girls are already eating their tea and whatever, crumpets.

814
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,940
So, I'm like, stressed about being there, because I know it's Century City, the worst

815
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:39,540
place to go to, and I know that it's hard to wrangle, wrangling everyone is almost impossible.

816
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,700
And so I'm like, all right, we're doing okay.

817
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,940
We're doing okay to be there on time.

818
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,780
We leave, we get about five minutes on the road, six minutes.

819
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,620
I'm like, kind of like, okay, I think it'll be all right.

820
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:54,500
Google Maps says, you know, we still have kind of like a 15 minute buffer, and I think

821
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,500
we'll be fine.

822
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,580
I realize right before we get on the freeway, Kirsten is at home.

823
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,540
I left Kirsten at home.

824
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:04,260
The whole point, I made a whole point to get Kirsten from my parents.

825
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:09,620
I was like, ah, and I'm like, I'm looking at the thing, and I'm trying to calculate

826
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,420
how much it's going to take to get back.

827
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,900
Is it worth it?

828
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,020
And then in my head, I'm starting to imagine, what if there's something that only having

829
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,100
a Kirsten will unlock?

830
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,100
What if there's some part of the, because I'm not even consciously thinking about this,

831
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,980
and I'm like, what if having Kirsten does something for us?

832
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,260
And now we're being sent on this mission for work.

833
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:35,700
This is work, and now I'm going to do, I'm going to screw this up.

834
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:40,380
They're going to say, well, if you had Kirsten here, it would unlock the Kirsten celebration

835
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,380
or something.

836
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,380
Yeah.

837
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,380
And now I, Kirsten's at home.

838
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,380
Kirsten's here?

839
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,060
We'll make the edible food.

840
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,060
Right.

841
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,060
The food is going to be 10% better.

842
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,700
We'll try for Kirsten.

843
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,940
Yes, exactly.

844
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,060
Or there was like a song or something.

845
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,740
I just was, all this stuff was flashing in my head.

846
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,140
I'm already stressed just about being on time.

847
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:02,580
And I go, fuck, we have to go back and get Kirsten.

848
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,620
And Kirsten, you can't feel good about this either, because now you're home alone?

849
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,100
I'm home alone and I had no food.

850
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,300
What she's really English right now.

851
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,180
And I had no food and the winter was coming.

852
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:17,100
And I was just ever so scared.

853
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,180
This is, you're so, you're so skittish.

854
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,940
We're not even anywhere close to the winter.

855
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:25,900
But I'm sure that's how it feels to you all the time, is that the winter is always nigh.

856
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,820
Is winter outside this door right now?

857
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,420
Is winter outside these walls?

858
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:33,620
Mike, did you consider just buying a second Kirsten?

859
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,100
Well we considered, we did consider buying, yes.

860
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,660
It's just an easy 160.

861
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,580
Sorry to say that, Kirsten, but you're a little bit replaceable.

862
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,860
Oh, that's all right.

863
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:45,220
That's what father says sometimes when he's having one of his attacks.

864
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,220
Oh no.

865
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,220
And father is not Mike, right?

866
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,220
What's that?

867
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,060
Father is not you?

868
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,060
No, no, that's a different character.

869
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,100
We took Kirsten in for just like a holiday.

870
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,100
Separate father, a very ill immigrant.

871
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:05,820
Father sent me to Michael and Lindsay's cabin while he was going through his treatments.

872
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,740
His father has been very sick.

873
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,180
His leeches and his.

874
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:15,460
Ever since he was beating for shooting Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

875
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,380
That's right, her father is a guerrilla princep.

876
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,820
Yes, thank you for revealing it on the show.

877
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,140
The man who starred in World War I.

878
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:27,700
These are all things that Michael doesn't know because he only knows what happens when

879
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,740
Mario meets Yoshi and he feeds Yoshi a few berries.

880
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,700
The book ends because it kills Yoshi.

881
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,340
You have to start over.

882
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,340
No, he shits out an egg.

883
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,340
Yoshi choked on berries.

884
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,980
He shits out an egg.

885
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:45,660
So I'm just, I'm cursing, I'm upset and I turn around and go back to get Kirsten and

886
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:50,700
I'm still going, OK, we're doing OK on time because we had, we had a little bit of time.

887
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,260
I think it'll be all right.

888
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,060
Maybe we'll, and I'm, this is the dumbest thing I've ever thought about somebody driving

889
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,500
from Burbank to Central City.

890
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,540
Maybe we'll make up a couple of minutes on the way.

891
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:06,060
So I'm still, I'm, I'm upset and, and, but I'm like, OK, we still, we have time, I race

892
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,060
in to get Kirsten.

893
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:11,340
Maybe if part of the freeway is broken, which turns it into a makeshift ramp that you don't

894
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:15,780
see coming, which will launch you two miles ahead of.

895
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,100
Like a Mario Kart track.

896
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,100
Very possible.

897
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,020
Entirely speed ramp.

898
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,020
That's all I know.

899
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,020
I don't know world history.

900
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,140
I do know how Mario Kart works.

901
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,120
So history began in 1992 when you're us.

902
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,260
So I'm running into the house.

903
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:33,580
I remember how old I am also, just my, my, my age flashes in front of me as I'm running

904
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,580
into the house.

905
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:38,780
You feel your knees creaking as you run to grab a doll.

906
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,780
Superfluous doll.

907
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,900
Tripping on many, many other dolls along the way.

908
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,900
And then I get in the car and we start driving and I was hoping that because the 405, I think

909
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,900
there was an accident.

910
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,620
That's really what killed us.

911
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,420
I think there were five on my route.

912
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,540
I think there were three.

913
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,540
I believe it.

914
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,700
But like the 405, like being that thing was shut down.

915
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,100
I think I was hoping that maybe the 405 will clear up on our way there.

916
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,100
Did not happen.

917
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,100
Never happened.

918
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,860
Could just has not cleared up now.

919
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,860
Even a week later.

920
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,860
No, no, no, no.

921
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,140
It's still, it's still crowded from.

922
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,140
So we could go.

923
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,500
Driving.

924
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:15,740
And then I see the ministers ticking up on the estimate on the car and I'm like, okay.

925
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,740
I still like stupidly.

926
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,740
I'm like, well, maybe cold water will over the hill will catch up.

927
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:26,860
So early on in the trip, I tell Lindsay, could you read Kirsten's bio online for me?

928
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,780
Because I need to know some backstory about Kirsten.

929
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,780
She says, sure.

930
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,780
That's fine.

931
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:36,740
She decides to do it while we're on Coldwater Canyon, the windiest, hilliest street you

932
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,300
could possibly do it on.

933
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:42,260
No, she, she does get motion sickness sometimes.

934
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,900
She starts getting motion sick in the car to the point where I go, do we have to pull

935
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:52,180
over like in front of like the house of Lucy lived on in Beverly Hills?

936
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:56,500
I don't know if it's on cold water, but those famous houses pull over to see the house.

937
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:01,260
Of course I wanted to see Lucy's house driving extra wild to try to get her to get sick enough.

938
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,260
Oh, hello.

939
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,260
Of course.

940
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,260
Yes.

941
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,060
We're like around that area.

942
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,060
The sketch got.

943
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,380
Well, we didn't film that there, but okay.

944
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,900
Well, I mean, it's, but technically I think it's.

945
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:16,940
I think Lucy, here's the, I think Lucy lived in 17 places in Los Angeles.

946
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,980
And for sure, there's something you really figure out when you live in LA.

947
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:25,180
Charlie Chaplin lived in 59 places in the city.

948
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,420
You will go, you will.

949
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,820
It's astounding how many places you will go where you learned that Charlie Chaplin once

950
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,820
lived there.

951
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:35,060
He could not hold down a place for two months, this guy, this tramp.

952
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:41,500
So we did not have to stop, but it came close where like, I just look in the back and Lindsay's

953
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,620
sitting back there by the baby and she's just like, her head is like this.

954
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:50,380
And I'm like, oh my God, oh my God, we're running late because of the doll.

955
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,500
And now Lindsay's about to be, she's sick because of the doll.

956
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,900
She simply must learn facts about the doll here, not there.

957
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:04,020
You got to know this going in, you cannot sit down and be on your phone reading a bio

958
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:08,860
They'll know, they'll know that you're a noob to American girl.

959
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,860
I just picture, I look, I pictured a casual thing.

960
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,820
We read, she was reading it.

961
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,540
We'd laugh a little and then I would have some information.

962
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:20,100
Not that it would almost like completely ruin the actual trip to this cafe.

963
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,180
Now she made it.

964
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:25,060
I'm trying to like, kind of not get like go, I'm not going slow on cold water, but like

965
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,980
I'm trying to hit like bumps too hard.

966
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,980
You also, you're by the way, you're on, you're on the same street where the last time I went

967
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,780
on that, I hit two potholes.

968
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,820
Ruining my chance to attend the opening gala of the Planet Hollywood auction.

969
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,460
Oh, right, right.

970
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,700
I needed a, I needed a tire replacement after that.

971
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,060
This street's a disaster.

972
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,020
I'm glad you didn't get in a puddle.

973
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,940
I had, I was thinking about that too.

974
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:49,020
I was like, this is a treacherous street.

975
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:55,140
So I forgot Kirsten and everything tumbled from there.

976
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,300
Everything spiraled out of control from there.

977
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,700
And yeah, so, so Kirsten made it.

978
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,340
She made it.

979
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:03,740
She was there.

980
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,060
Yeah.

981
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:10,220
Now, so then that I guess gets us to, I wasn't there that long before you, but enough to

982
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:13,180
check in and to realize we couldn't sit until everybody was there.

983
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:13,380
Right.

984
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:13,660
Yes.

985
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,180
So I'm hanging out, I'm pacing.

986
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:21,180
Sun is entertained, but you know, could tip at any minute and you guys come in, you

987
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:24,420
come in with the energy, you're huffing it up the stick cause you got to go up a flight

988
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,660
of stairs to get up there.

989
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:29,620
So you come up just like, ah, it's been a thing.

990
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,780
We are, it's been a morning.

991
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,420
Stuff is going on.

992
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:39,900
And I say, Mike, when has there been in the 10 years that I've known you now, has there

993
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,660
been one thing you've showed up at where that was not the energy?

994
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,220
I know.

995
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:46,260
Where there weren't multiple things going on.

996
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:46,740
Yeah.

997
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,580
No, I know.

998
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,820
I didn't know any of this either.

999
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,620
He was like, I'll talk about it on the show.

1000
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,140
Like this is happening.

1001
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:58,860
I'm sitting in bed coughing, drinking orange juice and taking a Moxicillin.

1002
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:03,780
And I, no one texted me like, oh, we're going to take Lindsey.

1003
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,980
Uh, don't worry about it.

1004
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,140
So I just like, I hope they're not mad at me.

1005
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:12,820
And then an hour later, I'm like, I hope there's not antics, which I couldn't have

1006
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:14,740
prevented even if I was there.

1007
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,620
You thought you would have prevented antics?

1008
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,620
No, no, absolutely not.

1009
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,020
I was just like, yeah, absolutely.

1010
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:21,340
Yeah.

1011
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,820
I would have been there even later.

1012
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:23,060
Yeah.

1013
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,860
Think about the who, the who's on that text thread.

1014
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,740
One of the names is Mike Carlson.

1015
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,180
There are going to be antics.

1016
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:29,580
Yeah.

1017
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,700
There's always antics.

1018
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:35,380
I was trying so, I swear I was trying so hard to not have antics.

1019
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,980
I really made such an effort to have no antics getting there.

1020
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:39,900
That's the problem.

1021
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,660
I think the more you try, I really felt like I was like punished for

1022
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,780
trying to have no antics and the God of Antics.

1023
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,780
Who's the Greek God of Antics, Jason?

1024
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,300
I don't know.

1025
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,220
I don't really know.

1026
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:53,740
Okay.

1027
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,180
Loki, is Loki the Greek?

1028
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:04,060
It sounds like the Norse God of Mischief and trickery, Loki, was in your car that day.

1029
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,140
He's like, I could, I could handle antics.

1030
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,820
Yeah, that'd be in my, I can grab it.

1031
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,300
It's not my.

1032
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:08,500
Yeah.

1033
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,020
It's not quite what I do, but okay.

1034
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:11,180
I can do it today.

1035
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:11,700
I'll jump on.

1036
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:11,900
Yeah.

1037
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,660
So she made it, she made it.

1038
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,100
There was no reason for her to be there.

1039
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,540
There were no Kirsten unlocking celebration.

1040
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:23,140
Not only is there no Kirsten unlocking celebration, but like, I mean,

1041
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:27,580
maybe you didn't know this going in, but a whole aspect of it is that

1042
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,340
you can get a loner doll.

1043
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:29,700
Right.

1044
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,060
There's a big wall of dolls.

1045
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,420
That felt wrong to me to get a loner doll.

1046
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:37,940
Cause we have, this is in the fam, Kirsten's been in the family for 30 years.

1047
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,860
It felt wrong to take a loner doll.

1048
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:41,980
I guess.

1049
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,620
I'm looking Kirsten in the eye and I'm glad you're here.

1050
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:45,980
And I had a good time with you.

1051
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:53,940
But I think one of your nonspecific from whenever pals up on that shelf would

1052
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,500
have been just as good a company.

1053
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:55,940
Yes.

1054
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,980
Sorry to tell you.

1055
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:01,580
And the voyage to Century City was longer than a wagon train from one side of

1056
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:06,140
Sweden to the other when father and mother and I left our home village and

1057
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:10,260
went to the new world, the Century City.

1058
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,900
We almost lost me on the way to Century City.

1059
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,540
You should have stayed in your time.

1060
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,380
I know you're probably like, Oh wow.

1061
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,300
They have horseless carriages now.

1062
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,340
Well, guess what?

1063
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,220
We got a lot of complaints about him.

1064
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,060
It's better when you were, Oh, to be in your time, Kirsten.

1065
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:26,580
Yeah.

1066
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,620
The Sepulveda pass was better when it was just a pass, not a freeway.

1067
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,140
I thought we were going to have to lose our oxen when we were

1068
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,780
pulling into Beverly Hills.

1069
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,540
I didn't know what was going on and why it took so long.

1070
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,500
Well, I guess that's something for you to know that I guess you don't know that

1071
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:45,580
about cars, that cars don't have lots of little oxen at the bottom.

1072
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:46,660
That's probably what you're picturing.

1073
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,260
Right, Kirsten?

1074
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,420
That is what I'm picturing.

1075
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:52,860
15 baby oxen all under the carriage of the car.

1076
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:53,780
I thought they were carrying it.

1077
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,060
Yeah.

1078
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,380
15 oxen under this automobile.

1079
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:00,900
Oh, the way some of these mechanics, George and LA, you thought you'd buy an

1080
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:01,500
oxen.

1081
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:06,100
Oh, is that ancient standup comedy material?

1082
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:06,660
Yes.

1083
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,700
That's a joke from her time.

1084
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,260
Ah, yes.

1085
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:09,820
Thank you.

1086
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:15,940
You remind me of many people I know from my time, Mr.

1087
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,580
Sheridan.

1088
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,340
You have a way about you.

1089
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,860
You like all this popular music.

1090
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:27,820
Like you probably like to to tootsie goodbye and you were a song in my era.

1091
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,980
One of my favorite popular songs.

1092
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,780
That was that was Olivia Rodrigo to you.

1093
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:33,820
Yes, exactly.

1094
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:34,420
Yes.

1095
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,260
You pretended to like to to tootsie to seem relevant.

1096
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,220
Exactly.

1097
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:39,460
I didn't quite get it.

1098
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:43,060
But it seemed like every young people liked it.

1099
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:43,500
Why?

1100
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,500
Why did they stutter?

1101
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,580
You said it doesn't anyone know how to speak in these songs anymore.

1102
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,420
That's yes.

1103
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:53,380
Coldplay, of course, now does that with para para paradise.

1104
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,620
They do a similar trajectory.

1105
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:55,900
Wow.

1106
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:56,900
I never thought of that.

1107
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:57,620
They really are.

1108
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,020
Yeah.

1109
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,460
There's a real a real through line from to to tootsie.

1110
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,380
Goodbye, Mr.

1111
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,700
Chris Martin had too many russes of blood to the head.

1112
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:08,700
It damaged his brain and he started making poppins.

1113
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:13,740
Father also suffers from a rush of blood to his head almost nightly.

1114
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:15,900
It's so tragic.

1115
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,380
That's when Coldplay's first hit.

1116
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,940
Yellow is the color of your father's skin.

1117
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,540
He's very ill.

1118
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:22,860
Sadly, yes.

1119
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,460
So Kirsten made it.

1120
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,100
She sat in her little seat.

1121
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,660
Kirsten made it even though Kirsten did not need to make it.

1122
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:32,500
And maybe you didn't know.

1123
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,180
Maybe you didn't know.

1124
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,900
But I wasn't totally sure.

1125
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,940
I knew that there was that wall of dolls.

1126
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,660
But I still was like, but what's the deal?

1127
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,100
And is it like an add on?

1128
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,380
Or but no, I think you just grab.

1129
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:45,100
Yeah, I wasn't I wasn't clear on that.

1130
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:48,620
I knew like you could get other dolls or be I didn't know if it's a charge,

1131
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:49,460
if it's something else.

1132
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:53,500
So it felt it felt like I could make we just couldn't.

1133
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,100
I should not have.

1134
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,260
If it was somewhere closer, I could have risked it.

1135
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:01,100
I think it's still been basically on time, not Century City, though.

1136
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,580
So that was madness.

1137
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:05,460
You lost at least 15 minutes, if not more.

1138
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:05,860
Yeah.

1139
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:09,020
To get a doll who did not ultimately factor into the experience.

1140
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:09,860
No, not at all.

1141
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,220
No waste of time.

1142
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:14,700
A phrase that has been said to Mike multiple times.

1143
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,380
That's true. Yeah.

1144
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:20,140
This is only probably the second or third episode.

1145
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,700
You've cradled a toy, surprisingly.

1146
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,700
That's true. Yeah, that is true.

1147
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,820
Yes, you are being very loving to Kirsten as you.

1148
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:30,140
Yeah, you're giving her support.

1149
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,780
But I also I do.

1150
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,340
I like the that that was the spirit of it.

1151
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:38,940
And I, in fact, brought a doll to my son as a baby doll.

1152
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:41,100
Baby Pete came along.

1153
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:45,300
Not a huge, important toy in our house,

1154
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,900
but he factors into into the fun sometimes.

1155
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,900
He his main attribute, as you noticed, Mike,

1156
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,220
is that he has kind of like built in pants that sag.

1157
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:59,180
Thus, he's often revealing his butt throughout.

1158
00:52:59,180 --> 00:52:59,620
That's funny.

1159
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,300
And he hang with him.

1160
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:06,060
So, yeah, we both we both brought our own dolls to fill the little chairs.

1161
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:10,740
Let's talk about those official terminology per the back of the menu.

1162
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:16,060
Treat seats like we're we're in real PTR territory here.

1163
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:21,500
Treat seats are the little pink chairs that have kind of two handles

1164
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:24,220
that slide right onto the edge of the table

1165
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,620
so that they can, you know, they're right at table level.

1166
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:28,980
Yes, with you.

1167
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:32,380
It is. Yes, it's the menu was fun.

1168
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,500
I would say the menu design is fun.

1169
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,300
But the menu I liked, I like the menu.

1170
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,020
I'll say that.

1171
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,540
You mean like the things on it, the things on it, the words

1172
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,700
than the corresponding food items that.

1173
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,260
Yeah, what is happening to you?

1174
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,700
I like the things on it, the words.

1175
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,820
I like when there's no things on it, those being like columns in space

1176
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,780
which allow you more room to read the words.

1177
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,380
You know, the front of the menu tells you the name of the establishment

1178
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,180
you're in, and that's very helpful.

1179
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:03,860
And I like that.

1180
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:07,700
Let's me know that I didn't walk into Katsuya by mistake.

1181
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,140
Right. I like that about it.

1182
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:12,700
I will say the menus had been through the mill a little bit as far as

1183
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,020
like as far as them being beat up.

1184
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,620
Like the photo I have of my my daughter here.

1185
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:20,500
She's got it.

1186
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,940
And this thing looks like it's been crumpled up a few times.

1187
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:26,900
Yeah, I mean, many, many children are playing with these.

1188
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,660
So I guess it makes sense to have them like that and not have like a big,

1189
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:32,780
like thick menu, like a bound menu or something.

1190
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:35,700
Yeah, yeah. Any any reactions to like the environment

1191
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,660
while coming in or once?

1192
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,380
Well, this is so so so going in a little bit blind.

1193
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:45,420
I was surprised at the aesthetic of the modern American girl.

1194
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,540
I didn't think we would be eating in like a like an old time mess hall

1195
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:52,980
or anything or like a gruel stand or whatever you would call it.

1196
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:53,980
Like an orphan.

1197
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,500
I didn't think we were going to an orphanage like restaurant.

1198
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,220
But I was surprised, like, oh, this is like Barbie ish.

1199
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,580
It is very Barbie to me.

1200
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:05,820
Yeah, I mean, I was aware of it maybe from that that Conan remote

1201
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:09,820
that I guess I knew that it's I know the colors.

1202
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,940
I know that it's this like this very dark pink.

1203
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:16,100
Yeah. And a lot of black and white zebra.

1204
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:21,540
I knew that. And if anything, I actually once we sat in here,

1205
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,620
I was like, this is like a little more subtle.

1206
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:26,740
This is a little more like stately, at least the room we were in

1207
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:30,260
than the one that I knew from from that remote. Right.

1208
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:33,820
Or it's been, you know, Travis Kelsey did a sketch on us

1209
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,980
and although it was a parodying this really recreated the environment.

1210
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,420
So I actually so to me, I was like, you know, it's a little

1211
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:44,940
it was just kind of like floral back chairs and just kind of white. And

1212
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,420
it was low key.

1213
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,980
It was. And you know what? Kind of disappointed me. I agree.

1214
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,260
I kind of wanted it to be trashier, right?

1215
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,580
I want it in some direction to be more something.

1216
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:59,980
Yeah. Like you want it's that it is historically accurate

1217
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:04,860
that you're in like an old tea room that is for most people kind of depressing.

1218
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,980
Yeah. Reminds you that you don't want to live in that area. Right. Or

1219
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:12,020
modern, current, annoying in your face. Yeah, yeah.

1220
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,300
Yeah. Erin saw pictures and she's like,

1221
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,380
there's a lot more boring than I thought. Yeah, I know.

1222
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:22,100
It is a little bit just kind of like it's sort of just like a modern tea room.

1223
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:26,420
And I was surprised that I felt this way, but I wanted it to be trashier.

1224
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,740
Yes, I agree. Yes. Yeah.

1225
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:31,540
Any direction they could go, I think I would have been happier than.

1226
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,060
Yeah. But it felt low key.

1227
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:36,980
It felt I wouldn't say it's tasteful, but it just felt like, oh, OK.

1228
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:40,140
I don't know. Like outside of just all the different like

1229
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,940
pictures on the wall of American girls, it would I would have been like,

1230
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,860
oh, this must be a themed.

1231
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,300
This must be something like it didn't feel so specific to me.

1232
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:51,580
Yeah, right. Yeah.

1233
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:53,900
So then food.

1234
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,820
So the structure here is

1235
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,620
twenty seven dollars a person.

1236
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:05,500
Yeah. Which is which which gets you everything

1237
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,740
minus booze, booze is add on.

1238
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:12,100
But it's this whole like multi-course meal where her

1239
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,660
imagine that. Oh, my God.

1240
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,340
Twenty seven dollars, by the way, if we had booked this

1241
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,900
maybe a week or two later, would have been 30.

1242
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,740
This is real. Yes.

1243
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,420
The prices have gone up. Wow.

1244
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,260
Since we did it, it is now.

1245
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:29,980
Yes, it would have been 15 more dollars instantly

1246
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,980
if we'd done this any later.

1247
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,260
So, Jessica, thanks for getting the suggestion in February.

1248
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:39,660
So but you the menu.

1249
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,660
Let's let's go through that and what you get.

1250
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:48,020
The starter, the welcome course also, as Jessica alluded to,

1251
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,900
they're famous.

1252
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,140
Warm, welcome cinnamon buns, warm, welcome cinnamon.

1253
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:58,300
Our petite cinnamon buns are an American girl tradition.

1254
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,140
And this is as I was looking on the menu of like,

1255
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,140
what am I going to get here?

1256
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,940
This kind of thing. I'm like, OK, I guess all right.

1257
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,100
We start with cinnamon buns. That's fine.

1258
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,260
That's fine. Regrets on missing this.

1259
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:13,300
You know, I wish more restaurants the appetizer.

1260
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:15,700
The brave course was cinnamon buns.

1261
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,860
You wish more people in general would give you a warm welcome

1262
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,020
with cinnamon buns.

1263
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:22,820
With cinnamon buns, a complimentary pink lemonade.

1264
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,260
That sounds great to me.

1265
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:28,140
Looking at this menu, I am like, this is all stuff I like.

1266
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:30,740
Yeah, you might have like a child.

1267
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,100
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

1268
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,100
The childless person might have enjoyed this the most.

1269
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,340
Just the food itself.

1270
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,580
Yeah. And that's true.

1271
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:42,180
You clocked that pink lemonade juice, soft drink, milk, iced tea, coffee.

1272
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,220
So, all right.

1273
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,420
Hey, we're getting like that.

1274
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,500
Twenty seven dollars is sounding like nothing now.

1275
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:50,780
Then you get this like a multi-tiered little,

1276
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,060
you know, plate tower.

1277
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,580
Yeah, sampler tower.

1278
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,740
Little teed snackaroos,

1279
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:00,860
cucumber bites with borson mousse,

1280
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,740
celery boats filled with cheese spread.

1281
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,100
Not there. Yeah.

1282
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,940
Right. I don't think that was there.

1283
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,780
I don't remember no celery boats.

1284
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,180
Oh, yeah, I guess you're right.

1285
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,980
Not that I recall. Yeah, no.

1286
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,620
Fresh fruit and festive fruit skewers,

1287
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:18,620
a.k.a. sticks with the fruit that you least want in a fruit salad.

1288
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:19,420
Yeah, all melons.

1289
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:20,740
It's all. Yes, 100 percent.

1290
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:21,900
I'm all melon, baby.

1291
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,420
I love the melon.

1292
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:24,900
All melon. Yeah, honeydew.

1293
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,340
Honeydew, cantaloupe.

1294
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,540
More than just like strawberries and stuff.

1295
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,700
I like strawberries too.

1296
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,860
But yeah, we're big melon fan.

1297
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:36,580
We're always excited when we went to a buffet or breakfast and there was melon.

1298
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:37,900
This is weird.

1299
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,860
I feel like I've never heard this opinion. Watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew.

1300
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,340
Watermelon is a whole other area.

1301
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,020
Well, that's a melon.

1302
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:45,100
Watermelon is a step above, I believe.

1303
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,260
Sure.

1304
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,620
No, I think to me, cantaloupe, melon, or these are boring.

1305
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:52,180
These are like these these just these are filler.

1306
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,500
These fill out a filler to me.

1307
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,580
But I will have some sometimes.

1308
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:58,300
OK. But it doesn't excite.

1309
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,540
The idea of eating a piece of cantaloupe doesn't excite me.

1310
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,580
But Jason, Jason, I love a cantaloupe.

1311
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:04,700
Yeah.

1312
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,820
Isn't really best out here.

1313
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,260
And they're right around the corner.

1314
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,140
There's an old Navy.

1315
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:12,060
So many bargains, you know, waiting for you.

1316
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,620
That jumped out at you.

1317
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:17,380
I was looking at the map of the mall and I was like, oh, fancy mall.

1318
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,060
It's got an old Navy and it's got chicken tender.

1319
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,340
Hang on a second.

1320
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:26,940
You what you clocked about the fancy mall was a store that is at every mall.

1321
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:30,940
Well, I it's at crappy malls, too.

1322
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,300
Yes.

1323
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,740
Well, old Navy.

1324
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:36,580
Now we're in the money.

1325
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:41,340
Father lost use of his leg in the old movie, sadly.

1326
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:47,140
And I see that he loved the old Navy, though, like this one over here.

1327
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:50,900
He would. So he would have no use for the very cheap shorts there.

1328
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:55,620
Yes, sadly, he had to have them specially made

1329
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:59,380
time off the woman who was having an affair.

1330
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,060
Oh, my God. Oh, that, too.

1331
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:01,900
Yes, that, too.

1332
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,380
Well, I'm so sorry.

1333
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,420
Things are things are rough, rough.

1334
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:07,660
Yes, you stay.

1335
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,100
You stay strong. All right.

1336
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,820
That's the American experience.

1337
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:12,580
You fight through it no matter what.

1338
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:14,180
Yes. I want to hear more about this.

1339
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:17,100
This one's love of melons.

1340
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:19,820
A delicacy back in the day.

1341
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:21,180
Yes, that's what I think.

1342
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:24,820
Yes. I had cantaloupe as a birthday present when I was five.

1343
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,660
Did you celebrate memory and no presents for years after the fact?

1344
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:32,580
Did anyone get kids old fashioned cherry soda?

1345
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,700
No, no.

1346
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,860
Add on, add on.

1347
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,860
I don't know. That's a one dollar add on.

1348
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,660
No, I don't know if I'm going to pass that up.

1349
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:43,380
You got to go alone and then don't even talk about it on the show.

1350
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:45,500
Yeah. Do it for you.

1351
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,300
The dolls are too cumbersome.

1352
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:50,100
So just table for one, please.

1353
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,740
Table. You could go right up to the bar, I think.

1354
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:53,980
They got like a soda bar.

1355
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:57,580
There is a large beer, wine, liquor menu.

1356
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:58,380
Oh, there's a lot of that.

1357
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,820
You kind of brought us to that with the so the add ons.

1358
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:04,620
Yes. I mean, it is very evident.

1359
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,660
That drinking at this place is a thing.

1360
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:10,340
Oh, yeah. Because it's a full page.

1361
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:13,380
Yeah. To itself is the booze.

1362
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:19,020
Yes. I I was eyeing wine, of course.

1363
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:23,220
I thought, hey, this this this will plus it up for me.

1364
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:26,700
But then I'm looking at what other tables are getting.

1365
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:28,300
Places hoppin.

1366
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,740
There's a birthday song every five minutes.

1367
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,140
Yes. Places, I think, entirely birthdays.

1368
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:37,580
Um, and like, OK, people got pink drinks.

1369
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,380
I feel like I got to get a pink drink.

1370
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:42,700
Yes. And so I asked, what is pink?

1371
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:46,580
They said rose martini vodka, house made sour.

1372
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:47,780
They make it in house.

1373
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,860
They make they make that sour.

1374
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:52,140
Wow. They lined up unused dolls

1375
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:55,900
to the ingredients in the sour

1376
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:00,420
and cranberry juice with fresh lemon peel and rose rim.

1377
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,340
When this showed up,

1378
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:06,420
I'd call it less appeal and more a lemon wedge.

1379
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:09,060
Like, you know, it would be in a nice tea.

1380
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:12,340
I would call it all cranberry juice.

1381
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:15,500
If there was vodka,

1382
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,340
I there it was not the primary component.

1383
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:21,500
Rose rim equaled sugar.

1384
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,580
There's just like sugar caked onto it.

1385
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:29,180
Yeah. And you saw as this went on, it just it didn't get me drunk.

1386
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,060
It just made me feel weird.

1387
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:33,940
Yeah. I just felt I just felt muddy brain.

1388
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,660
Yeah. I don't know what a somewhere.

1389
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:40,020
Like the the small amount of liquor and all the sugar just fought.

1390
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:43,780
And it was I'm not a big liquid sugar consumer.

1391
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,300
So it just like fuzzed me out.

1392
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:50,260
Yeah. Yeah. You did not seem like you were like, oh, yeah.

1393
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,580
Like you were all of a sudden like on a high from just a little

1394
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:55,060
because sometimes if you have a little alcohol in the middle of the day,

1395
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,020
you get a little boost.

1396
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:59,140
Well, that's where I'm like, this is I did what I thought would be funny.

1397
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:02,420
You're in a picture instead of going with what was in my heart,

1398
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:04,100
which is always Chardonnay.

1399
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:07,340
There probably is pure Chardonnay in my heart, right?

1400
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:09,940
It'll be an operation someday to get it sucked out of me.

1401
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:13,580
But I really should have because I think I would have.

1402
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,060
I do get a little energy.

1403
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:19,380
It like serves as caffeine for me sometimes in the right setting.

1404
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,460
I mean, that's what Disneyland, you know,

1405
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:23,660
you have a car they man at in the middle of the day.

1406
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:28,140
It's like I had an espresso or something like it's some depending on.

1407
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:31,940
Yeah, certain factors like, I don't know.

1408
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:34,220
It's just like it just bummed me out.

1409
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:37,620
It made me feel like the way and probably the food did this, too.

1410
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:42,860
I just remember my like major energy lag when I went to Red Robin

1411
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,740
and talked about it a little on the show.

1412
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:45,380
Oh, yeah.

1413
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:48,540
Which prompted the discussion of how I need to be done eating bad beef

1414
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:51,420
and maybe have a bad beef bachelor party.

1415
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,500
It made me feel like the bad beef.

1416
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,420
It's just like, I'm so tired now.

1417
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:56,860
I just want to nap.

1418
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,780
It's not how I want a little fun pink drink to make me feel.

1419
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,060
But I also wanted to match you, Mike,

1420
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,780
because you got something a little bit unusual.

1421
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:08,740
I feel so that you're not getting every restaurant you get.

1422
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:12,820
Cavie's glittery fizz girl of the year inspired drink

1423
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:16,300
sprite with your choice of a pink or blue glitter bomb

1424
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:20,060
that will bubble fizz and change your drink from clear to pink or blue.

1425
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:22,740
Served with a strawberry straw you can eat.

1426
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:27,460
Now, listeners, if you noted that paragraph,

1427
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:31,300
is there anything that you noticed was missing from that that little synopsis?

1428
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:37,540
Perhaps alcohol, mankind, of course, thus making it Mike's ideal beverage.

1429
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:39,580
Right. A sugar drink with no liquor.

1430
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:40,740
That is yes.

1431
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:45,220
So that did that give me a boost at all?

1432
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:47,260
I would say no.

1433
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:49,220
I would say I didn't dislike it.

1434
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,180
You looked pretty.

1435
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:56,060
I never saw a smile during the experience of Cavie's glittery fizz.

1436
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,340
I wasn't mad at it, though.

1437
01:05:58,340 --> 01:05:59,740
I wasn't mad.

1438
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:04,460
They there was a strawberry straw that was confusing to me.

1439
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:08,620
It confused me. It says you can eat the straw and eat it.

1440
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:09,660
Eat is different.

1441
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:11,420
This is actually more egregious than I thought.

1442
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:15,020
There's edible, which means technically you could kind of consume this somehow.

1443
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:16,940
Right. Eat is like crunch.

1444
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,300
And I am eating the straw.

1445
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,300
This is Willy Wonka.

1446
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:23,180
I didn't do it in that comical way, but I did try to take a little mini bite of it.

1447
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:28,660
And it was rock hard and not in a way like not in a candy necklace, even rock.

1448
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:33,820
It felt harder than a candy necklace and even a stale candy thong from its sugar.

1449
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:37,460
It felt like it felt like I was like, oh, I can't bite this.

1450
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,940
This is going to break my teeth.

1451
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:41,300
So I was like, well, I thought it was edible.

1452
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:46,100
And then as you put liquid through it, it gets soggier and soggier.

1453
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:49,260
And then I would try to kind of take a bite out of it.

1454
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:51,580
But it still didn't taste.

1455
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:55,340
I was like, oh, maybe it'll like turn into almost like a laffy taffy kind of a thing.

1456
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:57,300
And you're kind of eat part of it.

1457
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,580
But it still didn't feel right to eat.

1458
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:02,460
There's a part of your brain, you know, you put something in your mouth and it knows

1459
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,700
I can't eat this. Don't eat this. Not edible.

1460
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:05,980
That kept going off.

1461
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,860
That kept firing in my head of like, this is not edible.

1462
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:09,860
You shouldn't have this.

1463
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:12,820
This is something that this is a luxury that Kirsten doesn't have,

1464
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,140
because with the hard time she's fallen on,

1465
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:18,580
anything has to be considered possible food for the family.

1466
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:21,140
That's right. That's going off in my brain all the time.

1467
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:22,580
And I have to ignore it.

1468
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,260
That instinct to not eat something.

1469
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:28,580
You might have to just like, you know, try to take a bite out of your horse's hoof.

1470
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:34,260
We ate father's old notebooks the other day.

1471
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:36,180
Oh, my God. Oh, no.

1472
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:38,740
Your memories, all of your childhood memories.

1473
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:42,580
His whole history in Sweden is now gone because you the family had

1474
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,420
to eat it, put it in a stew.

1475
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:46,860
I mean, it was mostly memories of the front.

1476
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:49,060
So I don't know if he wants to relive that.

1477
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:51,180
Maybe better, better off.

1478
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:54,340
And he doesn't remember anything anymore because of the.

1479
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:55,700
Because of the mustard gas.

1480
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,820
Because of the mustard gas. Yeah.

1481
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:00,220
Archduke. What is that? Right.

1482
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:01,780
Was that the?

1483
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:04,460
I mean, it came a little later, but yeah, close enough.

1484
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:07,820
Yes. Well, our memories are gone forever, sadly.

1485
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:12,140
But I did develop a taste for notebooks.

1486
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:15,740
I will say that prepared just the right way.

1487
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:17,500
A notebook can be pretty delicious.

1488
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,580
Oh, well, all right.

1489
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:21,780
Now, that's that plucky American optimism that we like to hear.

1490
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:24,060
And, you know, you could probably I bet there's like notebooks and journals

1491
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:27,340
you could buy at this store, but they're probably prohibitively expensive.

1492
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:30,020
You'd be better off at CVS and they would be more delicious.

1493
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:32,460
You put them in a big pot and boil them.

1494
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,300
That's for sure.

1495
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,660
You over there, you should try it.

1496
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:40,220
Boiling a notebook in a bloody paper of my time.

1497
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:41,780
Young lady, don't worry about it.

1498
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:45,740
Yes. One of your fancy notebooks would be delicious.

1499
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:50,140
Mike, can I ask how was the glitter?

1500
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:53,860
So, OK, very if you're a podcast fan,

1501
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:57,340
you know that sometimes I'm a little worried when glitter comes into the picture

1502
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:01,220
because I had a glitter bomb in the first City Walk Saga in the bathtub

1503
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,900
and I was worried about the glitter going in my urethra.

1504
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:07,340
Because of Kirsten's ears. Sorry.

1505
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,620
Oh, no, it's OK.

1506
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:13,140
I've heard the description of every body part from when the doctor came,

1507
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:16,340
when the plague doctor came and dealt with my father.

1508
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:19,820
So I've heard ad nauseam discussion of my father's urethra

1509
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:23,940
and all the things that have gotten caught in there over the years during the war.

1510
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:25,700
Sorry, we're good times are hard.

1511
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,140
You're you're going to have to cut off your urethra.

1512
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,780
You've got urethral gangrene.

1513
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:34,780
Do they sell plague doctor mask size to the American girl plague doctor?

1514
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:38,300
Father had mites in his urethra again.

1515
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:44,100
So I see this and I'm looking at it and I I think what it was.

1516
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:47,980
And I don't still don't know what the glitter in the bath bomb was

1517
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:51,980
that definitely made its way in my urethra to some degree. Had to.

1518
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,380
Not all of it.

1519
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,700
It's not like it's sucking in the opposite way.

1520
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,180
My urethra, that is.

1521
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:59,900
But it had to some piece had to go in there.

1522
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,140
But I don't know what that is.

1523
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:04,620
This, I think this glitter was just sugar, I think.

1524
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,660
Certain like, well, it was if they're given it to you to drink,

1525
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,820
then it would also be safe to go into your urethra.

1526
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:10,300
Well, right.

1527
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,020
It did come. It came out of your urethra.

1528
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:13,340
Well, think about that.

1529
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:16,980
It absolutely came out of my urethra, but it was it changed.

1530
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:19,980
It was not in its glitter, because I didn't notice like a sparkly

1531
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:22,340
gallon of urine.

1532
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,260
Not gallon. I don't pee a gallon.

1533
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:26,700
I didn't have sparkle pee when I when I peed.

1534
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:29,260
So it definitely, I think, was sugar.

1535
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:30,100
And it just conveyed.

1536
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:34,220
It was probably more in my poop than it was in my pee, I think.

1537
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:35,220
But not enough.

1538
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:39,220
You don't also you don't remember taking a shit that was glowing.

1539
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:43,780
You know, like a rock candy shit is what you're describing.

1540
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,980
You didn't go to the bathroom in the middle of the night

1541
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,380
and then realize the toilet was illuminating the room.

1542
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:52,060
And that did not happen.

1543
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:54,980
My shit was like a light source.

1544
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:58,380
Oh, we would have prayed for a shit that was a light source in the middle.

1545
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,340
You'd run out of candle oil.

1546
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:04,180
Yeah, you would eat all the candles.

1547
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:07,340
If only a poop would light our way.

1548
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:14,180
Yeah, so so I like I like the drinks, but like with Sprite, basically.

1549
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:18,380
And then you would put this thing in the kind of yes, would like sort of color.

1550
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:20,660
It wasn't so bright.

1551
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,020
It could have been brighter.

1552
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,300
So one of you had a Sprite.

1553
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:24,820
One of you had a cranberry.

1554
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:26,620
This is essentially.

1555
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:27,660
Yeah, you got it.

1556
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:30,420
Yeah, you got it at a premium.

1557
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:36,380
Yeah. So while this put us in the mood, by which I mean, the nap mood,

1558
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:42,340
then we had a big long lunch with our children.

1559
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:46,180
Yeah, who are look, I'll only speak for mine.

1560
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:49,020
He's about as he's he's he likes restaurants, actually.

1561
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:51,100
He's pretty good and patient at a restaurant.

1562
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:53,420
But it's still, you know, but there hits a wall.

1563
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:55,380
Can we go? Can we go?

1564
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:57,300
Clock? Yeah, yeah, no, you could go.

1565
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:57,980
It could go any time.

1566
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,740
Basically, what I'm saying, I think we did not have the ideal

1567
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:04,420
ages of children by a long shot to be at this place.

1568
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:08,260
No, because he would have had as much fun, more fun

1569
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:11,220
at a Denny's a mile away.

1570
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:16,580
Yeah, no, I this my daughter is almost two doesn't really have much affection

1571
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:22,380
for the American girl IP and doesn't have the patience to sit around a lot.

1572
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,300
So, yeah, she wanted to get up.

1573
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:26,540
Lindsay did a shift and then I would do a shift.

1574
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:28,980
We just like followed her around and made sure she didn't like

1575
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:31,860
jump into the kitchen, which is what she wanted to do.

1576
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,980
And I had to snatch her away from doing it.

1577
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:35,740
And she had a fit and a meltdown.

1578
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:37,940
And she just wanted to ride in the elevator the whole time.

1579
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,460
She just kept wanting to go to the elevator.

1580
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:44,700
Which then you're like, so we we drove an hour to be in the elevator.

1581
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:49,340
Yeah, I yeah, that's the anything that he had.

1582
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:52,100
My son had a good time at this.

1583
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:53,260
He definitely did.

1584
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:56,780
But the things he had a good time with were like a fork

1585
01:12:57,660 --> 01:13:00,580
like talking, talking to people,

1586
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:04,500
things that could happen at any restaurant that doesn't cause this.

1587
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,060
Yeah, my daughter, she had fun playing.

1588
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:09,940
There was like a big kitchen set downstairs in the store.

1589
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:12,220
So she was playing with some other kids and she did like that.

1590
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:14,140
So she had some fun there.

1591
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,740
Was that available much closer?

1592
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:21,220
If we just like set her loose in a Sears than the Sears and the Burbank bomb, perhaps.

1593
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:24,420
Resurrected also a potential topic in the next.

1594
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:28,460
Absolutely. But like, yeah, you need like, you know, you need like a seven, eight,

1595
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:32,740
nine year old who is way steep, not way steeped, even just a little

1596
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:34,780
maybe steeped in this lore.

1597
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,300
And it's their birthday.

1598
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:40,020
Yeah. And you go like, that's the prime kid audience, I think.

1599
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:44,020
And let's be like, well, it's what we were around was like,

1600
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:48,900
we've taken some friends here, like bring, bring friends to come

1601
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:54,380
and to come do this and have your little, you know, your dainty tea items

1602
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:56,420
and sing the birthday song.

1603
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:58,540
Let me let me ask this question.

1604
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:00,860
Did you feel in that room

1605
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:04,380
we were surrounded by, you know, when you see online

1606
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:09,740
a picture of a very specific type of all white girl group

1607
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:13,300
that's like a bridal party and maybe it's like Massachusetts,

1608
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,980
somewhere up there in Maine, the main area.

1609
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:18,980
They all have like kind of furry boots on and a sweater.

1610
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:23,900
There's a certain type of white lady that was everywhere in this room.

1611
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:25,660
Yeah, there was.

1612
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:28,900
Yeah. And I was like, we're that we're definitely outliers in this room,

1613
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:30,620
even though we're white people.

1614
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:34,180
There is this very specific type of concerned white citizens

1615
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:37,580
Council five of like emanating, you're saying.

1616
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:38,380
And this is my daughter.

1617
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:40,980
And not that they said this, but like, this is my daughter's specialty.

1618
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:43,220
And this is going to be very, this is very important.

1619
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:45,500
And make sure that everything goes off without a hitch.

1620
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,380
Yes, exactly. That's the vibe.

1621
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:49,260
That's not I didn't hear that actually said.

1622
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:52,260
But that was definitely what I was observing.

1623
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:55,420
Maybe you maybe that maybe a lower price point to the clothes

1624
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,060
that we're all wearing.

1625
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:59,420
Absolutely. Yeah, yeah.

1626
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:03,100
Yes. And I would just like I made eye contact with these people.

1627
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:05,020
And I'm like, sometimes it's also just in general,

1628
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:08,700
like I have to remind myself how old I am and go, oh, there's so

1629
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:10,140
those are like parents over there.

1630
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:12,980
And I go, these people are probably five years younger than me.

1631
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:13,940
And I have to remind.

1632
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:15,420
But I made eye contact with them.

1633
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:17,300
And it just felt like, what are you like?

1634
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,140
They could tell I didn't belong here.

1635
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:21,380
I don't know if that's a judgy thing that I'm feeling.

1636
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:24,060
What cobalt mind you even own? Right.

1637
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:29,460
How have you been destroying the planet lately?

1638
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:33,620
Yes, these are all like, what are you doing to help the wives of CEOs

1639
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:38,900
in this room that we're taking their CEOs that are destroying the media companies?

1640
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:42,460
We've all extensively worked for and try to work for. Yeah. Yeah.

1641
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:45,900
Yeah. Wives who were put in charge somewhere

1642
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:50,660
in the wake in the succession and the mergers actually ran it into the ground.

1643
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:52,980
Half a billion when Quibi went under.

1644
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:54,420
So it worked out well for us.

1645
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:57,300
We're glad it was better than it failed.

1646
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:00,420
Yeah. Yeah. I didn't clock that so much.

1647
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:02,020
But you were facing more people.

1648
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:03,260
I kind of hit it. Yeah.

1649
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:08,020
Yeah. I didn't have as many people in my field of vision.

1650
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:13,660
Mainly, it was just like it was just a room I got tired of being in, I would say.

1651
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:19,060
Yeah, a small room, like it aesthetically, but it also wasn't irritating enough.

1652
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:21,060
Yes. And sorry, Jason.

1653
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:24,660
Oh, I was going to say, what main courses did you do?

1654
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:27,860
Well, let me just say real quick, what's interesting is the first half,

1655
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:31,740
as far as just the atmosphere of this room, it did feel kind of loud in there.

1656
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:36,740
Not like, I don't know, there was this weird loudness to it in a way.

1657
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:39,500
I guess it was just people talking and it was a small room.

1658
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:43,300
Half of the time they played hits from the 90s.

1659
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:48,020
And then the other half, they played what I believe are like American girls songs.

1660
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,260
Yeah. But I don't know why there was a shift.

1661
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:51,660
I was confused by that. Yeah, you're right.

1662
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:55,820
I want it all. If we're going to be here, why am I listening to all the small things?

1663
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:57,820
Let's just go fully at it.

1664
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:01,500
I want the most screechy, irritating songs.

1665
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:04,100
Yeah. I want to rip off of all the small things.

1666
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,660
Right. Right. That one of the characters.

1667
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:07,660
The togetherness. The Tenny performance.

1668
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:10,260
I would love to hear this. Be the place to hear the Tenny music.

1669
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:12,260
The Tenny version of the punk pop.

1670
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,180
Yeah. Yeah.

1671
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:16,300
So like, yeah, not not not quite enough.

1672
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,420
I totally agree.

1673
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:21,660
Main courses.

1674
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:24,180
I mean, let's shout out some of the things they have.

1675
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:28,460
Fancy bow tie pasta, artisan, personal pizza.

1676
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:31,300
Right. Best ever chicken tenders.

1677
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:33,740
And I swear, when I was assessing, like, how is this going to be?

1678
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,980
Is this something I want to bring my son to?

1679
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:40,540
I I can't believe I can't believe myself sometimes.

1680
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:46,700
I can't believe that we made it through the city walks that we've recently done.

1681
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:50,820
A city walk saga, the most challenging one in a culinary

1682
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:53,340
from a culinary standpoint.

1683
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:56,380
And I'm still looking at this menu going, sounds pretty good.

1684
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:59,820
How did it not occur to me that the food was going to be bad?

1685
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:01,580
I'm there when it showed up.

1686
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:03,540
I'm like, oh, right.

1687
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:07,220
Damn it. I how am I still getting tricked?

1688
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:09,020
You got tricked by this kind of thing.

1689
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:11,940
This is very much a menu for children.

1690
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:16,500
Or like if you saw this at the corner bakery, I was like, yeah, I need a quick.

1691
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:18,380
Yeah. Quick cheese pizza. Quick.

1692
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:22,220
Totally. Oh, turkey club with avocado. Great. Perfect.

1693
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:25,100
I would accept this caprese sandwich at the airport.

1694
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:27,540
It would be. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wasn't terrible.

1695
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:28,980
Yeah. And for yeah.

1696
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:32,460
For my son, he's just eating chicken tenders and fries all the time.

1697
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:35,060
So as far as he's concerned, they are the best ever.

1698
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:38,220
Tied with 300 other versions he's had.

1699
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:42,220
Yeah. I got the classic club. Fine. Yes. Fine. Yeah.

1700
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:45,020
Airport fine. If it was like, yeah, it was.

1701
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:49,340
You grabbed it at a grocery store to go and ate it in the car.

1702
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:53,180
You'd go, oh, pretty good. Like maybe we've had worse.

1703
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:55,060
We've definitely. Yeah, it's not.

1704
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:58,580
But I did start to feel like the sodium bomb of it.

1705
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:01,220
I said that to you somewhere between that and the sugar drink.

1706
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:03,700
I'm like, yeah, I don't feel sick. I just don't feel good.

1707
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:08,540
And also, here's where like, OK, maybe this is important to say.

1708
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:12,300
Server. Great. Really nice.

1709
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:15,060
Yeah, very good. Good experience there.

1710
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:20,380
But from the from the Conan sketch for the from comedy about this,

1711
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:23,820
I think I thought it'd be like, well, how about some stories?

1712
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:26,180
How about some trivia? How about some riddles? Yes.

1713
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:28,580
Well, that's yes, I thought more even in the Kirsten.

1714
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:30,900
Like I thought there'd be more something.

1715
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,220
I thought there'd be more stuff.

1716
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:35,900
I thought that like, yes, then a bunch of weird, funny,

1717
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:38,700
like a T-bone steak comes out for the dolls.

1718
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:42,140
But essentially, you put your doll in that little chair,

1719
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:45,420
and that is the end of the acknowledgement of the dolls.

1720
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:50,420
Any interaction with the dolls is what you put into it or what your kids put into it.

1721
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:54,340
And I tried to force some little moments of like, do you want to feed baby Pete?

1722
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:57,220
I'm numb, numb. But we again, we could do that at home.

1723
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:58,820
Yeah, nothing unique there.

1724
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:03,620
At some point, we did get a little little teacup and saucer.

1725
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:06,620
Well, it's OK. Finally, something has happened.

1726
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,820
A little doll sized thing has come out.

1727
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:13,900
And the only reason that happened is because our server, which was very nice,

1728
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:18,740
like forced us to celebrate Lindsay's birthday, which is a few weeks old.

1729
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:22,180
Really held our hand into is it a birthday to say, is it a birthday?

1730
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:22,860
We're like, not really.

1731
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,980
And she's like, are you sure it's not a birthday?

1732
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:27,220
Because we were asking questions about crowns and stuff.

1733
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:29,780
And that's so then we said, yes, Lindsay birthday.

1734
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:34,580
She came over with the crowns and then gave us two little like teacups and saucers.

1735
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:37,740
And that's yes, the only we wouldn't have had any sort of fun,

1736
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:41,580
like doll activity if it weren't for this birthday hack.

1737
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:43,340
Yeah, that's the way it happened.

1738
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:46,620
So listeners, I guess know that it's got to be a birthday

1739
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:48,580
or else you're not getting any little doll items.

1740
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:51,300
No, there's no doll silverware.

1741
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:51,980
Yeah, I know.

1742
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:53,020
What do you mean?

1743
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:56,140
There's not a little juice that's for them every day.

1744
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:59,460
This seems like the bare thing you'd expect.

1745
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:04,420
The base of this restaurant is I truly do want that.

1746
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:09,980
And I want that. I want like a fish with extout eyes and a little lemon on the top.

1747
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:15,300
I want like food that's fancier than what I'm eating in plastic form for those.

1748
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:18,500
And she should get a little bill or like they should get a little bill at the end, too.

1749
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:21,620
Yes, that would be funny that they and they pay separate.

1750
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:25,260
You can decide if your grownups want to pay it and then great.

1751
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:31,460
But, you know, or for Kirsten, a little paper stew, a little notebook stew.

1752
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,100
Right. Yes.

1753
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,380
If you saw fit.

1754
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:37,660
Right, because you really don't want to smear human food on like one hundred

1755
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:39,420
and fifty dollar doll.

1756
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:40,700
No. Well, that's true.

1757
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:42,100
On the loaner, certainly not.

1758
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:43,580
You really really wouldn't feel.

1759
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:45,820
They have a cleaning apparatus, though, I bet.

1760
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:47,740
I bet they can clean those dolls fast.

1761
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:50,140
Yeah, bottle Clorox and a dirty rag.

1762
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,260
They're the doll back in the doll.

1763
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:56,620
Yeah, but that's going to look that's going to erase her lips.

1764
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:59,020
That's going to erase the color from her face.

1765
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:01,980
She's not eating anyway.

1766
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:03,180
I do want to.

1767
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:05,700
Can I shout out something I saw on the Web site?

1768
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:09,580
Real big now serving up sparkle.

1769
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:12,980
You're piercing for girls in dolls.

1770
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:19,940
And I got to say, I don't know that I would trust the cleanliness to.

1771
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:22,540
First off, you think that they're using the same equipment on the doll

1772
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:23,500
that they use on a human?

1773
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,780
No, I don't think that. No, don't be ridiculous.

1774
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:29,460
I I'm going to say, first off, for that doll,

1775
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:33,420
you're sliding into a three hole punch or a screwdriver and a hammer.

1776
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:36,780
Like you don't need to pay for a doll ear piercing.

1777
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:38,180
That's how my ears were pierced.

1778
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:39,060
Yeah, that's right.

1779
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:42,820
Why, in my day, screwdriver and a hammer.

1780
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:47,940
We just got an angry mule and put an apple right on top of our doll's earlobe.

1781
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:52,020
But I feel like even Claire's in my ear is a little more

1782
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:54,540
cladly, I feel like.

1783
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:55,860
I'm sure it's clean.

1784
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:57,220
I'm sure it's clean.

1785
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:58,020
What's the clean issue?

1786
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:02,700
Claire? No, I just feel like you go to there's a lot of kids touching toys.

1787
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,580
There's a nasty restaurant.

1788
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:06,940
Touch the equipment that pierces kids ears.

1789
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:09,100
It just seems too close to me.

1790
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:12,660
I feel like even you want to at least go to a piercing

1791
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:14,580
pagoda or are those still around?

1792
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:18,220
First of all, I will say from what I can tell, places in the mall

1793
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:21,140
where you can get your ears pierced, I don't really know.

1794
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:25,340
But like, I don't think Claire's is like the.

1795
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:27,660
No, of course, Claire's is fine.

1796
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:30,100
Yes, sanitized for your protection.

1797
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,060
Twenty one year old piercing your ears.

1798
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:33,100
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

1799
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:35,940
I actually I think this being a higher end location,

1800
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:37,900
I think you're in a better situation.

1801
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:40,380
OK, I do. I do.

1802
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:43,100
I mean, look, I mean, I saw the quality of the salon.

1803
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:46,060
I don't know if the salon is also where the ear piercing occurs.

1804
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:48,860
Probably. But, you know, but I actually

1805
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:53,260
the salon is a high production value area.

1806
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:57,860
Yeah. And if that is any indicator, then yeah, I don't know.

1807
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:03,260
Your your concerns are valid and your ideas of how to pierce

1808
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:05,540
the doll's ear are correct and inventive.

1809
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:10,580
But the cleanliness is not one issue I'd be super worried about.

1810
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:13,300
I don't think it must be easy to pierce ears.

1811
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:14,500
I think it is.

1812
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:17,060
Yeah, I think it's just rubbing alcohol in the leg.

1813
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:19,220
You just go right through and the gun.

1814
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:22,140
I don't think it's that different from all on the gun.

1815
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:23,500
I'll do it.

1816
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:24,220
Chug, chug, chug.

1817
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:26,500
Somebody get me a gun. I'll pierce your ear.

1818
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:30,740
No, the piercing gun, not like a nine millimeter.

1819
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:32,060
I didn't call for a nine millimeter.

1820
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:33,140
I call for a piercing gun.

1821
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:34,420
And I said, I'll pierce your right now.

1822
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:36,020
Oh, OK. It's a fine.

1823
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:38,580
Well, that's a good also a topic for next month.

1824
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:40,500
If you want me to pierce Jason's ear.

1825
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:44,820
Yeah. But if you suggest this, the title in the poll has to be

1826
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:49,540
if Jason thinks it's so easy, let Mike pierce Jason's ear.

1827
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:51,660
I don't I don't mean to speak down.

1828
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:55,140
I think the professionals have very, you know, it's a complicated

1829
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:56,740
craft like everyone else.

1830
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:58,420
The teenager at the mall.

1831
01:24:58,420 --> 01:24:59,220
Yeah.

1832
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:02,820
Making money and that's the bar of professional.

1833
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:06,940
I think I've had enough needles and infusions and everything under the sun.

1834
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:08,380
Yeah, but this is for fun.

1835
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:09,220
This is for fun.

1836
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:10,580
Oh, this is for fun, is it?

1837
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:15,620
I see the guy who there was a guy who my friend wanted to get his ear pierced

1838
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:18,300
in Wisconsin by the Wisconsin Dells.

1839
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:22,820
And there was a guy who had a tattoo and I apologize for being so vulgar.

1840
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:27,220
He had a tattoo with a mermaid with a penis in her mouth on his arm.

1841
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:28,660
And this was the guy.

1842
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:31,940
This was the guy who was piercing people's ears regularly.

1843
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:33,460
And he was probably great at it.

1844
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:34,620
Let's be honest.

1845
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:38,540
Well, yeah, I'm just saying it's not like we do like you have to go to eight

1846
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:40,260
years of medical school to pierce someone's ear.

1847
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,780
I don't know if I would trust that mermaid.

1848
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:44,780
If it's a siren, likely calling you to the rocks.

1849
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:51,420
And possibly if if there's violent intentions, maybe

1850
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,780
snapping off that penis entirely.

1851
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:54,580
Oh, that's what he's getting at.

1852
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:55,580
That was a question.

1853
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:59,500
Do you remember if the penis was attached to a body or just its own thing?

1854
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,820
I feel like it was like part of the body.

1855
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:02,580
OK, OK.

1856
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:06,700
Unless we totally misread or missed like we did with something totally.

1857
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:08,220
She had like a cigar in her mouth.

1858
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:09,020
Well, then maybe. All right.

1859
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:13,060
So if it was attached to a body, then that dirty mermaid was probably in the process

1860
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:15,380
of snapping it off. Very possible.

1861
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:16,540
Yeah. Stay away from her.

1862
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:18,500
It was a siren. Jason's right.

1863
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,660
He knows that he knows them from literature.

1864
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:22,540
Yeah. For the honesty.

1865
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:25,500
You all. Yeah. You only and you only know the Mario Odyssey.

1866
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:30,140
Not the game, but the choose your own adventure book where you write

1867
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:31,980
the original characters or equivalents.

1868
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:34,580
Yeah. Sirens often.

1869
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:38,100
I believe I heard that due to the sea

1870
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:41,620
madness that would get in people's brains, they would think they were seeing

1871
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:43,380
sirens calling me to the rocks.

1872
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:46,860
In reality, it was likely like sea lions screaming.

1873
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,780
Wait, it was a hallucination.

1874
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:53,780
So you're saying in a practical way, in a reality, in the reality,

1875
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:57,420
people would report seeing a beautiful mermaid.

1876
01:26:57,980 --> 01:27:03,820
But they think what it was, they saw sea lions, they had sea lions.

1877
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:09,700
Yes, my father thought he saw 10 sirens on the ship from Sweden to Minnesota.

1878
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:10,620
Yes, exactly.

1879
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:12,780
And then he went over to give them all little kisses.

1880
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,940
But they were all sea lions and they took pieces out of his skin

1881
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:17,620
with their teeth and their fangs.

1882
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:21,140
Oh, my God. He ended up just like marked up.

1883
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:23,380
Yes, he's cut up like that Batman character.

1884
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:26,300
Mr. Zaz. Mr. Zaz. Mr. Zaz. Yes.

1885
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:30,100
That's a care Jason told me about him.

1886
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:34,220
He puts a hash mark for every person he kills, his body full of hash marks.

1887
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:37,660
Yes. But he married one of the sea lions eventually.

1888
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:41,300
What? Wait, is the whole I don't mean to propose this.

1889
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:45,260
Is your father faking his illness so that he can die,

1890
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,660
quote unquote, disappear and then go back to those rocks

1891
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:50,740
and live with the sexy sea lions forever?

1892
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:53,220
He keeps sending all his money to the sea lions.

1893
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:55,740
He keeps saying that there's that there are his wives.

1894
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:58,500
The money for your food and medicine, Kirsten.

1895
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:01,220
He signed the deed to our house over to them as well.

1896
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:03,500
And I'm not going to get anything when he passes.

1897
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:10,180
I did not know the back story for Kirsten was

1898
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:15,140
her father is a Mr. Zaz type and her mother appears to be the sea lion.

1899
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:21,220
Stepmother. That's what he wants is to. Oh, my God.

1900
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:24,580
Yeah. You've read you've read crazier things in your books, I'm sure.

1901
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:29,420
You're earning so all your your little dolly is going to end up

1902
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:34,260
in the via the will given split up between eight sea lions.

1903
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:38,660
That's right. Who may be beautiful, but what do they need with a dolly

1904
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:40,780
kill with eight sea lions?

1905
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:43,540
That's a word Jason taught me.

1906
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:47,140
Well, I'm just trying to explain.

1907
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:52,340
Jason's the Jason's the American girl of, let's say, twenty, twenty two.

1908
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:55,700
He knows all the phrases from two years ago.

1909
01:28:57,180 --> 01:28:59,260
He represents that year.

1910
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:01,100
He said he was going sicko mode.

1911
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:03,900
And now I understand what it means.

1912
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:06,580
I haven't gotten up to Sabrina Carpenter yet.

1913
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:13,660
Guys, can you look at your phones now, assuming that this has gone through?

1914
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:17,980
As I talk about the salon, I wanted to bring this up, something that I clocked

1915
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:21,300
when I was in here before being forced to be here by Club Three.

1916
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:25,860
This is the main piece of artwork on the wall of the salon.

1917
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,540
You guys both have this? I do. Yeah.

1918
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:29,340
Oh, sunglasses.

1919
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:34,060
Well, do you know, do you look at all the in this big photo montage?

1920
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:35,660
Do you realize what you're looking at?

1921
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:38,700
What all these American girls are doing? Yes.

1922
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:41,740
It's kind of well, Jason.

1923
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:44,460
Are these movie scene recreative?

1924
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:47,140
Yeah, I'm realizing what some of these are.

1925
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:48,100
You got it. Yeah.

1926
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,020
So call out call out what you see.

1927
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:51,940
And let's see if we can place all of them.

1928
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:54,060
I think we got nine E.T.

1929
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:56,220
E.T. Sound of music.

1930
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:58,340
Yes. La La Land, La La Land,

1931
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:02,700
all with Little Doll, Back to the Future and La La Land for the listeners.

1932
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:05,420
Is that is one of these a simple man?

1933
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:07,740
This are you talking about?

1934
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:12,940
Which one the two in on the bottom going from the left?

1935
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:14,940
I think I know what this is.

1936
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:17,180
But Mike, do you want to venture a guess? Is that up?

1937
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:19,020
I think it's up. Yeah. Yeah.

1938
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:20,420
Oh, OK. Yeah.

1939
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:23,500
This is just this is it's the little dolls recreating.

1940
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:25,780
That's a good guess.

1941
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:31,220
I it was not a simple man.

1942
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:31,980
The Cohen brother.

1943
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:36,380
I know I was thinking of a movie with Julianne Moore, a Todd Fields movie, I think.

1944
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:38,580
Oh, my God. That's even weird.

1945
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:39,940
It is pretty weird.

1946
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:40,940
There's Bueller.

1947
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:42,500
Paratrap. Moonrise Kingdom.

1948
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,340
That's what I am wondering.

1949
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:45,660
Is that what that is?

1950
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:46,780
That was my first thought.

1951
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:48,580
Moonrise Kingdom.

1952
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:50,500
Yeah, there's a for the listener.

1953
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,220
There's a little there's a boy.

1954
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:55,060
Well, somebody else look up Moonrise Kingdom proper while I describe it.

1955
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:55,980
We'll see if we're right.

1956
01:30:55,980 --> 01:31:01,780
But it's a like Boy Scout doll with a canteen and supplies.

1957
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:03,060
And he's holding up a map.

1958
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:06,180
And there's a girl in like a plane girl planes.

1959
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:08,220
You know what I'm saying?

1960
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:12,540
Yeah, planes girl planes girl planes girl dress in a blue basket.

1961
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:14,380
And I mean, that that's what it is.

1962
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:17,020
It's Moonrise Kingdom.

1963
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:18,700
That's the first thing I thought, too.

1964
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:22,420
Yeah, because all like, OK, you know, anything like this, where we're like,

1965
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:24,900
think about it, Universal Studios, you go to the Hello Kitty store

1966
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:27,700
and you see a Hello Kitty recreation of Back to the Future.

1967
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:29,140
Yeah, I think, too.

1968
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:31,420
These ones follow.

1969
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:34,420
And then you get La La Land in there for something recent and up.

1970
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:37,620
And but Moonrise Kingdom with dolls.

1971
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:39,940
What? That's so weird.

1972
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:44,100
And also, that movie is kind of a creepy little movie with its little romance.

1973
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:46,580
And now we're going even younger with these.

1974
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:48,900
I don't know. How do they land on Moonrise Kingdom?

1975
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:51,260
It's the sunglasses almost famous.

1976
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:54,420
Yes. Yeah. And that's weird, too, because we're looking.

1977
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:59,820
Yeah, we're looking at a doll Penny Lane who got traded to doll

1978
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:05,140
sweet water, still water for a case of doll beer.

1979
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:07,820
Well, yes, that's a very good point.

1980
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:10,700
Isn't there a part where this where this particular doesn't this particular

1981
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:12,580
doll overdose at some point?

1982
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:13,700
Yes, I think that's right.

1983
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:16,740
Overdose on glitter fizz.

1984
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:19,660
The also weird thing about it is just that like all these other movies,

1985
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:21,860
though, are at least are like very popular.

1986
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:24,300
Moonrise Kingdom is not pretty.

1987
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:26,260
Yes. My you know, successful for him.

1988
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:27,940
Sure. His most successful.

1989
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:29,580
You buy all other metrics.

1990
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:31,860
All these other movies are insanely more popular.

1991
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:33,260
Yeah. The Moonrise Kingdom.

1992
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:34,540
Yes. Yeah. Right.

1993
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:35,980
Ferris Bueller. Yeah.

1994
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:37,660
We're leaps and bounds. Right.

1995
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:39,940
How did they land at Moonrise?

1996
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:42,780
That's fascinating. So so strange.

1997
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:45,820
Yeah, they didn't do the

1998
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:50,380
they didn't do a doll Richie Tenenbaum shaving himself in the mirror.

1999
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:51,940
And then things coming to a.

2000
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:53,460
Yeah, that's good.

2001
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:56,580
That would be there was a discussion, I bet.

2002
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:58,540
If there's a there's a Wes Anderson fan,

2003
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:03,220
like, should we dress them up like Margot and whatever his character's name is?

2004
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:04,900
Would you say Richie? Yeah.

2005
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:08,540
Yeah. There was a discussion like on them on the bus or something.

2006
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:14,180
Oh, doll pirates going after Steve Zissou.

2007
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:17,340
Right. Yeah.

2008
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:19,980
That's weird. Yeah.

2009
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:22,540
I'm I honestly I was going to bring that up.

2010
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:24,620
Like, I'm confused. Am I?

2011
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:26,220
I was so dumb when I saw this.

2012
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:27,860
I thought it was Moonrise Kingdom.

2013
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:30,300
And now I realize it was Moonrise Kingdom. Yeah.

2014
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:32,540
Inexplicable. So weird.

2015
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:37,100
We'll post this, I think, somewhere so you can feel mad as well.

2016
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:40,460
Lane kind of makes sense because it's L.A.

2017
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:41,620
Sure.

2018
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:46,420
And for five seconds, it was the best picture of the year.

2019
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:48,660
Right. Right. That's right.

2020
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:50,660
Doll Moonlight would have been a weird one, too.

2021
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:58,860
So anyway, we didn't really experience the the salon, the food.

2022
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:00,980
I don't know. I mean, did that sort of close out?

2023
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:01,620
Then I don't know.

2024
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:06,380
It took a while for everything to play out, at which point

2025
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:09,140
a manager, somebody came over,

2026
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:12,020
I think just because the other tables were being dealt with.

2027
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:13,780
He could tell it was like taking a little while.

2028
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:18,180
And he just gave my son a full, unopened package of Hot Wheels.

2029
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:20,420
Not American Girl Hot Wheels.

2030
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:22,020
No, regular Hot Wheels.

2031
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:25,420
I think this is part of the Mattel family at some point, I believe.

2032
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:29,460
And I thought that was so nice and so sweet.

2033
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:31,580
And the only thing that threw me off about it

2034
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:36,060
is that he was just wearing a regular shirt and no name tag.

2035
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:39,180
And I was like, do you work here?

2036
01:34:39,180 --> 01:34:42,820
Did you go take that from the store and bring it over?

2037
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:47,060
I it really threw me with apologies to the guy.

2038
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:49,300
This is a very nice gesture.

2039
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:52,780
I was I was just unnerved in this, like, hang on.

2040
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:54,020
What are you, though?

2041
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:57,700
Why do you if a guy is walking up to me in this restaurant

2042
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:01,500
representing the restaurant, I want him to be in the gaudiest

2043
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:03,740
pink and black and white. Yes. And

2044
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:08,140
and for him to be have an extremely grating voice

2045
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:12,380
when a really normal man walked up right perhaps with an untucked shirt.

2046
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:13,540
Am I making that up?

2047
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:14,980
I wasn't there, remember?

2048
01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:16,980
She was gone. We were gone.

2049
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:18,100
So it was so nice.

2050
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:22,500
But I don't know. I figured out what I was thinking of

2051
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:25,660
in that picture, in that thing.

2052
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:28,580
I was thinking of the movie poster for

2053
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:32,540
Uneducation starring Carey Mulligan and Peter Sarsgaard.

2054
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:33,940
Wow.

2055
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:39,860
And I was quite I was really wondering why they chose that one.

2056
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:42,300
Why did they do American Girl and Education?

2057
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:44,860
Why do young girls need an education?

2058
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:45,660
Mm hmm.

2059
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:49,300
I it is about a young woman dating an older man.

2060
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:52,180
And I'm like, they that shouldn't be in the American Girl Store.

2061
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:57,180
Wow. Yeah, I didn't see his manager.

2062
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:59,780
Why did they do Doll Far From Heaven?

2063
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:02,380
That's the other one.

2064
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:05,780
I almost was trying to pull the word far from heaven.

2065
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:09,620
The scene from up is him with the wife who dies, too.

2066
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:11,380
So it's like that's in a montage.

2067
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:14,140
That invokes sadness immediately seeing that picture.

2068
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:17,260
That's from midway through what becomes the saddest montage of all time.

2069
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:19,780
Yeah, I didn't see this manager.

2070
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:21,860
I just came back and there were Hot Wheels on the table.

2071
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:23,300
We didn't get Hot Wheels.

2072
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:24,980
I was a little upset by that. Yeah.

2073
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:26,220
But I don't know.

2074
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:28,580
And then there was I've never saw it again.

2075
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:31,700
There was not a bored girl at that table at that time.

2076
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:33,620
Right. So this you didn't get it.

2077
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:37,620
It was just a representative from five below a few doors down,

2078
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:39,700
trying to get you come in, look around it.

2079
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:42,700
Were you just while you were sitting in your bed looking at all the stores

2080
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:44,860
that you could have gone to if you were there?

2081
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:50,580
No, I was just kind of guessing because most malls seemed to have a five below

2082
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:52,060
somewhere close by now.

2083
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:53,020
Sure.

2084
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:57,620
The let's talk about the desserts, which again,

2085
01:36:57,620 --> 01:37:01,420
and we're we're thinking and Jason at home is thinking,

2086
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:06,180
ah, moose, the rarest bird imported from far Europe.

2087
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:08,940
Yeah, that can be achieved here.

2088
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:12,100
I've only heard of one person having it.

2089
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:13,580
It's a delicacy.

2090
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:17,740
And they were far away, the richest kings in America.

2091
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:18,340
That was a kid.

2092
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:20,340
That was the king who kicked you out of the country.

2093
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:21,220
Yes, exactly.

2094
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:22,980
And that's the only person I ever heard of.

2095
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:25,580
Go find go find somewhere colder to live.

2096
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:27,300
Delicacy. You talk.

2097
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:31,460
There is a theme park in action, because that was like a go to

2098
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:35,620
at cafeteria style restaurants, Disney and Busch Gardens,

2099
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:37,260
King Dominion at the end of the line.

2100
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:39,940
There was always like, oh, a little thing of chocolate moose.

2101
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:42,260
Don't mind if I do.

2102
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:44,460
But isn't moose everywhere?

2103
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:48,100
Well, that's this world where moose is only an American girl and theme park.

2104
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:52,140
Looking back, I was like, oh, it was at all the theme parks

2105
01:37:52,140 --> 01:37:55,220
because it was incredibly inexpensive to make and of that.

2106
01:37:55,540 --> 01:38:00,420
They probably just dumped power and whole milk in a vat and then scooped it out.

2107
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:03,140
But I loved it.

2108
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:06,940
I love my vat moose.

2109
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:09,020
Don't put it anywhere near a piercing machine.

2110
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:10,260
It'll contaminate the ears.

2111
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:13,660
You need to get a vat, a home vat, and make your own moose.

2112
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:17,180
We did get a big pot, like a big pot for Christmas.

2113
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:18,300
So I could start making.

2114
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:19,900
OK, getting closer.

2115
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:21,860
That's getting close, but not a vat.

2116
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:24,020
It's a home vat, you know.

2117
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:26,300
Maybe Kirsten could use it as a bathtub.

2118
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:28,700
Yes, or a house.

2119
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:31,700
Well, it does have a lid.

2120
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:33,700
Turn it over. A locking lid.

2121
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:36,180
Maybe I could grow old in there.

2122
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:39,300
It's like an upgrade from your life now, yes.

2123
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:43,100
The moose comes at the end

2124
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:48,620
and it comes in little flower pots with little cloth flowers that you stick in the top.

2125
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:53,780
I saw a video of, I don't know,

2126
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:57,700
from eight to ten years ago where this moose comes to the table,

2127
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:58,940
maybe at the Chicago one.

2128
01:38:58,940 --> 01:39:01,140
Yeah, this used to be so much bigger.

2129
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:02,140
Of course it did.

2130
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:07,580
Now these flower pots come and I don't it's it was a struggle.

2131
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:13,580
Correct. It was so hard to eat this to get the width of a standard sized spoon.

2132
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:17,380
Yeah. Into to fit entirely into the pot.

2133
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:18,780
It was wild.

2134
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:21,940
I don't know what when this changed, but it felt like such

2135
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:25,140
because every time you would go and put your spoon in to pull,

2136
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:27,540
like you couldn't just get a good scoop on the spoon.

2137
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:31,060
It would knock all this different like crumb chocolate stuff.

2138
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:32,940
Like it would knock it all over everywhere.

2139
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:34,860
It was maybe dirt everywhere.

2140
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:39,500
Yes, it was more Oreo dirt cup style.

2141
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:43,300
So, Jason, in your pursuit of moose, you wouldn't have really gotten in here.

2142
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:44,220
I wouldn't have liked that.

2143
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:46,500
No, you would have said it's taken away from the moose.

2144
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:50,260
Yeah, you would have done it like a shot to get all of it in

2145
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:53,260
because I feel like half of it ended up on the table.

2146
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,100
It was trying to scoop it out.

2147
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:59,780
I would say these kids were pretty well behaved as far as mess goes.

2148
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:02,860
Yeah. These for and under children we were with.

2149
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:08,420
Yeah. Not until the struggle with the flower pots was their mess on the table.

2150
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:11,700
Yes. Were there worms? Were there gummy worms in the dirt?

2151
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:13,820
That's ridiculous. There wouldn't have been room.

2152
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:16,100
There was not the diameter.

2153
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:17,820
We're talking like like this.

2154
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:20,900
Yeah, flower pots narrow as they go down.

2155
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:22,340
You don't want a full size.

2156
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:25,740
Like even a teaspoon would be too big to get.

2157
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:27,860
What do you mean to scoop out moose?

2158
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:29,980
Yeah, I'm just saying they're like thimble.

2159
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:34,860
We did not have any special spoon to work with here.

2160
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:37,060
We had no straw issue spoon.

2161
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:39,980
Yeah. And the spoon did not fit into the.

2162
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:43,500
I understand. We we talk about Disney all the time. Right.

2163
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:46,180
The show. We know how it is when these things,

2164
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:50,220
when the perks are cut and cut and cut until there is no more anymore.

2165
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:54,100
That being said, just pure mechanics.

2166
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:56,660
You can't get these flower pots too much smaller.

2167
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:59,460
They're going to be smaller than the spoon.

2168
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:02,380
That's also you're not giving us all size spoons also,

2169
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:04,900
which would be more fun as part of the experience.

2170
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:08,940
Well, and also they had done such the cinnamon rolls or whatever were fine.

2171
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:12,620
But there was at least a couple different options for the appetizers.

2172
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:15,620
So I thought, oh, well, when they do the desserts, surely

2173
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:18,460
there will be something on that scale.

2174
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:23,460
This couldn't have been funnier and wronger of my thinking.

2175
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:27,740
And you're sudden and you're like, well, why order an add on dessert?

2176
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:31,540
That would be a plus up. I've already paid my twenty seven dollars.

2177
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:34,380
And I'm getting dessert as part of it.

2178
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:37,380
I'd be foolish to get more dessert on top of.

2179
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:41,540
And then when you see what you get, this is hardly a dessert course.

2180
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:43,860
That's really like dangerous.

2181
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:46,620
I feel like children would like they can't get a spoon in there.

2182
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:49,060
They're sticking their hand. They're sticking their fingies.

2183
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:52,420
Try to scoop out that moose. That seems like chaos.

2184
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:55,700
And then they go straight to the piercing machine.

2185
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:58,900
Touch it with the and suddenly they have permanent

2186
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:01,660
Oreo crumbs in their ear forever.

2187
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:03,260
Well, look, we've all been there.

2188
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:06,220
The salon.

2189
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:08,540
In the many episodes and we've said, Jason, come on,

2190
01:42:08,740 --> 01:42:10,300
get the Oreos out of your ears.

2191
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:12,220
We mean it literally. It's a condition.

2192
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:13,780
I'm trying.

2193
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:16,180
Medical science hasn't progressed that fast.

2194
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:20,660
The salon where you can get your nails and hair done

2195
01:42:20,660 --> 01:42:23,580
and your dolls shit also done up, right?

2196
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:25,740
Doll shit. Your dolls.

2197
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:28,260
Yeah. Yes, my shit can get done up.

2198
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:33,580
I don't even want to know about your century old shit diseases, Kirsten.

2199
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:37,420
Yes, the doctor would examine it and they would do them up,

2200
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:38,500
I guess they would say.

2201
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:41,500
Yeah. When they would examine them and find the different creatures living.

2202
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:43,500
Inside.

2203
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:47,340
And they and they'd say, oh, look, good for you.

2204
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:49,780
A new pet. I think take care of this worm.

2205
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:52,100
Long extinct, so do take care of it.

2206
01:42:52,740 --> 01:42:55,340
But I think he meant them this in a more colloquial way,

2207
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:57,300
like a colloquial way. Is that right?

2208
01:42:57,300 --> 01:42:59,500
Yes, correct.

2209
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:03,220
Uh, yeah, there's well, so yeah, we we close out of here.

2210
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:04,420
We had downstairs.

2211
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:08,580
I think I think kids end up having a lot of fun in the downstairs zone.

2212
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:12,380
Uh, you know, stop by the salon, but you didn't.

2213
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:14,580
Well, you didn't treat Kirsten to.

2214
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:15,500
I thought we were going to get something.

2215
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:19,780
And then like I was I was just in such a haze for many, many reasons.

2216
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:24,020
I was just like, if she's not we almost bought our daughter something

2217
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:26,540
and then she dropped it and we're like, she didn't want that bad.

2218
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:28,060
OK, good. Yeah.

2219
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:30,260
So like when they were like, I guess we could get something.

2220
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:32,300
And then I'm like, I don't even know where to begin here.

2221
01:43:32,660 --> 01:43:36,180
Kirsten is still dressed sort of sort of modern, but I'm like,

2222
01:43:36,180 --> 01:43:39,940
I feel like I'm I'm dropping 150 if I'm dropping money here.

2223
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:41,340
She's not worth it.

2224
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:43,580
She's right here. She's hearing she's not worth it.

2225
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:44,740
What do you mean?

2226
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:48,700
Well, I can get some on Amazon, probably a good knockoff thing for her.

2227
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:50,820
And she won't know the difference.

2228
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:53,940
Like a buying American girl dupes on Amazon.

2229
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:56,100
Yeah, I could buy her some sort of knockoff stuff.

2230
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:59,900
And plus also like she she's similar scale to my quarter scale Ninja Turtles.

2231
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:02,540
So at the very least, I could give her like a guitar to play

2232
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:05,260
or a sigh to wield.

2233
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:08,540
Oh, that would have been most helpful during the wars.

2234
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:11,900
That would have been great.

2235
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:13,100
A way to fight back.

2236
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:13,940
Way to fight back.

2237
01:44:13,940 --> 01:44:16,540
Finally, do you have throwing stars as well?

2238
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:18,620
Yeah, yeah, actually.

2239
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:20,540
And a pizza and a big pizza.

2240
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:25,020
Be a good doll, dad, and at least get her a her size shredder helmet.

2241
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:27,780
OK, yeah.

2242
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:30,220
Which I assume transforms the voice as well.

2243
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:31,660
It's me, Kirsten.

2244
01:44:31,660 --> 01:44:35,260
That'll be good if I fall in the water during one of the long expeditions

2245
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:37,740
across the oceans and a shark tries to eat me.

2246
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:40,820
The shark will break its teeth on my shredder helmet.

2247
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:44,420
Maybe scrape itself on the pads.

2248
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:45,660
You get the spiked pads.

2249
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:48,460
At the very least, I'll injure it on the way down while it tries to kill me.

2250
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:51,460
Well, you're sinking under all that shredder paraphernalia.

2251
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:51,940
That's right.

2252
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:58,140
Do they have any very modern like like influencer doll or podcaster doll?

2253
01:44:58,180 --> 01:45:00,100
I don't know specifically if they have like a selfie stick,

2254
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:01,900
but that's the vibe for some of it.

2255
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:05,620
So while there's girls of the year, which inspired the fizz drink.

2256
01:45:05,620 --> 01:45:09,380
Right. And I, you know, I don't know if that means that they are twenty

2257
01:45:09,380 --> 01:45:11,700
twenty four girls. Yeah.

2258
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:13,100
Not totally clear on that.

2259
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:16,780
The most fun that I had well, and my son,

2260
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:19,340
I'd say the most that we bonded over this experience was

2261
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:23,820
going to the

2262
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:27,260
there's like there was an ice cream truck

2263
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:30,580
as one of the accessories, a five hundred dollar ice cream truck

2264
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:32,820
branded to Jenny's ice cream.

2265
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:34,980
They made a deal with the specific brand.

2266
01:45:34,980 --> 01:45:36,940
Ah, the Listeria.

2267
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:38,620
Oh, is it? Yeah.

2268
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:42,220
Well, that's a joke, but they all of them, I feel like Bluebell,

2269
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:43,540
I think, in a Listeria.

2270
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:47,340
Apparently, if you work with cold dairy, you have a Listeria outbreak.

2271
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:50,900
I have a chronic Listeria infection that won't go away.

2272
01:45:50,940 --> 01:45:51,700
She knows.

2273
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:55,740
You have more you have more Listeria than than blood.

2274
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:58,020
That's right. My heart is full of Listeria.

2275
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:02,180
It pumps Listeria in and it pumps Listeria out.

2276
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:04,660
Jenny's, I think, is also the brand.

2277
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:07,260
Remember Nancy Pelosi's ice cream fridge?

2278
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:10,740
Remember, she had a separate fridge for ice cream.

2279
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:12,860
I do remember that on January 6th.

2280
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:16,420
Did somebody poop in there and then like, oh, it's the famous fridge.

2281
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:17,380
I know what I'm going to do.

2282
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:19,820
That's what that guy broke.

2283
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:22,580
Right. He broke it with a hammer to try to get the ice cream.

2284
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,900
And then did a very careful switcheroo.

2285
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:27,300
She'll be none the wiser.

2286
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:31,100
Yeah. I mean, to that end, I.

2287
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:34,260
Yeah, the most fun I had is my son is playing with the truck

2288
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:37,220
and then there's like ice cream scoops kind of around.

2289
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:43,700
And then just in the truck is a loose scoop of chocolate.

2290
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:48,460
And just out of context, not in a dish or a bowl, just a chocolate

2291
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:50,820
ice cream scoop did just look like poop.

2292
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:56,820
And I had baby Pete with me and baby Pete's pants come down very easily.

2293
01:46:56,820 --> 01:47:00,420
So I was really having fun making it look like he just took a dump on that.

2294
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:02,900
I saw that. Yeah.

2295
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:04,820
And my boy liked it, too.

2296
01:47:04,820 --> 01:47:10,180
And we laughed and we you know what we end it like it was a good time.

2297
01:47:10,820 --> 01:47:14,260
So I thank the listener for giving us a good time.

2298
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:18,540
However, it was the same good time that we would have had

2299
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:21,340
if we just went to the store and didn't find anything.

2300
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:23,940
Of course, we had eaten lunch somewhere else.

2301
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:28,940
Yes. If your kid loves American Girl or if you liked it,

2302
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:34,340
maybe a worth a trip, but maybe not just for the themed entertainment fan.

2303
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:37,380
That's what I would say. Yeah. Yeah.

2304
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:40,660
Just an enthusiast of themed entertainment, maybe not not for them.

2305
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:44,780
And if you look, if you went into this thinking,

2306
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:50,260
oh, boy, those three dorks are going to I we got them

2307
01:47:50,540 --> 01:47:55,820
to go to the place for little girls and be creeps at the place for little girls.

2308
01:47:55,820 --> 01:47:58,060
And that's what this episode is going to be.

2309
01:47:58,380 --> 01:48:00,940
And I'm going to laugh at that. Yeah.

2310
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:05,340
Then I say the Club 3 poll is a chance to let's go backwards.

2311
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:12,780
Let's make Jason go back there by himself and see if he just earnestly likes the meal.

2312
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:14,340
I would prefer not to.

2313
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:17,500
Everything you described, it sounded like from, you know,

2314
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:21,500
from getting your your rare moose to an Old Navy stop after.

2315
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:23,820
I think you would have had the time of your life.

2316
01:48:23,820 --> 01:48:26,580
You need to get the food to go.

2317
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:28,860
Oh, yeah. Do they have prefix to go?

2318
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:31,620
Is there a go? Oh, Jason Post made an American Girl Cafe again.

2319
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:39,220
So it's your it's your now thirty dollars just to get just to the entry fee.

2320
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:42,740
And the taxes and fees are astronomical.

2321
01:48:42,740 --> 01:48:45,300
Yeah. Well, and then to Postmates all the way from Burbank,

2322
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:48,420
her century city, by a reasonable dinner time.

2323
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:51,780
Yeah. A thirty dollar

2324
01:48:52,700 --> 01:48:56,580
barely edible pretzel burger food is not even cold.

2325
01:48:56,580 --> 01:48:58,980
It's like dry ice cold.

2326
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:02,740
Like it's dangerous to touch. Yeah.

2327
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:08,140
Well, still an interesting time had

2328
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:10,220
hope everybody had fun.

2329
01:49:10,220 --> 01:49:11,940
You survived podcast, the ride.

2330
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:13,900
Thanks for subscribing to Club Three.

2331
01:49:13,900 --> 01:49:15,220
Your bravery saved the podcast.

2332
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:16,460
Well done, Freedom Fighters.

2333
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:18,140
Kirsten, thank you for being here.

2334
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:19,940
Thank you so much for joining us as well.

2335
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:24,060
Mr. Jason, I'm very excited to learn about your new song.

2336
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:27,220
You were telling me about Hooray for Hollywood.

2337
01:49:27,220 --> 01:49:29,940
Yes, it's a celebration.

2338
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:33,340
Kirsten, you appear to be bleeding from the nose and ear.

2339
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:35,100
So I would get that looked at.

2340
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:37,540
Yes. No, that's normal. That's OK.

2341
01:49:37,540 --> 01:49:39,660
