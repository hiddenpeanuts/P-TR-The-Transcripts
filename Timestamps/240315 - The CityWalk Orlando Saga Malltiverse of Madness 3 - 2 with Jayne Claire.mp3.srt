1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,660
Forever.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:03,560
Dog.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,420
When your town has made you frown.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,160
When your square has made you swear.

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,080
When life gives you one more punch.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,000
You need a doughnut soaked in Captain Grunge.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,400
You need a place, a place to stroll with alcohol.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,520
A place that features part of the Berlin Wall.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,440
Where steampunk robots sell chocolate snacks.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,460
A place where you can tattoo your lower back.

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,600
So let's go take a walk.

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,140
Let's all go to City Walk Orlando tonight.

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,560
Podcast The Ride presents

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,680
The City Walk Orlando Saga

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,840
Multiverse of madness

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,200
A daily, extremely necessary series

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,940
Exploring the shops, restaurants, and cosmic wonder

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,200
That make up Universal City Walk Orlando

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,200
Welcome to Podcast The Ride

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,300
The City Walk Orlando Saga

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,580
I'm Jason Sherrod and joined by Mike Carlson

22
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,540
I'm here and it's the multiverse of madness

23
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,920
The multiverse of madness

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,240
Scott Caroner

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,300
Yo, hey, we're getting through it, we're getting through it

26
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:33,140
And we're deep up, we're still up in the weird up the stairs and ramps zone

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,380
Lest you thought we were moving back down the weird stairs and ramps

28
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,900
Maybe the most weirdness is up at the top

29
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,300
Yeah, I think that's right

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,860
And you know, Joker comes up a lot on this podcast

31
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,420
But maybe, I feel like we'll be all dancing up and down the ramps

32
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,920
Like Joker by the end of this episode perhaps

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,440
I mean, yes, the events of this got me Jokerfied

34
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,640
That's what I'm saying

35
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,420
For sure

36
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,660
Let's do the full round up of who's around today

37
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,520
Well, our guest today, my love, my love

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
My love

39
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,200
That's how you introduce

40
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,180
That's my iconic line

41
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:16,560
We say all the time around the house in acknowledgement to Mike's my love

42
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,460
That's how I do it

43
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,360
Here's the go, it's stylist Jane Clare

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,100
Oh, hey, what's up?

45
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,220
Okay, just some housekeeping first really quick

46
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,940
So number one, I just want to address

47
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,220
I have seen some comments online about my previous episodes

48
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,520
And I just want to say, I know you guys think that I talk too much and cut the boys off

49
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,460
But yes, of course, that is exactly right

50
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,300
Men should be speaking the least amount possible all the time

51
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,320
So I do stand by that

52
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,960
And second, we need to address little because I want the trademark

53
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,220
I want the residuals

54
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,540
Little is just how I say that word my whole life

55
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,000
I say mittens and I say little and all of a sudden it's this thing

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,700
And I just I need that to be like known and you need some closure

57
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,140
No, I just need a 10 credit

58
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,240
Fair enough

59
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,200
All right, attention

60
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,840
At first I wasn't that mad and then I was like, okay, I just said it once and now it's a whole thing

61
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,320
And I feel like it's associated with Jason and I'm like, no, my whole life

62
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,400
So right anyway, just getting that like out of the way at the top

63
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,100
Jane, you know, there's the phrase get that bag

64
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,440
There is the bag that awaits at the end of little

65
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,320
The little bag

66
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,360
It's a little bag, but it's so full and you got to get that bag

67
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,420
Always get the bag

68
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,080
There's so many residuals, there's so much weight, you know

69
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,500
People are saying this is nationwide, this is international now

70
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,940
When Jason, especially when Jason says it, should he credit you after every little?

71
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,760
I want you guys to say little and then say Jane

72
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,540
Jane Click

73
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,220
You have to

74
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:55,500
Really quick like like you signed it, you're instituting like Matt Groening signs

75
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,180
The Simpsons art in the future if we say it, we got to give you a quick

76
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,160
Okay, great

77
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,560
Is the speed okay or do I need to slow that down?

78
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,080
Oh, speed is whatever

79
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,640
Okay, okay, just as long as it's there

80
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,120
Dealers choice

81
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,200
Okay, okay, great

82
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,600
Nice, nice

83
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,480
We can do that

84
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,940
Now let's summon our dear friend

85
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,660
Oh yes

86
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,520
Please, yeah

87
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,340
We have multiple beings here

88
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,540
Our little, say hello to our little friend

89
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,620
Jane Claire

90
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,400
Jane Claire

91
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,720
Boys, boys, Jane

92
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,060
So good to see you, how are you?

93
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,000
What's up man?

94
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,620
Good to see you all

95
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,340
Yeah, you all know each other because you've been staying with the two of them

96
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,180
I've been staying with Jason and Claire, yeah

97
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,520
Thanks for letting me shack up Garfield rules

98
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,280
Thanks for taking him out so much, it helps a lot when you take him out

99
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,560
It's the least I could do, like you know, I made a chore wheel

100
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,420
Yeah, yeah

101
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,700
He's a very responsible house guest

102
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,880
Yeah, so we all spin the wheel every Sunday after mass

103
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
Okay, yeah

104
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,060
Is that how a chore wheel works?

105
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,180
You spin it like it's a wheel of fortune?

106
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,800
Isn't it usually justâ€¦

107
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,640
Yeah, no, this one you spin like wheel of fortune

108
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,300
Oh, okay

109
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,040
Yeah, there's a lot more Jason slices on that than Sector Keeper slices though

110
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,920
Well, you live there

111
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,560
I mean, I guess that's true

112
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,960
I'm really confused by this wheel, this wheel is a wheel of fortune wheel with your names on it

113
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,300
It's our names on it

114
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,060
Wait, are chores and names or are they just names and then you call out a chore before you spin it?

115
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,000
You call out a chore, then you spin it, and it can land on Jason, Claire, or I'm sorry, Jason

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,420
It's okay, people do it all the time, you can call me Claire, it's okay

117
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,840
No, no, no, like literally everyone calls me Claire and I'm like, it's fine

118
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,100
Jason, Jane, or Claire

119
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,460
Yep

120
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,460
Okay

121
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,740
So she's got two

122
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,180
She's a little bit of a disadvantage

123
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,220
Garfield, Sector Keeper, Bankrupt

124
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,160
Oh, you can get bankrupt from this chore wheel?

125
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,580
Lose a turn

126
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,760
Oh wow

127
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,420
And then every other week we put a little trip to Aruba on

128
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,200
No one ever gets that one

129
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,860
We've never landed on it though

130
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:00,920
No

131
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,560
It's like a pie cut into 32 pieces

132
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,180
Yes

133
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,080
Okay

134
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,420
The day when Garfield has to make the bed, that's a tough day for everyone

135
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,800
That's a long day

136
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,480
Or if Garfield has to take Garfield out, good luck

137
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,280
Oh, but we have to obey the wheel

138
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,100
It's the only way

139
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:31,100
He gets out the front door and then just lies on the mat and just goes to sleep for like four hours

140
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,240
Okay, well

141
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,420
Next to Jason

142
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,040
Yeah, that's my mat

143
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,700
And then if I try to take up more, he growls at me

144
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,360
I mean that is actually really accurate

145
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,180
He's been very, we call him Gronkle

146
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,380
Mr.

147
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,060
Gronkle from Busy World of Richard Scarry

148
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,620
It's like a speedy, irritable warthog who lives in the big house down the street

149
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,560
Sometimes Garfield, if you get too close to him, he just goes

150
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,500
Like these little annoyed growls

151
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,100
So we go, are you going Gronkle mode?

152
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,060
Are you Gronkle?

153
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,640
So Mr.

154
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,500
Gronkle is, the animals talk in that show, they're all animals, right?

155
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,020
Yeah, yeah

156
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,980
I forget, I've never seen the show

157
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,800
You've never seen that show?

158
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,640
I don't think so

159
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,980
I've seen the book, but I didn't see the show

160
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,300
Yeah, I've seen like the, I know what they look like

161
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,480
Well, they had that Kings Island, like Cedar Fair crossover

162
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,900
I thought there was a Richard Scarry

163
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,980
When I was younger

164
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,920
King's Island, yeah, there was a slight Richard Scarry presence

165
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,000
Because we lived in Ohio when I was younger and so I was like really into that

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,080
Yeah, it's a cute show

167
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,760
Look, I'm happy to watch it

168
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,180
What was the presence in the parks?

169
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,360
I'm not sure

170
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,560
It was mostly a restaurant where you could get personal pan pizzas

171
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,820
But that's where Richard Scarry is like everybody's got their little jobs, right?

172
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,280
Yeah

173
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,040
Is Richard Scarry like a thing where they try to like put like capitalism in your head?

174
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,720
Like you need a job or is there some sort of propaganda there?

175
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,520
Probably a bit, yeah

176
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,960
I think it's more about community and trying to go like this person is this job

177
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,980
And they will help you like this is how this person, this is a crossing guard

178
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,740
And we are learning that he helps us do this

179
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,640
It's actually really cute

180
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,180
Okay

181
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,580
Get your daughter on it

182
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,000
I think she'd love it

183
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,580
I'm open to all the shows, all the shows I hear I need to show her

184
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,300
One day she's like, daddy, why isn't podcaster in this show?

185
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,640
Is it a kind of job people are ashamed of?

186
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,540
I'll like excuse myself and I'll cry in the bathroom

187
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:37,540
Why isn't there a podcaster that's a rabbit daddy?

188
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,300
His ears wouldn't fit under the headphones

189
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,220
Yeah, that's the only reason why, otherwise I'm sure they'd love to put it in the show

190
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,440
Close that book

191
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,460
Kick it out of her hand

192
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,300
The book was old, the job didn't exist yet

193
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,020
It's dated

194
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,040
The cartoon's square, it's four by three, it's old

195
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,820
It's irrelevant, not like podcasts

196
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:08,540
I go in the office and I'm like animating by hand a Richard Scarry short with a rabbit that podcasts

197
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,140
Here it is, the flip book

198
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,920
Look, he's got a dirty microphone

199
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,440
He's the happiest animal in busy town

200
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,300
Here's his MacBook Pro

201
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,180
This rabbit is uploading his podcast to megaphone right now

202
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,000
See?

203
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,480
He's loving it

204
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,840
As for this podcast, as for the happy rabbits that all of us are today

205
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,920
Why don't we get the official assignment of today's sector?

206
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:47,480
Yes, yes, boys, boys, Jane, today's sector is Phase 3 Sector 2, BK Whopper Bar, Panda Express, Moe's Southwest Grill, and Hart and Huntington Tattoos

207
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,080
Getting inked up, boys

208
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,480
Yeah, yeah

209
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,860
I bet people, if you know what's at City Walk, Orlando, you're probably like, one of the weird things is that there is a tattoo place

210
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,900
I wonder how that will be handled in the series

211
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,140
And I think we'll close out with that, but just let that tantalize

212
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,900
I know, then

213
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,520
See you guys getting some fresh ink

214
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,840
Well, you know, yeah, well, there'll be a big reveal later of, you know, maybe of some ink

215
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,680
We'll see

216
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,720
We'll see what happens

217
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,040
Three good boy tramp stamps

218
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,720
Jason has a wimpy burger tramp stamp

219
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,720
He actually does, how did you know that?

220
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,980
He had it before this though

221
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,680
That was before the day

222
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,500
Yeah, yeah

223
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,100
That wasn't from there

224
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,280
They had to work around that

225
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,100
But we got another big thing up here, the food court

226
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:45,260
I don't know if they officially use this term anymore, if it's on a sign or anything, but at least when it opened, they called this the top of the walk food court

227
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,660
Opened in 2009, kind of a later edition, I think there were not a bunch of quick service options

228
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,700
And, you know, this was a fun thing to hit

229
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:03,840
And it seems like, Jane, some genuine enthusiasm from you about some of the establishments in the top of the walk food court

230
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,360
Yeah

231
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,200
Oh, I speak, okay

232
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,760
Sure, if you want, don't have to

233
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,040
Yeah, so I love Moe's Southwest Grill

234
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,660
Because that's a chain and they had it in the Midwest when I lived there a little bit growing up

235
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:26,100
And then of course they have them in Florida and they have like amazing tofu that you can get

236
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,200
And, you know, when I was in like high school and stuff, I was, I've been a vegetarian for a very long time

237
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,260
So when I was younger, I was like, oh cool, tofu, this was still kind of a new thing back then

238
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,080
And yeah, so it just became a place that I, you know, me and my mom would go a lot

239
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,200
And so whenever I see one, I get really excited because they don't have any here

240
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,280
Oh, that's true, yeah, not in California really

241
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,020
I know them primarily from airports, you know, they're cities

242
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,260
The Orlando International Airport specifically

243
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,420
Which we were talking about

244
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,240
We were just talking about that

245
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,220
We had like, oh, pretty good experience with that one a few years ago

246
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,580
I was so stoked, I was like, Jason, oh my God, there's a Moe's, I have to go

247
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,300
And I was like bolted off and he was like, okay, goodbye

248
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,860
Yeah, I'll see you in a bit

249
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,240
You ran away from him?

250
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,580
To get to Moe's?

251
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,580
I mean, for Queso

252
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,940
Alright, well for Queso then

253
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,140
For Queso

254
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,320
That's a good choice to make

255
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,080
So yeah, so I was so jazzed and then, you know

256
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,920
But, yeah, extremely disappointed

257
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,180
You don't, a food establishment at CityWalk Orlando?

258
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,240
Are you crazy?

259
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,380
This can't be true

260
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,600
The citywalk socket and food disappointed someone?

261
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,960
The running, the theme for this food court and sector in general

262
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,380
It's complications

263
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,020
Sure

264
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah, well, so basically we ended up

265
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,300
I think the goal here was to end up with doing a little like potluck

266
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,520
Like let's all grab little things from all of the great food establishments

267
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,380
And have a nice little picnic

268
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,220
So Moe's was your clear call

269
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,760
Which I was glad about

270
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,580
I don't know who's going to be passionate about Moe's of the Groovy

271
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,700
Wait, are you talking about this one?

272
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,500
That's when we went to BK though

273
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,440
Oh, right, right

274
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,060
I didn't do Moe's then

275
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,660
Oh, you're right, separately you did Moe's

276
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,660
Separately I did it twice

277
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:15,980
Right

278
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,620
Wow, oh yeah, there were two visits, wow

279
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,880
Yeah, I don't know why

280
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,380
I had such faith for the second time

281
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,780
Wait, was the first one bad and then you went back?

282
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,700
The first one was like fine and the second one was like a train wreck

283
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,800
This gives me strength whenever you all return to a shitty food place

284
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,500
I was really just thinking of you

285
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,960
Thank you, yes, you seemingly do it constantly

286
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,720
I was going to say, you take after your boyfriend in this way

287
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,960
Episodes worth of complaints, but we're going back on Tuesday

288
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,740
Look, look, okay, you only get one million chances, chain restaurant

289
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,000
Millions strikes and you're out

290
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,140
I have to shout out the fact that unlike the bar in The Simpsons

291
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,140
Moe's is not named after a man named Moe

292
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,240
Did you know this as a Moe's fan?

293
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,920
Do you know why Moe's is Moe's?

294
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,240
Is it something about rock and roll?

295
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,380
It used to be like a more rock and roll based place

296
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,240
And when you walked in, they used to all go, welcome to Moe's

297
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,980
Like it was a whole thing and they like really, really stopped doing that pretty quick

298
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,720
No, I'm not kidding and it was like fun

299
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,240
It was like, yeah, they said it

300
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,200
It was like a party, yeah

301
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,820
Moe's is an acronym, Moe's is, you're right, it is rock and roll oriented

302
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,420
It is musicians, outlaws and entertainers

303
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,420
Is this Southwest?

304
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,280
The sector keeper flew out of his chair when he heard this

305
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,200
He just called Moe, it's got to mean something

306
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,420
Geez, I didn't know I could die twice, bitch

307
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,660
Well, yeah, because they used to

308
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,700
I would have never guessed in one million of my eternal years

309
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,740
That's what it stands for

310
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,660
Sorry, musicians, outlaws and entertainers

311
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,900
Musicians, outlaws, same thing

312
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,340
Well, because they don't do it anymore, they totally changed everything

313
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,160
But they used to have big posters of like famous, like they would have land

314
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,800
I remember the big Bob Marley one for some reason

315
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,160
Sure

316
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,060
Big Bob Marley, probably like Madonna

317
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,680
Like it was a whole thing which made more sense

318
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,280
Musician, musician, outlaw

319
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,660
Well, Madonna also an entertainer I would say

320
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,300
And a style outlaw

321
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,700
So you would have to break the rules

322
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,760
You have to be all three things to be on the wall

323
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,500
I was thinking like Billy the Kid

324
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,600
Jesse James

325
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,260
I don't remember

326
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,160
Robert Blake

327
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,260
He was up there in the outlaw

328
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:43,860
Oh, yeah

329
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,920
There's a poster of Jason that says, wanted dead or alive at Moses

330
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,420
I answered too many chip refills

331
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,240
Oh, free chip refills

332
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,160
Okay, that's good

333
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,500
And that was so exciting to me when I was younger

334
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,860
Bottomless chips

335
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,520
And you're free when you're in high school or whatever

336
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,640
I will tell you why those stopped existing

337
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,100
Jane, why there aren't rock and rollers represented

338
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,540
It was due to a lawsuit from the estate of Jerry Garcia

339
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,980
So it really ultimately Moe's were the outlaws themselves

340
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,360
Using unlicensed

341
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,240
Not asking for image likeness clearance

342
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,480
So, yeah, no rocksters represented at this city

343
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,940
There's not a lot of walls to work with anywhere

344
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,380
Anyway

345
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,680
May I speak about the second time we went back when Scott wasn't there with me

346
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,000
So I was like, I'm going to give it one more try

347
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,380
Because I love this and I don't get a lot of chances to go here

348
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,480
What was wrong the first time?

349
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,540
Just fine, not the most

350
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,000
It was just not it

351
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,520
It just was not it

352
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,080
But you were like, oh, okay, it's a theme park

353
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,400
But second time I go back, it's later at night

354
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:06,960
So there are a bunch of new hire teen 20-somethings that clearly do not give a fuck about literally anything

355
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,440
And there's one older guy who's clearly the manager who's trying to keep things afloat

356
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,020
But knows he's got a bunch of fuck-offs just like there

357
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,100
And so stuff is kind of getting low for the end of the night

358
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,000
And I was like, I would love a tofu burrito

359
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,960
And this one kid was like, yeah, we don't have any more of that

360
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,700
And I was like, okay, can I get this?

361
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,520
And they're like, yeah, we don't have that either

362
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,360
And the guy's like, hey, go make some tofu

363
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,280
And the kid's like, um

364
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,800
And the guy's like, just go fucking make some tofu, okay?

365
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,840
So then he starts making my burrito

366
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,420
But it takes so long for the tofu to cook

367
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,820
That by the time it comes out, he had to make a new burrito

368
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,900
Because it was all soggy and fucking gross

369
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:54,460
And then the people are just fucking around and stuff

370
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,020
And the guy's kind of trying to save it

371
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,540
And there were some substances involved

372
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,520
How much am I allowed to say about that?

373
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,480
All of it, yeah, I guess

374
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,000
Okay, I was high

375
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,940
And I don't know if we had drinks, but I was definitely high

376
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,360
And I was like, you guys suck

377
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,480
I was talking to the manager, I was like, this fucking sucks

378
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,460
This is the worst mo's I've ever experienced right now

379
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,220
And I'm like, this really fucking sucks right now

380
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,240
And he was just like, okay, I'm sorry

381
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,380
And I texted the group, but I said

382
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,360
Because I was kind of on one and also on one

383
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,480
And he said, more mess at mo's

384
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,280
And Scott said, what, why?

385
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,480
And I said, new hires making burritos wrong

386
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,260
And manager taking over, no tofu left

387
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,840
And the employee was like, sorry, all gone

388
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,340
And manager was like, no, do it

389
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,220
And they had to restart making mine

390
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,500
I'm done, y'all, with an upside down smiley face

391
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,380
And they were so mad

392
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,300
They had to open a new thing of rice

393
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,660
And Scott, Jason's like, Jane, fucking stop texting this

394
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,760
But I was so enraged

395
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,200
This is the best part of the story

396
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,640
Well, she had sent me to this image of like just the end of the night

397
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,700
Like fucked up toppings

398
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,080
Looks like you'll get food poisoning

399
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,260
Wait, I wasn't done yet

400
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,040
Okay, okay

401
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,060
And it's almost over

402
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,600
And then Scott said, everything broke today, game over

403
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,520
And I said, my spirit included

404
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,620
Yeah, for sure

405
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,820
There was also some point

406
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,420
And I forget whether they said this, you or me

407
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,300
But we asked about like salsa verde

408
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:22,900
Oh, yes

409
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,100
And they were like, oh, we don't make that anymore

410
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,740
It goes bad too quick

411
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,240
Like not enough people order it

412
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,980
I was like, that was one of my favorite things at most too

413
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,380
So I was quickly like, are you fucking kidding me?

414
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,120
And then I was like, do you have this other sauce?

415
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,920
And they're like, no

416
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,720
What is this?

417
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,580
So do you think that like other Mo's, they carry salsa verde or you think they were lying?

418
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,880
Yeah, it's like a standard thing

419
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,380
So you think maybe this location is just like the teams were lying because they were lazy

420
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:57,800
It's like it's like a ice cream machine McDonald's situation where sometimes they go, oh, we don't have like 11 p.

421
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:57,880
m.

422
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,680
You want ice cream coming?

423
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,380
That's not on and this is a common thing

424
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,140
Well, no, because it was the first time I got it, I found that out

425
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,620
Yeah

426
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,240
When things weren't as crazy

427
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:05,940
Interesting

428
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,420
By the way, how common is that for you, Michael?

429
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,720
Certainly happened a few times

430
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,440
Yeah, that's happened to me a lot

431
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,560
That ice cream machine being broken

432
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,340
Because they use like a proprietary ice cream machine

433
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,220
And it's very difficult to repair

434
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,780
But you're believing them with the broken?

435
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,680
That's a lie

436
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,080
Well, it's a lie, but then sometimes it is also true

437
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,680
How do you know?

438
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,860
Do you go back and check it?

439
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,300
I've done some research

440
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,140
Yes, he does

441
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,560
This is a thing in the way I have read about the perpetually broken

442
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:35,840
Yeah

443
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,980
But you think all of it you think systemically

444
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,560
I think a lot of the time they're saying it just doesn't work

445
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,420
It's hard to clean, right?

446
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,360
Yeah, and it's just like

447
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,040
It's very difficult to clean

448
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,220
Especially because by the end of the night

449
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,800
You're not getting so many orders necessarily

450
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,760
Unless it's probably like near a venue where you get a bunch of drunk people

451
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,140
So it's just easier

452
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,800
Or just a sober Mike who wants some ice cream

453
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,700
A little treat

454
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,700
Of course

455
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,380
Or some sober treat, boys

456
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,700
Jason walks in at 11 p.

457
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:57,780
m.

458
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,540
to a McDonald's in like overalls and a hard hat with a little tool belt

459
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,080
And a tackle box of tools, whatever you call that

460
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,300
I'll fix this, bad boy

461
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,400
They say, oh, sorry, it's not working

462
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,520
And they go, not yet

463
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:09,940
Not yet

464
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,980
And you just move that thing up on the counter and you walk by

465
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,440
Anytime I see one of those counter hinges

466
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,880
I'm like, let me in there

467
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,300
Let me in there, my man

468
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,940
What do you call the thing under the car when you go under it?

469
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,960
Like you're on like the little dolly thing

470
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,440
It slides

471
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,040
You get under the machine like with there with the wrench

472
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,940
And it sounds like he's chasing tires with the Indy 500

473
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,800
Grease all over your face

474
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,220
Yeah, he's doing it with that speed

475
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,080
All right, 26 seconds, I'll get it shorted next time, let's go

476
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,540
And then the employee next day is like, oh, yeah, so the ice cream repairman came in and the manager goes, what?

477
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,660
The ice cream, what?

478
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,560
What are you talking about?

479
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,160
The guy with the overalls

480
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,360
The guy with the ice cream is enthusiastic

481
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,480
And we tried to pay him, but he said, no, no, the joy is all mine

482
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,520
The love of the game

483
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,180
He goes, you already paid me and he licked his cone

484
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,760
He filled up his toolbox with ice cream and left

485
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,580
He had toolbox of ice cream

486
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,540
He licks the wrench, licks the screwdriver

487
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,960
Here's the results of my photo search

488
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,420
One is Jane making like the

489
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,460
In an Iron Maiden shirt making like the rock and roll

490
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,140
Oh, yeah

491
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:22,240
This is where I am definitely, you know, having a good time

492
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,660
But I think this is before any of this has happened because you have not been taught to be soured on this particular Mo's yet

493
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,080
This is right after they said, welcome to Mo's

494
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,220
Welcome to Mo's

495
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,380
We don't make the kind of salsa you like anymore

496
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,100
No, they didn't say it.

497
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,920
Fuck this place

498
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,760
They didn't even, yeah

499
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,160
They didn't even acknowledge me

500
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,640
They were talking to each other

501
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,420
And then I walked up and they were almost like, what?

502
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,360
Do you think they were, did you say 20s?

503
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,020
Like how old, you thought they were teens or 20s?

504
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,720
Something like that?

505
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,480
I have no reference of age anymore because everyone looks

506
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,640
Kids look old, adults look young

507
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,340
I fucking have no idea

508
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,200
Some podcasters look young too

509
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,240
Some podcasters look half their age or lower

510
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,800
If you're tall, you're old

511
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,040
Thank you, that is how I feel

512
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,580
Hey, wait

513
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,900
Hey, that's a biggest slam on my

514
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,440
Hey, wait

515
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,380
Those are my rules

516
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,540
What part of listen to, now listen to all of Olivia Rodrigo's guts do you not understand?

517
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:24,980
Jane, you have the rock and roll spirit, but I immediately am grimacing at the sign that says

518
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,560
We built this city on guac and roll

519
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,840
I like that sign

520
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,760
I'm also not super fond of while my cheese gently weeps

521
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,640
It doesn't rhyme

522
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,160
That one I don't like, but the first one I like

523
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,080
Wait, I don't get that one

524
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,740
While my guitar gently weeps, but then it doesn't, cheese doesn't rhyme

525
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,680
I don't want my cheese weeping

526
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,260
It's a Beatles song

527
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,220
I'm not a Beatles kid

528
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,740
The Beatles are old

529
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,580
That one, that we know for sure

530
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,460
Some are dead

531
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,820
And some aren't old

532
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,660
At least two of them are dead

533
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,020
By the time this comes out

534
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,020
Oh, no

535
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,720
Did we just kill a Beatle?

536
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,020
Take it out, take it out

537
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,820
Yeah, yeah

538
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,780
I feel like that maybe covers Moe's unless you have more Moe's thoughts

539
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,040
No, I went back to last night there

540
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,520
You went back again, Jason

541
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,340
I know, I hadn't eaten there

542
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:21,180
I just tried to get, I just got like a bean burrito with like, I just needed some protein

543
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,260
But you heard what happened to your girlfriend

544
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,320
I know, but there was nothing else like, everywhere else was crowded

545
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,400
Well, you were also trying to be like, well she loves this, so

546
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,740
He was trying to have shared interests

547
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,800
Which she, I was trying to eat healthier

548
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,720
So you went to the place that made your girlfriend

549
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,280
No, she was fine, I don't think it made her sick

550
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,200
Look, I eat crap and shit all the time

551
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,240
Yeah, so

552
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,520
Wait, were you saying I eat crap and shit, that's what you eat?

553
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,540
Or was one of those that you shit after eating the crap?

554
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,580
Six of one, I have a dozen of the other

555
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,300
Okay, sure

556
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,880
Great clarification

557
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,260
So Jason went anyway

558
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,700
And you liked your meal?

559
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,040
No, it was not amazing

560
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,960
It was not amazing, it was just, again, I just needed some

561
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,660
What did you get?

562
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:19,540
I just got like bean rice and cheese and steak or something simple

563
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,720
And like whatever salsa they had left

564
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,900
And this was late

565
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:23,780
Yeah

566
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,060
You just got end of the night salsa

567
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,300
Which five minutes ago you showed us a photo of and said how gross it looked

568
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,400
Well, I think part of that was that it's like, you know

569
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,890
They could have used a wipe down on that counter

570
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,920
It was picked over

571
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,720
They know the emptiness of the empty Chipotle

572
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,080
Yeah, it's a breeding ground

573
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,830
Alright, so your household kept going back even though it was bad the first time

574
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,260
That's the magic of these places though, isn't it?

575
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,300
You got the draw, you want to try it again?

576
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,860
She on your side tonight?

577
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,260
That's what all of it's about

578
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,280
It's no fun to go to a place that you know is always good in quality

579
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,240
Where's the game in that?

580
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,640
Lady Luck, a place I only went to once, the BK Whopper Bar

581
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,260
Let's talk BK Whopper

582
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,240
Now I've been looking forward to this as an aspect of this

583
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,560
I feel like I clocked the opening of the BK Whopper Bar as kind of a

584
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,160
We've come across it here and there

585
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,460
We've talked about things that were there at the opening of City Whopper

586
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,260
They kind of got like a refresh of a lot of stuff in the late 2000s

587
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,000
And one of them being this

588
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,440
And I remember hearing about that and going that's such a cool idea

589
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,380
Yes

590
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,480
Not just a Burger King, totally customizable

591
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,400
You can make an insane Frankenstein Whopper creation

592
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,220
That sounds nuts

593
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,700
That doesn't sound like you look at it and it seems like any Burger King on earth

594
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,240
It's indistinguishable from a regular Burger King

595
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,580
It just has like windows

596
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,620
So you can see the lettuce before it gets on the burger

597
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,120
That's basically the difference

598
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,900
Wow

599
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,340
Right?

600
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:08,880
I mean right?

601
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,700
They say you want a revolution

602
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,720
It's like Baskin Robbins

603
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,740
It's like a Baskin Robbins, but Burger King

604
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,900
We were just at Baskin Robbins two days ago

605
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,940
The one over here where they train people?

606
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:21,760
Yeah

607
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,000
The drive thru

608
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,720
Yes

609
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,880
There's a big sign, like poster

610
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,940
What did it say?

611
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:29,740
Milkshakes

612
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,560
And we pulled up and were like hi

613
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,220
Could we have that when you're done with it?

614
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,220
What do you guys do with those?

615
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,460
I kind of love that

616
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,600
Was that an impression of yourself or Jason?

617
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,720
Both

618
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,840
It's us being a little grimy

619
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,180
Who would like that poster?

620
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,280
Yes, both of us

621
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,500
And they were like, corporate?

622
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,820
They don't think corporate would like that very much

623
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,800
And we were like, okay

624
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,040
But we were like, do you want me to ask?

625
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,020
He's like, no, no

626
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,600
And then I was like, I'll see what the vibe is when I get up there

627
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,580
There's this cool girl with a compliment on my sunglasses

628
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,720
And I was like, okay, she's like a cool bathroom girlie

629
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,640
Is what I say

630
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,420
And so I was like, okay, I'll ask her, she's my girl

631
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,680
And then she was like, I don't think corporate will be cool with that

632
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,200
And we're like, okay

633
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,380
And they were like, give us our milkshakes

634
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,100
She was your cool bathroom girlie?

635
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,880
Yeah, what does that mean?

636
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,900
Can I talk about?

637
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,580
Is this for a different episode?

638
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,400
I think it's for this

639
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,280
As long as you can talk about it, it's for this episode

640
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,480
Bathroom girlies would change

641
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,740
So we were at

642
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,920
Bathroom girlies are in this sector

643
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,560
Oh, good, he checked his notes

644
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,040
Bathroom girlies are in this sector

645
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,760
So this is at a different restaurant at Out Here City Walk

646
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,000
That's why I'm like, should I not say?

647
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,380
Oh, yeah, no, keep it broad strokes

648
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,160
Okay, broad strokes

649
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,900
So I had an experience recently

650
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,200
Jason's been on his sector keeper hat

651
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,620
Oh, let's keep that out of theâ€¦

652
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,920
I was at a restaurant recently

653
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,320
And the bathroom was such a disaster

654
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,200
Not like it was gross

655
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,440
But none of the soap was working

656
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,600
So they had a bottle of soap

657
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,500
But that was empty and the top was off

658
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,580
And it was on the counter

659
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,100
And me and a bunch of girls

660
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,460
Various ages, I say girls, but women

661
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,360
And we're all like, yo, there's no soap

662
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,400
And one of them is like, yeah

663
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,720
And there's no toilet paper in this one

664
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,640
I went, ladies, hold on

665
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,000
I went to find this manager

666
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,920
She fucking sucked

667
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,980
I had a whole thing

668
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,700
And Jason was like, please stop talking about this

669
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,540
I was like, no, she was soâ€¦

670
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,940
I fucking hit her

671
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,320
And so I was like, hey, man

672
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,660
This is going on

673
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,440
She argued with me about it for a minute

674
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,780
She's like, there's soap on the counter

675
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,140
I was like, bitch, go fucking look

676
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,760
And so we go in there and she fixes it

677
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,300
And all the girls and I were likeâ€¦

678
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,040
I was like the leader

679
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,620
I love being the bathroom girly leader

680
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,220
And so I was like, guys, I got it

681
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,320
And everyone was like, oh, yay, great

682
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,260
Thank you, this lady fucking sucks

683
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,620
And then later we're walking around

684
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,480
And this woman comes over

685
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,900
She's like, by the way

686
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,540
They finally put toilet paper in that bathroom

687
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,600
I was like, girl, that's crazy

688
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,040
And she's like, I know for the price

689
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,360
So bathroom girlies love bathroom girlies

690
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,280
So this is just a general term now

691
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,000
That's extended out into just in like

692
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,860
You use it as any ally basically

693
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,200
Or this is a specific group of girls?

694
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,600
Just like the vibe of bathroom girlies

695
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,420
Like who are really cool and like supportive

696
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,480
And like all of a sudden

697
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Like here's the thing

698
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,780
When you go into like the bathroom

699
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,520
And there's a vibe

700
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,780
Someone has to be the one to like break the silence

701
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,960
So everyone doesn't think they like hate each other

702
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,860
Because I don't know if that makes sense

703
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:14,020
In the way that men do not make eye contact

704
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,080
And maintain total silence in the bathroom

705
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,780
This whole community

706
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,840
This whole Richard's scary busy town happening

707
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,300
In the women's restrooms

708
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,180
Girls in restrooms

709
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,820
Like that's where like womanhood really like

710
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,000
That's where it lives

711
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,540
So yeah, so that is his term in general

712
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,040
So I like to be the leader of the girly group

713
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,020
You assert dominance

714
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,180
Because I also always want to be the leader

715
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,000
Because I'm a fucking Leo

716
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,800
And I don't want anyone telling me what the fuck to do

717
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,120
So I was like, fuck this

718
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,100
I'm going to get it figured out

719
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,540
So got it figured out

720
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,380
And then it was kind of like, yay, you did it

721
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,180
Fuck this lady

722
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,840
Like we were all on like one team

723
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,780
But it was so funny because this lady like stopped me

724
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,440
And I was like, oh shit

725
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,160
Like what the

726
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,120
She was like, they finally put like toilet paper in there

727
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,960
And it's so expensive

728
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,740
Can you believe?

729
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,260
I was like, girl, that's fucking crazy

730
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,000
Okay, bye

731
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,320
Like bathroom girlies, love them

732
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:55,740
Gotcha

733
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,840
So that's, that's

734
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,600
You could be deemed

735
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,700
If you find an ally anywhere

736
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,800
They're deemed bathroom girlies

737
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,620
It's an energy

738
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,320
Yeah

739
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,240
It's not specific to a bathroom

740
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,760
It doesn't have to be literally a bathroom

741
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,140
Usually

742
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,600
But like, you know, like I don't go clubbing

743
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,320
But like, like once I went and it's like you're you're fucked up in there

744
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,660
And girls are just like, girl, do you need something?

745
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,200
Are you good?

746
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,500
Don't text him

747
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,140
Don't text

748
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,960
Oh my God, girl, you're so right

749
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,580
Like

750
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:19,960
Wow

751
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,740
Have you facilitated a breakup in a bathroom?

752
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,440
Um, no

753
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,900
Not personally

754
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,020
At a concert someone was like, don't answer your phone

755
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,900
Oh, wow

756
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,000
To me

757
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,440
You like piled on to like

758
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,080
Oh, there's a movement happening here

759
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,120
I'll help with that

760
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,000
I've noticed

761
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,780
Because Jason, when you're talking about your trips that you take

762
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,880
You are gaining allies as you go

763
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,640
I feel

764
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,540
People like us

765
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,120
I'm sorry

766
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,660
I'm not saying that's not true

767
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,220
I'm saying, but like sometimes there'll be people who work at a specific part of the hotel

768
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:49,720
Oh yeah

769
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,620
Like there'll be

770
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,780
We talked a little bit about this

771
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,880
But I'm always impressed that you say, well, there was of course Susan we met

772
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,860
And then like she was our go-to girl while we were staying in whatever hotel

773
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:04,920
So it feels like would you consider the whoever that the woman you met at the hotel in Orlando?

774
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,020
Is she a bathroom girly?

775
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,280
Or is that not the same energy?

776
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,560
She's like an awesome mom who really cares about you

777
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,800
Okay, but she wouldn't be hanging out in the same space

778
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,060
It's just like a different vibe

779
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,520
Different vibe

780
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,520
That was a completely different vibe

781
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,600
She fucking rocked

782
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,180
She gave us free sodas and would tell us what's going on for the day

783
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,080
And would always like give us

784
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,600
Oh my God

785
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,440
Shortcut advice

786
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,380
Love her

787
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,420
Oh my God, I could cry

788
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,280
She's so sweet

789
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,240
Do you remember her name?

790
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,460
I haven't had a mic on her name

791
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,920
I'm just wondering if you did

792
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,920
You knew it then

793
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,880
You did know it, yeah

794
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,260
You did know it a few weeks ago

795
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,280
I just wanted to know

796
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:37,820
She's cool

797
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,960
What was the restaurant?

798
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,400
It was the chocolate emporium

799
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,140
No

800
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:43,560
Toothsum

801
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:48,360
This is our first hint that maybe the chocolate emporium could have some

802
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,420
Toothsum doesn't have toilet paper

803
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,140
It doesn't have good food either

804
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,540
We'll talk about that later

805
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,600
I bet we can dispute that for three days from now

806
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,100
When I say actual worse, I couldn't even swallow it

807
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,980
I went like, get this the fuck away from me

808
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,920
And they had to take it back

809
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,620
It was pretty rough

810
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,160
It came a half hour after his did

811
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,500
And then I get it

812
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
This is corrupting everything I thought I knew about Toothsum

813
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,080
My world has been turned upside down here

814
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,060
Don't fucking go there

815
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,260
Except for a friend of mine is

816
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,260
Well, for her sake, I will say a friend of because she's the one who works there

817
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,280
The Penelope lady

818
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,000
Okay

819
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,140
I'm not outing her

820
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,940
We were visiting Professor Dr.

821
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:30,660
Tooths

822
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,740
Professor Dr.

823
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,040
Toothsum

824
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,480
That was so fun

825
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,740
It was so cute

826
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,060
She's so cute

827
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,500
But back to the sector

828
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,140
Sorry

829
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,140
Back to the Whopper Bar

830
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:47,160
Yes, I thought this was going to explode my idea of what a Burger King could do

831
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,960
I agree

832
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,960
What did you encounter?

833
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,320
What's the reality of the situation?

834
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,240
Well, the reality of the situation was just

835
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,560
Pickle Whopper

836
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:04,380
And then there's like a handful of toppings you can add to it

837
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:10,060
So the idea, the revolutionary idea of choosing toppings at a counter restaurant

838
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,420
Which are mostly a good amount of them are cheese

839
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:18,080
American cheese, Swiss cheese, pepper jack, bacon, pepper bacon

840
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,060
Guacamole, jalapenos, crispy onions, onion rings

841
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,640
And was the cheese gently weeping?

842
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,960
It actually kind of was

843
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,180
Oh no, that's not what you want to hear

844
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:37,220
It was a little, you can kind of see in one of these pictures

845
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,260
There is a little bit of moisture on this

846
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,300
Johnny Cheese Sats

847
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,120
This is like Johnny Rockets from several sagas ago

848
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:45,800
Ew

849
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,700
The cheese's tears

850
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,480
The cheese's tears

851
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,640
Oh no

852
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,500
Oh no

853
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,440
The city walk of the magical land where burgers cry

854
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,740
Burgers cry

855
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,660
So now

856
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,580
Most of those ingredients are in a regular, any Burger King

857
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,460
Yes, exactly

858
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,820
By and large

859
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,800
What a let down

860
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,460
Now I'm going into this

861
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,920
I have to say I love a Whopper Jr.

862
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,860
I don't love a Whopper, like Whopper's too big

863
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,600
Really?

864
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,200
Quarter Pounders too big

865
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,120
This is a thing where I never get mad at you

866
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,760
But I get mad when you say Quarter Pounders too big

867
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,740
He has little hands, John Claire

868
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,000
I have little hands

869
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,500
So I like the standard McDonald's cheeseburger

870
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,800
I like the Big Mac because that uses smaller patties

871
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,440
I like Junior Bacon

872
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,580
But Big Mac is tall

873
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,540
It's tall but it's mostly bread

874
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,240
It's got big mouth, small hands

875
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,780
Yeah

876
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,200
Exactly

877
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,060
It's more of the diameter of the burger

878
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:51,740
I don't like a super thick patty or a super big patty

879
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,880
But I guess if you only want the small

880
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,160
I don't want that much, you know

881
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,020
And I don't like to be wasteful

882
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:02,000
Quarter Pounder though tastes better than a regular McDonald's cheeseburger

883
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,820
I don't know if I agree with that

884
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,160
I can prove that with science, I think

885
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,040
My order my whole life has been just to plain hamburgers and not Quarter Pounders

886
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,260
Well that's, I can't even get started on that

887
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,280
That's wild to me

888
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,520
It's done me well since I was a five-year-old boy

889
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,980
Don't you take away my two hamburgers from me

890
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,980
Plain, did you say?

891
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,200
Just as they come

892
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,620
I don't say no topping

893
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,720
I know another, I believe a friend of the show, Danny Jelenek, that's his order as well

894
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,280
With precedent and I was like, you too, really?

895
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,500
Surely no one will discredit this opinion on a podcast

896
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,440
I can prove all of you wrong with science and I don't know how I'm going to do it yet but I will

897
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,240
I just want to declare here, Sector Cuper, you don't probably eat a lot of McDonald's

898
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,720
No

899
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
But when was the last time you had it?

900
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,740
Twenty years ago

901
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,300
Okay, what would you get then?

902
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,300
Big Mac, I'd just like a Big Mac

903
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:51,820
Okay

904
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,780
Yeah, or over twenty years

905
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:04,700
Yeah, I also, see I don't go terribly often anymore because when a place makes me feel not good I stop going there

906
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,100
Well if it ever happened to McDonald's

907
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,480
That makes me a real outlaw podcast

908
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,560
It's never happened to McDonald's for me

909
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,880
Actually yeah, I don't think it's ever happened with me either

910
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,360
Because the food is hydrolyzed

911
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,440
That's fucking nuts

912
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,020
Hydrolyzed?

913
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,340
Hydrolyzed

914
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,220
We got water in our burdens again

915
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,880
Well what it means is, because I know this because having a dog with a sensitive stomach

916
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:29,520
Hydrolyzed means that they break down what is the actual atoms of the food

917
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,140
So much so that there's no way your system can recognize it as bad

918
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,360
That's pissed, it makes me sick

919
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:37,640
What the fuck?

920
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,560
Mike fuck off, it made me sick

921
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,700
That's true, that is false

922
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,280
Well perhaps the lettuce

923
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,780
Don't tell me there's no way

924
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,560
Perhaps

925
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,260
Are you saying it didn't happen to me?

926
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,420
Are you saying I'm a liar?

927
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,740
You know what probably it is, they can't make like lettuce hydrolyzed

928
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,640
That doesn't come on a regular burger

929
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:51,940
True

930
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,520
Or onions

931
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,220
So fuck you

932
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,480
Hold on, fuck yous can wait a second

933
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,580
The onions perhaps could be cooked

934
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,960
And then I guess that maybe could get you sick

935
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,280
Well it's probably not impossible but

936
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:11,600
No one not only Scott, Scott might be the only crazy man who's ever felt sick due to me

937
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,420
Why do you stop going sector keeper?

938
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,880
They make the food so it stays good for like 40 years

939
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:25,760
I know for a fact my mom got sick but I think she was eating one of those like chicken burritos they used to sell

940
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,100
Well that's an experimental item

941
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,500
Yes of course, they haven't put that

942
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,040
Or sausage burrito, breakfast burrito or something

943
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,800
They haven't put that new crisper and re-engineered it

944
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,840
Yeah they haven't re-engineered the burrito yet because it's not a normal menu item

945
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,480
De-anomized it and put it back together

946
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,040
Jane what's your McDonald's?

947
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,080
Like a Willy Wonka candy

948
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,100
Exactly, what's your McDonald's?

949
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:46,700
I only eat there the McFlurries because I'm a vegetarian

950
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,440
Oh right of course

951
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,140
Their fries have like a meat base

952
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,040
Yes they are like beef

953
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,580
So I literally can't eat anything there at the moment except for McFlurries

954
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,480
So what did you all get at the Whopper bar?

955
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:06,660
Okay, well so I you know what I should have done was I should have asked for every topping

956
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:11,720
But I tried to construct something, I made the mistake trying to construct something I would enjoy

957
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:22,580
So I think I got the standard, like what I like on a Whopper, I do like their lettuce, ketchup mayo, pickles onions

958
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:28,420
And then I added onion rings, pepper jack cheese, I asked for pepper bacon

959
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,740
You reminded me that very quickly said we don't have that

960
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,280
So I just got regular bacon

961
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:39,340
And it I mean it looks sad like it really didn't have a lot of flavor

962
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,680
It's terrible

963
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:46,020
It looks like it's a bit of a bummer Jane was able to get an impossible Whopper

964
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,860
Looks even worse

965
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,540
Looks even worse but probably tasted better

966
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:55,380
I got very simple I just did like what lettuce mustard pickles

967
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,760
Like just very very simple

968
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,340
It was like fine

969
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,380
I don't think I got sick but it was like disappointing

970
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,820
I just like they don't even have an egg

971
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:12,000
Egg is such an easy like oh like your dad's gonna get impressed with an egg like oh that's special

972
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,540
Do you want to eat an egg from this place?

973
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,960
I didn't say I did I'm just saying in my wildest dreams of my imagination

974
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,200
A higher quality BK Whopper bar

975
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,320
Yes at least I'm saying that at least makes sense obviously I want some sort of real nonsense

976
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,140
You know I will say a few years ago I was like early for work

977
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,820
And I was like oh you know what I haven't had in a while

978
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,120
I was trying to buy a Burger King

979
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,200
I was like oh I should get Burger King breakfast

980
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,880
I should get a croissant which

981
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,340
Croissant which that word is not in the Bible

982
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,920
No it's not or the English language honestly

983
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:51,320
And I got that and hash browns and like a cup of coffee

984
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,820
And yeah I felt real bad for the rest of the day

985
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,640
I don't know it's dehydrogylated

986
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,380
I wish it was

987
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,040
No that's McDonald's

988
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,300
That's McDonald's that I know that about

989
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,380
I wish it was dehydrated

990
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,900
Oh another thing I did like though that isn't about the food

991
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,520
When you walked in they had like a row of the Burger King crowns like all ready to go

992
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,740
So you know I picked that shit up right away and put that on the table

993
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,860
Yes we got crowns we at least got crowns

994
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,580
Yes yeah you the crowns that's fun

995
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,360
It was really fun

996
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,320
We ate with the crowns on

997
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,940
Oh yeah we got them for you guys too

998
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,180
Uh huh I think I was wearing one

999
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,920
Be careful though heavy is the paper crown

1000
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,360
It's a lot of responsibility

1001
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:41,020
Now Scott you went over Jane reminded me you went over to Panda Express

1002
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:45,920
Yeah I added to I did not make my main meal Panda Express

1003
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,080
In a place that made me not feel so good so I don't really go there anymore

1004
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,840
Fucking loser

1005
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,000
Fucking loser

1006
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,200
I know

1007
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,720
The outlaw of the show

1008
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,920
But I just contributed a little

1009
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,860
I'm like well maybe if we do a little something there

1010
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,260
A little like just to add to the potluck

1011
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,720
So I got a dessert

1012
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,240
Oh yeah

1013
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,800
It's like an apple pie

1014
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,040
What a spring roll correct

1015
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,300
There were generally positive reviews for that correct

1016
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,340
We finished them

1017
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,960
We polished those apple pie things wrong

1018
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,920
We were like y'all done with these little treats

1019
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,220
And I was

1020
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:28,440
Yes and we were happy to get the Whopper Bar taste out of our mouths

1021
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,320
But they were surprisingly good

1022
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,200
I was like these are gonna taste like shit and they were good

1023
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,880
I remember biting into the stalest fortune cookie I've ever

1024
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,680
That is a Panda Express

1025
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,120
That is what you get from Panda Express

1026
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,380
I have never had a fresh fortune cookie from Panda Express

1027
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,360
What was your fortune?

1028
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,620
You will find new ways to say thank you this week

1029
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,900
Like thank you God I didn't get food poisoning

1030
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,640
Thank you thank you Mike and Jason for coming up with a structure for this series where we didn't all have to do everything

1031
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,760
Some stomachs could be predicted

1032
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,340
Can I throw in a little

1033
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:11,380
I found out a little bit of history to the BK Whopper Bar concept

1034
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,060
And I am happy to say we have a guy

1035
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,380
There is a guy

1036
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:20,080
The newest guy's name is Russ Klein

1037
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:27,120
Russ Klein was the Burger King's president of global marketing strategy and innovation

1038
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:32,320
And he is credited with shepherding the premise of the BK Whopper Bar

1039
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,420
The concept is like pimp my ride

1040
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:35,920
No!

1041
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:36,960
No!

1042
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,780
Not that!

1043
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,220
Not that!

1044
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,840
To take up your whopper, make it your own, put you in charge

1045
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:51,260
So much so that the company initially considered labeling the concept pimp your whopper

1046
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,180
Oh my gosh

1047
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:58,120
Then he said my guess is we are not going to use that language on our menu board

1048
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,640
Also because probably like Moe's I think they would have had a lawsuit on it

1049
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,960
Customizing, equaling, pimping

1050
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,760
But this guy is so proud of this crate that we are basically doing the pimp my ride of restaurants

1051
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,900
There is a big wall of text right as you walk up to Wood or two

1052
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:23,180
And this is, you know, it says Whopper Bar, world's first, Orlando 2009

1053
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,340
Wow, big day for Russ Klein

1054
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:29,020
And then a beautiful little poem

1055
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:33,980
It started as a spark, it spread into an inferno

1056
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,320
100% flame broiled beef topped with unique ingredients

1057
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:45,860
America's favorite burger with more than a million ways to have it your way

1058
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,900
That is an incorrect statement

1059
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,180
You read the list

1060
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:55,660
You would have to, I mean really you would have to get micro to get a million combos out of it

1061
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,020
There's probably like 12 things

1062
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,200
16 combos

1063
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:03,720
And there's some like pre-made, there's like the Angry Whopper or the Bacon Whopper

1064
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,760
And it's just usually whether there's bacon or jalapenos on it

1065
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,280
A million

1066
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,560
That's kind of it

1067
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,500
Do you want it with bacon?

1068
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,420
Do you want it with jalapenos?

1069
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,900
Do you want it wet and weeping?

1070
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,420
A million ways

1071
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:23,660
Anyway, this guy seems, I think this guy was trying to be like, you know, the rock star of fast food

1072
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:27,220
Even in talking about why they called it that, he's really proud of himself

1073
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:31,040
Even just the syntax, the idea of a concept called the Whopper Bar

1074
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,900
It's very contemporary, like sushi bars, juice bars, or pizzer bars

1075
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:41,080
You're right, that is, yes, contemporary 12 years before you said that

1076
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,040
Russ, Russ, breathe, sit down

1077
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,240
What's his name, Russ Klein?

1078
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,620
Russ Klein, yeah

1079
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:51,260
It's also more of like a curved counter, more than a bar

1080
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,840
It's not much of a bar

1081
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:58,020
They didn't make any changes to that counter to make it seem more like a bar at all

1082
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,960
That just looks like what counter was there before

1083
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:07,000
And then behind it, it says, by the menu board, your Whopper, your way

1084
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,860
But that's a normal Burger King

1085
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,120
Have it your way, right?

1086
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,900
Yeah, that's always, yes

1087
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,000
And really, can't you at any restaurant basically

1088
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,840
You can customize, yeah, you can just order it with whatever

1089
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,020
It's called ordering, yeah

1090
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,940
So Russ Klein invented ordering

1091
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,120
I have a question

1092
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:31,220
When did Pimp, this is after my time so I may be wrong

1093
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:34,180
When did Pimp My Ride go off the air?

1094
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:35,640
Good question

1095
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,880
That bar opened in 2009?

1096
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:40,660
Can I guess?

1097
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,600
I want to guess it was off 2011

1098
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,240
That's a good guess

1099
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:52,340
Oh wait, apparently, new episodes only produced from 2004 to 2007

1100
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:53,280
Oh shit

1101
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,760
So this was past the airing of the initial

1102
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,740
Scott, I'm seeing 2009, 2004 to 2009

1103
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:00,680
Where are you seeing it?

1104
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,760
Singing on IMDB

1105
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,280
I feel like there's been revivals

1106
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,440
But either way, we are

1107
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,120
The Christmas specials don't count

1108
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,720
I mean, we're close to the end of the ride

1109
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,420
We were at the end, right?

1110
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:12,940
Yeah

1111
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:15,100
Okay, so Russ, that wasn't maybe the most

1112
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,400
He was five years late on that

1113
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:17,920
Yeah

1114
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,400
Well, that might have been, you know, that was one of the first things that didn't go right for Russ Klein

1115
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,480
During his run, he did it

1116
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,520
He's responsible for the

1117
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,440
Do you remember the campaign Burger King Virgins?

1118
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:35,580
Where they would get somebody from like, you know, some far off end of the earth and have them try a Whopper for the first time

1119
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,880
This was criticized by a lot of groups who were like

1120
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,160
There's like food shortages in places.

1121
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:42,720
What do you

1122
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,440
And then other ads, I don't know what and why, but other ad campaigns were deemed racist

1123
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:47,760
Oh Jesus

1124
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,440
Slowly there was a franchisee rebellion

1125
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:56,650
Especially after a one dollar menu that he instituted that the franchisees couldn't make money on

1126
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,700
So they also accused him of moving

1127
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:04,440
Sixty five million dollars from race restaurant maintenance to ads

1128
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,300
So eventually the franchisees rebelled

1129
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,360
They said we want Russ Klein out and then he's like, actually, no, I was gonna go though

1130
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,340
I was gonna do it anyway

1131
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:19,620
And he's but this guy had like a close relationship with like ad age

1132
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,260
So he'd just go talk to ad age and they'd print whatever crap

1133
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:30,280
So he did like a like a I'm leaving statement kind of kind of reminiscent of like, you know, when Charlie Sheen was like blowing up to

1134
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,320
Two and a half men and all that tiger blood crap

1135
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,420
That's kind of what so he'd like Russ Klein's leaving.

1136
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:35,960
What's up?

1137
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,280
We reached out to him for a statement

1138
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,080
Here's what he said

1139
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:43,660
Simply sharpening the sword and the bigger the dragon waiting for me when I return the better

1140
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,320
That's all you need to know

1141
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,000
Print it positively

1142
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,120
Okay

1143
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:55,720
Wait, I'm positively our kit like initials that Russ Klein.

1144
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,420
Yeah, okay.

1145
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,320
Yeah

1146
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:58,860
Positively comma.

1147
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,120
Yeah, positively.

1148
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:00,660
Okay.

1149
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,780
Yeah, like that's the sign off.

1150
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,620
Okay, you know me.

1151
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,720
I don't need to say Russ Klein

1152
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,100
It's me.

1153
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,040
Okay, you're working ads, you know me.

1154
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:06,420
Okay

1155
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,740
The bigger the dragon weight so he describes like, you know

1156
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,600
I'm just pursuing my next challenge sharpening the sword the bigger the dragon waiting for me

1157
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:20,200
The dragon ended up being that he several years later became the CMO of our beats

1158
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,800
Dream big

1159
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:31,560
Immediately one of my favorite guys we got the Google image him and you will find pictures of him kissing Paris Hilton.

1160
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:32,420
Whoa

1161
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:36,060
See that we got the meat guy like we got the meats, right?

1162
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:36,940
Is that our PC?

1163
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,260
I don't know.

1164
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,620
I actually don't know does that stand for chief meat officer?

1165
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,060
I

1166
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:47,380
Mean Jason insisted that it did this is the CMO of podcast arrived marketing.

1167
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,240
I say me print it sharpen in the sword

1168
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,420
He got the meat

1169
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,400
Insane

1170
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,540
I didn't think a guy was waiting here behind the

1171
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,560
I looked up Russ Klein and I don't know that this is him

1172
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:04,520
But there's a website called lead with Russ with just like inspirational quotes on it

1173
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:07,700
I

1174
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,280
Said this guy I don't know.

1175
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,280
That's a different guy.

1176
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,020
All right.

1177
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,820
Well, I don't want to slander this guy this Russ Klein

1178
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,980
What's that oh, yes

1179
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,140
The slander really will come here.

1180
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:31,780
Yeah, and I think I think maybe it is time to get into this because here we are

1181
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,540
We have arrived at the tattoo parlor

1182
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,660
Heart and Huntington tattoo.

1183
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,000
Yes.

1184
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,820
Now I didn't know who was behind this.

1185
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,020
I've determined that it is

1186
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:43,980
Carrie Hart

1187
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,920
Pink's husband ex-husband ex-husband.

1188
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,540
Oh, thank you for staying up on that.

1189
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,420
Great the ex.

1190
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:49,660
Mr.

1191
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:50,360
Pink

1192
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,840
there are establishments of this tattoo brand in

1193
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:58,120
Vegas Nashville and Orlando the Vegas one the

1194
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,900
subject of a reality show called inked

1195
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:06,300
Orlando I think it's you know, well, we're the first really to do a little reality show there.

1196
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,200
That's yeah

1197
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:14,580
You know actually when we first told a friend of the show recent guest in the saga Eva Anderson

1198
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,320
That we're doing this she maybe this is just me

1199
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,240
She texted like a link to the tattoo place

1200
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,600
right said if you guys thought about what you're doing here this could get weird and

1201
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:28,080
I did think yeah, where is this gonna go?

1202
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,880
Right the three of us

1203
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:36,100
I don't think there was ever a point in time where any of us had any desire to get a tattoo for this stupid show

1204
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:42,340
I I can I I say considered but never like I'm do like it was just like I guess I could do it

1205
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:46,780
But like yeah, it wasn't like I wanted to do it if you had to what would you get?

1206
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,520
I would have probably gotten like the smallest thing and I'm trying to think of like

1207
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:54,620
the for comedy sake a benign mole for

1208
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:58,940
I

1209
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:04,660
Know what I've noticed I was like, yeah, should I get like a little like a little ninja turtle?

1210
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,100
That's kind of yeah

1211
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:14,600
Part of the figure that I've been poked and prodded a lot in the last year or so

1212
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,780
So I was like I do not want more needles by baby.

1213
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,040
Yeah, so I was like I

1214
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,520
Do not want to go to get like the smallest X-Men logo

1215
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:33,020
Your arm, I don't know where I was just like that's the only thing I've liked for the biggest time big X on his

1216
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:37,640
My biggest hurdle was Aaron and this has come up in the past

1217
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,840
There was a day there was like a funnier die day

1218
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:45,820
Everybody went to the beach and there was a brief discussion of because we're all wasted like maybe let's get tattoos

1219
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,860
And she was when I just told her I thought about it.

1220
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:50,120
She's like, why did you think about it?

1221
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,440
I do not did she does not want to look at some dumb tattoo on my body

1222
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,180
Do you feel that way about Jason or would you be willing to?

1223
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,260
Oh, I'd be down his choice.

1224
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,340
I want him inked up

1225
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:08,800
Not at the moment because he's experiencing a lot and I'm okay not something he needs to add to his list

1226
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,560
I agree with that

1227
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:13,360
But if he could like sort of magically all of a sudden have a bunch of ink would you prefer you think he should get?

1228
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,660
Some sleeve tattoos leave tab.

1229
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:16,560
That's pretty cool.

1230
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,200
Okay.

1231
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,360
Oh, yeah, I don't think you'll ever get one

1232
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,000
Like the undertaker it's never like the undertaker

1233
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,940
I'm not like I prefer them or anything, but like I wouldn't be pissed.

1234
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,440
I'd be like, all right shit.

1235
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:29,780
Cool

1236
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:31,120
I don't blame here

1237
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:38,580
I have no I don't want one either and I am glad that the group of us at funny or died didn't all get the tattoo that

1238
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,500
We thought about getting which was

1239
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:44,360
BTTF the letters of course for back to the future.

1240
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,220
Whoa

1241
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:52,000
I regret that that's cuter than a ninja turtle future that would have been much of us thought that Wow

1242
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,260
Damn, I really wish you guys had done

1243
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:00,260
Before the party bus got on the road party boss

1244
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:07,000
But I do I remember because a specific memory is friend of the show bug main buzz buzz

1245
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:12,380
Commandeering the speaker to put on surf city and then surfing down

1246
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:19,720
And by that point we're all like, all right, let's not come back that's the vibe but no no none of this

1247
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,820
I would've been so stupid

1248
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:26,920
I I think everybody who was in the first Avengers like the main cast of the first Avengers all have matching tattoos

1249
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,700
I believe of the Avengers a I'm not maybe I actually don't know what it is

1250
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,300
But I believe they all have like they all have they're on a text chain

1251
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,520
I know and they have like tattoos I believe

1252
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,060
Did the Lord of the Ring actors maybe that might be rings

1253
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:47,120
His rings, yeah, okay, like I've seen it like it's rings which he was using actors plural

1254
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,660
So I think in his mind he was thinking look at the ring.

1255
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:52,000
Let's ever say anything incorrect on this show

1256
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,120
Yeah, I can't imagine Lord of that Lord of the Ring the ring, you know

1257
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:04,540
Yeah, there is one wait there is one thing to rule them all but it's called Lord of the Rings

1258
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,460
What is that about?

1259
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,660
I'm not a big Lord of the Rings guy.

1260
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,300
So there's no other rings

1261
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,960
It's kind of it's like a sector stones thing

1262
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,460
Now I understand yeah franchise people know a little bit.

1263
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:16,760
Yeah.

1264
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,820
Yeah, um, I took it Tolkien took it from me

1265
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,180
So we have now eliminated the three of us as

1266
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:27,400
Getters of tattoos.

1267
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:27,900
Hmm.

1268
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,380
Perhaps you were wondering why is Jane on this particular episode?

1269
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:31,980
Well

1270
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,200
Voluntarily you threw it out there.

1271
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,400
I'm gonna fucking tattoo

1272
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:46,820
Well, may I give a little context here when I was younger like in my mid-20s so like two years ago

1273
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:59,480
Funny kind of moved your head a little when you said it

1274
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:03,460
I also whenever he laughs at something I said you get really excited cuz I love when I make it

1275
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,980
He's so funny when I make him laugh I feel like you looked a little mad at that one.

1276
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:08,880
Yeah

1277
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:15,900
So anyway, um, I kind of was going through a phase of rebellion in a way

1278
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:19,880
I had just done a few like pageants like and was just like having an

1279
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,320
Try not to say too many things

1280
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:26,420
But I kind of having an eating disorder and trying to figure out my life and I was like fuck this

1281
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,120
I'm getting a fucking tattoo

1282
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,620
But I was like I'll get it on the bottom of my foot cuz those go away fast

1283
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,020
So I went to a legitimate

1284
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,940
Like tattoo shop with a friend of mine and I got the eye of Horace

1285
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:45,140
Which is like the Egyptian eye that you see it's like a good luck been protection thing and I was like I'm gonna get it

1286
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,140
on my bottom of my big toe

1287
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:51,460
I'm gonna fucking bottom of my big toe and the guy at the shop was like

1288
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:58,420
Okay, this is gonna go away like two weeks and I was like, yes it is like I was so down

1289
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,680
Okay, like this is gonna be weird and difficult and I was like hell yeah, like I was just like on one

1290
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,120
So I was like fuck it.

1291
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,420
I'll get a fucking tattoo on the bottom of my foot

1292
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:12,000
Like it did in fact go away pretty quick

1293
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,620
Oh, yeah

1294
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:16,640
Because the skin on your feet is a lot thicker because you walk on it and you build

1295
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:22,740
Skin layers so for for it to you know, stay there it won't um

1296
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,140
But uh, yeah, so you saved us here

1297
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,280
The three of us not all like not looking at each other

1298
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:33,500
This is a game of chicken where we're all staring at the ground and right swoop in I will do this

1299
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,000
I will handle.

1300
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,560
Yeah, I got excited to the point where I started to really annoy.

1301
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,500
I became a

1302
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:43,700
Will say I became a brat about this like I became a little my little brat mode

1303
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:49,700
I was like, but I wanna he was like do you really think you should because I sweet in a sweet way

1304
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,500
Not because he thinks I shouldn't get a tattoo

1305
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,820
Well, no cuz and the tattoo artists eventually

1306
00:57:54,820 --> 00:58:01,200
Suggested this do I was concerned that like Orlando weather is kind of it might be uncomfortable

1307
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,500
It's gonna be uncomfortable walking around theme parks gonna be uncomfortable walking through airports

1308
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:12,460
And then for your job you drive a lot you lug, you know giant garment bags of clothes and I'm like

1309
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,340
It was really sweet.

1310
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,820
He's it was really sweet, but I was being a little shit.

1311
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:16,820
Sometimes I'm a little brat

1312
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:19,180
I'm like, you know, but I want to get one he's like

1313
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:24,620
You were also like what Jason wasn't taking into account were the sector keepers feelings

1314
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:29,500
Yeah, right the only one selfless enough to be thinking about what he needs which is for us to get a tattoo

1315
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:37,280
So Jason was wrong is what I'm saying as per you

1316
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:46,500
He was wrong but also he was fucking right, um, so that the the moment comes it all lines up to happen on the the

1317
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:51,740
Often mentioned throughout this series hell day the day where all the rides broke

1318
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:56,360
Well, it was been through it and we'll and we'll go through it again, but it is important context that this was

1319
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:01,700
During a day that was already maddening in its own way for ways that you'll find out actually

1320
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,700
Yeah later you go out you go off to do this

1321
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:09,300
We kind of like splinter up a little bit like you start dealing with this process.

1322
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,660
I like Jason with Mo's I try to find something

1323
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:18,820
Decent and bland and it's it's not important but it's but it's something that did not screw up my stomach

1324
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:23,660
Thank God because I needed it Mike had another plan Mike was like, well, this is a place

1325
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,520
We're not maybe gonna have time to have a sit-down meal at this place.

1326
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,080
So I better do this to go

1327
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,460
Would you like to say what you did?

1328
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:33,680
Well, yeah, I would I'm just trying to find the exact name of it because I wasn't sure

1329
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,600
Oh, do you want me to while you're kind of figuring?

1330
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:36,320
Yes

1331
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,740
Whatever you're gonna do do it

1332
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:43,480
Inch forward in this I guess in my head I was like I'll just go up there

1333
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:49,120
They'll do it quick and I'll be done like I don't know why I thought that would be the case and we go in

1334
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:53,520
There's like a little bit of a line and of course, I'm like, oh, I was a brat

1335
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,900
Like I'm just gonna click I was a brat that night.

1336
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,500
I will own up to it.

1337
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,780
I was like, oh the line is long

1338
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,120
so

1339
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,120
We looked around the store a little bit and whatnot

1340
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:08,400
This is kind of already where the the follies come in with Michael because

1341
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:14,340
The texts aren't coming while we're like waiting in the store from Michael who's eating

1342
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:20,400
Maybe ten feet away from where we were in the door inside this place and like he's huddled outside

1343
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,140
I was like, why is he texting you?

1344
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:29,020
Let's use went to do to go food from tooth some chocolate to some

1345
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:35,660
Which you have just said the meal the meal proper is maybe not so maybe

1346
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:38,620
You can't describe that as food

1347
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:45,200
It's a place where you're probably you're probably your best bet is to go and get some dessert to get some ice cream to get some

1348
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,140
Well, you know

1349
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:47,940
chocolates to go and the

1350
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:52,700
Atmosphere is a lot of what you're after but Mike says let's do this to go

1351
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:57,000
The ramp from the steampunk

1352
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,840
Environment and aesthetic so what I did is I wanted to make sure that we were covering all our bases cuz you know

1353
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,860
Restaurant is not just eating there.

1354
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:05,620
It's taking it home.

1355
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,080
Sometimes sometimes you don't have the option eat

1356
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,480
So I wanted to see what it would try things would travel.

1357
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,180
So I ordered

1358
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:13,740
flounder

1359
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,880
Almondine to go Almedin Almedin.

1360
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,560
Thank you, Jason.

1361
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,620
I don't I did not know what that word was

1362
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:29,660
And it came in, you know, whatever like sort of a to-go container and it came with green beans and it came with some potatoes

1363
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:33,740
And I want to show I'll show the sector keeper first picture of it

1364
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:44,820
He's a little horrified by it you you guys just you know, just the to-go flounder from a chocolate emporium

1365
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:47,820
It's like the top-down view of a trash can

1366
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:55,500
This is the top I think there's like some sort of shaved like isn't nuts on the top like Jason I don't know

1367
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:00,580
That's what it means, yeah, I

1368
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:02,400
Never put it together until right now.

1369
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,460
I also knew it wasn't pronounced that way then but I didn't want to tell you

1370
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,920
No, thank you.

1371
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,560
Cuz I see how many I miss I miss pronounced it that way

1372
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,500
Last time as well.

1373
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,800
I had I have only ever seen trout almondine it like a French

1374
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:18,900
You know cafe.

1375
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,800
I'm not a man of culture as you heard.

1376
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:22,700
I'm more of a quarterpano with cheese guy

1377
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:26,000
Okay, I don't have classy dishes like this toothsome meal

1378
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,080
So I ordered it to go but now you've lived it up now

1379
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:32,940
You know the great flounder that the folks over at toothsome cook up and yeah

1380
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:37,340
I just want the context of it while it a tattoo attempt is happening.

1381
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,000
You have a to-go content

1382
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,040
You're outside with a styrofoam container

1383
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:48,040
And you you also had an order of like potato croquettes with that yeah

1384
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,900
Yeah, that's what it was said potatoes because that I ended up eating a lot of that.

1385
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,040
Well, yes

1386
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,060
Tell us why Michael.

1387
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:56,280
Well, there's a couple reasons number one

1388
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,340
It was by far the worst meal I had had

1389
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,120
on either coast

1390
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,780
on either coast

1391
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:10,480
And you'll notice I've not been them I've probably been the most positive in general

1392
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:18,040
This was by far the worst meal it didn't it's not just that like oh it was only ten or so fifteen minutes

1393
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,080
From taking it and going and sitting down

1394
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:25,780
So it wasn't like it was two hours old or whatever and just the way it was cooked

1395
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:28,540
It's like burned part of it was like kind of burned

1396
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:32,140
Like half of it felt like it was burned and the other half was not

1397
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:36,680
I'm just almond slipper and almonds are just thrown all over and that's just like

1398
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:39,180
Kind of an unpleasant texture to add to it.

1399
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,860
Did your fork break my memory?

1400
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:41,540
Yes.

1401
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:42,540
I believe it did break

1402
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:44,780
That was sort of that one of the more minor things

1403
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:52,880
So I'm like strong I am struggling through this meal no joke like this is truly like

1404
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,200
Everything else that was just like bad to okay.

1405
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:55,800
Like I'm all right.

1406
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:56,040
That's fine

1407
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:01,400
But like this sucks this sucks really really bad and then if this is where you're go ahead with this

1408
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,900
There's a lot of chaos going on

1409
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:07,740
Currently, okay, let's hear some chaos then we'll come back to that.

1410
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,480
Okay now to chaos

1411
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,760
Okay, so you were gonna get very simple tattoo.

1412
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,400
I was gonna get a very simple tattoo.

1413
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,500
Just a couple letters.

1414
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,300
I was gonna get

1415
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,860
WS city walk saga

1416
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:32,920
Okay, no, I know I knew this already and I knew it because that plan had been put in motion and I was

1417
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,680
Me with like rewrite brain

1418
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:39,520
I'm getting text updates about everything and they're doing CWS and I was like, is that weird?

1419
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,660
Is that like too close to CVS is that straight?

1420
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:43,840
I'm gonna look like she has a tattoo of CVS.

1421
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,400
So then it changed so I'm sorry

1422
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,000
Why am I?

1423
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:49,520
My choice if I want CVS on the bottom my goddamn foot.

1424
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,240
I will get it.

1425
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,680
Thank you very much

1426
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,900
You have no control.

1427
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,080
I also it also occurred to me that if you

1428
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:02,800
Jason's girlfriend had a tattoo that kind of looked like CVS his favorite place to save four dollars weekly

1429
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:04,380
Suddenly

1430
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:13,140
Don't get me start the coupons a bit terrible geez, I'll thank God she didn't get I have also

1431
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,860
Become a CVS girly.

1432
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:16,600
Oh, okay.

1433
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:16,960
Okay.

1434
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,380
Oh cuz we well I don't say anything about where we live

1435
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:20,700
But there's one not far from us.

1436
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,560
Yeah, and so we go there fairly often don't out yourself.

1437
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,360
It's near a CVS

1438
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,680
Allow yourself

1439
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:38,760
So I would be more than happy to have you know, they have like order pickup now and I do that shit all the time

1440
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:41,480
You mean like they'll gather your items

1441
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,300
Yeah, like a target like a target.

1442
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:43,800
Yeah.

1443
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:46,120
Yeah, you just go in there behind the counter and go

1444
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,760
Hey, it's my number of my order in my name and I go here go.

1445
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,420
I'm telling you guys

1446
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:56,120
So you would happily a CVS tattoo would be good anyway, I'm there going like I don't and you're like, no, it's chip is sailed

1447
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:56,600
Whatever.

1448
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:01,500
It's that so like because you're now like you're in the throes now of trying to get this thing to happen

1449
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,800
So there's like a line and we finally get up to the front and I was like, hey

1450
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,580
I just want to get like really simple

1451
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:12,340
Tiny little letters on the bottom of my foot and you would have thought I asked tattoo my whole body right now

1452
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:14,480
Like they were like, oh

1453
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:16,500
That's a lot of work

1454
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:21,520
Well, I don't know cuz I don't know if anyone here will do the bottom of a foot cuz

1455
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,840
It's kind of sensitive and I was like, yeah

1456
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:29,500
I've got I literally have gotten one before and like my pain threshold for this shit is not a concern for me right now

1457
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:32,740
They're like, well, let me let me ask and she goes well, I can do it

1458
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:36,400
But I have to leave right now cuz my dog is sick and I was like

1459
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:39,520
Okay, first of all, I'm like I take care of your dog.

1460
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,940
Like I would also rather you take care of your dog

1461
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,600
but she's like so I

1462
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:48,130
Know but this guy might be able to do it but probably not to like 11 and I was like

1463
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:52,780
What and so then the guy comes over and this is where I'm starting to kind of get a little faith that this could

1464
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:55,860
Happen but at this point Jason's like, please just give up on this.

1465
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:56,540
I'm tired.

1466
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:57,720
This is such a bad idea

1467
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,660
And this is where I become such a little brat.

1468
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,060
No, I want this tattoo.

1469
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:03,710
So then the guy is like

1470
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,720
Look man, because I was like it can be shitty

1471
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:11,730
It's actually funny if it's like I put a lot of pride in my work and I just can't I

1472
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:17,350
Can't give you a shit like I don't want that to reflect on me and I was like is this guy for a mother

1473
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:19,110
I'm like, do you know where you are right now?

1474
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:22,330
Like and what the vibe is and so he's like so, um

1475
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:27,450
Yeah, you can maybe come back, but I don't know I have to think about doing a bottom of foot and I was like

1476
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:32,610
What the fuck and so we keep like kind of I keep kind of going like well

1477
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:36,610
Maybe we can try this and well, maybe we can try that and it's just like not happening

1478
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:40,870
And then he's getting bombarded with text from Mike who is like right outside and I'm like

1479
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,230
Why is he texting you so much?

1480
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:42,770
He's right

1481
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:44,970
I was eating I was eating too.

1482
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:45,870
He was eating.

1483
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:48,670
I didn't want to bring some flounder into the tattoo part

1484
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:52,170
Yeah, but also I did go in I did go in a second

1485
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:52,590
Really?

1486
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:58,710
I did come in and my memory of what happened was I went in because I saw some commotion happening

1487
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:02,290
I saw some sort of maybe gesturing or something going on

1488
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:05,730
So I'm like, oh what's going on so I go in there and I think what happened is Jane turned to me go

1489
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:07,750
They're not gonna do it

1490
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,310
They told me they're not gonna do it

1491
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:17,010
There might have been cursing I can't remember but I remember just you you telling me from across the way what was happening

1492
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:17,490
I don't know.

1493
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:19,030
Okay, and I ran back to my flounder

1494
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:24,770
I'm getting texts about all this and the text that I got you gave me this update

1495
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:29,530
You walked in and the gene yelled they said it cost four hundred dollars

1496
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:34,870
So we said fuck that yes, and I think you yelled that across in the store

1497
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:38,330
I think you yelled that because I wanted them to know I was being an asshole

1498
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:45,330
Fucking do it the estimate was between three hundred and four hundred dollars for three letters for three letters

1499
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:46,910
They're like it's on the bottom of the foot

1500
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:53,450
It's gonna be labor intensive three four hundred dollars and I was like, but then there was a moment that passed

1501
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:55,330
So Jason was kind of like you're so nice.

1502
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:57,830
I love you and you're like, you know what?

1503
01:08:58,090 --> 01:09:00,130
Maybe I'll just pay for it.

1504
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:01,950
Like you really want to do it.

1505
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:02,510
Well here.

1506
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:04,530
Here's my memory of it real quick

1507
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:07,470
I just remember going Jason was like, you know what?

1508
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:09,090
Let's do it.

1509
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:11,310
He kind of just said he said you know what?

1510
01:09:11,650 --> 01:09:12,110
Let's do it.

1511
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:12,970
I'm paying for it

1512
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:14,150
You are the very positive.

1513
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:17,270
He put it be like he he really like tried to get

1514
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:20,070
No, he's tried to I'm saying he was pure.

1515
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:21,970
He was intentions was pure pure.

1516
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:22,470
Yeah.

1517
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:23,450
Yeah, you wanted me to be happy

1518
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:25,970
No, I've been dealing with a lot of

1519
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:28,550
She was helping me out so much.

1520
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:30,990
I was like look, it's the least I can do

1521
01:09:30,990 --> 01:09:32,990
Yeah, and I have a big piece of fish in my mouth.

1522
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:33,690
I remember

1523
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:38,770
There was a break so you were in there for a while and there was a break you came back out because now the money

1524
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:42,810
Is like it's like all this is for a stupid bid and I was like don't you don't have to do with the sector

1525
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:43,730
Keeper will forgive us.

1526
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:44,710
I think so.

1527
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:49,510
So I'm eating and then that's when Jason said oh, yeah, like don't like let's do it

1528
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:50,470
Let's go for it.

1529
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:51,670
It's expensive, but whatever

1530
01:09:56,690 --> 01:10:01,530
Like I can't squeeze it in so now it looks like cuz I'm we're going back for the nap time

1531
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,210
Okay now it looks like it's gonna happen

1532
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:07,990
I think everything is going to go down and then correct me if I'm wrong from the text chain

1533
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:14,530
But I'm eating alone again all of a sudden I bite the side of my mouth so hard

1534
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:22,710
Brutally hard were almost like you feel your teeth meat in the skin like just like just so not just like I nicked it

1535
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:28,150
I hope I didn't cut myself but like a big bite out of the side of my mouth where you immediately know

1536
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:30,990
I drew blood there's no way I didn't draw blood

1537
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:32,310
Sure enough.

1538
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:39,770
I take one of the black cocktail napkins from to some and I put it in my mouth to take a look

1539
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:41,870
It's just it's it's red.

1540
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,790
We got blood immediately.

1541
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:44,950
Oh my god.

1542
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:45,770
I am bleeding

1543
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:51,490
I am bleeding from the mouth.

1544
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:53,090
I have a photo of it

1545
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:55,070
That's like a lot of what?

1546
01:10:55,450 --> 01:11:00,110
Yeah, and it's and this was immediate it's not one of those where you're like, oh, I think oh no

1547
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:01,130
I'm good, and then it kind of bleeds.

1548
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,990
No, no like immediately I go that's bad news

1549
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:06,770
So I am eating this terrible fish.

1550
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:08,730
There's tattoo chaos

1551
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:13,870
Exactly I'm eating Heathcliff skeleton fish and now

1552
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:16,070
Texted about blood at some point.

1553
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:16,370
I sure did.

1554
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:18,130
It's about blood in your mouth

1555
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:21,970
I just bit the side of my mouth has now cut to me.

1556
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:24,530
I'm getting texts about all this Jane's yelling about

1557
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:28,650
$400 they're yelling fuck in the store people are coming out from the back.

1558
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:31,050
Every update is making me feel more and more crazy

1559
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:37,110
I'm in such bad health at this point that I walk up to a bar to have a little bite and the bartender says

1560
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:40,790
Do you need some water not in like a you're at the restaurant?

1561
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:41,590
Let me give you some water

1562
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:43,070
He said it like concerned.

1563
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:44,330
Do you need help?

1564
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:44,750
Yes.

1565
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:47,670
Yes, that was exactly the line then I'm getting all these updates

1566
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:48,850
I'm like, wow, this is getting nuts.

1567
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:49,750
Then I get the text.

1568
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:52,450
I bit the side of my mouth and drew blood.

1569
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:53,470
I

1570
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:55,630
Started cackling like the Joker.

1571
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:57,310
I lost it

1572
01:11:57,310 --> 01:12:02,010
There's a lot I'll post pictures and video of me just like I just went red

1573
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:08,930
I'm weeping at this point from the madness the madness had fully taken me over two minutes prior

1574
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:13,390
I had texted Evan Susser and Van Roepen show and said we're all in very poor health

1575
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:17,350
Then you bit your mouth you drew blood I hurt my

1576
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:22,770
Self that day on almond dine

1577
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:28,990
That almond Dean and then then after this so now I have lost I have fully lost it.

1578
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:30,390
I am jokerfied

1579
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:33,370
I'm like I'm in a haze as I get up from this place

1580
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:39,810
The haze is broken when the same guy who asked if I was okay sprints back up to me and says I left my credit card

1581
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:49,210
We are all it is madness at this point that's where I'm at you're bleeding a lot more than I ever knew even from the

1582
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:49,810
Tech a lot.

1583
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:54,590
You have basically landed at there is not going to be a tattoo to get things a little wrapped up

1584
01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:58,070
We did end up purchasing something from the store.

1585
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:00,470
Yes, the tattoo did not end up working out

1586
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:04,510
Yes, they said no eventually they eventually after saying yes $400

1587
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:08,570
Then you went back in well, they said come back at like 11 and then we said no

1588
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:11,950
Right right, but they still were giving you a run around.

1589
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:14,850
Oh, yeah, and you went back in and I remember after I'm bleeding

1590
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:20,910
Seeing more gesturing going on I remember seeing more commotion happening, but at that point I said, I don't know

1591
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:21,690
I can't go in there.

1592
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:25,390
I'm bleeding because I said so what I said was like

1593
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:32,130
You're just incredulous I think no further questions

1594
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:37,050
Such a keeper a point there was a point when we talked about you headed down with us

1595
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:38,930
And I think you're probably at this point very jealous.

1596
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:39,930
You didn't get to go

1597
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:47,230
At some point I went back out and joined Mike and he's like you want some potato

1598
01:13:47,230 --> 01:13:50,730
And then said do any that one I might have gotten blood

1599
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:54,030
This guy does not care.

1600
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,750
He finished most of my meal

1601
01:13:57,770 --> 01:13:59,650
Croquettes because I was just like so

1602
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:06,590
Stressed and I walked up when I joined the scene finally you'd also gotten a big crazy milkshake

1603
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:08,630
Oh, I didn't I didn't forget gum and at it.

1604
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:10,170
You're like with his straw.

1605
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:11,670
I think am I wrong.

1606
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:12,870
You're just using Mike

1607
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:15,410
I think I finished his milkshake.

1608
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:18,350
No, you didn't use the straw because he said I used the straw

1609
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:20,510
And didn't you maybe I was just drinking there

1610
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:26,970
I believe I have videotape of you using the straw so we did go back into the Jason drank my blood

1611
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:31,250
Drank we will all live forever like the sector key.

1612
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:34,590
Yeah, Jason and I are blood brothers, but he we didn't put blood together

1613
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:35,830
He drank my blood.

1614
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:38,250
Yeah, I drink your blood milkshake.

1615
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:38,690
I drink

1616
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:42,010
That's a good reference I

1617
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:48,170
Said like hey, let's not go home empty-handed.

1618
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:49,950
Let's get some t-shirts.

1619
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:51,310
So we did

1620
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:51,590
Oh

1621
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:57,170
Yeah, they did

1622
01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:00,350
So we each got t-shirts Wow

1623
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:06,870
And then the last little button of the night was we took them out to the cash register and they said those magical words

1624
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:09,270
That'll be 72 42

1625
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:16,490
Like a thin crop women's t-shirt this should not be that much

1626
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:18,330
I don't know

1627
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:22,890
The back is cooler it's got the logo on the back

1628
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:25,810
Yours looks like it's from a tattoo shop.

1629
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:26,170
Yeah.

1630
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:28,990
Yeah looks like it's like from a hill like

1631
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:34,130
He looks like he works at a Hawaiian barbecue restaurant like Bahama

1632
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:39,030
I prefer the print on the front all of them had it on the back

1633
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:41,350
So this one I settled for cuz I like the colors

1634
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:43,950
inked and oiled since

1635
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:50,450
2000 wait Jason's wearing a shirt that says he's inked and oiled Jason inked and oiled

1636
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:55,770
Jason paid $30 or more for a shirt

1637
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:04,910
Similar to a few city walk locations the bill comes to and it's like I'm sorry

1638
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:06,210
How much did you say?

1639
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:08,650
Like fucking fuck it.

1640
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:10,010
I want to go to bed.

1641
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:11,170
Here is my visa

1642
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:16,910
Became bed I know we went to Mose that's when we went to Mose after

1643
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:23,890
Yeah, that's when I got my

1644
01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:28,330
Beans and meat like just standard you know how late it was

1645
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:31,830
I need to put something in my system besides bloody croquettes

1646
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:38,490
Jane by stepping in front of this bullet taking more of a bullet than we realize.

1647
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:39,190
Yeah, thank you

1648
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:42,590

1649
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:48,350
So let me say Jane Claire you survived podcast the ride with a city walker land a saga multiverse of madness

1650
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:50,650
There's a plug portal anything you'd like to plug

1651

And yeah, so I'm kind of that's where I'm at right now and

1654
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:15,830
Shoot me a message if you have an event or or if you're an expert at tattooing the bottom of a foot

1655
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:21,690
Oh my god, if you will tattoo you guys there was like half of me that was like do I go get one here?

1656
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:23,410
Just as a fucking bit and go

1657
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:29,050
But then I was like this week was kind of crazy so I got it but I I did have the thought

1658
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:33,630
Oh wait, look and I'm seeing I'm seeing the sector stone here it comes it's whoa

1659
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:36,490
Wow, it's it's a little it must be kind of for Jane.

1660
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:40,830
It's a little it's a little tiara that says bathroom girly leader

1661
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:46,220
It's a little paper tiara for the BK walker

1662
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:52,530
That's right, then if you look closely engraved in it

1663
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:53,650
RK

1664
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:54,470
RK

1665
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:55,390
A

1666
01:17:55,390 --> 01:18:02,970
inventor of the concept so it's a pretty funny story, right like I know we didn't end up getting a tattoo but like it's

1667
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:04,250
That's fine though.

1668
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:05,130
Like ultimately it's

1669
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:08,450
T-shirts boys boys Jane.

1670
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:09,770
It's not fine

1671
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:18,090
All we had to do is talk about the place it doesn't matter if we didn't get the ink does it no the the ink was

1672
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:20,250
Crucial you had to get it

1673
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:26,870
$72 worth of clothing

1674
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:34,230
From H&H, but you are headed to a new land a good place

1675
01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:35,690

1676
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:39,930
Welcome to the land of fallen brothers and never built

1677
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:48,570
Gosh, oh god, I don't know what I don't like the sound of that something's happening to him.

1678
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:49,970
He's getting jokerfied

1679
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:53,810
Are you gonna be there you'll be there, right?

1680
01:18:55,690 --> 01:19:01,970
That's a little mysterious I don't like the sound of that wait a minute and I can see I see the path forming that's right

1681
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:03,410
Where is it gonna take us?

1682
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:07,710
It looks like it's heading behind a wall behind a paywall

1683
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:16,090
Terrible for everybody

1684
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:23,190
Are gonna have to go through the point hole to get over the paywall in order to hear tomorrow's episode

Dollars, that's right.

1687
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:32,270
Oh, wow.

1688
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:34,110
Oh, it's starting to seal up.

1689
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:35,070
