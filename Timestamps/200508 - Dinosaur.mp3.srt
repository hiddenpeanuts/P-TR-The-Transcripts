1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,280
Warning, the following podcast contains possibly outdated information about public health, condiment

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:16,720
pipes, two of the most popular characters in fiction, Aladar and Kron, and a robust discussion

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,000
about the animal kingdom ride, Dinosaur.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,480
Get to your time rover.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,680
It's podcast, The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,680
Welcome to podcast, The Ride, a theme park podcast that specialty is not time traveling,

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,840
but time wasting.

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,000
My name is Mike Carlson.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,760
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,160
Yeah, I'd say that's accurate.

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,440
Scott Gerdner also joining us as always.

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,440
Yeah, sometimes I feel like we've traveled several years in time and it's just been several

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
hours.

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,440
Exactly.

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,600
That's the magic of this podcast.

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,240
You don't know where the time went.

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,200
I also think, you know, also not knowing what time it is.

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,240
I don't know if people are hearing this still in COVID lockdown times, but ever without

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,800
I feel like some of these episodes are taking, you know, several months to get through.

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,480
Yeah, you're saying.

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,960
Depending on the listener, if you used to like have a 45 minute commute somewhere and

24
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,680
that's how you observed the episodes and you don't have that anymore, then yeah, you could

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,080
still you might be back on like a February episode, many, you know, in June.

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
Right.

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,320
It's like five minutes a day now is really all the time you have to yourself to listen

28
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
to podcasts.

29
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,960
Whereas before, yes, you could like rip through three podcasts in a day.

30
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,400
Yeah, yeah, pretty much.

31
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
So I don't.

32
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,120
Yeah. And if, you know, if people are too nervous to go on walks or whatever, then you

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,120
really aren't absorbing it.

34
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,880
So if you're if the only way you have to listen to it is like moving from the kitchen to

35
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,800
the bathroom, then, you know, just start doing it way more often because we need you to

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
get through these.

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,760
Should we get I mean, but should we maybe just make the episodes all 15 minutes long,

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,560
like rip right through it, be like, OK, this is about dinosaur.

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,640
It's a rocky ride vehicle.

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,400
I like it, but it's scary.

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,680
Jason, what do you think?

42
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,680
Wrapping up.

43
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,360
Great. Great to see Dr.

44
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,920
Seeker and Dr.

45
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
The other one.

46
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,200
OK, Scott, final thoughts.

47
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,440
Yeah, you know, Gwana Don's, you know, it's nice to rescue him, but that that

48
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,080
sort of super scary.

49
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,840
But at the end of the day, it's a lot of fun.

50
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,400
OK, well, you've survived the podcast, right?

51
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,160
And that's like that's about all the people have time for, honestly.

52
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,520
That's what we it's what we have to do.

53
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,600
But hey, come on, man.

54
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,880
You are we are you saying we're not going to take time to talk about Dr.

55
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,600
Seeker? Oh, man, maybe if I really think about it, I guess we have to talk about Dr.

56
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,320
Seeker for over 90 minutes.

57
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,720
We got to talk to Dr.

58
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,000
Seeker. Some people are still taking walks, doing that wonderful activity of jumping

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,280
into the street when some lunatic is not leaving your room on the sidewalk.

60
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,320
Well, especially if it's a jogger, the jogger, they've I've seen, you know, we've

61
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,600
all seen the articles about where the jogger leaves like a trail of germs in their

62
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,680
wake. Yeah, I saw someone posting from France where the mayor of Paris was like,

63
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,120
please stop jogging.

64
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,240
That has not really happened in Los Angeles, although been kind of gloomy here anyway,

65
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,480
so kind of scaring people inside, even besides the quarantine.

66
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,200
Is the way you leave it, you leave a trail of like ribbons of germs behind.

67
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,760
You're exhaling more.

68
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,320
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,520
You're going so fast. It's like kind of like you're almost like crop dusting with germs

70
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,040
because you're going so fast.

71
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,960
Like if you were just like walking at a normal pace and you like exhaled, it would sort

72
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,880
of like linger in the air a little bit and it would fall.

73
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,800
But since you're jogging, it's like you're it's like a water, an air and water show

74
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,120
with like X, like the fumes from a plane as you're like streaming down a sidewalk.

75
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,280
It's like going everywhere.

76
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,400
Again, supposedly. Jesus.

77
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,040
Every day is a new thing to make us paranoid.

78
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,080
I don't want this to be too much focused on what's going on right now.

79
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,280
We need to talk about dinosaur.

80
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,960
But I did finally see an article just now that said we don't have to, you know, pour

81
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,960
bleach all over our groceries and not like another definitive article, because that was

82
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,680
another concern we've all had is like how much we need to disinfect our groceries when

83
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,160
they come inside. So.

84
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,680
Well, yeah, that was my favorite era of it when people saw one video with one doctor

85
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,840
who told us that we need to like scrub each carrot.

86
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,240
We have to do like an hour long massage.

87
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,400
We have to do a bath bomb for every carrot.

88
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,520
And then everyone took that as as the Bible because he is a doctor after all.

89
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,040
So that was that was a fun couple of days living in carrot bath paranoia.

90
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,960
But like people need to remember, like Dr.

91
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,720
Drew is technically a doctor and he was saying this was no big deal for about three

92
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,960
months prior. So just just take everything with a grain of salt is what I'm saying.

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,880
Yeah, trust Dr. Oz, not Dr.

94
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,760
Drew. No, no, Dr.

95
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,440
Oz was saying it wasn't a big deal either.

96
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,080
Dr. Phil, Dr. Oz, Dr.

97
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,800
Feelgood. Those are the doctors to trust.

98
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,640
Well, we all like Dr. Feelgood.

99
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,200
We all like Dr. Feelgood.

100
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,920
Did they never steered us wrong?

101
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,040
Did they fully did they debunk the ibuprofen thing, too?

102
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,440
Wasn't that like one? Yes.

103
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,840
Yes. One French one French dipshit.

104
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,440
Like God, everyone was scared of ibuprofen.

105
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,160
I believe I believe the headline was French dipshit gets it wrong.

106
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,360
I think that's what I read.

107
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,400
But I repeat myself, right?

108
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,600
Was that a French accent?

109
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,200
I can't hear it very well over the zoom.

110
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,400
So no, no, that was just like a kind of accent.

111
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,880
OK, yeah, you were like like an upper crust voice you were doing.

112
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,640
Yeah, or like an exhausted kind of voice.

113
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,000
I see. Yeah.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,920
OK, so anyway, you know, Dr.

115
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,560
Dr. Dre says just chill till the next episode.

116
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,680
And maybe that's the best doctor advice that you can take.

117
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,440
Yeah, I'm into that.

118
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,880
Yeah, it's just all chill to the next episode of life.

119
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,920
Yeah, I think he's right on about this.

120
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,040
Yeah. And obviously, I'm getting high as fuck every day of this thing.

121
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,360
Yeah, me too.

122
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,040
And what I mean by that is I have a white claw and a kombucha.

123
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,480
That's what I that's my that's my drug of choice.

124
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,600
Yeah. Two sugar drinks.

125
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,000
So much is different for me since the quarantine.

126
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,080
I don't know who you are anymore.

127
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,800
Yeah, I'm way different now.

128
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,560
I'll be changed.

129
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,160
Everyone will notice a change when they actually see me in person.

130
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,280
So anyway, I guess we should talk about dinosaur.

131
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,960
I guess we should.

132
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,320
There. Yeah, it's the ride that answers the question.

133
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,200
What if the Indiana Jones ride was unpleasant?

134
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,760
Yes, that is what it that's that is basically the mission statement for this ride.

135
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,560
It's interesting with dinosaur because let me let me back up.

136
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,400
Scott, did you go on dinosaur this when we were there?

137
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,600
I forget. Do we go on together or no?

138
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,480
No, I didn't end up doing it.

139
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,720
It was like I think I'm going to be facing the choice between

140
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,120
a fast pass for dinosaur and a nap.

141
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,280
And I think I chose a nap. OK.

142
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,240
That was our most exhausted day, if you'll recall.

143
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,120
And it was pretty good to me.

144
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,400
We got up. We went to Pandora early.

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,840
And then we did Everest.

146
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,040
I got you fast passes for the Kilimanjaro Safari.

147
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,920
You ran. Yes, you ran.

148
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,960
You ran a little scheme there. Appreciate it.

149
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,480
Tiffins. We were at Lindsay and I ate at Tiffins.

150
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,400
So, yeah, dinosaur dinosaur.

151
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,520
I have a like a complicated relationship with because like a lot of

152
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,360
and I'll say kids, but I really mean like, you know, 14 year olds.

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,680
I got really scared on it when I went on it the first time.

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,040
And I haven't completely gotten over it.

155
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,160
The trauma is still kind of there.

156
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,520
There's other rides that obviously I was scared on the dark rides.

157
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,920
I've kind of gotten over all that stuff.

158
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:44,760
But there is something about dinosaur that I'm still a little skittish about.

159
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,080
And I can't tell if it's just deep seeded childhood trauma.

160
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,760
And when I say childhood, I mean tween or teen trauma.

161
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,280
Or it is, as you describe it, deeply unpleasant.

162
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,560
Well, Mike, isn't there a photo of you from a trip in the last five years

163
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,200
where you look upset on this ride?

164
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,880
Am I remembering that correctly?

165
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,120
Well, I think I told the story on the show.

166
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,360
I had gone with a couple of friends to Orlando a year prior,

167
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,120
the prior year that we went.

168
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,240
And I went on dinosaur then.

169
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,280
And I was like, look, it's a ride.

170
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,960
You're an adult man.

171
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,640
You have a theme park podcast.

172
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,200
You're a theme park journalist.

173
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,400
You need to keep your eye.

174
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Don't be scared of this.

175
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,080
You're an idiot if you think you're scared of this.

176
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,120
It's not it's it. First of all, it's a Disney ride.

177
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,840
Nothing's going to happen. You like haunts now.

178
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,560
You're a different man. You're a new man.

179
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,240
Everything's going to be fine.

180
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
So you went in dinosaur.

181
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,720
I kept my eyes open the whole time.

182
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,840
I was like, you know what? This is fine.

183
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,080
This is a ride.

184
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,080
I can enjoy it like any other ride.

185
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,200
And then when the picture opportunity happened, when the photo spot happened,

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,680
I think it's when the carna tour.

187
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,400
Is that what is it? Carnotaurus?

188
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,240
Carnotaurus. Carnotaurus.

189
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,280
Yes, I wrote that down phonetically.

190
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,120
I'm going to apologize because I will probably mispronounce some dinosaur names.

191
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,760
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I will.

192
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,360
I will for sure as well.

193
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,520
Tyrannosaurus. That's how you say it. Right. Yeah.

194
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,800
Nailed it.

195
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,200
And when the picture opportunity happened, apparently,

196
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,720
and I didn't even realize it, I turned away.

197
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,920
I turned away like I was scared.

198
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,000
So I thought I was being brave, but the picture said otherwise.

199
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,680
Well, but it is a scare at the end, right?

200
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,120
It's the it's the picture happens when the carnitourist is like right above you.

201
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,920
I believe it's right before that. OK.

202
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,200
I believe it's right before that.

203
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,960
But still, I humiliating myself again on this ride in my 30s.

204
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,960
I felt I had done a good, very good job of being comfortable on it.

205
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,400
But there there the proof was that there's still something

206
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,520
that's bothering me about the ride.

207
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,040
So I don't know.

208
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,320
You might just have like you might just have resting frightened face

209
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,920
because when we all went on the Knott's rapid ride together,

210
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,760
I was taking video of it in every frame that I saw.

211
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,400
You did you? I guess you didn't look terrified.

212
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,720
You just looked like actually you looked like you smelled something horrible.

213
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,320
It's right. Like every single frame where you were on camera.

214
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,440
So that just might.

215
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,520
And I know you weren't scared of the rapids ride.

216
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,680
I do know that's the rapids ride.

217
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,760
No. Yes. Yeah.

218
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,040
I that communicated to me.

219
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,680
But that just might be how you look on rides.

220
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,800
I don't know. You're you're a little squinty or a little like, you know.

221
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,440
Look, thank you for saying that because you're trying to get me off the hook here,

222
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,640
because I do grimace a lot.

223
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,800
I think I have like resting grimace face.

224
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,000
That's a good word. Rest in grimace.

225
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,480
Not not McDonald Land grimace, just a normal grimace.

226
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,520
But I have resting McDonald Land grimace.

227
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,320
I have resting like I got to get a shake.

228
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,680
Thank you, Jason. Thank you for making that joke.

229
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,000
So no one else had to, you know.

230
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,040
I feel better if I make it.

231
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,840
Yeah, yeah. Get ahead of it.

232
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,080
Yeah. Shows you have a sense of humor.

233
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,720
Sure. We can all laugh together.

234
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,800
We can all we're having a lot of fun.

235
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,840
Uh, so, yes, I was going to say thank you, Scott, for saying that.

236
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,520
But if you look at this picture, the picture,

237
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,640
I don't even have like a grimace on my face.

238
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,400
I have my head is turned away.

239
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:21,280
I am physically like recoiling from whatever robot is like coming out at me.

240
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,440
Do you have the can you remind us of what this photo looks like?

241
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,360
I don't have I have it.

242
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,440
Let me OK, I'll find it while we're talking here.

243
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,080
I think that'll take a minute.

244
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,880
I apologize. Posted it to the Twitter.

245
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,160
If somebody else wants to give their feeling about when they first went on

246
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,560
dinosaur countdown to extinction.

247
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,440
Yeah. Well, maybe maybe we should do the little

248
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,320
the the cliff notes of what it is for anybody who doesn't know off hand.

249
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,640
We haven't been animal king.

250
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,480
So it's it's it's in Disney's animal kingdom in Florida.

251
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,360
It is an opening day attraction.

252
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:56,120
It uses the same very similar ride vehicle and mechanism to the Indiana Jones

253
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:02,480
adventure, that being sort of the the simulator on a moving track, essentially.

254
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,840
Like it's you're you're on wheels, but it's simulating a little bit more

255
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,960
movement, and I think it may even be the same literal track layout.

256
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,080
It is of the Indiana Jones adventure. Yeah.

257
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,600
OK, yeah, it's the same.

258
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,280
The term is enhanced motion vehicles, which Imagineering developed

259
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:25,240
and was used for Indiana Jones in Anaheim, Indiana Jones at Disney, see dinosaur.

260
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,680
And. That's it.

261
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,320
It weird.

262
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,520
Well, it must be expensive as hell, but or else they would have done it more.

263
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,440
It's like such a like revelatory, amazing type of ride vehicle,

264
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,360
but it's got to be super cost prohibitive.

265
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,320
Yeah, I believe the estimated cost for this ride is

266
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,080
is it between 40 and 60 million?

267
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,680
I had it somewhere in my notes.

268
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,440
Yeah, I think I saw that number that was similar to that.

269
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,280
Yeah, I mean, it is very expensive,

270
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,480
but it was put in this it was done here for cost reasons to save money.

271
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,960
Yeah. By repeating the same track, basic track layout and ride vehicle.

272
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,320
It seems like.

273
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,600
I guess to use the same blueprints.

274
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah, has got to save him something.

275
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,360
The the apocryphal story is that as they were building Animal Kingdom,

276
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:26,640
they discovered that taking care of this many wild animals is expensive.

277
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,760
So they needed to cut costs.

278
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,040
And at some point, it came down between Dino Land USA

279
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,600
and Beasley Kingdom and Dino Land USA.

280
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,040
Those those imagineering those imagineers more willing to

281
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,880
cut costs and merge to attractions and and kind of skimp and save a little.

282
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,000
And a lot of the Beasley Kingdom imagineers

283
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,680
went on to move, shift over to Universal

284
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,960
and put a lot of their mythical ideas into the lost continent.

285
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,720
Yeah, there's a good there's a YouTube video.

286
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,320
I think it's theme park history that I watched.

287
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Did you watch that too, Jason?

288
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,120
I watched that. Yeah, that video is great.

289
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,760
They had a really thorough examination of the ride and the many changes of the ride.

290
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,960
He yes, he posits that the Dino Land USA people were more willing to compromise

291
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,760
than the Beasley Kingdom people.

292
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,120
There was going to be two rides.

293
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,960
There were going to be two dinosaur rides,

294
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,880
and they were willing to combine them into one ride.

295
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,040
And basically just use the same Indiana Jones track layout and vehicle.

296
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,320
So they got their stuff built.

297
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,720
They won. And Jurassic Park also was a big part of why Dino Land won,

298
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,280
because, you know, dinosaurs were all the rage.

299
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,160
Jurassic Park and also at the time,

300
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,600
Disney had entered into a 10 year partnership with McDonald's.

301
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,440
And when Dino Land USA first opened, the McDonald's logo

302
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:00,400
and references were just fucking everywhere in this part of the park.

303
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,360
Yeah. So yeah, even in the line for this ride, there are red,

304
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:14,160
yellow and white pipes that are supposedly meant to remind you of ketchup,

305
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,040
mustard and mayonnaise.

306
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,480
They have a chemical formula for each item on it.

307
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,560
Whoa. Yeah.

308
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,040
Even even further than I thought. Wow. Yeah.

309
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,440
Yes. I don't I don't know the logic behind that.

310
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,680
I don't know why in like a museum or like whatever.

311
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,040
I guess we're in a museum sort of in an institute.

312
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,080
There would be a need for pipes that shot ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise.

313
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,760
But there are.

314
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,800
I think museum workers are loving it.

315
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,840
Ba ba ba ba ba. You know, they got to eat.

316
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,320
They need a quick lunch.

317
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,360
They need a quick, reliable lunch like anyone.

318
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:57,160
Yeah. I have you look, Jason, have you looked into installing these type of pipes?

319
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,760
Like what would the with the city of Los Angeles be willing to?

320
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,960
You know, three different colored pipes in, you know, I would love it.

321
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,360
But yeah, the contractors, it's such a pain in the ass.

322
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,520
Find it a good contractor in Los Angeles.

323
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,680
You don't want to skimp on a task rabbit sort of thing for ketchup,

324
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,920
mustard, mayo pipes. Yeah.

325
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,120
You want a real pro.

326
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,920
If any of the listeners have recommendations for a plumber

327
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,480
that can install ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise pipes, let us know.

328
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,560
Yeah, because, you know, we I would be honestly, I'd be interested in it, too,

329
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,360
because who doesn't like those three condiments?

330
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,520
I know some people don't like mayonnaise, but I think that's crazy.

331
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,400
Many times, I think the question is, do you have that installed

332
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,440
just next to a water faucet?

333
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,200
Is it is it a kitchen thing or do you

334
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,600
is it is it a shower thing?

335
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,040
Do you want to get bathed in these items? Huh?

336
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,240
Well, I mean, at least if you put it in the shower,

337
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,360
that gives you the option to be bathed in ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise.

338
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,400
So it's always nice to have the option.

339
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,520
Obviously, you can take a hot dog into the shower with you.

340
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,480
But yeah, you can't you can't have a bath in the sink if you do it there.

341
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,920
So I would I would advocate you put it by the shower, at least in or in the shower.

342
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:15,960
Yeah.

343
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,640
It running through pipes also implies that you have the option

344
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,320
of hot and cold running mayonnaise.

345
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,000
Oh, that's interesting.

346
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,120
You can you can really warm it up if you want.

347
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,720
You can get blasted every morning with gallons of hot mayonnaise.

348
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,960
Jason, Jason, the mayonnaise bill is through the roof this month.

349
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,640
Oh, come on.

350
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,000
You've got to cut down on it.

351
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,520
It was cold this month.

352
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,360
The you're running through hot mayonnaise heaters.

353
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,400
You're the there.

354
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,000
The repairman has been out to fix the hot mayonnaise heater three times this month.

355
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,840
Well, he should have done a better job fixing it the first time.

356
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,880
I'm like I'm like a like a rolling pin wielding wife in this scenario.

357
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,960
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

358
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,480
What are you doing, Jason?

359
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,640
The economy's hard right now, and we're going to hand all our money

360
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,440
over to the DWKM.

361
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,400
M.P.

362
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,080
Jason, real quick, what is your mayonnaise brand?

363
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,880
It's back east.

364
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,560
It's called Hellman's and on the West Coast, it's called Best Foods.

365
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,520
It's one of those Mississippi, the Mississippi dividing lines once.

366
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,120
You mean you mean basic, basic is what you're saying.

367
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,800
Basic mayonnaise. Yeah.

368
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,120
OK, I don't I don't actually don't have any mayonnaise in the apartment,

369
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,840
but I do like mayonnaise. Yeah.

370
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,480
I have OK, so I have sent the photo to you of me cowering next to a child,

371
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,320
by the way, who is looking at the dinosaur.

372
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,520
I am not I am my head is down to the left.

373
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,120
And I am like cringing.

374
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,880
It's one of the most humiliating photos of my adult life.

375
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,320
You're trying to like turtle into yourself.

376
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,520
You're trying to shrink down.

377
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,160
I don't I also don't have a memory of doing this.

378
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:23,200
I I have a memory of of being on the ride and everything going well.

379
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,400
And I enjoying the ride for the most part.

380
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,760
And then I see this photo.

381
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,520
And apparently that was all just a fantasy I made up in my head.

382
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,960
I must have like blacked out during the ride and had a dream

383
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,720
that I comfortably went on dinosaur and enjoyed it.

384
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,320
But I really look like this most of the time.

385
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,040
You were smiling with a pipe in hand.

386
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,400
You were like a little golf clap.

387
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,240
Good show, Carnotaurus.

388
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,320
Yes. Like just like chuckling.

389
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,640
Ah, look at that. A pterodactyl.

390
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,720
Ah, very enjoyable.

391
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,320
Perhaps the children on board might be frightened,

392
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,640
but I, an adult, educated man, am perfectly fine.

393
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,880
The children. Yeah.

394
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,360
The children on board all seem a little surprised, but also delighted.

395
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,280
Your friend, Luke, sitting next to you is overjoyed at this.

396
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,280
Of course, everyone is.

397
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,920
I would like to point your attention to to the family right behind you

398
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,720
appears to have custom Mickey avatar shirts on.

399
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,600
Oh, that's a mom and dad.

400
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,640
A mom and dad look like Navi, but also has some Mickey ears in there.

401
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,120
Very fun.

402
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,160
And then like there's a kid in the front row, a little kid in the front row,

403
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,920
and his mom is pointing out like, look at that.

404
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,200
And he's like looking at it. He doesn't seem scared.

405
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,600
She's just trying to be like, look at that. Isn't that cool?

406
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,280
Meanwhile, there's only one asshole in the car who's looking away in terror.

407
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,800
Yeah. And if any of them bought this photo, they've made fun of you ever since.

408
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,640
This is if OK, if they all have like photo pass

409
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,120
and have the photo, this is a photo they will make jokes about me for generations.

410
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,600
This will get passed down in the family.

411
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,920
And let's be like, remember that wonderful trip we took to Walt Disney World?

412
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:13,440
And remember that adult man who couldn't handle a robot dinosaur that was 20 feet away?

413
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,800
Like this is someday the little boy in the front will be telling his little boy,

414
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,560
I want you to be strong and brave and nothing like this pink hoodie guy

415
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,640
from our 2018 trip to Disney World.

416
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,200
Look at him. He's in his mid 30s.

417
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,920
We can tell how old he is just because he dresses like a child doesn't mean he's a child.

418
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,200
He's an adult man.

419
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,120
You know, I'll say I I rode this ride.

420
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,680
I think I would have ridden it opening summer in 1998

421
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,960
back when it was called Countdown to Extinction.

422
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,200
And I liked it.

423
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,240
I mean, we didn't have Indiana Jones on the East Coast.

424
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,400
So this is my first experience with this type of ride vehicle.

425
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,080
And I remember being delighted by this ride, especially because I think it's

426
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,560
the most traditional kind of thrill ride attraction

427
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,600
in the original Animal Kingdom, Opening Day Animal Kingdom Park.

428
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,720
I think I bought a little time rover and had a nice time.

429
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,760
But as the years have gone on, it's kind of sticking out that they need to do

430
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,080
some work on these dinosaurs and that this ride is very dark inside.

431
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

432
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,040
Visibility is kind of the issue more than anything.

433
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,760
And yeah, I think they've let you know, we're all everybody's mad about the

434
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,080
the Yeti and Expedition Everest.

435
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,560
But I think there's a lot of smaller animatronics in this attraction

436
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,640
that are not working on the regular.

437
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:46,200
Yeah. Look, I guess I I'm not the one to tell you I saw this stuff firsthand,

438
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,960
because obviously, who knows what my eyes were doing.

439
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,520
But from the videos I was watching today,

440
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,520
yes, I think there's a couple of them that could be refurbished.

441
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,840
But the darkness does hide, you know, some of the flaws,

442
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,040
unlike that opening scene from the Jurassic Park ride,

443
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,600
where, like, you know, you would see the dinosaur skin just hanging off of its neck.

444
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:14,480
Yeah. And like the sun damage was was too great to not notice.

445
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,360
They might be real fucked up if you put a light on them.

446
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,480
So maybe light isn't the answer. Yeah.

447
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,280
Scott, what did you have you been on this ride?

448
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,400
Yeah, I did this.

449
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,440
I've done it a couple of times.

450
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,680
Yeah, I must have done it around ninety nine.

451
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,320
And it might have still been countdown to extinction.

452
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,200
I don't I don't recall.

453
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:39,080
I think my reaction was I thought this was going to be the major breathtaking.

454
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,640
Like, that's that's the killer ride in Animal Kingdom.

455
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,280
And that was kind of my reaction even then, because I I was lucky enough

456
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,360
to have been on the Indiana Jones adventure by then.

457
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,640
So I was like, I was so excited about realizing, oh, it's kind of a similar thing.

458
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,760
And yeah, I felt kind of let down just because it is more

459
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,520
a it's what I said at the top.

460
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,080
It's it's just more unpleasant to me.

461
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,320
It's it's it's a lot of loud noises.

462
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,200
Is there not a score?

463
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,320
There not a music score running through it?

464
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,440
I don't believe so.

465
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,320
No, just that's kind of weird to me.

466
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,040
Just dinosaurs and like the meteor crashing sounds, which they

467
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,600
and they they did turn down like we're we're listening to the team down version

468
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,880
since 2000.

469
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,920
Yeah. Oh, you're in, you know, in terms of filling in info,

470
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,320
that's probably the other thing to say.

471
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,720
So this is I mean, the basis of the attraction is that you're being

472
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,160
beamed back in time and kind of an all terrain vehicle.

473
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,120
And you were taken back to a little too close before the comets all started

474
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,880
landing that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.

475
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,360
That's why the ride was originally called Countdown to Extinction.

476
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,960
But in a bizarre, not bizarre, just kind of a confusing

477
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,360
cross promotional move.

478
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,000
This ride sort of was reflective of the upcoming film

479
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,760
Dinosaur was released in 2000.

480
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,240
And then they just went all the way full tilt with it and made it

481
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,120
a complete tie in to the movie Dinosaur.

482
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,200
And it's been named Dinosaur ever since.

483
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,160
I, for one, kind of prefer the title Countdown to Extinction.

484
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,720
I find that a little cooler.

485
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,200
It's definitely a better title.

486
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,440
The development is so confusing because it seems like Michael Eisner said,

487
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,880
all right, imagineering and animation work together to make these dinosaurs

488
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,280
coherent with both your projects.

489
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,040
So there is an Iguanodon and there is a Carnot

490
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,360
Carnotaurus, which was recently discovered at the time.

491
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,480
They they work that real life discovery in

492
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,680
to the movie and the ride.

493
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,160
But they called it something different for two years.

494
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,240
And then when the movie actually came out, yeah, like you said,

495
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,120
they changed it to Dinosaur.

496
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,680
So still trying to figure out the cross

497
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,960
inner company, get synergy there, kind of odd.

498
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,800
The synergy, I think, was getting a little out of hand because

499
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,720
elsewhere in Animal Kingdom, you had it's tough to be a bug,

500
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,520
which slightly predated a bug's life.

501
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,760
And in both cases, they don't totally reflect the movie.

502
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,520
Like there's so many bugs in it's tough to be a bug who are not in a bug's life.

503
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,280
And this is really strange where it's a trip back into the world of the dinosaurs,

504
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,080
which the movie Dinosaur takes place entirely in the dinosaur world.

505
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,880
And there certainly is no mischievous doctor

506
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,280
trying to have you bring a dinosaur back for his personal gain.

507
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,720
There's no time travel element in dinosaur.

508
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,240
There's no humans in it.

509
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,080
So and not all of the dinosaurs.

510
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,240
In fact, they aren't at all like the dinosaurs for the most part in dinosaur,

511
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,520
because mainly the dinosaurs in dinosaur talks.

512
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,480
And there's some real logic flaws once they switched it to dinosaur.

513
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,680
So you're going back as a meteor shower is happening and you spoiler alert.

514
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,240
You do happen to rescue the Iguanodon in the ride.

515
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,120
But does the logic then follows if this takes place after the movie dinosaur?

516
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,560
Everyone else in that movie has died in the meteor shower,

517
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,800
except the protagonist, who we all know is Aladar.

518
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,560
Aladar. Of course, it's Aladar.

519
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,960
Of course it's Aladar.

520
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,600
Or the other option is that in the movie Dinosaur, there is a brief meteor shower

521
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,560
early in the movie, and that's when they have to flee the island

522
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,800
that they first you first meet a lot of the characters on.

523
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,120
So then if you're rescuing Aladar at that point,

524
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,680
then the events of the movie don't occur.

525
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,680
Hmm. I didn't think about that.

526
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,400
Oh, weird. So that might.

527
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,000
So either this is the extinction of the dinosaurs and you have removed

528
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,040
this character saving him, which he would have died.

529
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,600
But his entire family and everyone he knows and loves is dead in the process.

530
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,680
Or that this is what we're seeing is the

531
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,320
the bombing of Lemur Island.

532
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,360
Yep. You got it.

533
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,440
OK, I think I'm caught up then.

534
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,840
Bombing is not the right word, but I mean, sort of bombing

535
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,760
bombs from the from nature, nature bombs, bombs, bombs,

536
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,200
bombs from heaven.

537
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,400
That's what I call asteroids.

538
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,240
Yes. From heaven, Jason is called.

539
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,520
They were sent by God.

540
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,640
Yes. The lemurs had sinned and only only God bombs could make it right.

541
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,240
This seems like I was this sort of reminded me of the story about Michael Eisner

542
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,240
wanting to have the Darrell Hannah splash, have something to do.

543
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,040
Movie Splash have something to do with Splash Mountain.

544
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,600
Like that was sort of he's always tried to do sort of like a synergistic thing

545
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,240
with rides. And here he kind of got his wish.

546
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,480
And he did not with Splash and Splash Mountain.

547
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,760
Because people like maybe in the 80s, there were people there

548
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,720
like Tony Baxter, who predated him and they weren't scared of him.

549
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,160
And they would tell him an idea was stupid.

550
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,880
But by this point, maybe it's all people who've only lived in Eisner world.

551
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,160
So they feel like they can't say no to him.

552
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,680
Yeah, maybe he yes, he maybe it was like it was obviously it felt like a different

553
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,520
time from what we've heard from, you know, imagineering interviews and stuff.

554
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,640
People like the 80s felt like in the early 90s felt like very collaborative.

555
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,320
And there was a whole everyone.

556
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,040
It was a team of rivals, but everybody was getting things done.

557
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,720
And then by the end of Eisner's tenure, it just seemed like everyone had had the wind

558
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,920
knocked out of them. The bubble had been deflated.

559
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,000
And maybe it was just like, all right, well, we'll figure out how to make this ride

560
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,160
tie in with Aladar, the dinosaur from the movie Dinosaurs.

561
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,320
It's not a random Magwana Dawn anymore.

562
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,640
It's Aladar. It's very clearly Aladar.

563
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,040
I guess you have to rescue Aladar now.

564
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,880
But like you're bringing him, you're bringing him into the future for like tests.

565
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,560
It's not even like he's I guess he's being rescued, but like at what cost?

566
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
Why does he want to live here in this time?

567
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,400
The mad scientist who is trying to get a hold of this iguana

568
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:33,320
dawn is putting countless people's lives at risk for scientific notoriety

569
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,920
for for the sake of getting a hold of Aladar.

570
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,080
Yes, I wish he was.

571
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,600
I wish he was Aladar.

572
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,120
I wish you had the name.

573
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,760
Yeah, that would clear it up.

574
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,800
But I think they only filmed the actor

575
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,720
before the movie before they had made this decision.

576
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,400
So, yeah, it's a it's a tie into a movie, but no characters are named.

577
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,720
Right. You see a little CGI clip of Aladar in the pre show.

578
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,600
But yeah, he doesn't see Dr.

579
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,320
Seeker does not say Aladar, so it's very confusing in the pre show.

580
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,800
He so so this day, yeah, this doctor, Dr.

581
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,240
Seeker lets you know that he wants you to go back in time

582
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,520
and bring back this particular iguanodon.

583
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,200
It's this one here. I'll show you.

584
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,600
And he brings up like security cam footage.

585
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,000
But the security cam footage is clearly finished shots from the movie

586
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,400
dinosaur. So it's you.

587
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,360
You're thinking you're going to go get like, you know, anatomically correct

588
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,840
dinosaur, but instead you're showing a dinosaur who's like doe eyed.

589
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,120
You know, he's like conveying emotion, which is very jarring,

590
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,600
especially then when you go to the dinosaur world and it's just a lot of like,

591
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,960
it's just a lot of like roaring, you know, no brain cells

592
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,040
dinosaurs who can't show you that they're like pensive.

593
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,200
Right. They can't like they can't win you over with their cuteness

594
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,000
like Aladar can a dinosaur who I would assume most

595
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,720
younger people would know now from there is I don't even it's

596
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,160
it might be too old even for people to know it as a meme.

597
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,120
But there's a screen, a grainy screen grab of Aladar looking like he's going,

598
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,080
uh, that I see every now and then it's like a reaction photo.

599
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Oh, like a gym.

600
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:33,200
Like, yeah, like a GIF or even just a J.

601
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,760
But let me see if I can find out, see if I can find it and send it to you guys.

602
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:42,160
Saying, uh, like, like his mouth is just kind of open and he looks a little.

603
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,960
Yeah, his mouth is just kind of gape.

604
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,880
He just looks a little slack jawed.

605
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,400
Hmm. I'm looking at a get a GIF here of a baby.

606
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,400
I don't know if it's baby Aladar, just a different baby dinosaur

607
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,800
sneezing and, uh, I don't know.

608
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,360
I don't even want to send it to you guys because I think you're going to.

609
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,000
I think you'll love it in some perverse baby Grinch way.

610
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,320
Oh, that's how awful I find it that I feel like it's guaranteed.

611
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,800
Oh, yeah. Give me that.

612
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,240
My mouth is watering for this.

613
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,840
Well, just look for dinosaur Aladar GIF.

614
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,680
Dinosaur Aladar GIF Aladar GIF.

615
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,280
Don't look at the one of Playa.

616
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,800
It's not Playa. It's Alad.

617
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,200
It's I think it's baby Aladar.

618
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,440
Oh, OK. He oh, I see this.

619
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,680
Oh, yeah. Oh, he sneezed. Oh, yeah. I love this.

620
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,440
No, you don't. Yes, I do.

621
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,160
You're being contrarian. I'm not. No one would like this.

622
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,280
I often. I don't you like this.

623
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,120
I don't know when this episode is coming out versus Patreon's,

624
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,840
but there's a couple of characters I've said I hated recently,

625
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,720
and I think that makes it clear that I am not biased.

626
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,120
I like. Yeah.

627
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,920
But if I bring it up and say I don't like it,

628
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,520
then you immediately say you like it.

629
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,920
Well, next. OK. Look, the next time this type of thing happens,

630
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,000
you have to go in neutral to prove so I can prove that I'm being unbiased here,

631
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,440
that I do like baby Aladar sneezing.

632
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,760
Let's see. Audience will also decide.

633
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
Let's post this.

634
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,880
The baby grinch, very decisive divisive baby Aladar,

635
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,680
I think going to be less divisive.

636
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,320
I don't know why I can't talk right now.

637
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,600
No, this isn't good.

638
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,720
Mike, can you say we might be worse?

639
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,120
Can you send me Aladar?

640
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,000
I will send you avatar avatar.

641
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,800
Baby avatar.

642
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,200
You know, it's funny you say that because obviously we all know

643
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,240
the voice of Aladar is one of our favorite actors.

644
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,520
Let's all say it together.

645
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,080
D.B. Sweeney, Sweeney, yes.

646
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,880
And D.B. Sweeney is Aladar.

647
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,520
And he's also Avatar Ang in The Legend of Korra,

648
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,080
the sequel to Avatar, The Last Airbender, which is not James Cameron's Avatar,

649
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,200
which has Dr. Augustine, who is not Dr. Ogden.

650
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,560
Right. Keep that straight, everyone.

651
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,120
So but D.B. Sweeney is Aladar and Avatar Ang.

652
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,240
D.B. Sweeney is Al.

653
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,400
What is he?

654
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,040
He's not Avatar Ang.

655
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,280
He's Aladar and Avatar Ang.

656
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,800
It's just Ang. It's just Ang.

657
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,080
Avatar is the name of the show.

658
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,760
No, no, no. I'm looking at it.

659
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,080
I clicked on a Wikipedia where he's still I think it's acceptable to call him Avatar Ang.

660
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,480
Wow. I think.

661
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,360
I mean, you know, we were both right.

662
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,160
I watched I watched some of the first I even watched any of the sequel

663
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,120
that the Legend of Korra where they're older.

664
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,920
But yeah, I remember a little of the show.

665
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,320
Jason on the Wikipedia, he's he goes back and forth.

666
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,640
Yeah. Sometimes he is Avatar Ang's every Avatar Ang and sometimes he's just saying,

667
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,280
I've sent you the GIF, Jason. I love it.

668
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,880
I love it. Yes, of course.

669
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,520
No, you don't. Why?

670
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,880
This is not cute. No, it's not.

671
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,240
He is cute. Why?

672
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,440
I think this is so he's a little cutie.

673
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,960
Jason's right. This is this is horrifying.

674
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,960
Late 90s CGI.

675
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,320
No one would if you saw this on your own, you would think this was bad.

676
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,800
I don't. But everyone's taking a stance.

677
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,040
You're all against me. That's what's happening.

678
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,840
Nothing to do with it.

679
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,320
Has nothing to do with it.

680
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,520
I think the next is going to overwhelmingly like baby Aladar. Jesus.

681
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,360
I bet over 75% will vote yes on baby Aladar.

682
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,800
I can't say that I don't like anything

683
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,720
because everyone will get in lockstep.

684
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,520
I didn't like Fuzzbucket.

685
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,680
Oh, well, all right, that's true.

686
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,200
But I think if I said I did, if I came out first and said I didn't like Fuzzbucket,

687
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,640
where would we be then?

688
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,680
I think I would have completely agreed.

689
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,320
Fuzzbucket is so unpleasant.

690
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,680
He's such a little turd.

691
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,040
I do not like him.

692
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,360
Go to our Patreon if you want to listen to us talk about the

693
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,360
Disney Channel movie.

694
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,240
No. Or was it ABC?

695
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,800
I think it was on ABC.

696
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,600
Yeah. OK.

697
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:15,320
It's about an unpleasant little character who kind of grifts a little boy.

698
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,960
That's the best way.

699
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,840
Yeah. And I don't remember the lines anymore is I've tried to force them out of my brain.

700
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:27,440
But it's like, you know, he says things like, hey, fun boy.

701
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,400
Kissy. Right.

702
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,800
Doesn't he demand kissy?

703
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,280
Right. Doesn't he demand kisses at one point?

704
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,080
Give me give me kissy right, fun boy.

705
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,040
Kissy. What's he says?

706
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,480
Something like, what's going on, party boy?

707
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,320
Oh, it's even worse.

708
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,720
And then he's like, then the little boy's like, because Fuzzbucket, like, is just using

709
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,560
the little boy and he's like, don't you like me?

710
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,360
And he's like, oh, yeah, I do.

711
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,400
I swear. Yeah, yeah, sure.

712
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,160
I do. That's right.

713
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,040
And he's so like, he's not cute.

714
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,120
He's unpleasant.

715
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,480
Is all of his friends.

716
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,480
Doesn't he have a friend named Stinky or something?

717
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,520
Yeah, he sure does.

718
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,880
Jason. I think Jason is the one on record that said he like Jason like Stinky.

719
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,600
I like Stinky. Yeah.

720
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,280
Yeah. But I don't even like Stinky.

721
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,480
I won't go on record as saying I enjoy Stinky from Fuzzbucket.

722
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,760
I think I'm looking at a different

723
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,360
different gif now that is baby Aladar either peeing or pooping.

724
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,680
Oh, my God. Send that over here.

725
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,080
Send that our way. Yeah.

726
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,880
I have to I'm going to send this of him sneezing just to make sure,

727
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,120
because I are you talking about the same gif?

728
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,080
No, no, no. This one is no.

729
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,240
This one is Tim Gagling or something.

730
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,280
I'm sending it over right now to you.

731
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,960
And I'm going to see if we're talking about the same thing,

732
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,240
because again, Jason and I are looking at this and we we say this is cute.

733
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,040
And I am sending to you with the email subject line piss.

734
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,360
OK, I will be very honest if I like baby Aladar going to the bathroom.

735
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,480
I'll be very honest.

736
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,040
There's there's a lot of fun dinosaur content.

737
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,440
Oh, yeah. This came up even bigger this time, Mike.

738
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,560
I can see this is a sneeze. This is different.

739
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,280
I'm sending you what I think is pooping or peeing.

740
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,840
All right. This is I don't OK. I don't like them.

741
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,520
Well, while you guys are OK.

742
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,280
Oh, hold on. While you're starting this out.

743
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,160
Let's see.

744
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,000
I think Scott is right.

745
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,640
This this baby Aladar is pissing or shitting right now.

746
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,240
I'm looking at him.

747
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,200
I think this is I think this is cute, honestly.

748
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,760
This is also cute. This might be cuter.

749
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,040
Why is it? Tell me why it is not because it's making a funny little face.

750
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,400
It's a little baby dinosaur guy.

751
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,360
He's just a little guy.

752
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:55,640
He's a little guy who's way too shiny and doesn't match his own background.

753
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,480
And a dinosaur would not be this expressive.

754
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,800
And yet he's also a dead eyed Zemeckis type creature.

755
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,520
Nothing about this is good.

756
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,640
This looks better than adult Aladar in the movie.

757
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,120
I might agree with that. Yes.

758
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,560
Should we should I like text Lindsey? She's downstairs.

759
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,320
Should I text her and say, do you think this is cute? Yeah.

760
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,880
Yeah, sure. Yes. OK. Send her both because I really both.

761
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,480
I'm I I don't think I'm trolling here.

762
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,080
I really don't.

763
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,960
I think this is cute.

764
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,400
This might just convey different taste or something.

765
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,040
Maybe I'll do the same to Aaron.

766
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,480
Sorry, listeners, that this has just become us sending files around.

767
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,080
No, no, I think they're I think they're gripped by this drama of who likes

768
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,960
the baby Aladar shitting or sneezing.

769
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,720
I have some I wanted to get your guys's feedback.

770
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,520
So did you guys come across, you know, we talked about the McDonald's

771
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,720
sponsorship.

772
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,320
Did you come across the posters of hand drawn

773
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,840
dinosaurs that say like food fangs and fun?

774
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,280
And did someone say styrakosaurus?

775
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,080
And have you had a crocodilian today

776
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,520
and it's one dinosaur eating another dinosaur?

777
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,960
No, I've seen none of this.

778
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,880
I saw. Yes, I have that right here.

779
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,400
And that is really terrifying.

780
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,400
It is a pretty detailed drawing of a dinosaur eating a crocodile.

781
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,800
Head first. Yeah.

782
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,000
Here, I'll send this to Scott. I have this.

783
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,360
Yeah, I am very shocked that this would even be in a Disney park.

784
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,360
I mean, it feels like something that would be like leftover from like the 60s

785
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,920
or something where you're like, well, it's been grandfathered in

786
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,680
because of how terrifying it is.

787
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,920
But yeah, yeah, it's it's a cool drawing, by the way.

788
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,080
Food fangs and fun.

789
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:52,920
The dinosaur McDonald's tie together in general is very bizarre.

790
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,360
I don't know why these properties are matched.

791
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,000
They are not is the answer.

792
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,720
They just McDonald's was looking to give them money and they gave them dinosaur.

793
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,840
Yeah, I think they had to fit it in where they could

794
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,040
because like it was you could get

795
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,080
like McDonald's food at the restaurant, a source.

796
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,760
Yeah, which is still there.

797
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,520
It just does not serve McDonald's food.

798
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,200
I when we when Lindsay and I were there a couple of years ago,

799
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,440
there was a very nice, quirky, older fellow who had a dinosaur puppet

800
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,640
who wouldn't leave people alone with it, who worked there.

801
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,400
They did work there. You're sure he worked there.

802
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,640
He at least had an outfit that resembled a Disney employees outfit.

803
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,240
I assume I think he took a tray or two, too, although none of that

804
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,080
really confirms that he worked there. Yeah, exactly.

805
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,000
Guys, the weird speckles on these posters make it seem like

806
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,280
the dinosaurs are surrounded by locusts or germs, honestly.

807
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,600
I mean, that's what's in my head at this point. Yes.

808
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,760
I mean, that should have been the warning that God was going to unleash upon them.

809
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,200
His his un un-mighty is almighty wrath.

810
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,280
You know, they were war. I do know.

811
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,680
I think we might all be screwed in this current scenario,

812
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,360
unless some other doctor and some other species

813
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,000
right before our extinction wants one of us in particular.

814
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,440
Like if some other species Dr.

815
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,160
Seeker in a thousand years wants Jason

816
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:35,240
and then some truck shows up and grabs him before the virus gets us all. Mm hmm.

817
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,880
That's the only hope any of us have.

818
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,680
I have a question.

819
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,840
Will future Dr.

820
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:46,360
Seeker be explaining his plan in glorious four by three aspect ratio?

821
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:53,440
Because this is no this ride pre show is notable for still having

822
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,360
standard depth footage.

823
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,600
Never a film cut of this film cut.

824
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,240
So it's time travel in that regard.

825
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,440
You're first you time travel to 1998, then you travel to the Cretaceous.

826
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,880
By the way, to follow up on the on earlier and might keep me updated.

827
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,240
But I texted Aaron, she walked in the room and said a very definitive no.

828
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,760
So we might just be getting different.

829
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,800
This is the different tastes of the unified Gardner's.

830
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,000
Aaron, who had no idea what we were talking about.

831
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,320
And I guess everyone else, I guess it's us against the world.

832
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,400
Hey, I'm waiting for Lindsey to respond.

833
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,440
She is downstairs playing Animal Crossing, which is become her addiction.

834
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,880
In quarantine time.

835
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,400
Yeah, you tweeted about this.

836
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,960
Oh, no, it is.

837
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,840
The hours are staggering, I'll be honest.

838
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,640
Like, I feel like I'm like my parents from like when I was like,

839
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,920
you really have to you're going to keep playing, huh?

840
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,760
OK. Huh.

841
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,560
It's made Twitter extremely confounding to me, not playing Animal Crossing.

842
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,880
I don't know what 85 percent of it is anymore.

843
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,640
All right. OK. Lindsey has weighed in.

844
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,760
She I said, I said the two GIFs, I said, do you think baby

845
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,040
Aladar is cute? And she wrote, yes, exclamation point. Boy. Wow.

846
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,240
Well, we hey, we find who we're meant to be with, I guess. Yeah.

847
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,720
Guys, I'm going to break the tie.

848
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,200
I texted them to my girlfriend and she also says very cute.

849
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,120
So very, very Lindsey.

850
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:36,240
Lindsey added a very cute to the text right before Jason said that.

851
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,400
And she came here. You're talking about.

852
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,960
Yes. Very cute.

853
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,880
Yes. I think we're getting I think over 75 percent of the listeners will agree.

854
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,280
I don't understand.

855
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,240
Why is that very cute?

856
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,160
He is that the mouth. It's a horrifying mouth.

857
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,080
It is like weird CGI rubber.

858
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,200
This is not good.

859
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,560
I don't know. Again, I don't think we're trolling here.

860
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,280
I don't think there's a well.

861
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,120
I mean, yes, this this test, the wife and girlfriend test is a

862
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,760
is a good litmus, but I don't understand.

863
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,560
I don't understand where anyone's coming from.

864
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,440
Lindsey is also now texted who the F is Aladar.

865
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,280
A very good follow up question.

866
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:25,200
Hey, maybe we should explain a little bit and we should talk about the 2000 film

867
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,480
don't say Aladar

868
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,600
that the 2000 film dinosaur.

869
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,160
This is a movie that everyone can revisit now if they have Disney Plus.

870
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,800
And I'm sure that very few people have.

871
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,840
I've never been able to stand this entire film.

872
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,680
And it is a movie that perhaps notably combined

873
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,960
real backgrounds, real nature backgrounds with CGI

874
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:00,200
dinosaur characters, which I'm sure made it the dullest film ever to shoot in history.

875
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,880
That sounds so boring.

876
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,600
They just had to go film plates for a long time.

877
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,360
And it's all very disappointing because the weird history of this movie,

878
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,360
where this was in its original development, was supposed to be a vehicle for Paul

879
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,840
Verhoeven with that, which is so great.

880
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,920
I lost my mind when I saw that fact.

881
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,360
I could just imagine Paul Verhoeven, 90s

882
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:29,240
Paul Verhoeven making a CGI brutalist dinosaur film.

883
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,280
That would have been awesome.

884
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,320
Yes. This is what he has explained in every interview

885
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,440
that it was going to be just really gory and fucked up

886
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:43,480
and just about like the the the pointlessness of of life.

887
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,400
I get not the point of this, but like, you know, the why flail against a death

888
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,160
that is coming no matter what it's going to be really severe.

889
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,200
And it just like end with extinction.

890
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,080
And that's that's it.

891
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,520
That's the end of them, which is kind of the end of the ride.

892
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,400
I guess that's that stayed unified.

893
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,120
Yeah. I you know, this ride kind of like is

894
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,040
is an interesting little special feature for the movie dinosaur,

895
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,400
because it regardless of the events of the movie, it reminds you, yes, that death.

896
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,760
Death comes for all of us.

897
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,840
I guess that's kind of a little special feature on all Disney movies.

898
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,920
Eventually, these characters will die.

899
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,400
And yeah, whether we keep in mind, yeah,

900
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,560
but only dinosaur had the guts to say only the dinosaur had the guts to say it.

901
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,800
By the way, guys, I pulled it up on Disney Plus on the app and under extras.

902
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,840
Look what I just said.

903
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,920
You look. Look what the only extra is.

904
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,600
There's a little clip.

905
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,360
There's a little.

906
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,400
It's maybe it's maybe.

907
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,120
Oh, no, no, no.

908
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,920
It's our friend.

909
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:51,680
What's that tired, tired, baby Grinch wired baby Aladar?

910
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,880
What's that? What's that?

911
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,080
I smell wafting through the air.

912
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,240
Why, I think I smell a little content coming our way.

913
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,280
No, please, no.

914
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,320
Ever since everyone spend this time connecting with your family,

915
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,400
zoom with your family and don't send us shit.

916
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,640
Just doesn't you think there's there's enough stuff in the like lore of podcasts

917
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,440
to ride to annoy Scott with?

918
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,640
We stumble upon baby Aladar.

919
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,240
How have I amassed a fan base that loves

920
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,400
only things that I find extremely abhorrent and unpleasant?

921
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,360
I mean, do I want like should there be a Photoshop of Randy Gerber

922
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,720
holding baby Aladar?

923
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,640
You know the answer.

924
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,760
Yes. Wow.

925
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,200
Now I can.

926
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,040
Now I hear a rumbling in the distance, a voice,

927
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:48,760
a cacophony of voices all at once yelling plus us up, plus us up.

928
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,080
No, no, no, no.

929
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,320
I'm not watching.

930
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,680
Hell, no, no dinosaur.

931
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,080
This is bad enough as it is.

932
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,440
Didn't we learn anything from our last plus us up?

933
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,320
Patreon exclusive dinosaur watch alone.

934
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,800
Please know, Aladar, Aladar.

935
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,640
I have hated the idea of this film.

936
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,960
I can't even stand watching short clips.

937
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,120
This is such an unpleasant movie.

938
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,520
Let me look up Aladar.

939
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,240
I'm going to look up Aladar plush.

940
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:26,120
When I was 15, I'd see trailers for this on TV with him saying, stand together.

941
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,880
I'm like, what is this move?

942
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,520
I don't ever want to see what this is.

943
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,040
Why would anyone like that?

944
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,320
This ugly gray dinosaur yelling stand together.

945
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,200
I see any other movie.

946
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,880
I'll go see what's that bad like,

947
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,560
you know, Jack Black, Steve Zahn movie from around that time.

948
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,880
Much rather see that narrows it down.

949
00:51:49,240 --> 00:52:00,960
That man, early animal kingdom had tie ins for Bugslife, Tarzan and the dinosaur.

950
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,320
What a time.

951
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,920
Jesus. Oh, terrible time.

952
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,120
I'm looking I cannot find any baby Aladar merch.

953
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,800
I think it's all regular Aladar adult Aladar, who I don't find near.

954
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,800
I'm not as attached to him now like I am to his baby self.

955
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,640
I see only baby.

956
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,800
Well, yeah, it was all downhill from then, I guess.

957
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:24,760
Yeah.

958
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:31,240
I see some other things about the movie dinosaur,

959
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:37,080
not the not the boring movie that I assume that they like.

960
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,800
At every turn, they denied things that could have made it cooler.

961
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,160
I should say specifically that not only was it going to be Verhoeven,

962
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,760
it was going to be a collaboration between Paul Verhoeven and Phil Tippett,

963
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,840
who did the Ed 209 sequence and Robocop.

964
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,920
So like that crazy, gory sequence as an entire dinosaur film.

965
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,880
So cool. And it didn't happen, doesn't even like any of that.

966
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,720
And then it sat on a shelf for a long time.

967
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,960
The only thing that stayed consistent is that there's a character named Suri.

968
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,160
Like in the in the Verhoeven version, there was going to be a Suri

969
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,000
that was ultimately played by Hayden Panetti.

970
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,360
So there is. Oh, that's oh, and that's a lemur.

971
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,320
But also there were going to be real lemurs in the movie

972
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:25,400
because there were lemurs in the time of dinosaurs and there's lemurs now.

973
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,760
So they were going to round up real lemurs to interact with puppets.

974
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,720
Whoa. Cool. Yeah, that sounds really cool.

975
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,600
And then but obviously none of that happened.

976
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,160
And instead, they made this boring thing with this not good baby.

977
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:46,080
And not only that, they said there was a full song

978
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,760
written and performed by Kate Bush called Out of the Storm.

979
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,960
And preview audiences didn't like it.

980
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,760
And the producers asked Bush to do rewrites and she refused.

981
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,480
So there was they they also denied Kate Bush.

982
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,480
Although I will say that then she reworked the song.

983
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,920
And it is a song called Lyra in the movie The Golden Compass.

984
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,960
And I checked it out and I'm not so much a fan of the song Lyra

985
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,880
from The Golden Compass, but nonetheless,

986
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,840
it feels like Kate Bush contribution would have made this movie

987
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,120
a little more interesting.

988
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:19,760
I agree with that.

989
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,720
I just started listening to some of the classic Kate Bush albums.

990
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:26,320
I was I never really got I just never came across my desk,

991
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,120
but I have been listening to Hounds of Love and it is good.

992
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,160
So, yeah, I'm sort of I'm kind of a latecomer with her a little bit.

993
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,480
Yeah, a little bit. I know it's almost

994
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,400
too heavy to listen to.

995
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,160
Like it's all like dove in a little and then I'm like, I can't

996
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,040
and handle this more.

997
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,560
I'm so way too many feelings. Yeah.

998
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,520
She's good, you know, much like staring at a photo of baby Aladar.

999
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,520
But I have I just have a limit.

1000
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,440
Now, hold on. What if I were to tell you that the Iguanodon

1001
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,360
with the one we are to assume is Aladar in the ride?

1002
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:03,640
The main time you see him in the ride, he is holding up a tree

1003
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,080
to help you escape.

1004
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,880
And he's also screaming.

1005
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,760
Pretty cool.

1006
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,200
Pretty cool.

1007
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:16,120
And it is but in TV Sweeney's voice or just like a roar,

1008
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:21,440
just a just a painful scream, like a high pitch

1009
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,400
as if he's watching everything he knows.

1010
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,800
Burn up from God bombs.

1011
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,920
What a strange ride.

1012
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,680
Watch characters suffer.

1013
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,960
Yeah. Wallace Langham has a ticket for you to see your friends

1014
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,200
go through hell like if Midway Mania ended with the scene from Toy Story 3

1015
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,040
where they're all in the incinerator.

1016
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,080
Like and then and then only one of the toys made it out.

1017
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,920
Only Ham makes it out. Yeah.

1018
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,560
Only Ham survives the incinerator at the end of Midway Mania.

1019
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,080
Bad news, troops.

1020
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:04,480
Your poor slingshotting is doomed all the characters to die.

1021
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,440
Oh, man.

1022
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,800
Yeah, this is the most bizarre, honestly perverse, perverse ride.

1023
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,200
You know, we talked about when the ride,

1024
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,160
the first two years of the ride when it was countdown to extinction

1025
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:24,000
were a little different when they switched it over to dinosaur in 2000.

1026
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,320
They did make some changes.

1027
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,760
One, they dropped the height, the height requirement.

1028
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,960
Got a little shorter.

1029
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,280
The vehicles got a little less jerky and the sounds a little less sinister.

1030
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,600
It was more so.

1031
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,080
Oh, my God. It was jerky and louder.

1032
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,200
And I guess they were playing the sound of like stomping

1033
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,720
as if like the dinosaur was right behind you.

1034
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,920
And the ending was a big change, like the ending.

1035
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,640
It looked like you were about to be hit by an asteroid.

1036
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,160
And then you threw a quote laser net over

1037
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,600
the Iguana Don, and that's how he gets back.

1038
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:07,720
Now talking about a laser laser that specifically laser that it was a laser

1039
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:13,360
net, and now there's a big, big carna car.

1040
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,760
I can't remember how to say this.

1041
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:21,040
Carnotaurus, a big carnotaurus pops out at the end,

1042
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,480
and you just kind of like happen to get the Iguana Don in your field.

1043
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,040
Yeah, they tell you, you got it.

1044
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,800
You got it. And of course, unlike Indiana Jones, where you actually see

1045
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,800
an Indiana Jones animatronic at the end, you do not see one last

1046
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,160
Iguana Don animatronic.

1047
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,680
You see video footage of CGI Iguana Don wandering around like

1048
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,440
facility hallways, empty hallways.

1049
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,200
On standard.

1050
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,680
He's stuck in a he's stuck in a laboratory.

1051
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,960
For once he was screaming because his friends are dying.

1052
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,960
And now he's stuck.

1053
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,280
Now he's in a time that he doesn't understand.

1054
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,760
He doesn't know what a wall is, much less a computer.

1055
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,600
Similar to like Biff running around the Institute of Future Technology.

1056
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,080
On the Back to the Future ride.

1057
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,680
Except it's a dinosaur.

1058
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,200
Much scarier for him.

1059
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,440
He's he's like, you know, he's like what?

1060
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,000
He's like 17 tops, right?

1061
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,040
He's still pretty young.

1062
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,480
Yes, yes, very young.

1063
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,080
The theme park history video said that there was going to be

1064
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:30,520
maybe a Pepper's ghost effect to actually make it look like

1065
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,320
the dinosaur was like with you or coming back through time,

1066
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,120
which would have given a little bit more of a suggestion of what happened

1067
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:41,640
as opposed to just like, oh, yeah, and we got the dinosaur.

1068
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,000
It worked.

1069
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,600
Now he gets to live in a laboratory.

1070
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,480
Yeah, yes.

1071
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,480
Or he escaped and like it was a lost world scenario

1072
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,600
where he like ravages a town.

1073
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,480
That's probably what's coming.

1074
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:00,720
Yeah, he's going to like he's going to run through everything in Dino land USA.

1075
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,440
I would love Dr.

1076
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,320
Marsh and Dr. Seeker to chase the Iguana Don in a Cadillac.

1077
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:11,120
In a top down Cadillac.

1078
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,120
They also swapped out the statue in the fountain out front.

1079
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,240
Used to be a Styracosaurus.

1080
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,640
And then when they switched it to dinosaur, they put

1081
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:25,120
an Iguana Don that in theory is Aladar in the fountain.

1082
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:28,720
And they put a bunch of landscaping around it because some blogs,

1083
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,760
some blogs were saying that the original fountain with no barriers,

1084
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,360
people would just climb into the fountain to stand next to the dinosaur

1085
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:41,040
or like splash around.

1086
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,280
So, yes, I said I saw that.

1087
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:48,880
Animal Kingdom, famously a very hot park, very extra warm.

1088
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,360
The day we were there was the hottest day we were we were there.

1089
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,640
Used to be a lot less inside attractions there,

1090
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,920
but even still with with the foliage grown in after 20 plus years,

1091
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,120
still a very warm park.

1092
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,080
Yes, it's just a giant sauna.

1093
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,720
It's the world's biggest sauna.

1094
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,840
Yeah, that's why I napped instead of going to see Aladar.

1095
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,400
Yeah, I mean, it is a cool.

1096
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,880
This is one of the places, you know, you can get out of the sun

1097
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,440
because it's all indoors.

1098
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,880
So that's a good thing about it.

1099
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,440
Right, a more traditional thrill ride.

1100
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:32,880
Did you guys you can get some AC and why and hear characters scream,

1101
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:37,320
bombs dropping, lightning strikes

1102
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:41,960
and a very screechy radio with the voice of Wallace Langham.

1103
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,440
Yeah. What could you not love about that?

1104
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:49,400
And and the robot voice identifying dinosaurs.

1105
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:53,160
I think if I was a dinosaur, a big dinosaur kid and hearing all the voice,

1106
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,200
I think I would be very excited, even though dinosaur

1107
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:59,440
what we know about dinosaurs seems to change every year.

1108
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,200
And this ride is probably already been, you know,

1109
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,400
retroactively incorrect in many ways.

1110
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,040
Yeah, like certain dinosaurs, they'll be like, oh, yeah, you know,

1111
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,200
that dinosaur you've known about since you were a kid.

1112
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,280
That dinosaur never existed.

1113
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,880
That was that was fake.

1114
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,800
Somebody thought that's what one was, but it didn't exist.

1115
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,240
You know, like, oh, OK. Yeah.

1116
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:24,280
And then like Jurassic Park did the whole like they're birds.

1117
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,880
And then like some people are like, they're not really birds. Yeah.

1118
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:34,360
So, yeah, you know, hopefully, hopefully in a few century,

1119
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,840
we'll figure out what dinosaurs were.

1120
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,920
I mean, we know for a fact it's the past.

1121
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,320
It's a blast or it's fast.

1122
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,440
It's a blast. And it's in the past.

1123
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,640
Mm hmm. That's the motto of this ride.

1124
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,440
Of course. It's cool and good.

1125
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,880
And we all know it.

1126
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,840
Um, we should we talk about the about the video before?

1127
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,680
We talked about the four by three nature.

1128
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,600
But yeah, you meet you have both.

1129
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,040
Initially, Felicia Rashad,

1130
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,760
who's the director of the Dino Institute,

1131
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:12,120
which is a real highfalutin name, the Dino Institute, Dr. Marsh.

1132
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,720
We just did a fake doctor final four on Twitch.

1133
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,320
And I didn't want to have too much dinosaur in it.

1134
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,160
So Dr. Seeker was in, but Dr. Marsh was not in.

1135
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,320
Like, we don't know as much about her.

1136
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,920
But she is, you know, more professional

1137
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:33,240
and just giving you kind of the museum tour you think you're going to get.

1138
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:39,160
And then Dr. Seeker announces that he is not your daddy's doctor

1139
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,440
because he comes on screen with a puppet and makes a weird voice.

1140
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:49,480
And so you immediately are shown that he is a little more oddball and casual.

1141
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,680
Dr. Marsh, kind of dismissive of the old museum,

1142
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,920
kind of like this looks like shit now that we got the time for.

1143
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:06,480
And then and then then so you got Dr. Seeker, who's you know, I did.

1144
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,120
I always liked this video.

1145
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:11,720
This this video is a successful component to me.

1146
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,280
And I like Wallace Langham.

1147
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,080
He's good. He's good. And Larry Sanders,

1148
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:21,680
a very good part of that show, Veronica's Closet.

1149
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,360
I don't know how he is on that.

1150
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,480
I've never seen Veronica's Closet.

1151
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,360
I have not seen it either.

1152
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,960
No, let's keep it that way.

1153
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,000
Let's not start thinking that's a second gate.

1154
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,160
Depends on how long this whole thing quarantine lasts.

1155
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,280
Oh, God, speed it up, speed it up.

1156
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:44,680
But yeah, it's all very this is a very back of the future ride vibe here.

1157
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,800
Maybe too much. So maybe it kind of paved the way too much.

1158
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:52,480
Yes, that might be when I'm analyzing about it,

1159
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,600
like like why maybe it doesn't stick out to me as one of my favorites.

1160
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:01,240
I feel like it does kind of feel like not as good as the back to the future.

1161
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,080
It's like very similar setup.

1162
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,760
It's a time. It's an institute.

1163
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:08,880
This obviously is a dinosaur specific time traveling institute.

1164
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,000
But it all feels less fun.

1165
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:17,120
Oh, to me, let's not forget the first pre show in the queue

1166
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,280
where the exhibits kind of get highlighted.

1167
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,560
Bill Nye is the narrator in that section.

1168
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,520
Very nice choice.

1169
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,760
Bill Nye from Universe of Energy is so much.

1170
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,960
Bill Nye, he was in other stuff and interventions.

1171
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,920
There was so much Disney just owned Bill Nye.

1172
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:35,920
They shoved them everywhere.

1173
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:40,920
I believe they touch the television division, partially funded Bill Nye,

1174
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,920
the science guy, and I think he's still caught up in legal,

1175
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:48,320
like trying to untangle the legal of that

1176
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:54,280
to then put those because those are on Amazon or Netflix.

1177
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,400
The Bill Nye, the science show where they know is a new show.

1178
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,640
That new show. Not sure. Rough.

1179
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,040
Yeah, I haven't seen it.

1180
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,360
I mainly know him from like, you know, I haven't seen a couple of months

1181
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,880
as a new viral thing where he says like, and I should know.

1182
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,440
I'm Bill fucking Nye, bitch or something like that.

1183
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:18,400
Yeah, that's he'll do a video where he swears.

1184
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,640
It's got all the novelty of like Bob Saget swearing.

1185
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,840
It's or standups really dirty.

1186
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,600
I don't know if you know that.

1187
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,760
I look, you know what?

1188
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:33,720
I just recently did that come across my desk that Bob Saget says words

1189
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,520
that I wouldn't expect him to. Yes.

1190
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,920
And I was. Yeah, it's crazy.

1191
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,200
He's all about farts and stuff.

1192
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,240
I haven't gotten over it.

1193
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:44,200
I feel like no way Bill Nye shows up every now and then to if like

1194
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:48,760
some Republican senator named like Turd Trudgley says, like,

1195
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,440
if the Earth's getting hotter, God wants that way.

1196
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,280
And Bill Nye shows up to tut tut them.

1197
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,680
Yes, I think I said this on the universe of energy episode

1198
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:04,680
a few years ago, where it's like Bill Nye smacks down Tucker Carlson on Fox News.

1199
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,080
And then you watch it and he's like, no, the Earth is getting hotter.

1200
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,560
And then it's like that was the clip.

1201
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,440
Oh, snap.

1202
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,000
And then you're like, well, did he really smack him down?

1203
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,480
I don't even he wasn't even didn't even give any good evidence.

1204
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,280
It's according to the Internet.

1205
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,840
There's no interaction on TV that isn't a smackdown or an evisceration.

1206
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:31,160
Yeah. No, this Bill Nye is smacking down left and right, according to the Internet.

1207
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,360
I don't know what he I don't know what he said about the virus pre

1208
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,160
it coming out.

1209
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,200
So I can't well, I don't know.

1210
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,160
I'll look into that.

1211
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,840
Well, he is anti vaccine.

1212
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,960
That's the one weird thing is that.

1213
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,440
No, no.

1214
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,640
That would be so funny if Bill Nye swears by all science.

1215
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:57,000
But he's like, I don't know about these vaccines, though, you know.

1216
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,200
Yeah, he's a big flat earther.

1217
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,720
But besides that,

1218
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,040
everybody just got that one wrong.

1219
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:11,440
What can I say? I'm Bill Nye, bitch.

1220
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,760
I came across I was wondering, did you guys come across the article?

1221
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,640
Do you remember Disney magazine?

1222
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,480
Disney's official magazine that covered Disney?

1223
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,880
Of course. So, you know,

1224
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:29,080
did you guys come across the scans of the article where an editor from that

1225
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:33,640
was like a cast member at Dinosaur for the day on the attraction,

1226
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,320
like worked all the different roles on it?

1227
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,680
Oh, she got a tour before the park opened

1228
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,480
and says this guy, Chuck.

1229
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:46,720
Chuck is the cast member showing her like shadowing her.

1230
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,280
She's shadowing and he's showing around.

1231
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,560
The writer of this article says the dinosaurs are especially eerie.

1232
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,280
Quote, they run all night.

1233
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,960
It's easier on them due to the hydraulic system, explains Chuck.

1234
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:03,920
They're set on night mode and don't go through the full range of motion.

1235
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,040
So they nod and sway gently back and forth.

1236
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:11,080
They're worrying mechanisms audible in the pre-opening silence.

1237
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,680
Yeah. So creepy.

1238
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:15,920
They never stop.

1239
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,920
I per this like 20 plus year old article,

1240
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,960
the dinosaurs just keep moving all night.

1241
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:28,720
Whoa. Is that could that be common with animatronics?

1242
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,760
At least this generally.

1243
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:35,520
I don't know if modern animatronics where the hydraulics are a little different

1244
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,480
or it's electric motors instead of hydraulics.

1245
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:42,120
But just imagining all these weird little dinosaurs

1246
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,760
just kind of swaying all night long is

1247
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,680
is a horrifying image.

1248
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,960
Well, I obviously I don't like the sound of that.

1249
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,960
That scares me. Yeah.

1250
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,200
Makes me makes me turn away and wins.

1251
01:08:55,440 --> 01:09:01,560
I'm going to have a nightmare where I wake up locked in the never ending,

1252
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:06,120
perennially moving over a dinosaur ride overnight.

1253
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,120
And I'm horrified by that.

1254
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:11,720
And then I look down and there's baby Avatar or baby Aladar.

1255
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,120
And maybe have it.

1256
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,120
And I have it.

1257
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,880
I don't like baby avatars either.

1258
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,640
And I and I have to raise him.

1259
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,120
He's my responsibility now.

1260
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,880
Oh, that's yes.

1261
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,240
That would I think you would like that.

1262
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,760
I think that I think you. Yeah, I think you would.

1263
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,520
Are you guys at all comforted by this attraction

1264
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,360
being in the brotherhood of the dirty yellow strap?

1265
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,400
Well, how about most attractions are?

1266
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,960
I guess so. Yeah.

1267
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,720
It's either lap bars or the dirty yellow strap.

1268
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,960
Yeah, a lot of a lot of dirty yellow straps. Yeah.

1269
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,640
Yeah, I yeah, I think I hearing that with the robots.

1270
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:54,640
What is like this?

1271
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,720
What would be the scariest Disney ride to have to spend the night in?

1272
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,320
Like, would it be this one?

1273
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,440
It might be this one.

1274
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,760
Maybe because it's loud and unpleasant.

1275
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,920
And like Indiana Jones, I guess there's a lot of stuff going on, too.

1276
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,040
And that would be scary.

1277
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,880
But like when I would maybe sleep in the room of skulls on Indiana Jones,

1278
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,400
and I feel like that would be OK.

1279
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,880
If you had to stay in the

1280
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,240
are you proposing that we have we can go anywhere in the rides?

1281
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,040
You just have to stay somewhere in the ride.

1282
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,640
I think so. Yeah.

1283
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,800
Well, but what would be what would be the scariest?

1284
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,200
Yeah, like there would be almost like no good spots.

1285
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,280
And like maybe don't count pre shows because there's not a lot of chaos

1286
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,720
in the pre show, but like on the actual ride itself from the ride vehicle on.

1287
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,760
I was going to say if you had to stay in

1288
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:46,640
the Pleasure Island area in Pinocchio's Staring Journey

1289
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:50,880
and the the like the the carnival games were going,

1290
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,640
the like Ding the Bell game was going all night.

1291
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:54,960
That'd be pretty horrible.

1292
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,960
But I could just keep moving into Gepetto's room,

1293
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,320
which has no robots and just a bunch of clocks.

1294
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,280
So that you'd be fine over there.

1295
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,720
But then you have to hear like an old man sobbing all night as he sleeps.

1296
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:11,200
Yeah. Are you are you suggesting set lighting or work lighting,

1297
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:15,120
like work fluorescence or like colored story lighting?

1298
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,800
What do you like? How much of the ride is running?

1299
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:26,600
Oh, I would say like with with the information about dinosaur,

1300
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,880
let's say they're all like that.

1301
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,120
It's like they're in B mode.

1302
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,480
All the animatronics are kind of moving.

1303
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:34,320
It's dark in there because they don't the lights are not unless they're

1304
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,960
like fixing something. So it's mostly show lighting.

1305
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,000
The animatronics may be not moving as crazy as they usually do,

1306
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,560
but they're moving a little bit and the sounds are all still running. OK.

1307
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,560
Yeah, I mean, the sounds are really unnerving.

1308
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,160
There's so much darkness in this ride, although that Disney magazine article,

1309
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:54,240
the editor said that like even the dark sections are set dressed,

1310
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,200
like have plants in them, which then begs the question,

1311
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:01,120
why isn't there a little more lighting even just on some plants? Like

1312
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,640
if there's set dressed, why aren't they lit?

1313
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,920
Yeah, I assume it's because they don't want to like show.

1314
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:13,000
I mean, it's such a big building, but it's like it's kept dark.

1315
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,720
So it kind of makes you feel like maybe there's more out there,

1316
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,280
but it does just kind of feel like you're in a tiny space, honestly.

1317
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,000
It doesn't. I'm kind of I'm kind of if you'll forgive me,

1318
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,040
I'm kind of stuck on the previous on Mike's on your scenario. Yeah, go ahead.

1319
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,280
And I it's you know, they don't it's not there anymore.

1320
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:36,200
But I think I thought of a bad one, which is if you had to be in the

1321
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,880
Wizard of Oz in the great movie, right? Oh, yeah.

1322
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:44,000
Oh, like in the in the like the where the munchkins are all.

1323
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:48,720
Yeah, if it were if it were that bright and you couldn't leave for like

1324
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,360
oh, that's a good. Yeah, that's yeah.

1325
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:55,120
And then like the munchkins kept popping up in the manholes and stuff and

1326
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,840
and follow the yellow brick road was playing over and over again.

1327
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:03,880
That witch or a pretty, pretty realistic animatronic. Yeah.

1328
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,520
Yeah. Anywhere in great movie, right?

1329
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,760
Might be might be a little rough.

1330
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:12,160
Right under the these are bad on alien. Oh, Jesus.

1331
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,800
Like a bed underneath the xenomorph, you'd have to sleep like a cot.

1332
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:22,600
Dear Lord. Yeah, I don't think that I don't know that there's a good spot in

1333
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,080
in great movie ride.

1334
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,720
Is there any beds in that move right?

1335
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,040
Hmm. Jason.

1336
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:34,160
Well, in the gangster scene, there's clearly like some flop house facades.

1337
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,760
Yeah, but those are facades.

1338
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,520
Not even a full flop house.

1339
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:44,040
I bet Bugsy would Bugsy would tell you he could make you sleep with the fishes.

1340
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,280
Yeah. And that's you don't want to do that.

1341
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,040
Right. What about what about like,

1342
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:55,840
could you think you could like sleep on the plane in the Casablanca scene?

1343
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:00,360
Is there a plan allowed, though, if the motors are going on?

1344
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,160
That's true. Maybe not scary.

1345
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:04,600
Maybe that one would just be unpleasant melancholy for me.

1346
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,800
Yeah. Huh. Footlight parade.

1347
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:12,880
Jason, would you sleep in probably footlight parade is the most, you know,

1348
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,720
that's probably the chillest.

1349
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,440
Yeah. Yeah. Huh.

1350
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,920
I'm trying to think.

1351
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,960
Maybe you could go in like a saloon part of the Old West

1352
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,120
where the chaos isn't happening yet.

1353
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,440
Mm hmm. Maybe the exit,

1354
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,280
the little exit area of the Tower of Terror in Florida

1355
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,040
with like the ventriloquist dummy.

1356
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:38,800
Oh, like at least because that's that's kind of a cozy spot.

1357
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,840
I bet you could like find a spot in there.

1358
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,000
Tower of Terror Lobby, the Hollywood Tower Hotel lobby.

1359
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,160
That's that's nice.

1360
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,280
Yeah, but no lobbies. I said no pre shows.

1361
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,560
But that's a literal lobby.

1362
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,600
That's a literal hotel lobby.

1363
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,160
So you know, OK.

1364
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,400
Hmm. Maybe the hallway.

1365
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:00,960
The hallway of Tower of Terror before it becomes a starfield.

1366
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:04,320
I guess then ghosts are just constantly appearing.

1367
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,880
The fourth dimension room, you mean? Yeah.

1368
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,880
Oh, you mean like one of that when it opens the door

1369
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,480
and you see the family down the hall. Yeah.

1370
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,280
Yeah, but there's go. That's a ghost.

1371
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,760
There's a big guy in the fourth dimension.

1372
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,200
Yeah, I mean, that might that's scary.

1373
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,320
So that's I guess I forget what we're actually trying to solve here.

1374
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,400
It's the scariest one.

1375
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,720
So I guess that is a contender.

1376
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:32,680
But if we're trying to pick a nice one to I don't know.

1377
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:35,120
And none of them are ideal. Nothing is ideal.

1378
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:35,640
I'm trying. Yeah.

1379
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:40,400
So what is the what would be the ideal ride to spend the night in?

1380
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,920
What would be the most pleasant?

1381
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,880
Is it maybe, you know, it is probably sleeping under the stars

1382
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,120
and Radiator Springs racer the inside area,

1383
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:51,680
like by the gas station, just sort of sleeping on the ground there.

1384
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,680
That's nice.

1385
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,480
It sounds kind of nice. Yeah.

1386
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:02,520
You know, vibe wise, maybe Peter Pan's flight wouldn't be too bad,

1387
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,680
but I don't know.

1388
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:06,880
I don't want to be on record saying that I would like to spend the night

1389
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,560
in Peter Pan's flight.

1390
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,200
I think that's an arrestable offense.

1391
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:14,480
Yeah, that's probably I mean, yeah, because you'd be in Wendy's room.

1392
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,800
Yeah. You'd be in the Dowling Children's Nursery.

1393
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:23,400
I mean, God, I'm like Robert Downey Jr.

1394
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,320
in 96. Some guy here.

1395
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:30,200
I just fell asleep in this kid's bedroom.

1396
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,920
I guess you could you could, you know, spend it on the ship,

1397
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,200
on Captain Hook's ship.

1398
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:39,080
Yeah, they're just on the ground in Alice somewhere.

1399
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,520
OK, yeah, that's not bad.

1400
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:46,560
The birthday scene would be unpleasant because there's such a such a loud party.

1401
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,240
Keep it down.

1402
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:52,760
Yeah, that's like I guess the most pleasant.

1403
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,880
Oh, you know what? You know what the answer is?

1404
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,200
It's the Navi River journey. Yeah. No.

1405
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,440
What? No.

1406
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:04,080
Well, not in the not not in the room with the I don't like this as much as you guys.

1407
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,160
I hate not not in the room with the shaman.

1408
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,680
Hell no. I'm not spending the night with the shaman.

1409
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,480
I don't know. That's kind of a soothing song.

1410
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,400
I think within earshot would be nice.

1411
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:19,200
Not right. Not like sleeping at the shaman's feet or anything.

1412
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,760
Not her feet.

1413
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:25,040
I think I'd be a little scared of all these like sparkly snakes slithering around

1414
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,840
or whatever the hell is happening in there.

1415
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:29,480
Yeah, it would have to be in the right spot because obviously there's

1416
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:33,840
different beasts flying around and running around.

1417
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:38,320
But like by the by the big the frogs, when the frogs are jumping on the leaves

1418
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:42,240
right there, I feel like, you know, you look up and you just enjoy the

1419
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,200
pandoran frogs hopping from leaf to leaf.

1420
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,360
And you have a nice night's sleep and you can hear in the distance

1421
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:53,880
that beautiful song sung by one of our favorite characters in fiction.

1422
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:58,120
Oh, what about in E.T., the green planet, when they're having a little party

1423
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,960
and they're sliding up and down, there's little water.

1424
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,840
I love I love that.

1425
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,040
But that's going to be how you're going to sleep.

1426
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,600
It's a party. I'll just be up all night.

1427
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,200
Yeah. Be full of piss in there.

1428
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:11,880
Well, you know what, if I want to just get a good dose in,

1429
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,840
I should just go to living with the land, right?

1430
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,880
That's what I do anyway.

1431
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,560
Which part of living with the land would you sleep in?

1432
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:23,280
Would it be in this lab, the science lab?

1433
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,120
I just feel the tomatoes.

1434
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,480
Yeah, that's yeah.

1435
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,280
Yeah. What's really anywhere?

1436
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,400
Any part is completely suitable to sleep.

1437
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,600
What's the softest fruit you could make a bed out of?

1438
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:38,080
Jason. Oh, gosh.

1439
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,600
Yeah, some of those tomatoes.

1440
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,240
Yeah, bananas.

1441
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,760
Depends, I guess, how much they've aged.

1442
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,960
Tomato would might burst my way through.

1443
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:52,720
That'd be like sleeping on like a partially inflated air mattress.

1444
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,840
I think it's all it's all going by the end.

1445
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,680
And then, you know, that ends with a big splatter. Squash, right?

1446
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,680
Maybe a big squash.

1447
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,600
Sleep too hard. I think big squash. Maybe.

1448
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:08,280
I mean, that sounds I would like to see you sleeping on a big squash.

1449
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,640
But I don't think that's going to be comfortable for you.

1450
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,280
Yeah, that's going to be a great photo op.

1451
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:13,720
But I don't know that that's going to give you eight.

1452
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:17,840
Oh, can I sleep on a raft in the in the fish, the fish farms?

1453
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,040
Just on my back with the gators.

1454
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:25,120
Not because it's not going to smell good in there.

1455
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:30,440
Here's a good one on the porch right before you go down the

1456
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:35,400
waterfall on pirates in Disneyland on that porch in the swamp.

1457
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:38,720
That's good. Any porches or the porch in living with the land

1458
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,320
right before the thunderstorm, you get a little white noise.

1459
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,120
Yeah, yeah.

1460
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,720
Well, that'd be nice because there's no like animatronics

1461
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:50,480
bothering you or anything happening that might distract you from getting.

1462
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,840
You're actually wrong. There's an animatronic dog right there. But.

1463
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,280
But he's not doing jack shit.

1464
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:00,280
So that's fine. I'll sleep soundly.

1465
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,080
Mm hmm. Yeah.

1466
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:06,760
So look, I mean, another will throw again, throw this out to the listener.

1467
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,600
What ride would you not want to sleep on?

1468
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,560
And what ride would you want to sleep on?

1469
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,360
Sleep in, I should say.

1470
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:15,120
Yeah, let us know.

1471
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,760
And then we'll kill a whole episode reading each and every response. Yeah.

1472
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,720
We thought it's a lot filled. I'm wasting.

1473
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:28,000
I like that we got to have a lot of time not talking about dinosaur.

1474
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:31,840
That was nice. But maybe we should get back to it

1475
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,840
so that we can stop one day.

1476
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,520
Any other any other thoughts about dinosaur?

1477
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:39,880
Well, I was trying to figure out like I we were talking about.

1478
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,800
We've talked about this before. We're living with the land.

1479
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,640
I've talked about how I think Soren is better in California

1480
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,000
because of the facade and because of outside.

1481
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,520
And I find like I think we even underestimate sometimes how much

1482
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:56,080
all of the stuff around a ride makes us want to go on.

1483
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:59,280
It's like Tower of Terror even California, which I know it's missing

1484
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,280
the the room in Florida.

1485
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:04,560
But like we didn't go on it that much, even though it's a great ride

1486
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,040
and it's a fun ride system and they change it into Guardians of the Galaxy.

1487
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,200
And it's like my favorite ride in Disneyland now.

1488
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:16,280
But I'm trying to figure out like I find so much of the queue on this ride,

1489
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:19,160
like not that fun. I don't like the building.

1490
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:21,560
I don't like it.

1491
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,560
Nothing draws me to it. It's out of the way.

1492
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:25,920
Like, you know, like mustard pipes.

1493
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:28,800
I love mustard pipes, but I'll be honest, I didn't know about them

1494
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,840
until, you know, five hours ago.

1495
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:36,800
It's mustard pipes, the voice of Bill Nye, Aladar splashing in a fountain.

1496
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,880
But I don't think I guess what I'm what I'm getting at is

1497
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:43,440
I think the ride is actually better than I give it credit for.

1498
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,440
I think the ride is better than

1499
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,320
than my memory of it is.

1500
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,000
And even though I'm apparently still terrified of it,

1501
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:55,320
I think with like a different framing device or a different show building,

1502
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,440
I think I make a, you know, point to go to it.

1503
01:21:58,840 --> 01:21:59,800
Every time.

1504
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,360
Let me ask, this hasn't really come up.

1505
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,640
Were you guys dinosaur kids?

1506
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:07,280
Were you ever did you ever have a dinosaur phase?

1507
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:11,280
A little bit, but nothing major.

1508
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:16,720
Not not not big time, but yeah, I dug them and I yeah,

1509
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:19,400
I certainly look forward to like, you know,

1510
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:23,040
any museum trip that involves seeing bones or whatever.

1511
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:27,360
Yeah, I remember I had like little models of them.

1512
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,840
I, you know, I feel like it lasted for like three months.

1513
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:33,040
And then I was back to Ninja Turtles, probably.

1514
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,800
Yeah, I feel like I had a little fit.

1515
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,680
I probably the way you guys are talking,

1516
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,960
I probably had the biggest dinosaur phase.

1517
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,720
I'm going to go ahead and say there is a chunk of our listeners

1518
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,040
who had a dinosaur phase.

1519
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,920
And I'm very curious if people who were big dinosaur kids

1520
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,960
like this ride more, you know.

1521
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,360
Yeah, I see what you're saying.

1522
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,360
But also like, you know, Jurassic,

1523
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:01,080
the original Jurassic Park ride is fantastic. Yeah.

1524
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,640
And I, you know, like it a lot more.

1525
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:07,840
And I don't think it's just because it's tied to the movie

1526
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,280
because it's like you don't see any like other human actors.

1527
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,560
There's no robot really on that ride.

1528
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:17,520
So I think it's just a better ride in general.

1529
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,600
I mean, I think that's not controversial what I'm saying.

1530
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,760
I'm not some genius who's come to that conclusion.

1531
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,840
Yeah, I think that's right.

1532
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,440
I mean, I like I do like this ride.

1533
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,520
I really liked it when I was younger,

1534
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,800
but I wrote it when we went down

1535
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,480
last year to when we were in Orlando, I wrote it.

1536
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,680
And I liked it.

1537
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,920
It did strike me how much of the ride is hidden by darkness.

1538
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:41,960
But yeah, I had a nice time.

1539
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,600
Yeah, short wait, pretty short wait when I was there.

1540
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,160
Another thing, when you compare it to Indy, which is unfair,

1541
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:51,880
but it's also fair because it's the same thing,

1542
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:52,960
same track and everything.

1543
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,720
It's like this one, it feels small.

1544
01:23:56,720 --> 01:24:01,720
Indy, Indy, you really like feel like, oh, my God, we're in this giant temple.

1545
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,840
And it's like art directed well.

1546
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,080
And your eye goes to these different scenes.

1547
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,640
And like it's such a it's such a giant,

1548
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:13,920
crazy experience going on in these still to this day. Yeah.

1549
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:18,080
And this almost feels like you're on a bigger, like dark ride.

1550
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:22,920
Like this feels like somehow much smaller in scale.

1551
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:26,920
For like, like imagine you have never been on this ride and imagine you're like,

1552
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:29,480
OK, here you have the track for Indiana Jones.

1553
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:31,680
You have that size show building.

1554
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:35,040
It's going to be it's going to be the exact same ride, except dinosaurs.

1555
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,880
And you'd be like, holy shit.

1556
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:40,560
You would imagine like turning the corner when you see like the giant temple

1557
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:44,040
in Indiana Jones, but like a giant dinosaur in the distance or something.

1558
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:45,480
You'd be like, oh, my God.

1559
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,160
It doesn't feel like that at all.

1560
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:49,320
It absolutely I hear exactly what you're saying.

1561
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:52,920
Yeah, it feels like you go into like little tiny show scenes.

1562
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:57,440
Where a dinosaur pokes out and you go, oh, that's not it.

1563
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,160
And then you move on.

1564
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:02,360
It's like it's weird. I don't know.

1565
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,760
It's a room of small rooms and false guessing.

1566
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:08,880
Yeah, it's not again. I don't it's not bad.

1567
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,040
I think it's better than I'm giving it credit for.

1568
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,440
But there's just a lot of like little things where I go.

1569
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:18,720
Well, if you have all the same resources as Indiana Jones,

1570
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,560
I don't know why the ride itself feels like this.

1571
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:26,560
From Q pre show to the actual ride itself.

1572
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:29,440
It's so I don't know. I don't know why.

1573
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,000
I just should be better.

1574
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
There's not enough tricks.

1575
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,640
The dinosaur is either I guess more at you or they fly over you.

1576
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:40,760
And that's kind of it.

1577
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:43,760
Yeah, I guess it's I mean, the limitations from just having

1578
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,480
animatronic dinosaurs, I'm sure is a big part of it.

1579
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,800
But it should I don't know why the scope isn't somebody's going to be mad at me.

1580
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,640
A lot of people will be mad at me for saying this,

1581
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,160
because I think this is actually like a sleeper ride for people. But

1582
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:57,320
I think it might be. Yeah, I know.

1583
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,880
I don't know that people will agree with what we're landing on.

1584
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:03,920
And we just kind of don't like it. But we we can't lie. I don't know.

1585
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,560
Jurassic Park has a scope.

1586
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:11,240
There's a scope to it like dinosaurs in general should be.

1587
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:15,960
You should feel like the first, you know, that scene of in Jurassic Park

1588
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:19,560
where they see, I forget which dinosaurs, the long necked dinosaurs,

1589
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:23,240
where they're like, it's that wow moment where you go, oh, my God, it's dinosaurs.

1590
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,920
And they have that same moment, which they, of course, have gotten rid of

1591
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:29,680
on the new Jurassic Park, Jurassic World ride, where you go into the thing

1592
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:33,400
and you go, welcome to Jurassic Park and the majesty and how big

1593
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:37,000
the dinosaurs are. And I feel like you get even more of that

1594
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:41,160
from the universe of energy than you do from here.

1595
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,800
I totally yes. You know what?

1596
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,760
Because the bronis are so tall.

1597
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,640
I don't feel like any of these dinosaurs are tall.

1598
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:53,120
I think it's just missing like taller ceilings, bigger.

1599
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:55,800
Right. Isn't the isn't the carnivore

1600
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:59,240
carnivorous kind of kind of short?

1601
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,920
It feels like that. I mean,

1602
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:04,040
and then when you think of the Indiana Jones building,

1603
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,880
I don't know if this building is maybe doesn't have as high a ceiling,

1604
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:10,880
but Indiana Jones building feels like it's 10 stories tall.

1605
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:14,720
I'm sure it's not that tall, but it feels so tall

1606
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:17,120
and it feels so expensive.

1607
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,920
The scale, the scale is much bigger.

1608
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,280
The theater tricks work better on Indiana Jones.

1609
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,360
I mean, I'll agree for sure. I agree with that.

1610
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:32,120
Well, and if we're comparing it to both the Jurassic Park ride

1611
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:36,320
and the Indiana Jones, which all feels kind of fair, both are.

1612
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:41,080
Unfortunately, both are tied to film franchises that we really love

1613
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:44,800
and no knock on Aladar and Kron or anything.

1614
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,120
But it's of no never want to offend Kron, never

1615
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:52,120
know. And that's

1616
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,280
praise be to Kron in Kron, we trust.

1617
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:02,200
But it's not only that you in both Jurassic Park and

1618
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:05,440
Indiana Jones, you're getting not just the connection to the franchise we love,

1619
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:10,240
but also the stirring score of both and moments being punctuated by

1620
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,880
this score that gives us feelings otherwise.

1621
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,720
And then this just doesn't have music.

1622
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,320
It's just like, is that it?

1623
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,160
No, not our dino.

1624
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:22,800
Vroom, just loud sounds.

1625
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,720
And there's no majesty in this.

1626
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:27,680
It's just it's very stressful.

1627
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,920
I feel like it's like uncut gems.

1628
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,600
Very much right.

1629
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:36,480
It's like because I think when you're in the in the queue,

1630
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:40,960
the queue is sort of setting you up for more of a Jurassic Park type experience.

1631
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,440
Yes, it's very like, look at how big these things were.

1632
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:46,880
Isn't this amazing? Like dinosaurs existed.

1633
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,480
They were big.

1634
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:54,320
And then the ride is this like very like, you know, tense, unpleasant thing.

1635
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:58,880
I mean, I almost think it would be better if it was like the ride was called Dino

1636
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:02,960
Hunters. And, you know, you went through like this

1637
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:07,200
Transformers style base and they were like, all right, here's the deal.

1638
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,640
We need to kill as many dinosaurs as we can.

1639
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:14,280
Dinosaurs have been running amok in this part of the jungle.

1640
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:20,000
Like it would get you at least in the right head space for this type of ride.

1641
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:23,760
Come back with Kron's body or you don't get to come back.

1642
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:29,480
Deliver the head of Kron to my desk, or you will be drummed out of the academy.

1643
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,440
We are Dino Hunters.

1644
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,520
And it's like, all right, dinosaurs are the enemy.

1645
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:40,720
We're getting ready for like a very like tense ride, kind of a thrill experience.

1646
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:44,560
Is it like the end of it's a video that starts with a guy.

1647
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:48,200
The lights are off and he's just a silhouette and then a light hits him.

1648
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:52,920
And he's wearing like a velociraptor hide as a big trench coat with.

1649
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,480
Yes, that's good.

1650
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:59,600
And that shows you that he's had previously successful missions.

1651
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,800
I guess we want a Joe Exotic, I guess.

1652
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:05,440
Yes. I have dinosaurs.

1653
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,520
That's a.

1654
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:10,520
I kind of think that we would all be sort of less conflicted

1655
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,760
because because I'm trying to work through my feelings here.

1656
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:17,800
I think we'd all be a little less conflicted if it was all sort of a unifying thing.

1657
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:21,640
If it all felt like a unified ride.

1658
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,600
It shouldn't be very warm at the beginning

1659
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,520
and up through like it's a warm building.

1660
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:31,440
You look at it's the wonder of seeing dinosaur bones.

1661
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:35,360
You meet Felicia Rashad, who's a very warm personality.

1662
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:38,720
And then it hands off to, you know, will weasel Dr.

1663
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:41,000
Seeker and then it's all unpleasant after that.

1664
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,760
It's like there's a hard divide there.

1665
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:46,720
So you want an all warm ride or a ride that's all murdering.

1666
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:50,160
It really ups the tension at the end.

1667
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:54,040
Once it starts counting down to a catastrophic meteor strike,

1668
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:58,200
which is kind of a neat trick, but also like, oh, well,

1669
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,760
I know this ride is going to be oversuit.

1670
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:03,520
They are counting down until the end of it.

1671
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,200
Yeah, that's weird, too.

1672
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,520
Yes, you're right.

1673
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:10,640
You're like in a hurry the whole time.

1674
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:14,440
Yeah. And I mean, there's obviously contradictions to what I'm saying.

1675
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:18,240
There's rides that are sort of like, you know, fronts for like fake.

1676
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,760
Like they're much more pleasant in the queue and everything.

1677
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,320
It's just I feel like it eases you into what's happening more than this one does.

1678
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:30,760
It's just Jurassic Park is very warm and then very severe,

1679
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:34,840
but not until the climb and the climb is the transition.

1680
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:38,960
So you get the wonder of dinosaurs and then you get the terror of dinosaurs.

1681
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:42,280
And this kind of doesn't ever give you wonder.

1682
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:46,200
The entire actual ride part is just very stressful.

1683
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:49,360
And also, I think I don't know exactly how I've presented it,

1684
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:55,280
but I kind of feel like a good ride has like three or four, five moves.

1685
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:57,720
Like different little things that you go, oh, yeah.

1686
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,560
And then that happened. It was cool. Oh, that happened.

1687
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:01,960
It was cool. And it could be anything.

1688
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:04,840
It could be Optimus Prime saying he's proud of you.

1689
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:06,840
It could be like a little drop, whatever it is.

1690
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,720
This doesn't know that I consider that a move, but OK,

1691
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:14,520
well, I move is maybe not the best way to drop and being told you're proud

1692
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,040
or both moves. Well, a moment.

1693
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:20,800
I should say moments, different moments where you go, oh, and that was cool.

1694
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:23,080
This is the same moment over and over again.

1695
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:27,320
Yeah, which is like, oh, God.

1696
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:35,760
Yeah. So it's yeah, I, I really don't think I'm as negative as I'm sounding like it now.

1697
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,000
I'm just trying to figure out what it is about it.

1698
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:44,320
Well, let me let me ask, will this story change your opinion?

1699
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:49,120
The biggest news story about this attraction in the last 10 years.

1700
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,400
Do you guys know about this?

1701
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:57,000
I think 2013, a woman found a loaded gun in a ride vehicle.

1702
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:02,960
So that person was thinking that they had the dinosaur hunter idea before I did.

1703
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:09,960
And they wanted to be prepared to, I guess, yeah, to shoot the carnitourists.

1704
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,800
Thankfully, did not open fire on the carnitourists,

1705
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,440
turned the attraction into cast members, cast members passed it along,

1706
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:21,720
turned the gun into cast members, passed it along to the authorities.

1707
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:26,560
The owner of the gun said he did not know about Disney's policy against weapons

1708
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,640
and he did have a concealed weapons permit.

1709
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:35,320
So that was, you know, that could just happen before they had the metal detectors.

1710
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,000
Yeah, that was the old days.

1711
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,200
I'm sure there's no way anybody could sneak anything weird in now.

1712
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,120
Sure, it's a foolproof system.

1713
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,600
Yeah, that's a little bit scary.

1714
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:51,920
You got to be protected in case, I don't know, Pluto comes at you.

1715
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:53,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You really.

1716
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:55,080
How does he know all the other?

1717
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:59,360
How does he know all the plush characters don't have weapons as well?

1718
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:03,800
Yeah. Well, I think maybe they were also like thinking like, well, on the safari

1719
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:07,640
to we should be prepared.

1720
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:10,080
You know, in case a giraffe.

1721
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:13,520
Attacks us notoriously aggressive animals.

1722
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:18,840
Yeah. Yeah, that's the story.

1723
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:23,880
I was reading and this is I forget where I was reading it, so forgive me.

1724
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:27,400
There's been a lot of chatter recently in the last few years

1725
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:30,280
about them doing something to this ride.

1726
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:36,160
Like probably like the biggest rumor, of course, is that they're going to make it

1727
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:39,360
into the Indiana Jones ride. Yeah. Right.

1728
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:44,280
But there was a new thing I read and this might be new as of a year or two ago.

1729
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:47,000
And who knows, of course, with the state of the economy right now,

1730
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,320
when anything ever will happen with theme parks again, honestly,

1731
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:54,040
I am wondering if the epic world,

1732
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:57,040
whatever the third universal park even happens now, who knows?

1733
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:00,000
Oh, no, it might not.

1734
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,840
I wonder if Mario will just sit there at Universal Hollywood for like

1735
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:07,280
unbuilt for five years after this, who knows?

1736
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:10,680
And that is too sad to think about.

1737
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,760
Sorry. Sorry to bring everyone down again.

1738
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,480
Now, now we're sad.

1739
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:17,800
Now, Jason, finally, it's hit him.

1740
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:20,320
How this whole thing is a bummer.

1741
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:24,360
I mean, I'm just feeling really excited and cool about like, oh, cool.

1742
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:27,760
Going on a ride and finding a gun. Neat.

1743
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:32,280
Yeah, sorry. And then you brought us down. Sorry.

1744
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,280
The idea of lifeless Koopa troopers,

1745
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:39,960
let alone Koopa paratroopers.

1746
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:43,000
Oh, so sad. They'll never move again.

1747
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:48,520
But I read and this now I was like, I was always like, oh, I guess that's OK.

1748
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:51,360
If they just put the Indiana Jones right over there, it's like, obviously,

1749
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,280
we'd all want a new ride, cooler ride.

1750
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:58,400
But someone brought up the speculation or I guess the rumor that

1751
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:03,160
they would keep the dinosaurs on the ride in Indiana Jones would be added to the ride.

1752
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:07,120
Oh, yeah. And I was like, I was like, hell, yes.

1753
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:11,120
Yeah, I was thinking like, yeah, Indiana Jones has met aliens now,

1754
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,600
but he hasn't met dinosaurs yet.

1755
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,960
I think I was like, oh, like Indiana Jones goes to the island of the dinosaurs.

1756
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:20,000
You sign me up.

1757
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,280
I mean, I guess you could go in the time machine, too.

1758
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,920
But I like the idea. There's like a secret island of dinosaurs.

1759
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:29,280
And then I was like, OK, yep, yep. Let's do that.

1760
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:33,640
Remember, remember in the like Saturday afternoon, like syndicated

1761
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:37,560
cheapie dramas, there was a lost world show for a while.

1762
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:42,360
The is it Jules Verne or Robert Louis Louis Stevenson lost world,

1763
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:46,880
but very conveniently done when the movie lost world was in the air.

1764
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:49,280
I don't remember this at all.

1765
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,160
Oh, because that title was up for grabs.

1766
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:53,840
Yes. So you can confuse people.

1767
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,120
Sir, Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World. That's who it was.

1768
01:36:57,640 --> 01:37:00,080
Oh, OK. So, yeah.

1769
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:04,480
So if if there's ever any money freed up to do anything to dinosaur the next decade,

1770
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:10,200
I fully fully rubber stamp Indiana Jones meets the dinosaurs.

1771
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:12,320
So what are the moments of this?

1772
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:16,280
Do we get to see him like like whip a raptor?

1773
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:20,080
He probably has to at least whip toward a raptor.

1774
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:24,360
I think there should be a scene where he's in one of the dinosaurs mouths.

1775
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:27,760
His his feet are sticking out like wiggling,

1776
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,640
like he's about to be eaten by a dinosaur.

1777
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:34,800
And then like he does something to free himself or we help him free,

1778
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:37,760
get free from the dinosaur.

1779
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:41,040
You can tell that there's trouble because like a, you know,

1780
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,840
like a baby triceratops ended up with his hat.

1781
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,920
Oh, yeah, that's good.

1782
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:49,440
I mean, that let's see what else.

1783
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:53,680
He brought a Nazi with him and you get to see a T.

1784
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:56,400
Rex devour and that's the yeah, perfect.

1785
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:01,200
Maybe like there's a big dino and he like kind of looks at you

1786
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:03,120
and he goes, at least it's not a snake.

1787
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:04,400
Yeah, that's good.

1788
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,880
There's a boulder that starts rolling or so you think,

1789
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:15,960
but when it gets a little more lit, it's a it's a big brontosaurus shit.

1790
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,040
It's Aladar shit.

1791
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,560
It's an it's an iguanodon giant shit

1792
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:27,880
rolling toward Indiana Jones in the vehicle.

1793
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,080
Oh, cover your nose.

1794
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,080
It's a big one.

1795
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:33,560
Oh, cover your nose is everyone.

1796
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:34,520
Oh, no.

1797
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:38,720
And then you can use like that grass, like that dirt grass smell from Soren.

1798
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:44,760
And then you then you go around the corner and then you see like the wreckage.

1799
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:48,560
But it's that it all it all hit him and it's like Biff and the manure.

1800
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:49,800
It's like Biff and the manure.

1801
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:53,360
And there should be another ride vehicle stuck in it, like another time.

1802
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,280
Time over vehicle.

1803
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:56,960
Time Rover, thank you.

1804
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,840
An animatronic of you wincing

1805
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:03,800
stuck in a big pile of iguanodon shit.

1806
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:06,480
That's great. Yeah.

1807
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,520
This ride sounds so much better.

1808
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:12,120
This is great. Indiana Jones versus the dinosaurs.

1809
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:15,640
Is it? Wait, did you use you said the island of dynasty?

1810
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:18,360
Would it be called Indiana Jones and the island of dinosaurs?

1811
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:20,680
That was my suggestion.

1812
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:23,080
I like it. My temple of dinosaurs.

1813
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:25,680
Yeah. My suggestion was like it's not there's no time travel.

1814
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:26,920
It's just like there's a secret.

1815
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:30,440
Like he finds an island that still has dinosaurs on it somewhere.

1816
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,760
This is what I've complained about this four or five times,

1817
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:35,960
I'm sure, on the show at this point.

1818
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:39,760
But this is what George Lucas's sort of idea was, not specifically dinosaurs,

1819
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,760
but was going to be every movie was a different crazy genre.

1820
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:45,920
Every. Yeah. Every genre of like pulp novel.

1821
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:51,520
Right. So like like his idea was Indiana Jones and the Saucer Men from Mars.

1822
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:54,760
And it would have been like, I think like Mars Attacks meets Indiana Jones,

1823
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,400
which is awesome.

1824
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,600
And then Temple of Doom came out and people were like,

1825
01:39:58,600 --> 01:39:59,800
this isn't like the first one.

1826
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:02,760
And then they just have been remaking the first movie ever since.

1827
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:07,920
Guys, I got to tell you, I just found the best eBay item.

1828
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:14,200
Rare Disney 2000 Dinosaur movie, Baby Aladar, Pop-Up Watch.

1829
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:19,320
Whoa, what do you mean pop up?

1830
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:21,800
Watch pops out of an egg.

1831
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:25,040
And there's a very small LCD screen.

1832
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:28,160
All right. I've made it.

1833
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,440
I've made it. I don't mind.

1834
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:32,880
I don't mind this guy. He is not as horrifying to me.

1835
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:35,840
I've made an offer for $10.

1836
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,080
I like him more.

1837
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,640
I like this plastic baby Aladar more.

1838
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,600
Actually, actually, you know what?

1839
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,640
Their shipping is five.

1840
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:45,360
Let me make an offer for $8 or $7.

1841
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:49,000
Then let me break down my feelings.

1842
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:51,880
Plastic toy, Baby Aladar.

1843
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:55,080
Fine. I feel like I've filmed Baby Aladar.

1844
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:59,560
Hell no. I don't like Baby Aladar in this watch nearly as much as I do with CGI.

1845
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:02,480
Yeah, I got to agree with Mike.

1846
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,600
It's because I said I like it.

1847
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:07,160
It's not. No, that's why it's not.

1848
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,400
The other baby's better.

1849
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:14,440
If I if I if I sent you guys a 4am text out of nowhere, out of context,

1850
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:17,440
a baby Aladar, you would all say this is bad.

1851
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,880
I'm going back. There's no way I will pass a lie detector test.

1852
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:25,480
Hook me to a lie detector and ask me about the cuteness of all these characters.

1853
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:27,680
I've said I like madness.

1854
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:30,120
I do. I do a podcast with maniacs.

1855
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:33,920
I think, look, I'm very, very sane when it comes to cuteness.

1856
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:38,680
I am very within my mental faculties.

1857
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,960
I found I found an Aladar

1858
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:46,960
adult Aladar McDonnell rubber dino hand.

1859
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:49,520
Oh, I just said you the hand puppet.

1860
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:52,040
Now, this is that.

1861
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:54,760
Oh, you did. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1862
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:57,320
I hate this.

1863
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:00,440
We're back to hate for me.

1864
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:02,920
Aladar hand puppet.

1865
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:05,200
It's a little too expensive.

1866
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:06,800
And I have too much too many toys.

1867
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:11,600
But if anyone has an Aladar rubber hand puppet and we do a live show in the next decade,

1868
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:15,040
feel free to gift this to me.

1869
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:18,840
Um, I'll I'll say this, though, after all of this

1870
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:23,400
animosity between me and baby Aladar, we could make up for all of it.

1871
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:26,720
If when Indiana Jones goes to the island of dinosaurs,

1872
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:29,640
if we get to see baby Aladar eating Mutt Williams,

1873
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:33,840
all is forgiven, baby Aladar.

1874
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,680
Oh, man. Baby Aladar eating Mutt Williams.

1875
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:38,280
Just the leg. Yeah.

1876
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:39,360
Again, just the legs.

1877
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,640
You see him like like writhing around.

1878
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:43,240
Just his cuff denim.

1879
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:44,160
Oh, yes.

1880
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,040
I.

1881
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:51,200
His blue suede shoes, which played on the ground.

1882
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,600
Well, did we do it?

1883
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:56,760
Did we survive? I guess.

1884
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:59,840
I think so. Well, the last this isn't anything I really need to say,

1885
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:04,160
but it's the last note I had was that I think it's clear that they picked Carna.

1886
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:05,840
I can always carna sort.

1887
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:06,920
Now I can't say anything.

1888
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:09,280
Carnasaurus, Carnotaurus, what?

1889
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:11,520
Carnotaurus. Geez.

1890
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:14,080
We've I've lost my mind trying to remember all these names.

1891
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,560
I. It's gone.

1892
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:19,880
It's pretty clear.

1893
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:23,960
It's pretty clear to me that they were like, OK, we cannot have

1894
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:28,320
the T-Rex be at the end like Jurassic Park ride.

1895
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:32,960
So let's come up with a different dinosaur that's almost exactly

1896
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,680
the same as a T-Rex in scary.

1897
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,520
That's what I was saying.

1898
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:39,120
They had recently discovered that one

1899
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:42,600
and they conveniently slotted it in.

1900
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:43,920
But I have to.

1901
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,400
That's I mean, I think I'm not making some genius point here,

1902
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:49,440
but don't you don't you think that's why they chose this dinosaur?

1903
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:52,120
Oh, for sure. Yeah, I think early on they probably were like, well,

1904
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:54,800
obviously the scariest big one is a T-Rex.

1905
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:58,920
But yeah, that is complicated when it's so identifiable.

1906
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,360
It seems like they went with a bunch of dinosaurs

1907
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:05,240
that were not used in Jurassic Park, like the common ones.

1908
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:08,440
There's a raptor. There is a raptor in this ride.

1909
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:11,240
It's not really a super scary moment.

1910
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:14,680
I don't know. It's hard to make the raptor scary in the universal one, too.

1911
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:19,320
Well, supposedly that if I mean, I think this

1912
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:22,440
the roller coaster is being built for islands next year.

1913
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:24,200
So maybe that one will have to be finished.

1914
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:28,240
Yeah. But supposedly that is a little a little section in the raptor cages.

1915
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:33,040
So let's see if they can make the raptors as scary as they are in the movie. Yeah.

1916
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:38,000
We'll see. We'll see what the future of dinosaur based entertainment holds.

1917
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,320
Something to look forward to in a crazy time.

1918
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:43,320
That's right. At least someday.

1919
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:44,920
I think there will be robot dinosaurs again.

1920
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:48,160
I'm hoping we get a live action CG at Aladar.

1921
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:49,520
You know what I'm saying?

1922
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:54,400
I think Aladar on Disney Plus, Baby Aladar,

1923
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:58,000
sort of the better call Saul for Aladar

1924
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:01,240
and dinosaur to see him as a baby.

1925
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:05,920
So multiple seasons of Baby Aladar to see what happens.

1926
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:10,200
Baby Aladar to see what formed him, how he got his principles,

1927
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:13,800
to see what shaped him as a as an adult man dinosaur.

1928
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:16,360
Sounds great. I think that's all great. Yeah.

1929
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:22,800
And I think Jason Sheridan should motion cap the Aladar.

1930
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:26,520
If called to serve the baby, Aladar called to serve.

1931
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:31,080
Yeah, I'm a little baby.

1932
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:33,560
I'm just baby Aladar.

1933
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:35,320
Jason, could you do a little?

1934
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:37,000
I'm yawning.

1935
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,320
Jason, do a little of your baby Aladar for us.

1936
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,000
Does it sound like Stitch? I don't know. It might.

1937
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,200
I'm hungry for plant.

1938
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,960
Oh, wow. He's a little baby. He's cute. He has a cute voice.

1939
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:51,360
Oh, Jesus. Say I'm hungry for plants again for me.

1940
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,760
I'm hungry for plant.

1941
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:56,800
Adorable. Plant singular?

1942
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:59,360
Plant? I'm wiggling. What am I doing?

1943
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:03,120
Oh, wow. I love this.

1944
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:05,240
This is great. I made a little peepee.

1945
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:08,360
This is definitely cute.

1946
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:10,920
Do you like baby?

1947
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:14,560
Do you like baby from dinosaurs better than baby Aladar?

1948
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,680
Do you think cute? Yes. Yes.

1949
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:20,000
I may like baby from dinosaurs better, but I don't know that I think baby

1950
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:22,960
from dinosaurs is baby Sinclair is not cuter,

1951
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,200
but baby Sinclair is more like funny and endearing.

1952
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:31,040
Yeah, baby. I think he is more aesthetically pleasing. Hmm.

1953
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:34,480
Well, there's going to be a lot of debate raging when this comes out.

1954
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:39,960
Yeah. Scott banging on a keyboard to write us a stern letter about

1955
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:42,520
doesn't like baby Aladar.

1956
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:48,640
Truly, this is madness.

1957
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:54,680
Although, oh, God, I just looked at baby baby Sinclair toy.

1958
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,200
I wait, where did it go?

1959
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:00,840
God, it was like I imagined it in a

1960
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:06,200
Shuko esque fashion. I saw like a bunch of unpainted baby Sinclair.

1961
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:07,960
Oh, my God. It went away.

1962
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:10,040
It was in the preview and now I'm not.

1963
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:12,080
There's some horrifying babies and clear dolls.

1964
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:14,720
Oh, yeah, I found one.

1965
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:16,520
Maybe what I'm fine.

1966
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:19,280
I don't maybe I don't want to raise a baby dinosaur.

1967
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,680
That's what I'm going to see.

1968
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:24,320
That one's that one's OK.

1969
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,120
OK, well, we'll buy that for you.

1970
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:29,600
I don't like that it says, got to try me, got to try me.

1971
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:33,320
Try me.

1972
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:35,320
Oh, here we go. Try me.

1973
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:39,920
Here's a child's baby Sinclair costume.

1974
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:45,040
You know, oh, God, oh, no.

1975
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:47,480
Oh, he's got like a plush.

1976
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:54,960
It's like a foam head and a big diaper and separate skin tone pants.

1977
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:58,120
This is not good.

1978
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:01,320
OK, look, I'm going to I'm going to hit the escape

1979
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:04,440
patch from this video or from this video from this episode.

1980
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:05,760
You survived, but I guess the right.

1981
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:10,400
But I'll also say I'll tie this into the socials by saying go to our Twitter

1982
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:16,160
and perhaps also our Instagram or Facebook to see some of these horrifying things.

1983
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:19,240
But also one more thing.

1984
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:21,840
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1985
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:23,040
What is this weird?

1986
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,200
I don't know. Like a knockoff ripoff.

1987
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,200
As

1988
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:32,880
well, you can see lots of horrifying baby Sinclair's and allodars

1989
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:35,640
at our at our Twitter, if I guess the ride.

1990
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:38,000
Oh, God, please stop. Please stop.

1991
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:43,320
Let me let me, though, also send you what I think is the is the ultimate

1992
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:46,160
in 2000 dinosaur aesthetics.

1993
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:47,960
You guys check your text messages.

1994
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:53,240
I got to check out a little of the dinosaur Gameboy Color Game.

1995
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:54,280
Oh, wow.

1996
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:57,240
The stills of this that I'm sending and I'll post on Twitter,

1997
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:00,400
I think are like vapor wave masterpieces.

1998
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:01,560
Oh, good.

1999
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:03,520
These are these are unbelievable.

2000
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,320
I hate the aesthetic of the film.

2001
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:07,200
This I'd watch a whole movie of this.

2002
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,680
No problem. Oh, yeah.

2003
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:12,000
This is like you could imagine like some like city pop playing.

2004
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:13,440
Yes, yes.

2005
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:15,720
These are all like album covers waiting to happen.

2006
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:18,120
Like Aladar is blue.

2007
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:20,560
He's like he's a very royal blue.

2008
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:24,200
There's a weird thing that says in really eight bit font.

2009
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:27,960
These pillars indicate the exit and it looks like blood.

2010
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:30,760
These stones, I don't know what I'm looking at there.

2011
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:36,000
And then a close up of a very pixelated Aladar eye that says

2012
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:37,960
Lemur Island is gone.

2013
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:39,360
These are great.

2014
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:45,400
And then and then this really like sad gathering of four dinosaurs.

2015
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:46,600
You can't tell what half of them are.

2016
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:50,240
And then I like step down eight bit rainbow and it says you win.

2017
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:54,760
These are this is like some of the best aesthetics I've ever seen.

2018
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:57,760
So credit to the makers of the game.

2019
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:00,960
That song, Lemur Island is gone.

2020
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:05,520
If you're a vapor wave artist,

2021
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:08,360
take Lemur Island is gone for an album, please.

2022
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:10,520
It's waiting. It's waiting for you.

2023
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:14,400
I was doing a lot of I texted you, I was doing I'm listening to a lot of marauder.

2024
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:16,720
Hey, that's good news.

2025
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:19,520
That's smart. Oh, very good.

2026
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,000
Any discoveries and you want to share?

2027
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,560
Do you have you do you know the Giorgio Marauder and Joe Esposito album?

2028
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:26,640
Solitary, you mentioned who's Joe Esposito?

2029
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:30,400
I actually don't. I forget he's there's a song he has.

2030
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:32,320
I got to look it back up.

2031
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,480
But the album is fantastic.

2032
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:37,040
Wow. OK. It's like I.

2033
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:39,120
Yeah, he's I got to look him up here.

2034
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:43,040
He's a singer. He he's an older man.

2035
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:45,480
He's a

2036
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:48,200
I'm stalling his older man's here while I look it up.

2037
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:52,480
He's he's written songs, Donna Summer, Rita Franklin.

2038
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:55,080
I'm trying to think of what his

2039
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:56,080
I don't know.

2040
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:58,520
But look, the point the point is,

2041
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:02,360
look at the stills that we're posting of the dinosaur Game Boy Color game.

2042
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:06,760
And, you know, by the way, in general, Game Boy Color,

2043
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,720
there's some pretty fun stuff on Game Boy Color.

2044
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:11,840
I was not aware of this area,

2045
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:14,200
but I found a Game Boy Color game.

2046
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:17,480
Maybe we just have to play this over on Twitch, which is another thing I can promote.

2047
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:19,840
So we've been doing stuff on Twitch and having fun there.

2048
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:23,240
But there is a Shrek game for Game Boy Color.

2049
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:26,240
And the game is called Fairy Tale Freak Down.

2050
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:33,200
And I've looked at part of the game in which Shrek is in a fistfight with Pinocchio.

2051
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:36,640
He's just punching Pinocchio in the face.

2052
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:40,360
Wow. Fairy tale freaked out rules.

2053
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:42,680
I think I'm I think I'm off of dinosaur.

2054
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:44,560
I think I'm a big Game Boy Color guy.

2055
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:47,600
So play dinosaur for Game Boy Color and listen to Marauder.

2056
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:50,880
And you'll be in a static heaven. Yeah. Wow.

2057
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:55,600
And as for other bullshit, you can always find that three extra episodes

2058
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:58,880
of bullshit a month on Patreon dot com slash podcast the ride.

2059
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:01,840
That's the second gate. Anything else, fellas?

2060
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,880
That's it. Just I'm pretty worn out.

2061
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:08,080
That's a little too much alidar for one day for anyone.

2062
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:10,040
I could do in a little more elder, but I agree.

2063
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:13,280
It's almost done. It's almost if you guys want to do a talking

2064
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:16,360
alidar after show, feel free. Oh, yeah, maybe.

2065
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:18,760
I'm getting hungry. I'm going to have to eat more plant.

2066
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:23,120
Oh, is that a baby? Yeah, he's back. He's back.

2067
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:26,200
Oh, baby alidar.

2068
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:27,760
Oh, love him.

2069
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:30,720
He's the baby. Got to play with him. What was it?

2070
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:35,320
Try me. Try me.

2071
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:37,760
Oh, God, if we're there, where's the Godbombs?

2072
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:41,560
When I need them, baby, baby Sinclair and baby alidar on the same show.

2073
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:43,800
Wow. The real odd.

2074
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:45,160
That's how they own them both.

2075
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:47,200
They own them both. Yeah, they own them both.

2076
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:49,200
All right. Well, I'm good.

2077
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:51,840
All right. I'm more than good. Goodbye.
