1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,380
Warning, the following podcast may contain a 456 foot high view of a parking lot.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:16,740
It may also include an erstwhile margarine spokesman and a high degree of branding for

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,500
got to be glued hair spiking glue.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,440
We journey to a jungle called New Jersey with Dan Klein to talk about Kingda Ka at Six Flags

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,920
Great Adventure on podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:53,520
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast about theme parks where today at least one host will

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,800
speak with authority about a ride he would never ever go on.

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,480
I'm that guy, Scott Gardner.

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,560
I don't know about my co-hosts, Mike Carlson.

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,560
Before this podcast, I think I wouldn't have gone on it, but now I do feel I have like

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,720
going on when I went on hang time with Jason Sheridan, the other co-hosts.

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,280
He's here as well.

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,160
I don't know that I would have done that, Coaster of Knots, if not for the podcast.

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,160
You know what I mean?

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,160
Right.

18
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,880
I got you into shape, which I feel to some extent, but this is far beyond what I would.

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,200
Right, but I'm saying there's scales like you were not doing drop rides, you were not

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
doing launch.

21
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,360
So now you're doing that.

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,640
I was doing that before.

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,120
So now I have to take it up a notch.

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,040
From where you were at, but I'm still handicapped.

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,360
I still have my handicap.

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,360
Right. So maybe two years you'll be doing Kingda Ka.

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,000
Maybe so. And in two years, I'll be like hanging out of like a plane or something.

28
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,840
I am disappointed myself.

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,240
I haven't been on this.

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,760
Yeah. It's a little after my time of going to Great Adventure.

31
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,000
That was my childhood Six Flags.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,600
Well, Jason, you started like you since you started the podcast with a higher threshold

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,000
than all of us for you to take it up higher.

34
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,240
Do you have to like try auto erotic asphyxiation or like what you ever do?

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,160
You should do a you should do auto erotic asphyxiation, but then do a halo jump

36
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,720
like Tom Cruise did in Mission Impossible Six.

37
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,760
Oh, yeah. So you get like a huge boner and then jump out of a very high plane.

38
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,320
My thing that I usually don't do with parks is anything where it's like an additional add on.

39
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,680
I mean, partly I'm cheap.

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,600
Second, like it's always like a slingshot that a teenager like.

41
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,040
It's always like a scrap metal capsule.

42
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,480
Oh, yeah. On bungee.

43
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,280
And it's like for an extra twenty dollars, you can be launched into the sky.

44
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,120
Which they have at Six Flags, Magic Mountain.

45
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,520
Yes, which they do have there.

46
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,800
Which you just are like Superman.

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,080
Did you see this? Did I send you a video that there's just a thing where you you

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,200
and like three people, they get stacked together like Superman,

49
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,640
and then they just let you go off of a bungee and you go back and forth

50
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,760
on a bungee like Superman.

51
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,720
And it looks just it looks very cheap.

52
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,160
It looks very scary.

53
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,320
Yeah. And kind of the bigger the town in the Jersey shore,

54
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,200
the more likely you are to have launches or bungee jumps or something like that.

55
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,480
And when we when we run out of rides from Disneyland Universal,

56
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,880
the three of us will have to just go do random teenager run slingshot.

57
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,360
We will. Well, sure.

58
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,920
A month of slingshot experiences together.

59
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,160
Three Superman. All right.

60
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,280
We'll talk about that. We got years to go for now.

61
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,400
OK, we should say that today today's topic is the world's tallest roller coaster.

62
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,400
And we're talking about it with one of the world's tallest comedians

63
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
in terms of talent.

64
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,800
He's a writer for AP Bio and great news and much other great stuff.

65
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,280
The very funny Dan Klein.

66
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,960
Yes, I think I'm five foot eight.

67
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,480
So regular size man, but the talent, but talent.

68
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,120
Why? 400 something feet tall is that?

69
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,160
Kingda Ka is four hundred fifty six feet.

70
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,040
So I've been on it multiple times.

71
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,560
OK, so in terms of bravery, yes.

72
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,840
Maybe one of the most brave guests.

73
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,480
You can rank in terms of actual height at where you feel you fall on the scale.

74
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
It's yes. Yeah.

75
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,440
And certainly the brave.

76
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,920
I'm the only one that's been on it here.

77
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,680
So, you know, yeah, I'm the bravest person here. Yeah.

78
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,160
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

79
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,200
Quite. Yeah. Quite easily.

80
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,480
And how many times like a couple of times to several times?

81
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,080
I like so

82
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,280
basically I would go to Six Flags Great Adventure

83
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,600
as an adult later, probably past my like, well,

84
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,320
Coastal Riding Prime.

85
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,200
Yes. Yeah. Coastal Riding Prime is what?

86
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,480
Like 13 to 18 something like that.

87
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,520
But while your brain is still growing and you take the abuse.

88
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,880
Yes. Yeah. That it's like, oh, this seems fine.

89
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,880
Even though you should probably should not be doing it at that point in your life.

90
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,960
Yeah. I doing it's like an old person.

91
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,360
That's those are the people that should go on rollercoaster.

92
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,680
Yeah, because they're already losing it.

93
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,240
Yeah. What's the point? What's the point?

94
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,840
Like, this is my time to enjoy myself.

95
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,080
Or if it kills you, then it kills you.

96
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,240
Seems like a fine way to go.

97
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,840
Or your brain cells, whatever.

98
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
Yeah. Yeah.

99
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,920
So you just want to have some fun at that point. Yeah.

100
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,320
But I was doing it in my 20s that I would go with a couple of other friends.

101
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,600
We did it, I think, three years in a row, and we would stay in my house in New Jersey.

102
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,400
Well, that's more my parents house in New Jersey.

103
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,120
And we would go to Halloween Horror Nights, which.

104
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,360
Oh, wait, no, wait. Fright.

105
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,800
Fright. So sorry. So sorry. Oh, my God.

106
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,160
That's fine. All the New Jersey fans are going to kill me.

107
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,880
Fright Fest. Learn your brand.

108
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,960
Yes. Your park scare brand.

109
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,840
So, yes. Yeah. Yeah. Where you get scared.

110
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,360
I've been scared on the East Coast. I've been scared on the West Coast.

111
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,840
She's scaring across and getting scared across America.

112
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,320
Actually, that is another thing that I could talk about is that I was always too

113
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,840
scared of that stuff.

114
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,760
Yeah. I would really avoid it at all costs.

115
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,680
But we would just go because the lines were shorter at that time of the year.

116
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,880
And if you went on a Friday night, especially all the children were gone.

117
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,840
Right. So the lines were really short.

118
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,360
And we would just like run through the park and get on as many rides as we could.

119
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,440
And we would usually start with Kingda Ka.

120
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,120
Oh, sure. Just get there before any line starts.

121
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,360
OK, OK. But that's also terrifying because it's very strange to be the first person

122
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,760
on a roller coaster, like the first person of that day.

123
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,800
Oh, yeah. If it hasn't been like vetted and like it, like there hasn't been a few

124
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,440
like any pig. Yes, they've done like you've seen it like go up and down like empty.

125
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,840
Yeah. But still, to be the first person on a roller coaster that day feels strange.

126
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,280
It seems like this will be the time that there would be some issue.

127
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,520
Yeah, especially which seems like there there are errors.

128
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,040
I feel this thing's they did like they know there's going to be problems sometimes.

129
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,400
We'll get into that. But sorry, what are you saying?

130
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,240
Oh, I just sometimes the vibe at Six Flags feel like great adventure.

131
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,240
You usually have their act together, but sometimes the vibe is like,

132
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,840
oh, yeah, this ride is opening late because like Kenny was 20 minutes late.

133
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,120
Yeah, because he blah blah took too long.

134
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,640
But yes, yeah.

135
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,480
So it's just like, oh, hey, man.

136
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,640
Sorry. Sorry about that. Come on on.

137
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,000
Come on. The teenager that we hired to like, yeah, run this thing that is

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,560
run this up front to God, to God's kingdom.

139
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,880
Who was trained like for a day by a video and presses a button now is like running late.

140
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,600
So but yeah, there were a few times where they would be like talking,

141
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,360
you know, this the 10 year old Six Flags employees that were running this thing.

142
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,120
And you're waiting in line and wondering what's happening, what's going on.

143
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,160
Is everything OK? And then they're like, oh, I think it's fine.

144
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,320
Like, come on in. Yeah.

145
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,000
There's such like astrophysics involved in this attraction,

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,560
especially all roller coasters.

147
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,720
But this seems like you need degrees to operate.

148
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,160
There should be more scientists.

149
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,720
I feel like a scientist on call at all times.

150
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,400
Six Flags scientists to just be like, everything's OK.

151
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,440
I've done the calculations again, just sitting next to like an old computer,

152
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,800
you know, to make it seem like, yeah, everything's a go.

153
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,960
Let me see a list of like five articles you've written.

154
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,880
And then, yes, yeah, trust you.

155
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,880
It feels like we were we were just we did this crazy new Disneyland ride,

156
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,880
the Star Wars ride, and we were told there were 30 Imagineers in the basement

157
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,800
making sure that everything was OK and monitoring it.

158
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,640
And I feel like Six Flags just has like one handyman

159
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,280
that's in the middle of the park somewhere.

160
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,440
And then they go, hey, something's wrong.

161
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,840
And he goes, OK.

162
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,600
And that's or they don't even have him.

163
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,520
He's like at home and they have to call him.

164
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,800
Yeah. And if our if a sink is broken in a place we live,

165
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,720
yeah, we're going to call the handy. Yeah.

166
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,400
Yeah. There's no real like sink guy.

167
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,000
It's like I know how to like use a wrench better than you do.

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,160
So I'll tighten something. Right.

169
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,320
There's not many like guys that are specific to this one thing.

170
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,960
Yeah. Yeah.

171
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,600
We also do. We did this episode behind the paywall,

172
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,120
which allowed us to be more honest about the Six Flags experience.

173
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,200
But there's a fright fest here in L.A. at Magic Mountain that I mean,

174
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,040
go listen to it on the second gate or patron thing.

175
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,640
But the like the most scarring image for me was the

176
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,600
discussion of teenagers sucking fog.

177
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,040
Yeah. Like getting what you were there, you could say.

178
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,160
Yeah. So so in fright fest, of course, they have a lot of fog machines.

179
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,040
And there's a lot of teens.

180
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,520
Of course, they're very, very tired.

181
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,800
They're trying to impress each other.

182
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,360
Yeah. So there was a teen that was specifically very impressive.

183
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,120
He impressed you.

184
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,080
He impressed me and my friend Anthony because he went up to the fog machine

185
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,440
and just sucked the fog right straight from the machine.

186
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,400
Is that some kind of drug?

187
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,080
Or is it just like it was impressive because it's like he was experimenting.

188
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,560
Like, yeah, if synthesized correctly, he could have pioneered.

189
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,760
So maybe he already now in the month since this October,

190
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,480
like figured out how to synthesize it or make it solid or something. Right.

191
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,680
Isn't it a vape track? Like he was like, oh, well, like, oh, it's like a big vape.

192
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,800
You know, it was. Yeah.

193
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,440
Fog machine, if you think about it, it's just a big vape.

194
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,600
Yeah. So I think that is what he was like doing, like blowing it out for his friends.

195
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,280
I mean, the teens were everywhere.

196
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,720
They were.

197
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,160
That was the craziest thing I think we saw from teens that night.

198
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,080
Fog sucking, fog sucking teens don't care about Legionnaires disease,

199
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,880
lingering, no, there is disease.

200
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,160
I'm not a big topic in team talk.

201
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,320
No, you didn't see any fog butt chugging, though.

202
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,480
Oh, my God.

203
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,360
Nobody bent over a fog machine

204
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,760
or squatted over a fog machine, because it would go up.

205
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,360
Fog goes up.

206
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,400
Fog can go up.

207
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,400
So you could just squat over it

208
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,520
and then try to like spit it out of your mouth.

209
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,640
Let's see if it makes it all the way through your intestines.

210
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,440
Oh, and burp it out or something or blow it out.

211
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,480
I guess that's a long distance for fog to not dissipate all the way from anus to mouth.

212
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,600
Yeah, that's like it would be like a David Blaine style trick.

213
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,080
A true sorcerer. We need to do that.

214
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,160
Which takes time. It takes a one hour special.

215
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,760
Yes. Yeah.

216
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,120
On Sunday night, this week on ABC.

217
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,720
David Blaine butt chug some fog for Harrison Ford in his house.

218
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,440
Yeah, that's unbelievable.

219
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,160
For very high Harrison Ford.

220
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,560
Callista, get in here.

221
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,960
You got to see this.

222
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,120
You got to see this fog in his asshole.

223
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,560
Do it again.

224
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,360
Don't leave. Keep doing it.

225
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,080
Holy shit.

226
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,880
Ever since it was I was a boy, it was my dream to butt chug fog

227
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,240
tonight with you watching.

228
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,440
I was thinking about being a teenager recently,

229
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,400
and the things that I would do that I thought were just like,

230
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
oh, I'm just like a teen.

231
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,840
This is but looking back, it was to try and be impressive.

232
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,000
And one of the things was just like cursing loudly, more in conversation.

233
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,560
Did you guys ever do this?

234
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,840
Showing you a new curse word?

235
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,360
Yeah, like you could curse like and it doesn't matter.

236
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,080
Like you're not affected by the cursing.

237
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,040
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

238
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,960
You don't like look around before you say the curse word.

239
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,840
You just barrel it.

240
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,680
Yeah, you're just like you're performatively loud.

241
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
Yeah. Yeah. Loud.

242
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,720
And as if someone would then hear those curses and be like, that was.

243
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,720
Yes, that was very impressive to me.

244
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,320
And I have to say sexy.

245
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,680
You were let's say inside the Actors Studio.

246
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,200
What's your favorite curse word?

247
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,400
Or what was it when you were?

248
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,000
I think it was probably just fuck, right?

249
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,320
It's just you just want to say that as much as possible.

250
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,000
Find a spot for it and hope that a beautiful woman hears it

251
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,040
and has never heard a little boy say it.

252
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,880
So what was that word?

253
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,880
I mean, you could just say this. Yeah.

254
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,200
You have the confidence, the gusto.

255
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,760
The teacher is yelling at you, but she's like, but hold on.

256
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,960
It's the after class. Yeah.

257
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,040
Class never seen a little boy swear before.

258
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,640
I know. That was very cool.

259
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,120
What age? Like doing this? Yeah.

260
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,880
I mean, I don't know.

261
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,720
It probably ranged anywhere from like 10 to like 21 or something.

262
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,280
I think I was eighth grade when I started.

263
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,600
Oh, your first like swear.

264
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,680
Curse word. Yeah, I think that's awesome.

265
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,040
I feel like it's a late public curse word.

266
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,680
I have a lot of things in my life.

267
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,600
Yes, I feel like my friends are probably starting to do it.

268
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,240
Like, I mean, I remember a kid saying in third grade saying, oh, yeah,

269
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,320
on the playground at school, but he was in a dire situation.

270
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,520
Yeah. So he what he had where he had, he was getting sat on by a bigger kid.

271
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,360
Oh, and he said he yelled to get this big bitch off of me.

272
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,960
And we're all like, whoa, whoa.

273
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,600
I really. Oh, my God.

274
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,640
I spilled water. Water's been spilled.

275
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,320
But you didn't swear. I didn't.

276
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,400
No, not anymore.

277
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,680
This with this wet bed or spilled all over those little bit.

278
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Because we can pause a second. Yeah, maybe let's pause.

279
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,880
OK, we're back.

280
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,160
I'll say in case we leave the spill in

281
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,160
and we're talking about teens and cursing.

282
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,960
Oh, and we're talking about big bitches.

283
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,080
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Get this big bitch off me.

284
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,080
Famous moment from my elementary school.

285
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,840
So I think it was around then that people, you know, probably curse

286
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,120
at the bus stop. Sure. Mm hmm.

287
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
And in a great, great.

288
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,960
That's your cursing journey. Yes.

289
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,280
It which dovetails nicely, I guess, into into roller coaster.

290
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,560
Oh, wait. Well, we have to talk about the thing you mentioned.

291
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,240
Your in your life's roller coaster journey.

292
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,120
When I was talking to you about topics, you I was delighted when you brought up

293
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,720
this tape that you had when you were growing up, you had a roller coaster tape,

294
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,680
a tape that I watched frequently.

295
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah, it's I couldn't even get there like 10 minutes of it.

296
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,680
As I recently watching the YouTube.

297
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
Someone kindly put it on YouTube.

298
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,360
Not just it, but it's two sequels.

299
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,840
Oh, I will say I did not watch the sequels, but I did make it through the first one.

300
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,920
People might. Boy, people might cheer if this was also a childhood favorite.

301
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,920
I didn't know it before, but it is called America's Greatest

302
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,560
Roller Coaster Thrills in 3D. Yes, it is in 3D.

303
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,240
And what does that mean?

304
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,560
Nothing. Nothing. It comes with glasses.

305
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,720
They mount the camera in the front car of the coaster.

306
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,280
Yeah, it feels like you're on it.

307
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,240
And I have to say, I watched it.

308
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,560
I watched the full hour.

309
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,560
And then I put the sequels on to like peacefully go to sleep.

310
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Oh, that's nice.

311
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,800
It activated something in my brain where I was like, yes, this is this feels good.

312
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,480
I there's something nice. This is good.

313
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,840
It's a very easy way to experience a roller coaster.

314
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,920
You don't have to leave your house and you get to see the thrills.

315
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,720
See the thrills.

316
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,480
Some of these are gone to Drakken Fire and Big Bad Wolf are both gone.

317
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Oh, man.

318
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,320
Big Bad Wolf, I thought was so cool.

319
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,280
They're like hanging. Yes.

320
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,480
And seated because there was the Batman hanging where your legs are kicking.

321
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,000
But Big Bad Wolf had like little boats that were like hanging.

322
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,520
Oh, I think when I was watching it, there was some familiarity

323
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,040
to me about the little boats because I think that the proper term they got.

324
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,800
I will say it is now.

325
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,160
It's little boats.

326
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,320
I went on something oddly in the same video.

327
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,840
There's a roller coaster called Top Gun, but I went on a different top gun

328
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,480
at King's Island that was a little boat coaster, not a flying coaster.

329
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,720
And so I think I like the boat.

330
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,960
As I recall, I was especially a coaster wimp,

331
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,760
you know, in 2005 when I did this, the boats I could handle.

332
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,120
I think I'm a fan of little boats.

333
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,720
OK, nice.

334
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,160
Please direct me to more little.

335
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,400
It also just looked cool going around the turns and stuff

336
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,960
because it like kind of swings up in the air a little bit.

337
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,280
It's very satisfying.

338
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,120
That was probably my favorite coaster to watch on that video.

339
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,320
Huh? Yeah.

340
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,280
Now, I'm watching the video.

341
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,160
First of all, the beginning, there's banter between it's a man and a woman host.

342
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,760
Yes. And professional host.

343
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,720
Yes. Yes.

344
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,560
Host people who I can peg listeners, if you don't have a chance

345
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,720
to look it up right now or don't care about it.

346
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,520
Imagine they imagine someone says, OK, we need a Harry Anderson type.

347
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,480
And we need a Suzanne Summer type. Yeah.

348
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,680
Can we get them? And they're like, absolutely not.

349
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,280
We have no money. No, they will not do this.

350
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,520
But we have a guy who is credited on one episode of the Tim Conway show.

351
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,960
Oh, nice.

352
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,640
What was also the what was the Tim Conway show?

353
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,360
I'm sure there were multiple Tim Conway shows.

354
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,680
It was the one that was just called the Tim Conway show.

355
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,120
But that was like a long time ago, not like a podcast he did.

356
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,800
Oh, no, no, no.

357
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,680
Long time ago, 70s, 80s variety show kind of thing, I think.

358
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,520
Yeah. Anyway, but there yet it's a guy and a girl.

359
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,440
And the dynamic is, guys, a real coaster hound and girl like,

360
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,360
oh, you would know.

361
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,720
She says you would take an act of Congress to get me on one of these things.

362
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,800
Great writing. Big bitch.

363
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,680
Yeah, it's like I'm a big bitch. I can't get on this.

364
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,880
But then she doesn't get on the coasters.

365
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,720
No, eventually she does.

366
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,960
Oh, she's done. OK.

367
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,920
And then it's really confusing.

368
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,920
They get they clearly the hosts only went to Magic Mountain

369
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,840
and they didn't travel the country for this thing.

370
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,760
So they go like no money.

371
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,320
Yeah, not at all.

372
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,160
So they go on whatever it is at Magic Mountain.

373
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,640
Could be Batman the ride even.

374
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,280
And she goes on it.

375
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,240
And then you leave the go the host for a long time.

376
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,560
You go on five more coasters, which is it's all long and tedious.

377
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,880
And then we come back to the skit that's like he now he's now

378
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,480
she's making him go on.

379
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,520
So it's like an art. He's got the taste. Yeah.

380
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,480
There's a little story, a little three extra to this story.

381
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,680
You meet all sorts of characters.

382
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,520
You get meet one guy from Arrow, the the manufacturing company Arrow,

383
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,720
which I did look up and it is now defunct.

384
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,160
This arrow is gone. Yeah.

385
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,480
Arrow dynamics. Yes. Yes.

386
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,800
Yeah. Ron Toomer is his name. Yeah. Ron Toomer.

387
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,360
His name is Ron Toomer.

388
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,320
I was like, this is such like this all feels so fake.

389
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,200
It feels like a Tim and Eric sketch or something. Yeah.

390
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,960
Yeah. Watching a 90s VHS of roller coasters.

391
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,160
Well, especially because now we talk to the coaster expert

392
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,680
and his expert analysis is kind of like, yeah, you know,

393
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,080
he's got to figure out a good way for him to bend.

394
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,160
And that's how to make it move. And that's important.

395
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,760
I don't go on. I just bend him.

396
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,920
And here's how you do it.

397
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,920
And then he takes a wire and just bends it around.

398
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,960
And that's how a coaster that made me so nervous.

399
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,440
I was like, he's going to get smacked in the face with that.

400
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,600
Because you seem like he was having trouble bending it. Yes.

401
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,160
And then his eye goes straight on the socket.

402
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,480
They would have left it in if it happened. Yeah.

403
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,720
They wouldn't have cut it out. They just had one time to do it.

404
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,400
So, yeah, yeah, yeah.

405
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,880
Yeah, we got if he got hit in the eye, it's like,

406
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,280
don't go on roller coasters.

407
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Look what they could do to you. My warning.

408
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,160
If just the small one did it, imagine what a big one you could die.

409
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,840
You'll be like me, Ron Toomer.

410
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,920
You were saying VHS, but I found it on laser disk on eBay.

411
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,880
Whoa.

412
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,040
Fifty dollars for this laser disk.

413
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,240
Five dollars shipping like new condition.

414
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,640
Oh, it's like new. Yeah.

415
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,920
Mine was not like new. It was played many times.

416
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,440
Well, mine really were this.

417
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,880
So did you like because to explain what they mean by 3D

418
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,320
is that they just play you the POV like now on YouTube.

419
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,280
You can watch a ton of POV shot on people's phones, roller coasters.

420
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,400
But at the time, they had to set up big broadcast cameras

421
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,440
and like and mount them and it was like in a complicated manner.

422
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,000
So you just get to watch 10 roller coasters all the way through

423
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,880
as if you were going on.

424
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,160
I think it was probably like as a child, my version of reality TV of like,

425
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,240
yeah, you just kind of leave it on.

426
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,600
You don't have to watch every scene.

427
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,320
It kind of blends into the next thing.

428
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,720
You know, like I didn't want to watch a narrative.

429
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,160
And someone gave it to me as like a birthday gift, I think. OK.

430
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,000
And so I I don't know.

431
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,320
I mean, also looking back as a kid, I'm like,

432
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,280
I don't know why I was watching what I was watching

433
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,200
other than my love for just a television being on for me.

434
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,160
Yeah, you like it was around. It was around.

435
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
There was people on it.

436
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,360
Like I just watched every sitcom imaginable.

437
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,600
I don't think I liked any of them.

438
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,080
Yeah, but I watched all of them.

439
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,480
Whereas now in this era where you can choose, choose if it's bad,

440
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,080
you just don't want although people are still watching crap. Yeah.

441
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,080
Yeah. Crap rises to the top.

442
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,880
It's all about the people love crap.

443
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,320
Crap. It'll never stop.

444
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,440
It'll never stop.

445
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,960
They will crap food. They love crap TV. It's true.

446
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,640
I remember another podcast, a radio lab from like years.

447
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,400
I mean, they still make it.

448
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,920
But years ago, there was an episode where I think they found like an old trash

449
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,680
heap from like ancient Egypt.

450
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,400
And there was they kept finding this book.

451
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,800
And it was like erotica, like crap of the time.

452
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,000
And like that's what people were reading was just crap.

453
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,160
I have a crap like an old Egyptian book.

454
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,080
Yeah. I mean, like a romance novel for Egyptians, essentially.

455
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,280
Like ancient Egyptians.

456
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,560
Yeah. It's just like porno bad porno.

457
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,520
Yeah. It's just like you're like run of the mill, like pulp.

458
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,200
Yeah. V.C. Andrews. It's the V.C. Andrews.

459
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,560
So it's yeah. And they're like, that's what everybody wanted to read.

460
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,560
Yeah. That's just what's going on now.

461
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,480
Geez. I like that being able to judge that, like finding something ancient

462
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,680
and old that should feel important and being able to say it sucks.

463
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,440
It's crap. Yeah. Like the writing is horrible here.

464
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,920
This is just about sex and nothing else.

465
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,880
Funny that it's like maybe back then it was considered good.

466
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,400
I'm not sure. Yeah. You know, maybe they were being harsh on it.

467
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,080
Right. But like it could have been like a 50 Shades of Grey.

468
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,680
Yeah, that's kind of what I think they were trying to say.

469
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,200
Like this is like people read that now.

470
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,160
People read it then.

471
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,080
Sure. We're all the same. We haven't changed.

472
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,720
The aliens combing through, you know, the remains of humanity

473
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,200
and just going like, what is a million little pieces?

474
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,160
This must have been an important book for them.

475
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,200
This is it. This was their god.

476
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,360
Yeah, this was their god. Written by a non-liar.

477
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,800
Yeah, that's the one.

478
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Oh, that's the one by the liar.

479
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,240
I haven't watched that one.

480
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,800
But isn't that that's the This Is Us?

481
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,040
Right. Wait. No. Oh, no.

482
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,240
I mean, that's a million little things.

483
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,680
Guy who went to rehab, but made it up.

484
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,000
And then he was on Oprah and there was a book club

485
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,160
and then it like sold a ton and then it was like, oh, I lied.

486
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,400
I made this. He made all of it up. Right.

487
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,520
Yeah. That was the idea. OK.

488
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,360
Sorry. I was thinking of a million little things that short lived drama.

489
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,120
I think maybe I thought those things were related to it.

490
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,320
Just people like that idea of like a bunch of something.

491
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,880
You know, something I guess.

492
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,360
So that's never changed either.

493
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,760
Yes. People like crap and they want a million of something.

494
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,000
One time when I was hosting the tram tour, as I as I did long ago,

495
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,200
I had an especially non responsive audience in the front row.

496
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,720
And if people don't pay attention on the fourth car of the tram, whatever,

497
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,040
I think I can't see. I don't care.

498
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,560
But the first row of the first car, you really notice.

499
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,280
And there was somebody just like brazenly reading that book

500
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,240
on the ride at the theme park.

501
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,920
Why even go on the ride at that point? I don't know.

502
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,360
I guess there was some it was pleasant background noise.

503
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,600
Yeah, I guess like the roller coaster tape.

504
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,320
But they decided to go do it in person.

505
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Yes. Yeah. I like being around it.

506
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,960
Yeah. I just you know, I get wind in my face.

507
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,160
It's nice. I can't drive my own car and read at the same time.

508
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,000
So I'm going to pay this place to drive me around.

509
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,840
Maybe I'll turn and look when the shark jumps up.

510
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,800
But otherwise. But I was like really I was man.

511
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,080
I like tried to roast him.

512
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,800
And I was going to say, are you allowed to like Rickle style roast

513
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,960
the people in the front row on the tram tour?

514
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,360
Probably not. Not Rickles.

515
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,360
I guess you can't say Rickle style.

516
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,680
No, really. Because that's not a big bitch.

517
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,000
Look at this. What are you a Nazi?

518
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,640
Because Nazi.

519
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,840
I guess you probably can't do that.

520
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,920
I tried to make fun of that.

521
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,080
I think I'm sure it was much more sputtery at the time.

522
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,520
But I tried to say, hey, if you're going to read a book in front of me,

523
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,720
can it be a book by a non liar?

524
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,040
That didn't do it.

525
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,280
Yeah. That is that clear, clean thing I just did.

526
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,160
Is the book still good even if you know it's a lie?

527
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,880
I mean, most books are lies. Yeah, right.

528
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,320
It's true. I mean, all of entertainment are just lies.

529
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,400
Lies upon lies.

530
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,640
Yeah. So is it did it did its effect, this positivity in the world

531
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,840
actually make up for the lie? Yeah.

532
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,400
It's like that Simpson episode with Joe Bidaya Springfield.

533
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,960
Is the legend better than the reality?

534
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,760
I don't know that it is.

535
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,080
You think? No. It's not what I see out on Rax.

536
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,600
Oh, you're saying the book. The book.

537
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,680
You're not talking about the idea I'm talking about.

538
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,040
Life of Pi tried to pull that too.

539
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,640
Do you guys see Life of Pi?

540
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,200
I haven't seen Life of Pi.

541
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,680
Can I ruin it? Yeah, sure. Go.

542
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,400
Life of Pi. Listen, jump ahead.

543
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,000
If you recall, it was that Ang Lee.

544
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,080
Yeah, yeah. It was like spectacular, like animal things going on.

545
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,880
But it turns out at the end, well, first it starts with like

546
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,920
by the end of this story, you're going to believe in God,

547
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,720
which I'm like, I'm already annoyed.

548
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,080
Like, yes, the character like is telling a story.

549
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:24,440
And then at the end, someone's like, OK, I think what actually happened

550
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,960
was that you were stuck on this boat with your family.

551
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,880
And this animal represents this person and this represents this person.

552
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,640
And what really happened was like this horrible thing.

553
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,600
And it's like, yes, but what version do you like better?

554
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,080
And I'm like, well, you didn't show us the other version.

555
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,800
So you're just dismissing it as if it's not interesting or worthwhile

556
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,200
for anyone to hear it.

557
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,920
You're saying like, no, no, no, you got to hear the monkey version.

558
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,400
And so I'm like, that really like bothered me.

559
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,000
Sometimes it was like literary bestsellers like do not make good

560
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,000
like The Goldfinch was this hugely successful book.

561
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,440
It's a giant brick of a thing.

562
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,880
And a movie came out and did any of you see it?

563
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,320
The Goldfinch? No, really?

564
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,600
Just like, yeah.

565
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,960
Well, but this one at least was an Oscar nominated.

566
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,560
I mean, that one's true.

567
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,440
But like even even those like there's something gets weird in translation.

568
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,600
Sure. Yeah.

569
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,600
That is very aggressive to start off with a very aggressive.

570
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,240
You're going to believe in God. Yeah.

571
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,080
Yeah. Yeah.

572
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,640
Only the only books to do that are Life of Pi and the Bible.

573
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,800
The Bible. You're going to believe in God by the end of this book.

574
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,360
Not till the end.

575
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,840
But every page and then you'll get it.

576
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,280
I actually just started reading the Bible.

577
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,120
Really? Yeah.

578
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,960
Like genuinely, I want I was curious.

579
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,800
I was like, I've never read this thing.

580
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,560
Sure. But it probably doesn't occur to most people to like sit down and read the.

581
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,120
Yeah. And I don't know anything.

582
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,200
I don't I really don't know much about religion at all.

583
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,520
And I was sick of being like seeing things on TV or movies.

584
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,680
And people are like, oh, that's a biblical reference.

585
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,600
You know, and I'm like, I don't know what they're talking about.

586
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,440
I know like the basic ones.

587
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,280
Uh huh. Where are you adding it?

588
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,160
It's still pretty early on.

589
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,840
Like still I'm still in Genesis.

590
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,040
OK, you're doing all.

591
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,880
I'm just reading the Bible. Wow.

592
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,480
Yeah. It's just Genesis been a slogan.

593
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,840
It's usually it's very small type.

594
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,000
So it's taking. Yeah.

595
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,560
I'm actually reading it on an app.

596
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,000
The Bible Bible.

597
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,160
There are several Bible apps. Oh, yeah.

598
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,480
And I'm reading like it's called the New Learning one or something,

599
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,520
which is supposed to be the easiest just to understand what's happening.

600
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,480
I see. Yeah.

601
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,560
And I mean, I'm on like Genesis Chapter seven or something.

602
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,600
Oh, oh, yeah.

603
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,920
And I'm still a ton of chapters.

604
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,040
Yeah. And Adam and Eve are still there, but they're like super old.

605
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,280
But they just had another kid.

606
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,840
Wait, so they had another set.

607
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,600
They have like Cain and Abel.

608
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,200
And then they go through this whole line of people and all this stuff happens.

609
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,600
And then all of a sudden they're like, and then Adam and Eve had another child.

610
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,720
Wow. I know about the other kids in the Old Testament.

611
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,400
Yes. Yeah.

612
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,240
It's like this person had this person and this person had this person.

613
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,360
Yeah.

614
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,840
And you like skip the baguettes or did you try to read the baguettes?

615
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,800
I mean, in this version, it's not as horrible to get there because it's like,

616
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,600
oh, it's more like they've cut down.

617
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,840
Yeah, it's more plain English.

618
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,840
But they are saying like, then this person had this and then this guy had two wives.

619
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,320
That was kind of cool.

620
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,800
Lamac and they do a little.

621
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,600
I mean, I don't know how to say his name.

622
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
He has two wives. They don't care about it.

623
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,720
They're just like, he just does. Wow.

624
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,920
Do they put so weird?

625
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,080
Is there like modern slang in there to make you understand?

626
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,320
Like, yeah, side chick. Yeah.

627
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,960
Yeah. They're like that. That that song slaps. Yeah.

628
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,840
Stuff like that. There's a lot of tick tock.

629
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,680
Yeah, yeah.

630
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,720
Yeah. That would help me if I would.

631
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,440
Yeah. I can't get into something unless it talks about tick tock.

632
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,200
Yeah. That is. Yeah.

633
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,480
I hit the dab on the Pharaoh.

634
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,240
Yeah. This guy huge on tick tock.

635
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,480
And there you go, because that's what they have to do now in movies.

636
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,880
Right. For a while.

637
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,640
Like, I think it was in Chef where, you know, he got he went viral.

638
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,440
Yeah. On YouTube.

639
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,240
Oh, there's still a lot of people going viral in movies.

640
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,080
Joker went viral.

641
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,200
Joker went viral in a very strange way.

642
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,880
Yeah. Right.

643
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,080
They said, like in the 70s, that has to be a cut scene.

644
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,520
Right. That there's no mention that they're filming.

645
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,000
Yes. And on on film.

646
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,560
Yes. When you see it, it is still it is shot really, really nice.

647
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,640
Yeah. Yes. That's true.

648
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,800
Why didn't they?

649
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,040
But I guess it's like this is too much.

650
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,480
No one's going to care. Right.

651
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,520
Yeah. Like these losers who aren't going to like it anyway.

652
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,440
Yes. Fuck it.

653
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,520
But yes. Why is there a viral?

654
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:32,360
And it does that 70s style talk show play clips often of local bombing.

655
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,280
Why didn't they just say like, you know, tonight we're shooting.

656
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,760
We're shooting a video for.

657
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,680
So you can be a star.

658
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,400
Yeah. Yeah.

659
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,120
Why not just have a line of saying yes.

660
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,320
And then they got it.

661
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,560
As opposed to someone was secretly

662
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,920
like the loudest loading magazines of film.

663
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,840
It's a light something with that for that kind of camera.

664
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,080
The last thing light in these people's faces.

665
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,280
They would have noticed.

666
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,040
Yes. Definitely.

667
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,080
Even somebody has messed up in the head as the Joker would have noticed.

668
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,800
Maybe the most messed up of all.

669
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,840
He's probably the most messed up of all time.

670
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,560
I have top five. Top five.

671
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,360
Yeah. Well, you guys read the Bible.

672
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,080
God is up there.

673
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,440
You're going to meet some real characters that might be shifting.

674
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,040
Yeah.

675
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,600
If you want to go on a ride that gets you close enough, maybe to touch God.

676
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,440
By that, I mean, it is very tall and it gets you close to heaven.

677
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,560
King Kaka.

678
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,360
Oh, yeah.

679
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,720
Maybe that ride.

680
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,840
I didn't know.

681
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,000
That could have done that segue on that tour.

682
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,400
You just don't talk to anyone else for the rest of the podcast.

683
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,520
You're so proud of it.

684
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,000
I did my work.

685
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,280
Go ahead.

686
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,600
Enjoy some little solo smoke time.

687
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,400
I didn't realize that it's still the tallest roller coaster.

688
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,920
Still the tallest.

689
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,680
Lost the title of fastest.

690
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,200
It was fastest.

691
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,920
They went and opened.

692
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,880
Tallest and fastest.

693
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,080
Fastest now.

694
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,880
You probably have it.

695
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,160
Yeah.

696
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,880
Formula Rosa at Ferrari World.

697
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,920
At Ferrari World.

698
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,480
In Dubai.

699
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,400
In, yes.

700
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:01,960
Oh, wow.

701
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,840
Abu Dhabi, I believe.

702
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,640
Oh, OK.

703
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,120
Abu Dhabi.

704
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:05,880
Yeah.

705
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,640
That whole place seems really bog.

706
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,560
We got to get there or something.

707
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,120
I don't know when we're.

708
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,920
How willing are you guys to go to UAE?

709
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,400
I'll go.

710
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,120
Scared.

711
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,520
I'll go.

712
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,320
That is where my fear sets in.

713
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,320
I'm scared to go anywhere, but I'll go.

714
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,080
We have to go.

715
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,800
Scared because if you slip up, you might get thrown in jail.

716
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,080
Yes.

717
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,480
Yeah.

718
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:38,520
Scared of anywhere where the buildings of the future are built by slaves who have their

719
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,160
passports taken away when they enter the country.

720
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,000
And I am on record saying things like that.

721
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,760
We're going to edit this out though before we go.

722
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,400
OK.

723
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:47,800
Yeah.

724
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,960
We're never going to get invited at this rate.

725
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,160
We're going to have to come through a lot of past episodes.

726
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,520
There's one episode where you say something about Abu Dhabi.

727
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,920
This government is run by insane people.

728
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,720
Do we have to cut out references to when I talk about Garfield mailing Nermal to Abu Dhabi?

729
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,080
They're still mad about that.

730
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,960
They still hate that.

731
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,640
They probably don't like that stereotype that it's a place where cats get mailed.

732
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,680
Or hated cats.

733
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,120
Although can you imagine if at one of these theme parks in Abu Dhabi,

734
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,200
they had a Garfield ride and it started with Nermal getting out of a box?

735
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,040
I would be cool.

736
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,000
That would be fantastic.

737
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,760
The ultimate Garfield reference.

738
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,260
Yes.

739
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,000
I think that they need to do this.

740
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,880
We've embraced this.

741
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,400
It's literally what most children think about.

742
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,280
When I say children, I mean men in their 30s.

743
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,840
So it's still.

744
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,040
It was.

745
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,520
All right.

746
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,680
It's now the fastest coaster in North America.

747
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,360
It is the longest drop in the world still, I believe.

748
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:52,760
Because of the structure of it, presumably we will have tweeted out the episode,

749
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,320
art and promo that shows you what the thing looks like.

750
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,720
But it really is just this straightaway and then a big upside down U,

751
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,960
which involves a corkscrew.

752
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,520
And then you're back down and the rest of it is just kind of like losing speed from how crazy it got.

753
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,020
Yes.

754
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,840
And it's a big launch at the beginning.

755
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,520
And you're up to the top of that thing within seconds.

756
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,160
Really fast.

757
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,000
0 to 128 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds.

758
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,920
So twice as fast as the Hulk.

759
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,840
That's zero to 60 in a few seconds.

760
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,560
It's crazy.

761
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,360
There's a whole thing on this.

762
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,720
There's been a runner on this show.

763
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:40,360
Guest Matt Rogers was here and he dubbed me a no launch queen for my inability,

764
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,920
me being scared of going on launch coaster.

765
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,440
Launches are the coasters of the future.

766
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,280
It feels like a lot of things have shifted to launching.

767
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,920
I guess it's probably easier and cheaper for them, right?

768
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,680
It's newer tech, I feel like.

769
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,180
Yeah.

770
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,280
So it's still cool.

771
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,400
It's still pretty cool.

772
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,080
Now they've figured out how to do multiple launches, but less intense.

773
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,520
So it's starting to get woven into family.

774
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,520
You can do coasters now.

775
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,920
There's this Harry Potter one in Florida where it slows down for a little bit so you can see

776
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,480
some scenes and then it goes really fast again.

777
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:25,480
Yeah, they can control the speed as opposed to just letting something drop from a tall height.

778
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,520
You'd have to build up the energy for the coaster up at the top of it.

779
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,920
And now they can do it a couple times.

780
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,380
Yeah.

781
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,640
I was saying with my history with it that I've gotten braver, have become more of a launch queen,

782
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:46,520
but the one that I've stated, and we've talked numbers before in the podcast, but I got freaked

783
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:51,960
out by going on the Rock and Roller coaster, which is this Aerosmith themed ride in Disney World.

784
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,520
Rock and Roller is really just dying this horrible death.

785
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,240
Everything rock themed and oriented in the last 20 years.

786
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,200
It just sucks so bad.

787
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,320
Yeah, you understand.

788
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:09,400
It's been a harsh exit interview and future generations could scarcely be

789
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,960
made guilty for not staying on board with rock music.

790
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,200
Yes, based on the last 40 years.

791
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,600
It's really heinous what they've done as old men.

792
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:31,160
This morning I watched Dan Rather interviewing the three members of Sticks who stuck around.

793
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,480
The hairstyles on these men, just age, just age guys.

794
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,520
I should not have blue hair when you're 70.

795
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:45,080
When I saw Blondie a couple months ago, some of the guys have the wig version of what the

796
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,920
hairstyle they had in the 60s was.

797
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,400
So it would be like that, you know, like what Keith Richards had, and he had this big poofy black

798
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,960
hair when he was a young man.

799
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,120
They just have a wig version of it.

800
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,720
And it's so funny because maybe far away if you kind of squint, you're like,

801
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,320
oh, yeah, that's a youngish.

802
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,800
And then you get close and you're like, ah, no.

803
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,920
It's the worst of both worlds.

804
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:07,980
Yeah.

805
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,760
It can't be shot on HD anymore.

806
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,820
Yeah.

807
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,920
Or what's his name?

808
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:22,600
The DJ, Rodney Bingenheimer, who has another wig version of his hair from 40 years ago.

809
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,240
Oh, right.

810
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,000
I don't actually know that these guys have wigs.

811
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,920
I should probably not be slandering them.

812
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,000
It still looks terrible.

813
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,500
Yeah.

814
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,960
Chances are they don't listen to podcast the ride.

815
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,600
Most likely.

816
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,160
Chances, but.

817
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,760
The guy from Blondie or Rodney Bingenheimer.

818
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,160
You know, but so I, all right.

819
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,840
So I went on this, I went on this Aerosmith ride, mainly admired the way they were dressed,

820
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,520
how many feathers and scarves they were wearing.

821
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:49,400
But then, okay, this one is zero to 57 in 2.8 seconds.

822
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,560
And that one was like a little out of my comfort zone going to 57.

823
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,480
This one goes to 128.

824
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,440
That is how much bit that's more than double.

825
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,420
Right?

826
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,360
I couldn't do this fucking thing.

827
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,800
I don't, I can, I maybe I was starting to feel like a launch queen.

828
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,760
I don't know if I can say.

829
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Well, and the thing with Kingda Ka is everything around it is like

830
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,880
gravel and like metal and fencing.

831
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,880
Like I think the one thing watching that roller coaster video that stuck out

832
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,560
was like the pleasant footage to watch is like the big bad wolf, which goes through a forest

833
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,960
and goes through a little German town recreation or anything at Cedar Fair,

834
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,800
which is on a lake.

835
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:35,480
But it is crazy how many big roller coasters the like speed and number of loops and stuff

836
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,760
was the appeal.

837
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,520
But then it's just the most industrial looking gravel lots.

838
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,920
Yeah, you basically, when you get to that, the top of the drop in Kingda Ka,

839
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,800
you just see like the Six Flags Great Adventure parking lot.

840
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,300
Yeah.

841
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,240
But it's still pretty cool.

842
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:51,740
Sure.

843
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,640
Well, you supposedly from the top, you would have to like really get your bearings immediately.

844
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,800
But if you knew where to look, if you could like stand on top of that tower for a long time,

845
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,120
you could see Philly, I think, and maybe even New York.

846
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,600
Yeah.

847
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
And another city that's not occurring.

848
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,960
What else is crazy?

849
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,000
I think that's all it takes.

850
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,400
It doesn't seem like it's that tall, but I guess it is.

851
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,000
So for 56 feet.

852
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,720
How tall is like I'm thinking of the Freedom Tower in New York.

853
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,760
That's now that's a thousand feet or something.

854
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:23,960
Yeah.

855
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,040
What are the roller coasters are built?

856
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,480
I don't know.

857
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:33,800
I watched something that said that the Statue of Liberty could fit under Kingda Ka.

858
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,360
Oh, wow.

859
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,720
But that's not like a statue.

860
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,000
It's pretty small.

861
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,560
Yeah.

862
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,060
Yeah.

863
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,880
I mean, in the, you know, it's.

864
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,120
Yeah.

865
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,240
And I didn't answer your question.

866
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,600
It's tall.

867
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,160
Yeah.

868
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:48,200
But not for like a structure for a structure for an impressive structure.

869
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,700
Yeah.

870
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,960
I have no I don't want to just look up building heights, but I should have done

871
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,880
buildings versus roller coasters.

872
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,200
Yeah.

873
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:56,680
Yeah.

874
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,360
Well, you know, it's just somebody to ponder, I guess.

875
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,480
No one will ever know the truth.

876
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,280
Mm hmm.

877
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,560
I know the numbers are there.

878
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,800
It's probably probably a lot of the Seven Wonders of the World are much shorter than

879
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,520
this thing.

880
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,720
Let's kick them off.

881
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:07,960
Yeah.

882
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,160
Like old old.

883
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,400
Yeah.

884
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,480
Like how tall are the pyramids?

885
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:11,960
I don't know.

886
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,040
They're probably old and shitty like that book.

887
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,040
That dirty book.

888
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,440
Yeah.

889
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,040
The dirty book that's all stuffed in there compared to Kingda Ka.

890
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,080
All right.

891
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:26,200
What I want is for a new Kingda Ka style coaster to be built on top of the pyramids.

892
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:26,360
Yeah.

893
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,480
I'm actually surprised there isn't.

894
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:27,960
Pyramid.

895
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,600
The Great Pyramid for 481 feet.

896
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,240
Taller than Kingda Ka.

897
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,520
It's still taller than Kingda Ka.

898
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,480
That's a little taller.

899
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,520
That's a wonder.

900
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:38,840
Yeah.

901
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,240
All right.

902
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,560
Fine.

903
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:39,960
You get to say.

904
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,840
Deserves that.

905
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,080
But Kingda Ka right on the other side of that parking lot, there's wild tiger.

906
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,800
There's tigers.

907
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,520
Yes, it's true.

908
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,720
Drive through safari.

909
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,840
Do they still have the safari?

910
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,360
I want to say yes.

911
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,160
They haven't gotten it.

912
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:56,120
I want to say the drive through safari and we should say it gets cold in like

913
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,840
this is considered central Jersey, right?

914
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:04,760
This park only operates like half of the year and weekends some of the rest of the year.

915
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,000
Yes, they have fright fest.

916
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,320
Fright.

917
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:07,560
Yes.

918
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:07,960
Oh, sure.

919
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,920
Some Christmas stuff, minimal Christmas activities.

920
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,560
Freezing.

921
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:11,960
Stuff.

922
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,200
Yeah.

923
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,160
Oh, it's going to be cold.

924
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,680
Are they closing probably now?

925
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,080
We're recording this in like late January.

926
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,560
Yeah.

927
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,840
So right now you couldn't go.

928
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,280
Don't think so.

929
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:27,080
I have a little bit more about tigers because this was part of they made a whole area out

930
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,040
of Kingda Ka.

931
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:33,640
They made it called the Golden Kingdom, which I guess is the it's all kind of themed to

932
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,120
Asian jungles, I suppose.

933
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,400
And they all right.

934
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:45,720
So they did a tiger show, a Bengal tiger show for a little while in the near Kingda Ka.

935
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,920
They even named one of the tigers Kingda Ka.

936
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,240
Hunter like a snake.

937
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,480
I think I think well, yes, cause it sounds like the snake.

938
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,160
It's like King Cobra kind of thing.

939
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,640
Yeah.

940
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,120
And cops jungle book is the tiger.

941
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:06,120
But I saw news reports saying Kingda Ka or as it translates to King of Coasters.

942
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:12,840
So if that's true, the ancient word for Coasters, I don't I don't think that's right.

943
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,720
I think they made that up.

944
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,200
Also, another news report says it's it's it vaguely translates to lose your lunch.

945
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,440
But I think that might have just been a joke.

946
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:20,920
That's a joke.

947
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,400
I think so.

948
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,040
That one's a joke.

949
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,080
But several pieces of real literature said King of Coasters.

950
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,320
So why is a tiger named King of Coasters?

951
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:28,840
Yeah.

952
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,640
Not correct.

953
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,280
Shouldn't be.

954
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:30,680
Yeah.

955
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:35,320
Anyway, there was a show with a trainer where they did tricks and stuff and jumped through hoops

956
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,440
and that kind of thing.

957
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,160
And then they closed the show in 2010.

958
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:48,200
And they seemingly they just moved the tigers to the drive through Safari Park that you guys

959
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:48,680
referred to.

960
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:54,520
But there is one guy on a message board who was not satisfied with that answer and was

961
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,400
assuming the worst.

962
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,480
And let me just skim through this message.

963
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,960
All six of the tigers were banished to the Safari Park never to see their human companions again.

964
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,680
Well, interesting.

965
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,680
That's what he that's what he was worried about, not like the welfare of wild animals.

966
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,720
No, I guess just that they wouldn't get to interact with the trainer.

967
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,000
Yeah, they want to see their friends.

968
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,000
But he also he doesn't know that he could say at least that's what the park says.

969
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,800
No one has seen them in over a month.

970
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,160
This is clearly the trainer, right?

971
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,640
That's right.

972
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,600
Oh, yeah.

973
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,640
Oh, yeah.

974
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,160
He's losing his game.

975
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,680
What are you reading this off of again?

976
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,680
Some theme park message board.

977
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,480
I'm not sure what it was.

978
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,360
You don't remember the name?

979
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,880
It might have been theme park insider.

980
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,380
Okay.

981
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,320
But so he keeps going and he's blaming the guy who was running this park at the time,

982
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,360
John Fitzgerald.

983
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,960
John Fitzgerald closed Temple of the Tiger and fired the trainers for wanting to mate the Tigers.

984
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,040
The biological clock is ticking.

985
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,280
It was a now or never situation.

986
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,640
She may be pregnant.

987
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,360
If so, will the park have the Cubs aborted?

988
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,400
Oh, my God.

989
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:51,900
Wow.

990
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,240
That's a leap.

991
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,180
Isn't it?

992
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,800
This man, Tom Fitz, John Fitzgerald, head of Six Flags is going to command.

993
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,600
Press a button.

994
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,320
Have the Cubs aborted.

995
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,240
I love the idea of someone giving a Tiger an abortion.

996
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,400
Bring me my Tweety Bird Sunday and have the Tigers killed.

997
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
This is worthwhile for us.

998
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,960
In a facility, yes, with Sylvester the Cat smiling down.

999
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,680
In New Jersey.

1000
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,280
That is a sort of tri-state area passion.

1001
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:24,780
Yes.

1002
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,120
It's a good old fashioned New Jersey Tiger abortion.

1003
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,440
But also, then there's videos recently of Tiger Cubs.

1004
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,640
They still, there's Tiger Cubs running around this place all the time.

1005
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,040
And that's now in 2020.

1006
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,560
Why did this guy jump to?

1007
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,120
I don't.

1008
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,480
They're going to kill the Cubs.

1009
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,040
I think that's theory that if the trainer, it might not be wrong.

1010
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,540
Yeah.

1011
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:45,880
He knows too.

1012
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,560
He's going to know so much.

1013
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,320
Someone's going to kill the Cubs.

1014
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,520
This is a warning.

1015
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,560
This is a warning.

1016
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,560
Someone with a high powered rifle.

1017
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,400
Full metal jacket.

1018
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,600
Did anyone respond to that post on the message board?

1019
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,640
That I don't know.

1020
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,760
It could be Googled if you want to do the further entomology.

1021
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,360
I believe that Theme Park Insider.

1022
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,120
Look for John Fitzgerald.

1023
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,640
Just Google John Fitzgerald Temple of the Tiger Cubs Aborted.

1024
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,880
So there's been some changes.

1025
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,240
They still have a safari park.

1026
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,600
You could see Kingda Ka in the distance.

1027
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,100
Wow.

1028
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,840
A real safari.

1029
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,040
With llamas.

1030
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,840
This is a massive off-road vehicle that you ride in to do it.

1031
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,680
They also offer VIP options or school group options.

1032
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,360
The VIP options is just like an SUV parked next to a giraffe.

1033
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,600
This is a white G. That's a OJ's Bronco.

1034
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:48,680
But in the 90s, you could get in your, in my family's case, your Plymouth minivan.

1035
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,640
You would follow a road, a paved road through the safari park

1036
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,560
and get pretty close to the animals to the point where,

1037
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,520
please remove your antennas or take them down.

1038
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:05,080
Or else the monkeys that crawl on your car will ruin your life.

1039
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,680
First off, they sometimes go crazy and beat up the cars anyway.

1040
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,880
But like the animals with like a rip off antennas.

1041
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,800
And I believe people have been mauled there.

1042
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,600
Yes, I think there are lions.

1043
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,400
Tigers now.

1044
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,920
Yeah, I think people have been mauled.

1045
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,760
They should have killed them in 2010.

1046
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,280
They're like, don't feed the animals.

1047
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,200
And people's immediately like, what if we brought like food and tried to give it to them?

1048
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,680
Please remain in your car, ladies and gentlemen.

1049
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,720
Please remain in your car.

1050
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,840
Oh, I'm getting out.

1051
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,800
Yeah, I got to get out.

1052
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,680
I got to get.

1053
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,640
What if I get close?

1054
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,280
Yeah.

1055
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,120
Got to feed them some Jersey Mike's.

1056
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,920
I got two exposures left on this disposable.

1057
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,640
Get them, honey.

1058
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,880
Oh no, he's whacking me with my own antenna.

1059
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,320
The subs gave him strength.

1060
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,960
Any, any clues?

1061
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,440
I looked up the gentleman's username and it does say he's a season pass holder at Six Flags.

1062
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,560
Could still be the trainer.

1063
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:01,480
He's not.

1064
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,840
They're not mutually exclusive.

1065
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,760
I found there's a there's a post here from somebody who

1066
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,200
said he was posted a video of what got the temple of the tiger closed.

1067
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:10,680
That's right.

1068
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,200
The tigers caught in the act looks real dangerous to me.

1069
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:14,600
Not.

1070
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,840
And then it has the link like spurned trainer.

1071
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,920
So I will look up the YouTube link here.

1072
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,800
125.

1073
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,160
They gave me a time code.

1074
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,760
The video is unavailable.

1075
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,200
No, damn.

1076
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:31,960
As a tiger trainer, if at a certain point they're like, hey, you can't we can't have this show anymore.

1077
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,120
People don't like this stuff like, you know, treating animals this way anymore.

1078
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,560
What do you do after that?

1079
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,880
Like, what does he do for his next job?

1080
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,380
Yes.

1081
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:48,040
Maybe some shady circus could hire or he could just does it just like he becomes a

1082
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,080
particularly cruel like child actor trainer.

1083
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,440
Yeah.

1084
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,920
Like, I'll make sure they hit their foreign country or something where they don't care as much.

1085
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,960
Rules are more lax.

1086
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,400
When is the Siegfried and Roy accident?

1087
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,520
Is that the number one job if you're a tiger trainer in the mid 2000s?

1088
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,000
Is being on team to be on the team.

1089
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,480
Oh, yeah.

1090
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:09,720
Yeah.

1091
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,200
Gotta be.

1092
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,480
I mean, just the the glamour alone.

1093
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:14,520
Yeah.

1094
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,920
Do you? Yeah, you get issued like a big white fur when you get that's your uniform.

1095
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,400
Rolling in with those guys to like a casino buffet.

1096
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,320
Could there be anything better?

1097
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:25,640
Yeah.

1098
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,160
Can you imagine the two of them?

1099
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,280
High to their power.

1100
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,880
You're walking around in their entourage.

1101
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,480
You're like Johnny drama in the Siegfried and Roy entourage.

1102
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:40,040
And you get to scoop like eggs and bacon from the buffet with like a diamond encrusted ladle.

1103
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:40,600
Oh, yeah.

1104
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,280
You get your own.

1105
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:42,780
Yeah.

1106
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:48,460
And the MGM grand large cats were different than the Siegfried and Roy ones.

1107
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,020
Is that correct?

1108
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,140
A lot of cats in Vegas.

1109
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,420
A lot of cats in Vegas.

1110
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:56,060
All of them now prowling the city for their next meal.

1111
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:56,860
Out you go.

1112
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:58,620
Good luck.

1113
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,700
A lot of food for Tiger Whip.

1114
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,100
Yeah.

1115
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:01,900
Knows where to find it.

1116
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:08,940
You know, we haven't talked about it's just like what's what did what this thing feel like?

1117
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:09,820
How did you feel?

1118
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,940
Do you feel like you did?

1119
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:12,220
Yeah, it rocked.

1120
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,020
It's a great ride.

1121
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,420
It was very fun.

1122
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:17,900
Yeah, it was.

1123
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,020
I mean, it is very short.

1124
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:20,860
Yeah, it seems like.

1125
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,740
Yeah, it's it's it's up and down, but it's a crazy up and down.

1126
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:25,580
It's just a crazy up and down.

1127
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:34,060
And it I liked it because it was so fast and so smooth and that when you're done with it,

1128
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,260
you don't feel sick or anything.

1129
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:39,100
And I definitely wanted to go back like get in line again, but it always had the longest line.

1130
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:39,500
Oh, sure.

1131
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:39,900
Yeah.

1132
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,300
So you hit up the other rides and then maybe come back later.

1133
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:42,780
Oh, sure.

1134
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:43,260
Makes sense.

1135
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:43,820
Yeah.

1136
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:47,660
But yeah, especially on like a chilly night for the Fright Fest in New Jersey,

1137
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,180
shooting up there like with the cold wind in your face.

1138
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:51,660
Wow.

1139
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,220
Whoa.

1140
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,100
Felt really good.

1141
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,220
I've said this before.

1142
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:58,780
I think the launch like this actually, as much as it looks scary, is a lot less scary

1143
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:04,300
psychologically than like hang time, which is a Nats coaster that droops you over for like what

1144
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,980
feels like a minute pauses.

1145
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:06,940
It makes you pause.

1146
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:11,420
It goes up 90 degrees slowly, which makes you feel like you're going to fall off that.

1147
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,700
Then it hangs you.

1148
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,820
And then it does a regular thing.

1149
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,980
Like this seems like it's so fast.

1150
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,780
It's in crazy intense, but it doesn't destroy your brain.

1151
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,820
Well, that with the drop, there's this slight corkscrew.

1152
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:25,980
And I think it was because like to slow it down or something or right.

1153
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:31,020
And it makes like the drop more tolerable, but you do get a second of looking down at it.

1154
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,940
But at that height, it's unfathomable.

1155
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,140
Like what's going on.

1156
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,020
So you're like, I don't know.

1157
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,060
This seems fun.

1158
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:36,380
Yes.

1159
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,780
You wouldn't even know what you were experiencing.

1160
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:45,900
Say you were to get launched off this thing or, you know, like sure if the straps didn't work.

1161
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:46,380
Oh, yeah.

1162
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,420
And you just like fell off.

1163
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,180
I don't think you'd really be able to process it.

1164
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,060
No, it would be fine.

1165
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,180
Everything would be fine.

1166
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:51,580
Yeah.

1167
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:51,900
Oh, yeah.

1168
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,580
You would land on your feet and walk away.

1169
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,220
Just land on a tiger's back.

1170
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:56,540
Yeah.

1171
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,820
All right.

1172
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,580
Tweety Bird Sundays for everyone.

1173
00:49:59,580 --> 00:49:59,900
Yes.

1174
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,540
Yeah.

1175
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,820
Do they have those?

1176
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:02,380
I don't know.

1177
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,420
Well, I'll tell you what they did in the mid 90s.

1178
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:10,460
Six Flags did have like come back if the rain was really bad.

1179
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:13,740
They would or like they would give you return tickets.

1180
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:14,140
Sure.

1181
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:14,700
That's cool.

1182
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:19,420
And they were but they called them Twickets like Tweety Bird.

1183
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:23,100
And I remember I had to write like how I spent my summer vacation.

1184
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,620
And I wrote about Six Flags and wrote that detail in.

1185
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:29,420
And the teacher like circled it as a spelling error.

1186
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:33,660
And I had to go to them and go like that's actually what they call it.

1187
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:34,780
It's not a spelling error.

1188
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:36,940
I am correct.

1189
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,500
You told the teacher this?

1190
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:39,740
Yeah.

1191
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:40,780
What did the teacher say?

1192
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,620
She docked points because of Twickets.

1193
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:42,860
Yeah.

1194
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,900
Like no, I want.

1195
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,540
It's a brand.

1196
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,820
And so she was like, I apologize.

1197
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,580
I had not heard of Twickets.

1198
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:49,900
Yeah.

1199
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:50,620
Yeah.

1200
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:50,940
Wow.

1201
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:51,420
Exactly.

1202
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,180
Did you explain like you know how?

1203
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:53,420
Okay.

1204
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,780
You know Tweety Bird, right?

1205
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,540
Tweety Bird talks a certain way.

1206
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:58,060
Like it's like Tweety Bird.

1207
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:58,220
Yeah.

1208
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:58,720
Okay.

1209
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,980
I would love a video of this.

1210
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:02,300
Yeah.

1211
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,980
A 10 year old man.

1212
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,180
Man-splaining.

1213
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,180
We got to settle this.

1214
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,700
We got to settle up.

1215
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:08,940
Okay.

1216
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,580
I want a public apology in front of the entire class.

1217
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,820
And an acknowledgement that I'm cool for going to places like Six Flags.

1218
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:18,380
Yeah.

1219
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,100
Wow.

1220
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:19,660
Twickets.

1221
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:20,780
I didn't know about Twickets.

1222
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,940
Yeah, I do not know about Twickets.

1223
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:23,820
That's amazing.

1224
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,380
If you recall Twickets fondly.

1225
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:26,860
I was not.

1226
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,820
Will you Google Twickets really fast?

1227
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:28,700
I know when to Google it.

1228
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,020
Yeah.

1229
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,460
Or don't you mean, did you mean tickets?

1230
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,740
Oh, I'm praying it's wrong.

1231
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:33,340
I'm praying it doesn't exist.

1232
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,100
I'm praying I have lucidated.

1233
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:39,100
The Wikipedia page is just like, these were a spelling error on a third grade.

1234
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,540
On one batch of tickets one summer.

1235
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:45,260
Why did they write a whole Wikipedia article about that?

1236
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:49,340
There is a first, the first thing that comes up is there's a company in the United Kingdom

1237
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,620
that I think is a resale.

1238
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,420
Okay.

1239
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:51,820
Okay.

1240
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:52,700
Called Twickets.

1241
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,420
That's what I mean.

1242
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:56,460
They call like candy bars Twickets over there or whatever.

1243
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,100
They call everything like, you know, everything something stupid.

1244
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,380
Everything something different.

1245
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:03,740
I looked up.

1246
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,500
It's a boot, not a trunk.

1247
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,220
Twickets, Six Flags, and it goes to the.

1248
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:10,380
Hold on.

1249
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:10,940
Oh, whoa.

1250
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,140
Oh, wait a minute.

1251
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:12,860
I'm not doubting it.

1252
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:13,980
I just want more.

1253
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:14,540
Yeah, yeah.

1254
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,020
Details.

1255
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:15,500
I took it in.

1256
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,780
Here's a message board.

1257
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:17,580
This is from 2010.

1258
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:20,620
My boyfriend and I were at Six Flags Great America a couple weeks ago,

1259
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,460
and we knew we would be back in October.

1260
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:26,540
His uncle happened to remember the Twicket promotion they used to offer.

1261
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:26,940
Yeah.

1262
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:32,300
Where you could upgrade your ticket for an extra $20 before you left to be good for another day of admission.

1263
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,460
So that's a different Twicket.

1264
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:41,580
No, that's what it was because we went back and then the day we went back, we got rained out.

1265
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:47,100
And so with the rain out, so ended up going to Six Flags three times for like.

1266
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:51,180
But the first thing you got, you had a Twicket, took the Twicket, but were rained out.

1267
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:51,500
Yes.

1268
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:52,300
Yeah.

1269
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,220
So then you went back to reuse the Twicket again.

1270
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:59,420
In the fall, like Fright Fest season, like, yeah, it would be cold or it would be rainy,

1271
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,860
but the crowds were very low.

1272
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:01,580
Yes.

1273
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:06,140
Would it run like the Lethal Weapons Stunt Show or the Batman Forever Stunt Show?

1274
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:06,380
Yeah.

1275
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:11,180
And like compared to Universal Studios out here with the Horror Nights,

1276
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,420
the Fright Fest was like really low rent.

1277
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,380
Yeah, pretty small.

1278
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,220
A few zombies here and there.

1279
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:18,860
Yeah.

1280
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:19,500
Amazes?

1281
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,700
Were there full?

1282
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,300
No, nothing like that.

1283
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,580
Like no haunted houses.

1284
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,780
It was just like, it's dark outside and we're going to have a few people scare you every

1285
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:27,500
once in a while.

1286
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,620
But overall, like you could avoid them easily.

1287
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:35,180
Whereas at Horror Nights, like you're going to get spooked no matter what.

1288
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,780
Those guys are, they're gunning for you.

1289
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,020
Yeah.

1290
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:41,180
They, there's like real full coverage of the property.

1291
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:41,420
Yeah.

1292
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,060
Yeah.

1293
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,020
But just maybe like.

1294
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:43,980
Hacked with zombies.

1295
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:47,100
And you maybe see four zombies your whole night at Fright Fest.

1296
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,500
It's like, yeah, if we just walk fast enough, they won't bother us.

1297
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,700
They're not going to come after us.

1298
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,900
Because they walk slow.

1299
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,380
Yeah, they have to walk slow and they don't feel like doing it either.

1300
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,060
To build it up.

1301
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:56,700
Whereas here.

1302
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,980
I think it's a little bigger now.

1303
00:53:58,860 --> 00:53:59,500
Out there?

1304
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,780
Yeah, I had all of them.

1305
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,340
All of them.

1306
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,900
I think they duplicate Fright Fest stuff.

1307
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:04,220
Yes.

1308
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:04,460
Yeah.

1309
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:10,460
And just, I feel like all of the actors and makeup artists in Los Angeles that have

1310
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:14,060
probably the free time around Halloween to go all out.

1311
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,620
They really do a great job.

1312
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:16,940
Oh yeah.

1313
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:21,740
Whereas Fright Fest is New Jersey people that are probably hired to like do another job there.

1314
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,260
And they're like, you got to be a zombie tonight.

1315
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:23,980
Yeah.

1316
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:24,700
And they're like, all right.

1317
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:25,740
I'm at Fright Fest here.

1318
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,500
I'm at the haunted hayride here.

1319
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:27,820
Yeah.

1320
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:28,140
Yeah.

1321
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:28,620
I'm at the other thing.

1322
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,580
They did.

1323
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:34,540
When we went to Fright Fest in October, there was a maze that if you recall,

1324
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,020
had a massive pile of shit in it.

1325
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:37,500
Human?

1326
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,220
It was not real.

1327
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:41,180
That's part of the narrative of the sewer maze.

1328
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:41,740
Oh, okay.

1329
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,220
Just shit.

1330
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:43,740
They're like, guys, we have to be honest.

1331
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,180
This is a sewer.

1332
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,100
There needs to be a big pile of shit.

1333
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:47,600
Yes.

1334
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:49,580
They want it to be very accurate.

1335
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:50,540
Can't people just imagine that?

1336
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,460
Can't we just let them know, yes, they're in a sewer?

1337
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,900
It's like, nope, nope, nope.

1338
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:54,620
They're in a sewer.

1339
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,540
We got to see shit.

1340
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,420
They wanted to see you to experience the horror of the plumbing system.

1341
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,580
They wanted you to know what it's like.

1342
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,220
What a nightmare.

1343
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,900
How underpaid, how underfinanced the sewer system can be.

1344
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:06,220
Yeah.

1345
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:06,460
Yeah.

1346
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,100
That was a 3D one.

1347
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,220
We had to wear 3D glasses.

1348
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:10,700
Wow.

1349
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:14,460
And it showed you all the numbers at the end of how much it costs to run the sewer system.

1350
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:14,960
Uh-huh.

1351
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:15,660
How much?

1352
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,160
Underfunded.

1353
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,300
Facts of hourly rates.

1354
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,420
Which administration's gutted, the funding for it.

1355
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,020
The year of the last pay raise.

1356
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,700
They're like, oh, the horrors.

1357
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,780
I'm terrified.

1358
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:27,580
Yeah.

1359
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:28,700
Clinton was president.

1360
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,300
Poor infrastructure.

1361
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:40,540
So there have been incidents on this attraction.

1362
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,060
Mostly it's run pretty safe.

1363
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:47,180
Actually, we should talk about this is not an incident, but it is an oddity about this ride.

1364
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:52,220
And I was trying to remember if we talked about this aspect with your wife, Kelly,

1365
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:56,700
a while back, that the strangest thing about this ride, that you can,

1366
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:02,620
they tell you before you get on that there is a possibility of rollbacks.

1367
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:10,380
You could make it all the way to the top and sit there for a minute and then not quite crest that

1368
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:14,860
hill and then roll all the way backwards and have to do it again.

1369
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,300
Never seen that before.

1370
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,020
Really weird.

1371
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:17,340
Never seen that side.

1372
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:21,980
This has to be the only roller coaster where they tell you there's the possibility that

1373
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,740
it might not do what it's supposed to do.

1374
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,300
Make it up.

1375
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:25,260
Yeah.

1376
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:28,700
That little Casey Jr. might not think I can.

1377
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,660
It's way up.

1378
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,860
There's versions of it.

1379
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:34,380
I think on Hagrid's, I think I could be totally wrong, but the new Harry Potter

1380
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:38,220
coaster where it does sometimes like that'll roll you back and you do the launch again

1381
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,420
in certain sections.

1382
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:40,460
It could be totally wrong.

1383
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,620
I'll cut this out to make myself not look stupid if I'm wrong.

1384
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:46,620
So I like there is something like that, but this seems like such a crazy.

1385
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:46,860
Yeah.

1386
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:50,300
You might go like 430 feet.

1387
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,140
Yeah, you might miss it by five feet.

1388
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:53,340
Yeah.

1389
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:54,220
Because that's what, yeah.

1390
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:58,540
In the examples I saw, it seems like it does get up there and then just doesn't have the

1391
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,380
forward momentum anymore.

1392
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:00,620
Right.

1393
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:06,860
You do the entire thing, which if I were like, if I were coerced into going on this thing

1394
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:10,540
and I did it begrudgingly and then I made it up, oh, few, we made it up.

1395
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,180
Wait a minute.

1396
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:11,740
What the fuck?

1397
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:14,380
We have to go down backwards and then do it one more time.

1398
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:14,620
Yeah.

1399
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:15,980
That's bad news for me.

1400
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:16,220
Yeah.

1401
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:21,660
I don't know if it's just because it's a basic, some sort of basic version of whatever

1402
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:24,780
it launches where it's not a perfected system.

1403
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,220
It's kind of just seems like it's just like some peg that grabs you.

1404
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:28,380
Right.

1405
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:28,860
That's what it is.

1406
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:34,540
It just hooks it and it shoots you up and sometimes it misses by a couple.

1407
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:39,580
It must be that they wanted to make it so tall to get the world record or something

1408
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,820
that it's like, all right, we're pushing it here.

1409
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,780
We probably could have lowered it by 10 feet and gotten it right every time.

1410
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:45,180
Oh, yeah.

1411
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:48,220
We need to say that it's the tallest.

1412
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:54,220
They bump up and then they start running tests and like, well, it's mostly getting hurt.

1413
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:58,700
Well, they haven't really replicated it anywhere and I'm wondering if it's just like,

1414
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:01,020
yes, it's not worth the headache.

1415
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:01,500
Definitely not.

1416
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:05,260
This was in the news a lot, these incidents you have, Scott.

1417
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:12,540
The local news every now and then would be like, well, Six Flags, trouble at Six Flags,

1418
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:16,300
yet again with Kingda Ka, something would happen.

1419
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:19,180
Yes, no one has died on this one.

1420
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:26,620
There's a more infamous story of there was a fire and a haunted attraction in the 80s

1421
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:35,820
that led to a massive court case and new laws about inspecting dark attractions or dark

1422
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,140
businesses where your vision is obscured.

1423
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:40,620
Oh.

1424
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,140
But that did not happen with this.

1425
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:48,940
The incidents are odd, but no one grievously injured.

1426
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:49,500
Yeah.

1427
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:57,020
Well, the oddest one probably is that one time a couple years ago, this coaster pulled a Fabio.

1428
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:03,500
By that I mean somebody got hit in the face by a bird, like some kid, like a 12-year-old

1429
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:03,980
or something.

1430
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:05,820
I don't know at what point on the ride.

1431
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:06,780
Pulling a Fabio.

1432
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:07,100
Yeah.

1433
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:12,700
The most famous bird hit incident, and this one wasn't as cool to look at.

1434
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:16,860
The Fabio one was so crazy where there's this blood coming out of his nose.

1435
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:22,220
Maybe the thing just wasn't photographed because it seems like it didn't...

1436
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,860
The kid who got hit in the face wasn't that affected.

1437
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:28,860
It just hurt a little bit, and I think he did have to get some money from Six Flags.

1438
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:36,300
But he described it as the bird exploded and the people behind him just had feather

1439
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,460
guts all over their faces.

1440
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,500
This is like a cartoon.

1441
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:45,180
The Fabio was like he got hit with a pointy beak and busted him open.

1442
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:46,940
His I think was a bigger bird too, I believe.

1443
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:50,540
This was a pigeon, and Fabio was like a goose.

1444
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,660
It was something big and grand, I think.

1445
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:54,620
Canadian goose.

1446
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:56,620
Very rare, it was the last one.

1447
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:03,020
I know the answer to this, but we should do a whole episode on just Fabio getting

1448
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:04,140
hit in the head with a bird, right?

1449
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,020
Oh yeah.

1450
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:06,060
I always thought of that.

1451
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:07,980
We got to see what the date...

1452
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,500
Well, actually, I have the date.

1453
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,140
We should do 90 minutes, like the Zabruder film of it.

1454
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,380
Last year was the anniversary.

1455
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,460
We should have done it for 20 minutes.

1456
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:18,060
Oh, what's the date?

1457
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:18,860
I don't have the date.

1458
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,220
It just says 1999.

1459
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,140
Oh, the solemn event.

1460
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:24,140
We should take a minute of silence.

1461
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:24,640
Yeah.

1462
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,940
I pulled the Philadelphia Inquirer had a story about it.

1463
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:32,780
I couldn't tell if it was from the Inquirer or the Daily News because I think they merged

1464
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:33,820
at some point.

1465
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,940
Detail in this, the boy's name was Shane.

1466
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:44,620
Shane said that he was briefly distracted by the sound of an alarm and turned his head

1467
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:48,620
to the right, which was when the bird collided with the side of his head.

1468
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:51,420
Had he not, the bird could have hit him in the eyes.

1469
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:51,920
Oh my God.

1470
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:57,420
So he happened to look away and got hit in the side of the head.

1471
01:00:58,620 --> 01:00:59,820
Jeez, do we know what kind of...

1472
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:00,860
We don't know what kind of bird.

1473
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,540
Scott said it was a pigeon.

1474
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:03,660
Oh, you said it was a pigeon.

1475
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,620
Common pigeon.

1476
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:05,260
Yeah.

1477
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:09,820
I'd like to think that maybe at that speed, maybe this is too fantastical to happen in

1478
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:14,780
the real world, but maybe it would have been a fly kind of scenario where he...

1479
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:15,900
Became a pigeon?

1480
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:16,620
Yeah.

1481
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,220
Gets pigeon powers or something.

1482
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:18,720
Yeah.

1483
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,180
The DNA is just...

1484
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:22,700
Yeah, you're saying it's so fast.

1485
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:23,580
Like the Hulk.

1486
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:24,780
Like the Hulk cannon.

1487
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,660
The molecules get fused together.

1488
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:29,100
I don't know.

1489
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:32,300
It's like a good origin story to someone.

1490
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:32,940
That's pretty good.

1491
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,060
We should follow that one away.

1492
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:35,180
A roller coaster.

1493
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:38,060
I don't know what pigeon powers you would want, but maybe none.

1494
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:39,180
Flying?

1495
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:39,660
Flying.

1496
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:40,380
Flying.

1497
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:40,700
Yeah.

1498
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:40,940
Okay.

1499
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:41,500
So you get to fly.

1500
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,740
But maybe you would also somehow get roller coaster powers.

1501
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:46,540
Because you're also the DNA of a...

1502
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:52,380
So I am now a roller coaster pigeon creature.

1503
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:54,140
So then he could launch him.

1504
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,940
Oh, in a bound.

1505
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:57,260
Yeah.

1506
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:57,900
Yes.

1507
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,340
He launches himself.

1508
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,220
He has the power of magnets.

1509
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:07,820
He can launch from 0 to 128 in 3.5 seconds.

1510
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:08,140
Yes.

1511
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:08,700
Yeah.

1512
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,620
And then he could kind of fly a little bit.

1513
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:11,020
A little bit.

1514
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:11,500
Yeah.

1515
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:11,900
That's pretty good.

1516
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,020
Now keep in mind he stinks, but remember the launch part.

1517
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:16,620
And also he doesn't always get all the way up.

1518
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:17,660
Sometimes he comes and then he's good.

1519
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,420
Sometimes he immediately falls back down backwards.

1520
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,820
Shitting constantly.

1521
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:22,300
Yes.

1522
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:22,940
So decent powers.

1523
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,060
Carries a lot of diseases.

1524
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:25,180
Others are lesser.

1525
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:25,980
It comes out in the wash.

1526
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:29,340
Fabio was specifically a goose hit him.

1527
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:29,900
Was a goose.

1528
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:30,460
Wow, you got it right.

1529
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:30,940
Was a goose.

1530
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:35,180
The end of the article about King Daka, the boy getting hit on King Daka,

1531
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:37,020
does mention the Fabio story.

1532
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,740
And I think it's worthwhile reading this summary.

1533
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:39,980
Yes.

1534
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:48,140
But a similar incident in 1999 bloodied the famous face of Italian model Fabio Lanzoni,

1535
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,220
the erstwhile margarine pitch man.

1536
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:57,340
He was riding Apollo's chariot at Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, Virginia when a goose crashed

1537
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:03,580
into his face as a roller coaster sped into a 210 foot drop.

1538
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:05,820
He couldn't believe it wasn't butter.

1539
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:07,120
What?

1540
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:09,900
That is the last line of the article.

1541
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:10,400
Dude.

1542
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:14,140
A major newspaper of the time.

1543
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:17,580
How is a goose?

1544
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:19,440
Exactly.

1545
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:21,900
The goose was not.

1546
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,300
He couldn't believe it was not butter.

1547
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,660
The goose wasn't butter.

1548
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:30,540
He loved doing those ads so much and was so locked into it that he questioned whether

1549
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,060
everything in his life was butter.

1550
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,900
The erstwhile margarine pitch man.

1551
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,500
The erstwhile margarine pitch man.

1552
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:41,180
Puts it up with a past episode.

1553
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:47,020
The head of a guy who owns a park in Asia was described as a mercurial casino magnate.

1554
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,580
That's a good cousin.

1555
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:50,860
Yeah, it's a good cousin.

1556
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,380
Erstwhile margarine pitch man.

1557
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,340
Oh man.

1558
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,020
You were in a Dunkin' Donuts commercial.

1559
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,660
We can describe you as an erstwhile donut pitch man.

1560
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,180
Well, yeah.

1561
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:00,620
Erstwhile enthusiastic.

1562
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:02,860
Current donut enthusiast.

1563
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:07,820
A pitch man makes it really seem like it's your product and you're trying to get it out into the world.

1564
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:08,940
Billy May's style.

1565
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,440
Yes.

1566
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:10,940
I'm like.

1567
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:11,820
Yeah, come on.

1568
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:14,620
Get this hot sauce off the shelves.

1569
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:17,260
Like, Fabio is really like margarine.

1570
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,260
Like, it's the new thing.

1571
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:23,660
He consulted with the food scientists to make the recipe to his liking.

1572
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:25,740
It sounds like an elixir.

1573
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:30,060
You know, it's like Fabio and sons selling an elixir of some kind.

1574
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:31,420
That's a pitch man in my mind.

1575
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:31,920
Yeah.

1576
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,300
You want your hair to be luxurious like mine.

1577
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:41,340
And then like it gives it to like, you know, weird little weird short guy and old lady and they all end up with Fabio.

1578
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:41,740
Yes.

1579
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:42,460
Yes, exactly.

1580
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:43,740
Like, I gotta buy this now.

1581
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:45,980
That's a pretty good ad campaign.

1582
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:48,380
Did they have margarine commercials anymore?

1583
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:50,380
I feel like I haven't seen a margarine commercial in a while.

1584
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:53,100
I feel like Brummel and Brown was the one with yogurt.

1585
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:53,900
Remember that one?

1586
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:54,960
No.

1587
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:56,940
Remember Brummel and Brown?

1588
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:00,700
Jason, name your top five favorite margarines.

1589
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:05,660
Easy Breezy, Brummel and Brown, Eat Scott Yogurt, Blend It Right In with Creepy Taste of Butter.

1590
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,740
Wait, you're saying this is modern?

1591
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:10,540
No, it's from his childhood in the 30s.

1592
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:11,580
Like late 90s.

1593
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:12,620
This feels made up though.

1594
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:13,740
That song didn't rhyme.

1595
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:14,620
Yeah, do the song again.

1596
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:15,900
I mean, that was an excerpt.

1597
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,500
I don't remember the full song.

1598
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,000
Okay.

1599
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,180
There was more to it.

1600
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:19,980
Yeah, there's more.

1601
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,460
Were you a margarine family growing up?

1602
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:30,380
Every now and then we'd get Brummel and Brown, but I think mostly from the jingle.

1603
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:33,020
Is that a local margarine?

1604
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:34,300
I don't know.

1605
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:37,580
I think those are dash commercials.

1606
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:40,540
That's the song the man sang who delivered it to your door.

1607
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:43,900
This is the second episode where I'm the margarine man.

1608
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:47,180
The erstwhile margarine pitch man that would go to your home.

1609
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:50,220
Your local erstwhile margarine pitch man.

1610
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:55,820
BrummelandBrown.com creamy butter spreads.

1611
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:57,020
Deliciously creamy.

1612
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,140
Made with real yogurt.

1613
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,820
That logo is real, Lawrence.

1614
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:00,540
Let me see the logo.

1615
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:01,020
No way.

1616
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:03,420
That logo is like all in the packaging.

1617
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:07,980
It's like how Land O' Lakes makes spreadable butter now.

1618
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:10,380
Doesn't that feel like it's, I don't know.

1619
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:11,820
I just don't like that graphic design.

1620
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:14,460
The design looks like it was made on Microsoft Paint.

1621
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:17,260
It hasn't changed since 1999, I'll tell you that.

1622
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:18,060
That was the logo.

1623
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:19,660
Well, that's probably what they made it in.

1624
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:25,100
While we're talking about jingles, what I remember very clearly about Six Flags Great Adventure,

1625
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:29,660
they got a lot of life at Batman on the Ride.

1626
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:32,220
Gave them commercial footage for like a decade.

1627
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:36,620
That loop where you go on the outside, your legs are dangling.

1628
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:40,860
But the radio ad for a while would end with a jingle that just went,

1629
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:44,060
Six Flags Great Adventure, we had fun.

1630
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:45,180
Oh, yes.

1631
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:45,740
Yeah, yeah.

1632
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:46,460
That was it.

1633
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,740
That was the, someone's like, I got it.

1634
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:51,420
I figured it out, gang.

1635
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:54,060
Yeah, I guess it's inoffensive.

1636
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:54,940
It's inoffensive.

1637
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:56,300
Yeah, you wanted people to have fun.

1638
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,460
I think this is what we had fun.

1639
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:00,700
In the past tense.

1640
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:02,460
Like you went.

1641
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:03,580
Those people already went.

1642
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:03,900
Yes.

1643
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,980
Even though you're watching an ad encouraging you to go,

1644
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,900
we're hearing from people who went.

1645
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,980
So I guess, yeah, the idea was like they're telling you,

1646
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:12,460
we had fun, so you should go and do it as well.

1647
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:13,740
But they don't mention that part.

1648
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:14,620
But they don't say that.

1649
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:16,380
But that should be left to assume.

1650
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,980
They don't even mention they're going back,

1651
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,180
or if they would go back.

1652
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:20,860
It's like, yeah, we had fun.

1653
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:23,740
It's just a commercial for advertising people that were happy,

1654
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:25,260
satisfied with the experience.

1655
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:28,220
Yeah, the experience overall was satisfactory.

1656
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:28,780
That's nice.

1657
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,300
Satisfactory.

1658
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:34,380
15 seconds, new for 2005, Kingda Khan for 20 bucks.

1659
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:38,700
You can add Wild Safari Park, Six Flags Great Adventure, we had fun.

1660
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,460
Your little five second fill-in part.

1661
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:40,940
Yeah, yeah.

1662
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:41,500
Yeah.

1663
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,860
But why don't we have fun?

1664
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:44,620
No, we had.

1665
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:45,180
We went.

1666
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,620
Those people went and had fun.

1667
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:47,660
But why not we have fun?

1668
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:49,420
I think we have fun is weird.

1669
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:50,780
I don't know where that's coming from.

1670
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:51,420
Is that the park or is it?

1671
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:52,460
Yeah, because that almost seems like the people.

1672
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:54,300
Yeah, it's like, we'll have fun anywhere.

1673
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,300
Yeah, we have fun.

1674
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:56,940
You'll have fun.

1675
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,220
Swingers or something.

1676
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:59,260
You'll have fun?

1677
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:00,140
You'll have fun is good.

1678
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:01,180
You'll have fun?

1679
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:02,060
Oh, you'll have fun.

1680
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:03,100
Might have been.

1681
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,340
Maybe that seems like a mushy or something.

1682
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:07,660
Don Draper all of a sudden in here trying to punch this up.

1683
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:10,300
You'll have fun seems like it's like, come on, you'll have fun, go.

1684
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:11,180
Come on.

1685
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:12,140
Come on, where's the other one?

1686
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:14,780
It's like, you take my word for it if you want.

1687
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,140
I had a good time.

1688
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:17,500
You don't have to go.

1689
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,020
But then you're like, I want to go.

1690
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:20,060
These guys had a good time.

1691
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:21,100
And they're playing it so cool.

1692
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,220
They're playing it very cool.

1693
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:24,540
They won't describe what happened.

1694
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:25,820
They're not even telling me to do it.

1695
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:26,380
No, yeah.

1696
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:27,580
So let's check it out.

1697
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:28,140
Yeah.

1698
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:29,500
Let's go to Jackson.

1699
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:30,940
I think that's the town that was in.

1700
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:35,100
I guess that's like playing it cool with somebody want to date or something.

1701
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:35,340
Yeah.

1702
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:36,540
It's like, don't be sweaty.

1703
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:37,500
Don't be desperate.

1704
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,300
Hey, we had fun.

1705
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,700
It seems like you're avoiding something.

1706
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:43,820
Let's just see where it goes.

1707
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:44,700
Let's just see where it goes.

1708
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,140
It seems like something horrible happened.

1709
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:47,260
It's like, we had fun.

1710
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:47,820
We had fun.

1711
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:48,460
We had fun.

1712
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:52,540
Well, Shane had a thing at Kingda Ka, but he's OK.

1713
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:53,340
He's OK.

1714
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:55,340
Shaz is uncomfortable talking about Shane's act.

1715
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,860
Shane had a thing, but we had fun.

1716
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:57,340
Yeah.

1717
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:00,620
It'd be so much different if it was Six Flags Great Adventure, but we had fun.

1718
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:02,620
But we had fun.

1719
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,780
Nevertheless, we had fun.

1720
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:12,140
We had fun.

1721
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:13,820
Don't ask Shane.

1722
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:15,980
He's OK.

1723
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:17,580
Most of the family had fun.

1724
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:22,860
This ride is currently, there's an incident currently in progress,

1725
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:25,260
like in the month that we were recording this.

1726
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:26,220
Oh my god.

1727
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:33,500
Somebody was horribly injured involving Kingda Ka, but not on the ride.

1728
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,020
So Kingda Ka was like an accomplice?

1729
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:39,820
Essentially, and more so the teenagers working Kingda Ka.

1730
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:45,740
What happened was a guy was getting on the ride and he was didn't know what to do with

1731
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:46,460
his cell phone.

1732
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:47,660
Like, I got to put this somewhere.

1733
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:49,020
Do they not have lockers?

1734
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:49,900
This is OK.

1735
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:53,980
So this happens in a lot of things where it's very confusing because they have cubby holes,

1736
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:55,660
at least in Magic Mountain.

1737
01:09:55,660 --> 01:10:00,700
So you're supposed to like dump your phone just out in the open and a cubby hole and

1738
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:01,900
anything else you have.

1739
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:05,580
And there's a, at least on the hang time or not hang time.

1740
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:06,060
What's the one?

1741
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:07,740
I always forget Twisted Colossus.

1742
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:12,380
There is a little like envelope to put something in front of you.

1743
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:14,780
And usually at Disney, it's like you can put like a bag in.

1744
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:20,300
The one here at Six Flags, you could put like a Manila folder in.

1745
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,260
It was so tight.

1746
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,220
Your documents.

1747
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:24,220
You could put an important document.

1748
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,660
Not more than five or six.

1749
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:27,500
You could slide those in front.

1750
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:30,380
But anything else you had on your person, you had to go just throw in like a cubby

1751
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:32,700
hole as if you were taking your shoes off to get in a ball pit.

1752
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:38,300
The cubby hole system implemented before people carried around thousand dollar phones with

1753
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:38,620
them.

1754
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:39,660
I guess that's a good point.

1755
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:40,140
Yes.

1756
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:43,500
But they don't have like, I think maybe one or two.

1757
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:46,300
And Riddler's Revenge at Magic Mountain too.

1758
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:50,380
It was just like go throw all your shit on a table and then go back onto the ride.

1759
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:56,380
Not a bad system, but there's something worrisome.

1760
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,940
Should I leave it there on the table?

1761
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:00,300
Table works fine.

1762
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:05,420
Knowing that many groups of people will pass by the open table while I'm in the sky.

1763
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,860
Knotts had a thing for Pony Express.

1764
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:13,500
They have the cubby as well, but they close the cubbies once you've all put them in and

1765
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:16,700
then have the other cubbies load when you come back.

1766
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:21,420
Some sense of privacy and security.

1767
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:22,300
Yeah, a sense.

1768
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:24,700
Ultimately, it's still a cubby.

1769
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:26,620
Which is all honestly we have in this life.

1770
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:28,060
That's all we need.

1771
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:28,540
Yeah.

1772
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:30,540
Uh oh, someone else could read that good book.

1773
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:34,620
Yeah, it's all we have is a sense of his greatness.

1774
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:37,980
Let's just follow it.

1775
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:39,180
How are you going to know these quotes?

1776
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:40,540
You got the quotes at your disposal there.

1777
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:46,860
I think this ride figured out the worst possible system because a man asked,

1778
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:48,460
what do I do with my phone?

1779
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:51,500
And the guy said, I don't know, go put it in the bamboo over there.

1780
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:53,260
He did?

1781
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:56,700
Yes, as the official Six Flags employee responds.

1782
01:11:56,700 --> 01:12:01,260
And nearby there's a little patch of bamboo, perhaps because this is an Asian jungle themed

1783
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:01,980
area.

1784
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:05,820
So he went and hid it under some foliage.

1785
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:11,420
And then he went on the ride and then he got off and like, okay, go retrieve my phone in

1786
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:12,620
the bamboo.

1787
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:19,980
And his full shoe stepped right through a sharp piece of bamboo that went through his foot.

1788
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:25,260
Like through the shoe, through the foot, required stitches.

1789
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:32,140
The article I was reading had the reminder that sharpened bamboo on the ground was used by

1790
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:37,180
Vietnamese soldiers against American soldiers during the Vietnam War.

1791
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:38,620
Yeah, they said that in the article?

1792
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:39,900
Yeah, they reminded you just like-

1793
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:41,020
To tell you how sharp it is.

1794
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,620
Yes, yeah, just as an indicator.

1795
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:43,340
Charlie.

1796
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:48,300
This was meant to destroy the killing power of soldiers.

1797
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:52,620
And in this case, just a man trying to go on a roller coaster.

1798
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:56,460
And so he's suing the park as we speak and we'll see how it plays out.

1799
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,380
But what in the fucking world?

1800
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:01,020
Go hide your phone in the bamboo.

1801
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:06,700
I could see every different employee having a different place for you to put your shit.

1802
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:08,860
There's no unified-

1803
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:13,580
Like, first of all, the kid, when we tried, when my friend and I, when Anthony Gio and

1804
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:20,700
I were on Twisted Colossus, we had like collector's mugs from the press events, like skull-

1805
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:21,500
Full Steins.

1806
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,540
Investments.

1807
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:26,940
Yeah, I have them in there. And they were the same ones as the one at Universal. So they all

1808
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:34,700
had the same like clear light up skull mug vendor, essentially. So we were like-

1809
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:41,340
Mike taking calipers to the skull mug to like measure, like, how to say-

1810
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:46,860
Slightly different sizes, but the same skull design from both Universal and Six Flags.

1811
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:51,180
So there's a man or a com- I hope it's just a man who makes all these. One person.

1812
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:55,580
But yeah, we tried to get the employee to take them because we didn't, we assumed we'd just be

1813
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:59,660
able to put them in the thing in front, but it was only for six pieces of paper. So we were like,

1814
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:00,540
Oh, here, here.

1815
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:01,100
Our title.

1816
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:02,700
Could you take them?

1817
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:03,660
Registration.

1818
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:07,580
Because we were like, could you take these? And he's like, I'm not allowed to touch anything.

1819
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:09,500
Anything.

1820
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:10,620
So we're like, oh, okay.

1821
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,700
Even the button to start the coaster.

1822
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:13,100
Nope.

1823
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:19,180
So I'm handing like Anthony, like all my stuff because he has to now get out and go over to the

1824
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:23,660
area. So I could see every single part. Like also maybe the kid was just saying like,

1825
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:25,660
I don't want to do this shit. You do it.

1826
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:29,260
Yeah. It was probably partially a little bit of column A, a little bit of column B.

1827
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:32,060
Yeah. Because like, is it really some legal thing where it's like,

1828
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:32,620
can't touch it.

1829
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:37,500
We can't sue Six Flags if we're the one who puts it down on the dirty table.

1830
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:38,940
Right. Yeah.

1831
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:42,220
But if this kid puts it down on the dirty table and it breaks or somebody steals it,

1832
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:43,180
then we can sue.

1833
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:46,300
I could see like an older employee telling me, he's like, just don't touch anything.

1834
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,380
Okay. Cause like so and so got in trouble.

1835
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:49,820
Just to someone to ask, just don't do it.

1836
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,580
It's not company policy.

1837
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:54,540
Yeah. It's like unspoken. Like just don't just say you can't.

1838
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:55,980
You're in the clear if you don't touch it.

1839
01:14:55,980 --> 01:15:00,460
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Trust me. Like you'll make it farther if you just don't touch stuff.

1840
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:02,700
It's all in the throat and the bamboo.

1841
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:08,540
So yeah. So like whatever like table they had set up here in that situation,

1842
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:12,620
it was full maybe. And he's like, I don't know, just go throw in the bamboo over there.

1843
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:13,260
And he's like, the bamboo.

1844
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:16,700
Climb into the landscaping, the decorative landscaping.

1845
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:17,820
Put it in the tiger nest.

1846
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:19,020
Yeah. I like that.

1847
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:22,300
If you put it in the tiger nest, the tigers will protect it while you're on the ride.

1848
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:25,100
They'll think it's one of their eggs. They'll think it's a tiger egg.

1849
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:26,780
They'll sit on it. They'll keep the phone warm.

1850
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:28,860
Yeah. Yeah. And then they'll suit it.

1851
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:30,460
No one's going to abort them. It's fine.

1852
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:31,420
As soon as you come back.

1853
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:31,820
Those babies.

1854
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:32,860
We don't know that.

1855
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:33,580
Yeah. Yeah.

1856
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:35,180
We haven't gotten confirmation.

1857
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:35,900
Wait a minute.

1858
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,420
Wait a minute.

1859
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:42,540
When I went to a Mets game once, I had a metal water bottle with me in my backpack

1860
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:44,060
and they were like, you can't bring that in there.

1861
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:46,860
And I was like, like, it's just a water bottle.

1862
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:49,980
And he the guy was like, just go hide in the bushes,

1863
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:54,060
like outside of like a major league baseball stadium.

1864
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,620
And I did. And it worked out for me when I got back.

1865
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:58,620
I mean, I guess it's not the same thing that someone.

1866
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,460
Well, I guess this guy, his phone didn't get taken.

1867
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:02,540
He just got his foot in his foot.

1868
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:03,500
Yeah. Yeah.

1869
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:03,900
But yeah.

1870
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:07,100
Follow up. But that's what they're arguing in court.

1871
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,340
But did you get your phone back?

1872
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:10,940
Yeah. Case closed.

1873
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:14,380
He's got your big Android, your big Android phone was there.

1874
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:16,300
It is interesting.

1875
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:18,540
He did get his phone back.

1876
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:18,780
Yeah.

1877
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:20,780
He just got his foot messed up.

1878
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:22,300
We're supposed to pity this guy.

1879
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:23,260
You got your phone.

1880
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:23,900
What's your problem?

1881
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:24,700
You got your phone back, buddy.

1882
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:25,980
You'll walk someday.

1883
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:29,660
I wonder if it was like, you could see a situation where he would be like,

1884
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:30,940
I can't. It's my phone.

1885
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:33,900
I don't want to just leave it on the table or in this cubby hole.

1886
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:34,860
Like, what do we do?

1887
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:36,060
Well, then hide it somewhere.

1888
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:36,540
I don't know.

1889
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:37,260
Hide it somewhere.

1890
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:37,420
Right.

1891
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:39,180
We're not going to fucking hide the phone right now.

1892
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:40,460
Everybody else is doing it.

1893
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:43,580
Look, buddy, I'm hitting the button on the coaster in 45 seconds.

1894
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:46,460
You fucking go over and do something or you're just we're leaving without you.

1895
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:47,820
Because that is how it feels.

1896
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:49,820
I would imagine it probably sounded like that too.

1897
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:50,940
Like, listen, pal.

1898
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:53,660
Cobra leaves in 45 seconds.

1899
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:54,060
Yeah.

1900
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:57,100
You got 3.5 seconds to get up to speed if you miss it.

1901
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,220
He's got his hand on the button.

1902
01:16:58,220 --> 01:16:58,860
Dude, watch me.

1903
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:00,140
I'll put it.

1904
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:00,860
I'll do it.

1905
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:02,220
I'll fucking do it right now.

1906
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:03,180
It's lowering.

1907
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:04,300
It's lowering.

1908
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:05,100
Oh, fuck you.

1909
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:08,220
I'll fucking go walk in the bamboo.

1910
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:10,380
You really want to stand in that line again?

1911
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:11,660
That's 20 minutes.

1912
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:12,860
It's 20 minutes of your life.

1913
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:13,580
You never get back.

1914
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,740
It's how long it takes for my mom to make a pasta.

1915
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:21,580
I could be eating right now.

1916
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:22,540
I could have.

1917
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:23,980
I'm standing in the line again.

1918
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:25,180
My mom's gravy.

1919
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:28,860
All the people on the roller coaster are like, just go to the fucking bamboo.

1920
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:32,380
Just fucking walk in the bamboo and put your fucking thing down.

1921
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,300
We're trying to ride here.

1922
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,660
Got to get to Sunday dinner.

1923
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:37,980
It's different.

1924
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:39,820
We've got places to be.

1925
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:41,100
Grandma's making a gravy.

1926
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,300
Grandma's making a gravy.

1927
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:43,980
Get on the king of the car.

1928
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:46,060
I've got so much time.

1929
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:47,580
We've got to get on king of the car.

1930
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:51,980
Just get in the, just go in the boo so we can go to the sky already.

1931
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:54,700
Guy leans over, tries to hit the go button himself.

1932
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:55,580
I'm doing it.

1933
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:56,620
I'm fucking doing it.

1934
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:00,540
I love about great adventure in general is just imagining

1935
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:03,580
everyone there having New Jersey accents, which is true.

1936
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:04,380
Oh, yeah.

1937
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:08,860
It's just like, it's so crazy to me that they're investing millions of dollars

1938
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:12,220
into these roller coasters and stuff for just a bunch of New Jersey people.

1939
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:15,580
As a New Jersey person, it was fascinating to me.

1940
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:19,020
With that real New Jersey humidity too in the summers.

1941
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:19,820
Yes, yeah.

1942
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:20,700
It's brutal.

1943
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:21,180
It is.

1944
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:25,020
It's such an odd place for a theme park, but I guess there's really no great places for

1945
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,740
to put a thing that doesn't belong.

1946
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:29,980
Drive through safari in New Jersey.

1947
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:32,300
That's the craziest to me.

1948
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:33,340
It's like, really?

1949
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:36,060
You guys are you guys checking to see if like, you know,

1950
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:38,700
the temperatures and the climate are OK for that's fine.

1951
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:42,780
He looks fine to me.

1952
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:44,540
You're seeing a fucking gorilla.

1953
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:45,660
Is your fucking draft?

1954
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:47,260
If they get out of line, we'll shoot them.

1955
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:48,140
It'll be all right.

1956
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:48,460
All right.

1957
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:48,940
On your way.

1958
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:51,500
Did they say where they got the animals from even?

1959
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,340
And don't worry about it.

1960
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:54,860
My cousin, my cousin.

1961
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:55,740
It fell off the truck.

1962
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:58,300
I don't know.

1963
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,580
I didn't open it.

1964
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:01,020
It was there was stakes.

1965
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,700
There was animals in there when I got.

1966
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:03,100
Yeah, yeah.

1967
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:03,740
Yeah, I know.

1968
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:05,100
But when I got there.

1969
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,700
We got to put them in a field.

1970
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,540
I'm not going to keep them in my apartment.

1971
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:09,040
Yeah.

1972
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:15,500
He's going to lower the value of my Jersey Shore house if I leave him in the yard there.

1973
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:16,860
More he stomps around.

1974
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:18,940
Giraffe tracks.

1975
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:19,440
Yeah.

1976
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:21,580
All over the lawn.

1977
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:25,260
There's there's one more thing I have to say about this place that has

1978
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:31,580
I didn't realize until now also kind of adds to the Jersey ishness of it,

1979
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:36,140
which is that I was reading the article about the bamboo impaling the man's foot

1980
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:44,540
and it had a picture of the car of the coaster car itself towards the end of the ride.

1981
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:49,900
And, you know, as we know, Six Flags is not crazy deep, but detailed with the theming.

1982
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:55,100
They are not going to like make this like, you know, all right, so you're in like a jungle

1983
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:56,540
it's not a coaster car.

1984
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:59,100
It's a safari vehicle and you're going to climb aboard.

1985
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:00,620
It's just it is a coaster car.

1986
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:01,340
It's slightly thing.

1987
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,340
It's named something jungle ish.

1988
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:13,180
But so the the coaster car I noticed on the side of it is just a decal for got to be glued hair spiking glue.

1989
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:14,860
Excuse me.

1990
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:17,260
Whoa, wait, so there's ads on the cars?

1991
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:18,860
Apparently, yes.

1992
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:20,540
That was happening when I was there.

1993
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:21,500
Maybe this is a new thing.

1994
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,300
This is this photo.

1995
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:23,740
This article was from 2020.

1996
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:25,020
So this could be brand new.

1997
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:25,500
Wow.

1998
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,180
Yes, it's a hair gel.

1999
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:33,900
Yeah, got to be glued, which and it has photos of yeah, it's not just people with spiked.

2000
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:35,900
It's not just people who like make their hair a little tall.

2001
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,900
It's full on big old spikes.

2002
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:41,500
And as I say it, I'm realizing super situationy.

2003
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:43,180
Oh, yeah, right.

2004
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:43,420
Yeah.

2005
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:43,660
Okay.

2006
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:44,140
I know this.

2007
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:45,500
I've seen this brand.

2008
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:48,940
I don't use got to be glued, but I have seen it in the store.

2009
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:51,100
It's not a household name like a Brummel and Brown.

2010
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,820
Brummel and Brown's yogurt spread.

2011
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:56,220
Well, butter with yogurt mixed in.

2012
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:58,140
Oh, got to be glued.

2013
01:20:58,140 --> 01:20:59,500
We got yogurt in there, too.

2014
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:00,300
It's yogurt.

2015
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:01,020
How's the stick?

2016
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:03,580
Really weird.

2017
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:05,260
Very strange.

2018
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:08,460
Already a bright blue and orange and green car.

2019
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:12,060
There's a guy on this bottle that looks like Mark McGrath.

2020
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:18,700
Also, I guess you're going to see the car, the coaster car as you get on it.

2021
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:21,260
But overall, people, it's going so fast.

2022
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:25,100
It's not necessarily like a good advertising location.

2023
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:25,900
Hmm.

2024
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,740
Only track would maybe.

2025
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:34,380
Maybe if a pigeon was keeping up with it and going at the same speed, they might be able to read the ad.

2026
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:35,020
Yes.

2027
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:37,740
What pigeon isn't going to buy a hair styling gel?

2028
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:39,020
No, they got nowhere.

2029
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:40,220
Pigeon got nowhere.

2030
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:44,540
Maybe the you know, this guy that becomes part pigeon, part coaster.

2031
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:45,900
Oh, yes, the man, the hero.

2032
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:50,540
Maybe he like has to use the hair gel for something.

2033
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:53,420
He's like, I got the DNA of that, too.

2034
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:58,060
It's to make his hair into antennas to find out when people need help.

2035
01:21:58,620 --> 01:21:59,120
Great.

2036
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:00,060
Done.

2037
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:01,740
It's a very clean superhero.

2038
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:02,240
Yeah.

2039
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:07,660
Six Flags, honestly, they should just go all out and put ads on every ride vehicle.

2040
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:08,460
It's pretty good.

2041
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:09,660
Yeah, it is pretty good.

2042
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:13,980
May as well just what kind of like integrity.

2043
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:14,540
No, yeah.

2044
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:21,100
Like they should have like Bugs Bunny in like a shirt for like a local salon or something.

2045
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:21,980
Just like whatever you have.

2046
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:26,540
Five hundred dollars to have Bugs Bunny wear a shirt for like a month of your business.

2047
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:27,820
For a Chinese restaurant.

2048
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:30,300
Like a tinted windows business.

2049
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:34,220
Like when they tint windows and Bugs is wearing the shirt for like easy tint.

2050
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:42,620
Do you think that because there'll be a new Space Jam movie coming out at some point in

2051
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:47,820
the next couple of years, will more people go to will that bump up some Six Flags sales?

2052
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:48,620
Oh, I wonder.

2053
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:50,220
They'll probably have some space.

2054
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:54,940
It is kind of the only place where you can potentially go meet Bugs.

2055
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:55,260
Bugs.

2056
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:56,940
Yeah, you don't see him otherwise.

2057
01:22:56,940 --> 01:23:00,220
Yeah, I don't know if they have a costume of Babs.

2058
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:00,860
No, not Babs.

2059
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:02,300
What's the Babs is Lola.

2060
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:02,800
Lola.

2061
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:04,060
Lola Bunny.

2062
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:05,340
She'll probably show up, though.

2063
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:06,940
Yeah, if she's back.

2064
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:07,500
Yeah, Lola.

2065
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:08,380
For the new Space Jam.

2066
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:09,260
She's got to be back.

2067
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:11,820
I did actually read that she's back.

2068
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:17,820
I did recently get curious what is up with Space Jam 2 and there's very little info except

2069
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,980
that Bugs and Lola are back.

2070
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:20,480
Yeah.

2071
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:22,700
You read that on Deadline?

2072
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,060
Lola Bunny.

2073
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:27,020
Told you.

2074
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:29,020
Told you Lola is back.

2075
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:30,140
Repped by ICM.

2076
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:35,660
Like Brad and Jen with their SAG Awards backstage laughing.

2077
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:37,020
Bugs and Lola are back.

2078
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:40,540
Oh, Bugs and Lola still get along after the divorce.

2079
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:41,100
Still friends.

2080
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:41,740
So nice.

2081
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:42,240
Good.

2082
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:48,540
Something we haven't mentioned, in May of 2009 Kingda Ka was struck by lightning.

2083
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:53,660
And it closed until August 21, 2009.

2084
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:56,780
So pretty much the summer season it was out of.

2085
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:58,700
It reopened for like a Labor Day.

2086
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,060
Wait, what did the lightning do?

2087
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:01,820
Just the idea of being struck by lightning?

2088
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:02,540
They were like, it's down.

2089
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:03,340
It made it faster.

2090
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:04,140
It made it faster.

2091
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:06,780
It caused enough damage.

2092
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:09,260
It was damaged in Hurricane Irene too.

2093
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:09,820
Jesus.

2094
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:10,860
In 2011.

2095
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:11,980
So they had to repair it.

2096
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:14,460
It's only going to get worse with climate change.

2097
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:15,100
It's got to happen.

2098
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:18,300
Yeah, this one's probably not going to make it as long as other rides make it.

2099
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:18,800
Yeah.

2100
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:20,140
Poor Kingda Ka.

2101
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:24,860
Well, but maybe it'll be when the sea levels rise,

2102
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:27,580
it'll be sticking out much farther than most rides.

2103
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:31,580
So as the world is ending, it's one of the few rides people will still be able to go on.

2104
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:34,460
You have to board underwater.

2105
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:36,300
Where do I put my phone?

2106
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,660
Hey, in the starfish.

2107
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:39,260
The rollback.

2108
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:40,860
No, I don't want the rollback.

2109
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:42,460
Yeah, the rollback would be very bad.

2110
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:44,780
The rollback is essentially like a big water board.

2111
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:48,540
Being water boarded on Kingda Ka.

2112
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:49,020
Wow.

2113
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:50,700
Kudos to you, Kingda Ka.

2114
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:52,300
The one ride that will survive.

2115
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:59,740
Did you guys realize or read that there's also then a drop ride attached to Kingda Ka?

2116
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:01,180
There's also-

2117
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:02,140
Oh, because it's so tall?

2118
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:07,340
They had it built for a few years and then added another ride.

2119
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:09,420
Like, look at all the space we're not using.

2120
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:10,700
Yeah, that's pretty efficient.

2121
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:13,180
They did this to Superman in Magic Mountain as well,

2122
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:16,220
which Superman is a big crazy launch thing and then it goes back down.

2123
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:21,260
It's not like Kingda Ka, but then they just added Lex Luthor's drop of doom to the side.

2124
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:24,460
So they just plaster a different ride to the side of ride.

2125
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:29,740
Oh, which, and Lex Luthor's ride was the biggest drop and now it's this thing,

2126
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:32,540
which is called, oh, the name's good.

2127
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:33,180
I want to get it.

2128
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:35,260
Has it got to be like another jungle-y?

2129
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:36,140
It sure is.

2130
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:38,380
Yes. Zoomanjaro.

2131
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:41,420
Does it say what that means?

2132
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:46,380
No, but I saw a, this must have been the Wikipedia or something.

2133
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:50,860
Somewhere I found the quote, the name Zoomanjaro has African influences.

2134
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:57,260
But also just the word zoom in there, I guess.

2135
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:01,900
Manjaro because that's Kilimanjaro, that's the African influence?

2136
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:04,700
Yes. And the rest is referring to zooming.

2137
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:11,100
So weird. So I guess also the only two rides that will make it.

2138
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:13,340
It won't be as long of a drop.

2139
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:15,900
10 feet.

2140
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:17,740
You'll have to jump off or something.

2141
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:23,420
You'll take a boat to the drop ride and then you'll get on and it's a terrifying plunge

2142
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:25,020
into the ocean, the new ocean.

2143
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:25,420
Yes.

2144
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:27,420
The American ocean, I suppose we'll call it.

2145
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:30,620
The ocean that is covering America.

2146
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:35,420
Yeah, a beautiful future to look forward to.

2147
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:37,980
Yeah, the bamboo already pillaged for weapons.

2148
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:38,700
Yes. Yeah.

2149
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:39,980
We know how sharp it is.

2150
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:45,100
Oh yes. We should all go grab some now just in case.

2151
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:45,740
Yeah.

2152
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:46,940
If we need it in the future.

2153
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:47,340
Yeah.

2154
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:51,500
Start sharpening it up and start sharpening up our hair with got to be glued.

2155
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:57,660
Everybody keep your hands on the coasters and don't forget, got to be glued.

2156
01:26:57,660 --> 01:26:59,100
Like got to be glued.

2157
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:00,700
To make the announcements for the rides.

2158
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,500
Then have to start advertising.

2159
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:07,500
Hands and arms inside and remember for your styling needs.

2160
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:10,780
Any closing thoughts about King Kong?

2161
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:13,260
Any closing memories?

2162
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:16,220
Do you think you'll get over there again?

2163
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:17,340
I wonder.

2164
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:23,580
I don't know if I'll, I mean, I guess I'll go to a theme park again when my child is

2165
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,020
old enough and wants to go.

2166
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:31,900
So I can't foresee myself going to any Six Flags before that.

2167
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:34,540
You know, you have like a boys night out at a Six Flags.

2168
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:36,700
Let's do it guys.

2169
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:38,940
I mean, it does kind of sound fun.

2170
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:42,220
Has anyone been on a big roller coaster recently?

2171
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:43,340
Yeah.

2172
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:43,580
Yeah.

2173
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:43,980
I have.

2174
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,540
Is it the same, I guess?

2175
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:49,660
Like, I'm, I am a late bloomer.

2176
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:50,540
So with these coasters.

2177
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:52,540
You're really enjoying it for the first time.

2178
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:55,660
But some of them, yeah, I went on like, I went on rock and roller coaster when I was

2179
01:27:55,660 --> 01:28:00,780
younger, but like out outdoor coasters, really just like your brain gets, it takes maybe

2180
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:04,380
a couple of minutes longer to recover brain wise.

2181
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:06,220
But mostly it's fine.

2182
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:07,020
Okay.

2183
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:09,820
Especially if you were doing it a lot as a kid.

2184
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:10,060
Yeah.

2185
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:11,260
You should probably be fine.

2186
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:12,220
You could get, it's like a bike.

2187
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:15,420
You built up pain in my head.

2188
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:17,100
Yeah, you fucked up your brain enough.

2189
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:20,300
It's like a concussion.

2190
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:21,820
Your brain is used to swelling up.

2191
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:22,060
Yeah.

2192
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:22,380
Yeah.

2193
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,100
So it'll re-swell when this happens.

2194
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:25,900
Yeah, that's fine when that happens.

2195
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:26,540
It'll be fine.

2196
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:32,300
You'll build up your boy's tolerance and you'll like, and especially like get him sucking

2197
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:33,180
some fog.

2198
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:33,500
Yeah.

2199
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,900
So yeah, well, I wanted to be an impressive teen for sure.

2200
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:36,700
Yeah.

2201
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:37,340
So.

2202
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:37,740
He will.

2203
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:38,460
He swears.

2204
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:38,940
Yeah.

2205
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,300
Butt chug some fog.

2206
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:41,180
Oh yeah, yeah.

2207
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:41,980
Loudly curse.

2208
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:46,140
So you never forget that father son moment the first time you.

2209
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:47,980
Curse and butt chug fog.

2210
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:50,220
You teach your son to butt chug fog.

2211
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:54,620
I mean, other than Kingda Ka, yeah, I don't know if I'll ever go back, but it was a really

2212
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:55,900
cool ride when I did.

2213
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:57,660
I did love riding it.

2214
01:28:57,660 --> 01:28:57,900
Sure.

2215
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:03,180
So whoever, whatever aerodynamics like company, Ron Tumer, whoever made this thing.

2216
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:03,580
Thank you.

2217
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:04,060
The Ron Tumer.

2218
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:05,100
He did a great ride.

2219
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:06,140
It's good work.

2220
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:11,740
And hopefully building the model didn't take your own eye out.

2221
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:12,140
Yeah.

2222
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:13,500
Impale you like some bamboo.

2223
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:13,740
Sure.

2224
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:15,420
Scott, I have a question though.

2225
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:19,260
Is there something like, can we throw out real quick a couple of scenarios that would

2226
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:20,460
get you on Kingda Ka?

2227
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:24,300
Like say, for instance, just like if somebody goes, I'll give you a thousand dollars cash

2228
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:25,660
and you don't have to travel.

2229
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:26,940
Say you were there already.

2230
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:27,420
Yeah.

2231
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:27,740
For you.

2232
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:28,940
Five thousand dollars for Kingda Ka.

2233
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:29,820
No line.

2234
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:30,700
No line.

2235
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:31,180
No line.

2236
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:32,140
A thousand bucks.

2237
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:34,300
The nicest table for your device.

2238
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:37,420
Clean table.

2239
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:38,620
Clean table.

2240
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:40,780
Not sharp, as smooth as can be.

2241
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:41,820
So you'd have to think about that.

2242
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:44,220
I'm looking for one that you go, yeah, I'd have to do it immediately.

2243
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:44,460
Okay.

2244
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:45,660
Here's my second scenario.

2245
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:47,100
I don't mean to be a snob.

2246
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:47,420
Yeah.

2247
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:47,660
Yeah.

2248
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:49,180
Maybe a thousand isn't enough.

2249
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:49,420
Okay.

2250
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:49,900
That's fair.

2251
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,020
I'm just so okay.

2252
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:53,900
Here's my second scenario and everyone feel free to pitch in on different ones.

2253
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:54,140
Yeah.

2254
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:58,860
You're with Mike Love and Mike Love wants to go on Kingda Ka with you in the front row.

2255
01:29:58,860 --> 01:29:59,820
It's just the two of you.

2256
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:01,420
Oh man, my favorite beach boy.

2257
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:02,940
You and your favorite beach boy.

2258
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:05,260
That story you would tell forever.

2259
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:05,980
Scott, come on.

2260
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:06,940
The seat's open.

2261
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:08,620
They're going to start the ride soon.

2262
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:11,500
And he's, wait, does he have, no, do I still get a thousand dollars?

2263
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:12,620
No, no thousand dollars.

2264
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:13,180
Just it's.

2265
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:13,980
But I do get.

2266
01:30:14,620 --> 01:30:17,500
Somebody's got a kind of a grainy phone video of it.

2267
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:19,900
And it's you and Mike Love on Kingda Ka.

2268
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:21,100
Yeah.

2269
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:23,740
And if a pigeon were to strike him in the face.

2270
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:25,980
I could say I was there for the moment.

2271
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:26,380
Yeah.

2272
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:27,420
Or a goose.

2273
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:27,740
Yeah.

2274
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:28,060
Yeah.

2275
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:29,020
Oh boy.

2276
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:30,780
Maybe just Christmas goose.

2277
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:33,980
An 80 year old Mike Love gets hit in the face with a Christmas goose.

2278
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:39,180
A goose three times as fast as the one that struck the erstwhile Marger and Spokesman.

2279
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:42,700
Maybe Mike Love gets me on there.

2280
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:43,900
Maybe still though.

2281
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:48,780
And that I get to like, I'd get like, you know, I get 10 seconds to ask him questions.

2282
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:52,300
Is it true that you were going to do a rap song with Bart Simpson?

2283
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:58,140
I just love the idea of him being like, get on the ride and you think about it and say, no, thank you.

2284
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:00,620
You are not enough for me.

2285
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:01,580
You let me down.

2286
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:02,700
You're not a true fan.

2287
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:04,460
I'm sorry, Mike Love.

2288
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:06,780
I'm just not interested in going on a Kingda Ka with you.

2289
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:08,700
The Beach Boys.

2290
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:12,220
I'll officially say the Beach Boys don't think you're cool, Scott.

2291
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:14,300
Oh, oh my God.

2292
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:15,020
Fired off.

2293
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:19,100
And he makes it back safely and doesn't get hit by a goose.

2294
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:23,500
If someone could in the audience paint, like I want a very good picture,

2295
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,020
like drawn or no paint it.

2296
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:28,300
I would like a painted photo of Scott and Mike Love on Kingda Ka.

2297
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:29,100
That sounds beautiful.

2298
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:30,540
There is the skill sets.

2299
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:31,580
It's got to be a painter.

2300
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:32,220
It should be a painter.

2301
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:33,020
Do you have a medium?

2302
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:34,300
Is it oil?

2303
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:35,260
It's watercolor.

2304
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:35,740
Okay.

2305
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:36,860
I'm thinking watercolor.

2306
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:41,020
Yeah, you wouldn't reject a like fancier kind of painting.

2307
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:41,420
We'll see.

2308
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:43,260
I'll see it entirely.

2309
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:45,900
The only time I got to be gelled hair shell.

2310
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:46,300
Yeah.

2311
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:47,180
Different colors.

2312
01:31:47,180 --> 01:31:50,860
You're Kingda Ka is my skydiving is I'm too afraid to.

2313
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:51,340
Oh, okay.

2314
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:51,580
Sure.

2315
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:54,460
Would you do it if Mike Love wanted you to do it?

2316
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:57,260
As someone who's not really a Beach Boys fan, yes.

2317
01:31:57,260 --> 01:31:57,760
Yeah.

2318
01:31:58,540 --> 01:31:59,040
Easily.

2319
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:05,660
They've played the Ocean City Boardwalk a couple times the last decade.

2320
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:07,500
I think they've played great adventure.

2321
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:07,980
Not too far.

2322
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:08,860
Oh, is that right?

2323
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:09,420
I think so.

2324
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:09,660
Yeah.

2325
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:10,140
Okay.

2326
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:10,860
So really close.

2327
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:11,820
So this could happen.

2328
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:13,100
It could happen.

2329
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:13,420
Wow.

2330
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:15,660
Do they ride the rides after this?

2331
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:16,700
This is why we do it, man.

2332
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:17,660
They don't pay us at all.

2333
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:20,700
We do it for the love and for the thrills.

2334
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:24,620
I don't know.

2335
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:26,860
Let me get the maybe out.

2336
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:27,340
Mike Love.

2337
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:27,500
Yeah.

2338
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,420
Get me on that coaster with Mike Love and I'll do it.

2339
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:30,060
All right.

2340
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:30,940
That's priceless.

2341
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:32,300
See that money.

2342
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:33,980
That's going to be gone someday.

2343
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:34,480
Yeah.

2344
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:36,060
Love is forever.

2345
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:36,380
Yeah.

2346
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:37,900
But love is forever.

2347
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:39,020
Mike Love is forever.

2348
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:41,340
Well, fantastic.

2349
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:42,860
Thanks so much for joining us.

2350
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:44,940
Dan Klein, You Survive podcast, The Ride.

2351
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:45,440
All right.

2352
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:47,260
It's such a fun topic.

2353
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:51,260
Thanks for bringing it to us and for introducing the glory of 3D

2354
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:52,060
roller coasters.

2355
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:52,540
Of course.

2356
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:53,660
I'm happy to spread.

2357
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:54,220
Our lives.

2358
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:55,020
So peaceful.

2359
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:57,900
Everyone at home, just sit in front of the TV.

2360
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:58,700
Just watch.

2361
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:00,540
Do a watch through all of those.

2362
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:06,220
And really enjoy when the male host is on the ride and has to kind of still be hosting,

2363
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:07,660
but screaming on the ride.

2364
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:08,540
So he's like, oh, yeah.

2365
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:10,060
Oh, oh, yeah.

2366
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:10,940
That's a ride.

2367
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:14,060
Like he's kind of still in host mode.

2368
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:15,020
But he's like, oh, boy.

2369
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:15,500
Yes.

2370
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:16,620
Oh, boy.

2371
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:16,940
Yes.

2372
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:17,980
Oh, boy.

2373
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:19,420
He knows he's on camera.

2374
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:19,660
Yeah.

2375
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:21,420
Trying to keep it together.

2376
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:23,260
It's wonderful.

2377
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:27,100
Besides that VHS, let's exit through the gift shop.

2378
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:28,700
Is there anything you would like to plug?

2379
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:31,340
Well, actually, yes.

2380
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:37,180
I worked on a show, Sunnyside, last season that was forgotten by time already,

2381
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:40,540
even though it just came out to Hulu.

2382
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:41,260
Peacock?

2383
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:41,500
OK.

2384
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,220
To Hulu.

2385
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:42,780
OK.

2386
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:45,500
But there was recently an article.

2387
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:48,380
It's a show about a sitcom about immigrants.

2388
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:52,140
And there was an article recently that I read about another show about immigrants

2389
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:55,740
called Little America that mentions all the new shows about immigrants.

2390
01:33:55,740 --> 01:34:00,620
And Sunnyside is not mentioned because it was already just dismissed as like,

2391
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:01,580
this was not a show.

2392
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:03,100
But there's some really funny stuff.

2393
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:04,460
And we learned a lot about immigrants.

2394
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:05,740
And I really loved working on the show.

2395
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:07,420
So check that out on Hulu.

2396
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:08,860
Oz Rodriguez directed?

2397
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:09,340
He did.

2398
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:10,460
One of my favorite folks.

2399
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:10,860
Great director.

2400
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:13,100
Joel Kim Booster, Cal Penn.

2401
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:15,980
But there's a lot of the supporting cast is very funny.

2402
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:16,300
Wow.

2403
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:16,620
Wow.

2404
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:17,900
So it is a wait.

2405
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:18,940
So it is Hulu.

2406
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:19,820
It's on Hulu now.

2407
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:20,300
All right.

2408
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:23,260
So don't forget, even though this article forgot.

2409
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:27,100
And everyone wants you to forget about it so badly.

2410
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:27,580
God.

2411
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:28,140
Yeah.

2412
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:28,940
Network shit.

2413
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:31,100
Network and just TV in general.

2414
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:31,740
You're like, oh, yeah.

2415
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:34,460
If something's not like a smash hit, you're gone.

2416
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:38,380
It is funny now to hear friends get jobs on new network stuff.

2417
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:42,620
And you're not sure whether to go like, congratulations or, oh, I'm so sorry.

2418
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:42,940
Yeah.

2419
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:44,780
It's like, you just don't know.

2420
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:45,500
Sorry in advance.

2421
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:46,220
That can shift.

2422
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:47,260
Sorry in advance.

2423
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:47,820
Yeah.

2424
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:48,540
Godspeed.

2425
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:49,100
Gone.

2426
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:49,340
Yeah.

2427
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:53,740
Well, from zero to canceled in 3.7 seconds.

2428
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:55,500
Yeah.

2429
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:56,220
Sunny side.

2430
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:58,060
Although it's not even technically canceled yet.

2431
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:02,060
But you can't tell if it's that because they forgot about it or they just don't want to

2432
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:02,620
talk about it.

2433
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:03,500
But yeah.

2434
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:04,220
Very strange.

2435
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:05,340
Hot topic too.

2436
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:05,900
Gone.

2437
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:06,380
No one cared.

2438
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:06,780
Yeah.

2439
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:07,900
That was a show?

2440
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:08,540
That was a show.

2441
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:10,940
We're not referring to the store here.

2442
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:12,300
Because, no, that's live and well.

2443
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:12,540
Yes.

2444
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:13,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

2445
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:13,900
What did I say?

2446
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:14,700
Hot topic.

2447
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:19,180
No, I meant that immigration discuss inside.

2448
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:20,140
Oh, hot topic.

2449
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:21,340
I'll never forget hot topic.

2450
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:21,740
Come on.

2451
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:22,780
I get shirts there every week.

2452
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:22,940
Yeah.

2453
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:26,140
I think we're bringing up a TV series called Hot Topic.

2454
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:26,620
Why not?

2455
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:27,420
About the store?

2456
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:28,700
Yeah, sure.

2457
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:28,940
Yeah.

2458
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:30,620
That's good.

2459
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:33,100
A show about working at a hot topic.

2460
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:40,940
And somebody like having to, they're not like a goth already, but they need a job.

2461
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:42,940
So they have to kind of goth themselves to get this gig.

2462
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:46,940
I have a pilot already that has a guy working at a hot topic from like a decade ago.

2463
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:47,340
Wow.

2464
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:47,820
Fix it.

2465
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:49,260
I forgot all about it, honestly.

2466
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:52,620
The problem was it not being entirely hot topic centric.

2467
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:52,780
Yeah.

2468
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:53,340
No, it wasn't.

2469
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:56,140
It was an analogous hot topic.

2470
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:57,180
It should just be hot topic.

2471
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:57,820
Hot topic.

2472
01:35:57,820 --> 01:36:03,020
As long as the lesson is that family is just the people you love the most.

2473
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:04,220
Right?

2474
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:04,380
Yeah.

2475
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:05,340
Doesn't that sound good?

2476
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:05,820
That sounds great.

2477
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:07,420
Go for some text for hot topic?

2478
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:07,740
Yeah.

2479
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:08,380
Yeah.

2480
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:11,900
And that's on one of the t-shirts that they sell at the store.

2481
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:12,620
Something like that.

2482
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:14,860
It's on a rancid t-shirt.

2483
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:15,180
Yeah.

2484
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:17,660
And a bunch of pop figures could come to life in it too.

2485
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:18,540
Sure.

2486
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:18,860
Yeah.

2487
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:20,540
There's a lot of possibilities here.

2488
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:26,220

2491
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:38,700
I'm going to do a little addendum here because I like when we do a little play us out kind of music.

2492
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:42,540
And I want to acknowledge the music that was apparently played in the line.

2493
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:47,100
I don't know if you can confirm or deny this, but I saw a Wikipedia or something that said

2494
01:36:47,980 --> 01:36:50,700
the line for Kingda Ka had very specific music.

2495
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:53,020
It's kind of a jungle theme, as we said.

2496
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:55,260
So what kind of music are we going to play?

2497
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:57,740
Obviously, early 2000s trance music.

2498
01:36:59,100 --> 01:36:59,740
Hell yes.

2499
01:36:59,740 --> 01:37:06,140
Apparently, primarily the music of the Saffry duo, the most popular Danish act since Aqua.

2500
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:07,660
Wow.

2501
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:08,700
Since Aqua?

2502
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:09,340
Barbie Girl?

2503
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:11,580
That's pretty huge.

2504
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:12,860
That was a mega song.

2505
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:16,380
So that tells you the quality of this band.

2506
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:18,460
The Saffry duo, not the Safdie brothers.

2507
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:18,940
I saw it.

2508
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:19,500
Yeah.

2509
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,300
Saffry duo.

2510
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:26,780
So here, just to play us out, here is the biggest hit by the Saffry duo, the Bongo song.

2511
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:32,060
And just imagine being in line and this playing for a while.

2512
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:32,620
All right.

2513
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:34,300
So thanks for listening, everybody.

2514
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:35,180
It does sound familiar.

2515
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:37,900
Sounds like Six Flags, doesn't it?

2516
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:39,580
I like this.

2517
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:44,060
It's not dissimilar to Sandstorm by Daboud.

2518
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:49,740
They apparently did a trance version of Sweet Freedom with Michael McDonald.

2519
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:52,060
They got him in to do new vocals.

2520
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:52,540
Really?

2521
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:53,020
Yeah.

2522
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:55,020
So thanks, Saffry duo.

2523
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:55,580
Good work.

2524
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:57,580
Bye.
