1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:01,720
Forever.

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,540
Yep, test one two, test one two.

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,280
Okay, I think, yeah, I sound fine.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,340
I guess we can give him a couple more minutes, I don't know.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,000
It feels like we've given him enough time,

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,360
it feels like Scott's not coming back.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:19,340
Yeah.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,880
I think he's serious, I guess.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,920
All right, time to get down to it.

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,860
Let's do our rank the X-Men episode.

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,080
Well, yeah, we could do that.

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,600
I was also thinking, should we call Nate?

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,600
Should we call Mr.

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,060
Morrow?

15
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:30,960
Like as far as-

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,260
Oh, do you wanna get him on FaceTime

17
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,780
and see who his favorite X-Men are?

18
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,180
Well, yeah, I think he would have a lot of good opinions

19
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,040
about X-Men, I'm just saying like permanent hosts though.

20
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,600
Oh, that feels like a larger discussion.

21
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,680
Well, we can test him out.

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,180
Guys, guys, wait, wait, don't, please,

23
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,380
don't do any of that, I heard you.

24
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:48,960
Okay.

25
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,340
I got a lot of perspective last night,

26
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,940
thanks to someone very special.

27
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,400
Whoa, whoa, what the fuck is that?

28
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,080
What the hell, what the hell is that thing?

29
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,500
Watch out, punch it, punch it or something.

30
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,780
Guys, guys, no, no, no, no, no.

31
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,080
He's my friend.

32
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,900
His name is Cowfish, and I know he looks a little weird,

33
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,000
but when you get to know him, you'll understand him,

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,860
and you won't treat him like an outcast anymore.

35
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,220
He reminded me how important friends can be,

36
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,000
and how you're never really an outcast if you have friends.

37
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,260
Like you and me, Mike, and you and me, Jason.

38
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,040
That's true.

39
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,100
Is he doing one of those long fish-like shits right now?

40
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,760
Like red, you know what I'm talking about,

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,580
that red string that comes out of fishes?

42
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,420
Oh, yeah.

43
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,380
I think he's shitting.

44
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,020
Cowfish, what is that?

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,880
I hope whatever he just pooped out

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,380
isn't something that they serve at his restaurant.

47
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,680
Something else you should know,

48
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,120
there is a experimental fusion restaurant

49
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,620
named after Cowfish, and something tells me

50
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,500
if we all talk about it, explore everything about it,

51
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,040
then we'll have a great time,

52
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,520
and get this saga back on track.

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,280
What do you guys say?

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,560
I say hell yeah.

55
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,280
Jason?

56
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,780
Yeah, sure.

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,100
You know, one more ambivalent.

58
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,760
Say hell yes.

59
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,560
Hell yes.

60
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,380
Okay, great.

61
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,780
Let's all braid our hair.

62
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,700
He's gonna open his mouth,

63
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,500
and we just need to swim in there,

64
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,380
and connect our hair braids to his uvula,

65
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,520
and then that'll teach us everything we need to know

66
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,140
about him, and all his experiences, and his restaurant.

67
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,880
You guys get with that?

68
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,100
We have to go in his mouth?

69
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,300
Yeah, we gotta go in his mouth.

70
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,080
Don't worry, look, he took a poop,

71
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,880
so whatever that was isn't in there.

72
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,280
Do we have to come out the other end?

73
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,000
He didn't tell me that part.

74
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,740
Okay, he's been sure too?

75
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,680
Only one way to find out.

76
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,600
Come on, guys.

77
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,040
All right.

78
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,020
Let's go.

79
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,400
Where?

80
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,140
Where could he be?

81
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,340
Where?

82
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:43,580
Where?

83
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,220
When your town has made you frown,

84
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,980
when your square has made you swear,

85
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,520
when life gives you one more punch,

86
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,580
you need a doughnut soaked in Captain Crunch,

87
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,200
you need a place, a place to stroll with alcohol,

88
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,260
a place that features part of the Berlin Wall,

89
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,220
where seam-punk robots sell chocolate snacks,

90
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,240
a place where you can tattoo your lower back.

91
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,220
So let's go take a walk.

92
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,060
Let's all go to City Walk Orlando tonight.

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,760
Podcast The Ride presents The City Walk Orlando Saga,

94
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,580
multiverse of madness,

95
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,000
a daily, extremely necessary series,

96
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,260
exploring the shops, restaurants,

97
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,900
and cosmic wonder that make up universal City Walk Orlando.

98
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,640
Welcome to Podcast The Ride,

99
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,800
The City Walk Orlando Saga, multiverse of madness.

100
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,020
Today there is a mood of healing, a reunion,

101
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,920
and I feel refreshed.

102
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,660
I feel lively in a way that I haven't before

103
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,640
because I'm so happy to be back here with you, my friends.

104
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,620
I was guided back.

105
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,820
I'm Scott Gardner.

106
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,580
Mike Carlson, it's so good to see you.

107
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,700
I'm so good to see you.

108
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,860
I'm sorry about everything.

109
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,600
No, everything's fine, and I understand.

110
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,600
Sometimes it takes a special friend to make everything okay.

111
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,620
Yeah, that's right.

112
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,840
And I just can't wait.

113
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,180
I'm so excited that today we'll be reverberating

114
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,160
with love like that.

115
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,740
Jason Sheridan, hi, buddy.

116
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,060
Welcome back, brother.

117
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,480
Yeah, yeah, it feels good.

118
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,100
It's a new chapter.

119
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,220
We're also joined by one of our favorites

120
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,420
from her podcast, very amusing, it's Carly Wisell.

121
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:33,880
Hey.

122
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,880
Hello, I'm thrilled to be back.

123
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,200
Yay, thank you for returning,

124
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,440
a survivor of the Downtown Disney ordeal.

125
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,840
I keep finding myself in these themed

126
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,460
mall entertainment districts somehow.

127
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,600
It's either it's slow moving boats

128
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,800
or it's oddly mundane retail establishments,

129
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,280
but let's make sure that we know where we're going today.

130
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,020
Let's get our assignment from the Sector Keeper.

131
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,200
Oh, great one.

132
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,780
Boys, boys, and Carly, phase six,

133
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,120
sector two is the cowfish sushi burger bar.

134
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,920
Eat up, boys and Carly.

135
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,560
Okay, there we have it.

136
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,440
So the focus today is about the brilliant,

137
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,780
the misunderstood, my friend, the cowfish.

138
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,420
And Carly, I understand that you have,

139
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,640
you've encountered this cowfish before, have you not?

140
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,760
I have, I've survived and lived to tell the tale.

141
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,260
This is so exciting, and I, you know,

142
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,780
when we were poking around putting this together,

143
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,520
and I just asked you, is there anything

144
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,940
that you are mildly interested in in CityWalk Orlando?

145
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,580
You had this locked and loaded, ready to go,

146
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,000
shouting the cowfish's name.

147
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,880
Yes, in terms of personal dining, I'm going to Antohito's,

148
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,220
but if we're gabbing on a podcast, we're doing cowfish.

149
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,700
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

150
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,620
Antohito's, yeah, possibly the most,

151
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,620
more like legit establishment in some way.

152
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,980
But yes, cowfish, how could you not engage with the cowfish?

153
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,840
How could you not?

154
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,140
How does this place exist?

155
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,480
How is it still open?

156
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,900
It will be open forever.

157
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,740
I think so.

158
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,120
Cowfish will live longer than I do.

159
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,560
I hope so, and has lived long, and we can, I think,

160
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,800
look to cowfish for the cowfish's wisdom,

161
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,340
and hopefully all of that can get imparted to us

162
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,240
here when we need it in the deep end of this long journey.

163
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,900
Yeah, it really is the best of humanity, isn't it?

164
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,660
Yeah, a universal original, I believe.

165
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,600
Well, is it, because there are other establishments.

166
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,740
I think they might have, yeah, this is,

167
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,560
it's the weirdest arc of a restaurant.

168
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,680
Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina, and then this.

169
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,080
Yeah, is one of those the casino?

170
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,460
Is one of those the casino, there's a casino cowfish?

171
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,700
Oh, I don't know, you tell me.

172
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,540
I'm confused.

173
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,940
I'm still learning the cowfish's ways.

174
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,760
I'm confused because there's some restaurant

175
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,040
in a casino called Cowfish as well.

176
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,360
So the mystery here is like.

177
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,700
Okay, figure that out, but let me know if you've,

178
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,300
and then also, but it clearly is a brand

179
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,880
that is working for Universal that they're excited about

180
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,400
because it made it to City Walk, Beijing.

181
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,020
It's one of those that they reinvested in.

182
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,660
This is in South Africa.

183
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,380
What?

184
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,980
Cowfish Silver Star Casino,

185
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,780
the name of the casino is Cowfish, but.

186
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,920
Then that's not affiliated.

187
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,680
But no, no, this is Cowfish Sushi Burgers.

188
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,080
Yeah, but the logo's not the same, is it?

189
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,060
It's not the same.

190
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:28,620
No.

191
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,080
But what is this?

192
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,220
Well, and who's stealing Cowfish's good name

193
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:33,660
and trying to profit?

194
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,420
And it's the same thing, it's the sushi and burgers.

195
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,660
I mean, unless this one was first,

196
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,740
which very well could have been, but.

197
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,400
But do they have burger as sushi?

198
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,600
Well, that's the question.

199
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,920
That is the question.

200
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,620
I'm actually extra confused.

201
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,580
This truly is the innovation,

202
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,580
the spirit that drives Cowfish.

203
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,760
Because yeah, a restaurant can offer both of these things,

204
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,900
but both of these things together never been done before.

205
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,840
And that's what we're dealing with.

206
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,100
If you've never been there, if you've never been by there,

207
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,880
if you've never been to Raleigh, North Carolina, apparently.

208
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,700
Or South Africa.

209
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,160
Or South Africa, if you've never been to South Africa,

210
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,680
this is a combo burger and sushi restaurant,

211
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:12,260
but that also combines these items into a magical blend,

212
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,700
an unprecedented blend called burgushi.

213
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,440
Never before seen and never to be seen elsewhere.

214
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,020
Very possibly, never again.

215
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,040
Okay, when we corresponded about this,

216
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,920
was this based on an experience that you had

217
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,480
that you were enthusiastic about,

218
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,100
or you just baffled by Cowfish?

219
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,040
I think we suspend reality

220
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,280
by being theme park people very often,

221
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,020
but we're simply not talking enough about the fact

222
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,060
that this exists and thrives in Orlando.

223
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:45,980
Absolutely.

224
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,600
Thrives.

225
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,100
That's what this whole thing is about.

226
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,520
I think people have said that City Walk Orlando

227
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,900
feels like a place that you rush through

228
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,560
on the way to incredible theme parks, but not us.

229
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,220
We slowed down, we took the time,

230
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,560
and that's what we're doing now,

231
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,140
is meta to every day stepping through

232
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,180
and making sure we all reflect on the fact

233
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,600
that there is a burger sushi restaurant out there,

234
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,140
which thousands of people could go to if they wanted to.

235
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,600
And I think many do.

236
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,240
Yeah, it seems like it.

237
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,380
Yeah, seems popular.

238
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,080
The time of year we were there,

239
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,260
we tried to do it kind of like middle of the week

240
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,200
after Halloween, kind of an off season,

241
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,840
and we encountered some empty rooms,

242
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,980
some lonely rooms at various establishments.

243
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,160
Cowfish, not one of them.

244
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,400
Cowfish definitely hopping and happening.

245
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,540
but very friendly wait staff.

246
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,660
Oh, that's true, because there's all the

247
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,780
on-seastic.

248
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:40,780
Very enthusiastic.

249
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,160
Yeah, yeah.

250
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,700
That they're excited to do.

251
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,460
There was an energy in there.

252
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,120
Yeah, yeah.

253
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,560
Yes.

254
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,580
Of excitement.

255
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
You get that question at many a restaurant,

256
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,940
is it your first time here?

257
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,340
And usually, it's like, I'm gonna,

258
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,380
it is, but I'll be fine.

259
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,480
I'm not like learning, you're not shaping my view

260
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,560
of how the earth works, are you?

261
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,340
In this case, they are.

262
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,320
When the person asked, is it your first time here,

263
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,960
they're like, yes,

264
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,160
and you've got a lot of explaining to do.

265
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,360
I mean, I don't wanna talk out of turn,

266
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,180
but it does feel like the cowfish has something

267
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,600
that Toothsome wants and will never have.

268
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:18,740
Interesting.

269
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,120
That's an interesting, that's a little gauntlet thrown.

270
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,260
Because Toothsome, we're going full decor,

271
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,820
we're doing terrifying walk around characters.

272
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,660
But here at Cowfish, they don't need that,

273
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,700
they don't need that.

274
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,600
You know what you're getting into,

275
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,900
it's gonna be wild and everyone is literally seated

276
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,540
waiting for it.

277
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,840
And the food is the abomination at Cowfish.

278
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,160
Yeah, it's not.

279
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,600
Not the character around you.

280
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,660
Not the decor.

281
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,560
The food is going to shock you.

282
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,720
So there's no Jacques the robot equivalent at Cowfish.

283
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,040
Not as far as I saw.

284
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,040
Well, there's Cowfish himself, my friend,

285
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,700
who is outside the restaurant.

286
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,920
Greets you, yes.

287
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,620
Which, you know, we've noticed a lot of these places

288
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,240
have some big thing out front.

289
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,040
Some photo op, yeah.

290
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,500
To kind of hurry in.

291
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,540
And the Cowfish, one of the great ones,

292
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,200
I sat on Cowfish, I took a magical ride

293
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,040
that I'll never forget.

294
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,320
Right.

295
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,660
It illuminated, changed me forever.

296
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,000
I didn't know that Cowfish was a real animal

297
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,620
that looks a lot like the one in the logo.

298
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,540
It is this odd squat, little, like this yellow squat

299
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,420
with two little horns animal.

300
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,720
Yeah, I didn't know that either.

301
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,860
So there are Cowfish in our world,

302
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,440
not in our part of the multiverse.

303
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,100
That's how another restaurant could get away with using it

304
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,680
because if a Cowfish is an animal,

305
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,780
there's plenty, well, it's just named after the animal.

306
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,480
No, we're going more off of it.

307
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,100
Because it doesn't look like this Cowfish

308
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,960
stole any of the proprietary dishes.

309
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,540
Okay, okay.

310
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,700
Doesn't look like it.

311
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,420
That's really what it's about.

312
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,840
And it was one of the biggest questions that I had

313
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,780
on the way to our City Walk Orlando expedition.

314
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,320
I knew of this place, obviously,

315
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,680
and okay, so it's burger sushi combos,

316
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,260
but what does that mean?

317
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,840
Exactly.

318
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,280
Is it bun,

319
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,340
and then there's a sushi roll in the middle?

320
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,160
And I couldn't begin to picture what rolls are

321
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,120
that are burger oriented.

322
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,200
Rarely is an entire restaurant concept predicated on,

323
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,920
I don't know what this is,

324
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,780
and I don't know if it's gonna be good.

325
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,820
Yes, yeah, yeah.

326
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,880
And that is the Cowfish.

327
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,880
The expense is high before your food even comes out.

328
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,480
What other restaurants are you nervously anticipating?

329
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,460
What do you mean, burger sushi?

330
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,460
What do you mean?

331
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,120
That sounds bad.

332
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,240
Could it be bad?

333
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,660
I don't, that's the feeling.

334
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,580
Oh, I don't know.

335
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,520
Well, that's what I found about Cowfish,

336
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,940
is that Cowfish's reputation wasn't good,

337
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,540
but maybe the Cowfish is misunderstood.

338
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,100
Right, right.

339
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,000
Maybe that's why the Cowfish is an outcast,

340
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,680
and really, and that's what I've found,

341
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,620
that Cowfish's spirit is what matters.

342
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,140
That's very important, yeah.

343
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,300
Isn't that right, Cowfish?

344
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,100
Thank you for, okay, okay.

345
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,420
Standing close by.

346
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,720
Don't wanna bother Cowfish,

347
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,160
but you can chime in if you want.

348
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,580
I think that all the decor kinda plays on your expectations

349
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,980
or confusion or lack thereof,

350
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,540
because when you get up to, past the host stand,

351
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,800
you get up to the second floor of this massive establishment.

352
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,580
Massive complex.

353
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,760
It's a complex.

354
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,500
Yeah, absolutely a complex.

355
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,220
If you go to the bathroom on the third floor.

356
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,380
Kind of a trademark of city walk restaurants.

357
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,040
That's true, NBC Sports Bar and Grill,

358
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,420
the restrooms are on the second floor.

359
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,780
You gotta walk up some stairs to get to those restrooms.

360
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,140
And some are on top of each other.

361
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,260
It's like the Fantasyland dark ride, so you know.

362
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:35,540
Right.

363
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,160
Yeah, Alice, you're up above Mr.

364
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,040
Toad or whatever.

365
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,760
It's this beautiful interconnected complex.

366
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,460
It's beautiful, yeah.

367
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,960
It's a beautiful way to say it, it's beautiful.

368
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,380
It's almost like the combination of burgers and sushi

369
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,720
to make burgueshe?

370
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,260
Burgueshe.

371
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,360
Burgueshe.

372
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,780
Okay, so if that phrase is in your head

373
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,860
and you know I might be having burgueshe today

374
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,420
and you're wondering what does that look like,

375
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,840
then you end up at, there's this fountain

376
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,860
when you get past the host stand on the second level,

377
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,380
and that shows you what you might, there you go, yes.

378
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,520
That is a burger bun, okay, so it's a fish bowl tank,

379
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,600
and then there's a burger bun and lettuce,

380
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,360
and maybe, I don't know, is it mushrooms or seaweed?

381
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,460
What's up on the top?

382
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,160
I don't know.

383
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,400
It's unclear.

384
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,040
It's something dark.

385
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,640
Some brownness.

386
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,960
A brownish, blackish substance,

387
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,740
and then between not a burger patty, but a full sushi roll,

388
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,860
and so you think is this what I'm having today?

389
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,600
Am I gonna bite into it?

390
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,040
Is that the size of it?

391
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,480
It looks like it's 30 pounds.

392
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,540
Is it a novelty thing?

393
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,100
Is it like a heart attack grill

394
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,560
where it's like I'm gonna have to eat the biggest

395
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,380
piece of food I've ever eaten before?

396
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,120
That was what occurred to me is like,

397
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,240
taking a bite of that, it does feel like

398
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,520
your heart would be immediately upset.

399
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,360
There'd be some quiver.

400
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:00,720
Right.

401
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,980
It's like it's bracing itself for a heart attack.

402
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,040
Is it gonna be served to me in a fish tank?

403
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,540
That's a question you might have.

404
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,540
Is that part of it?

405
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,540
Is that part of it?

406
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,580
That might be part of it.

407
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,160
And then there's fish, it is a real fish tank.

408
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,240
There are fish in there.

409
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,100
There are also fish in it.

410
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,960
So yeah, this I think is designed to sort of

411
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,360
light your imagination on fire and say,

412
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,860
can you believe the world,

413
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,960
look at the world we've created here.

414
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,360
And it's got more-

415
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,280
What man is capable of?

416
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,340
Right, and really what it does though

417
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,700
is it asks more questions than it answers.

418
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,940
And I don't think they're good questions necessarily

419
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,040
because this doesn't look like an appetizing thing.

420
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,340
Frankly, it doesn't really look,

421
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,400
it looks kind of like a stuffed animal

422
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,440
or like a stuffed thing you would buy.

423
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,400
Yeah, I don't know.

424
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,220
Yeah.

425
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,720
A stuffy, a squishy mallow.

426
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,880
Yeah, edible squishy mallow.

427
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,060
Okay, okay.

428
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,160
It also just, yeah, it looks, it doesn't look real.

429
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,800
Obviously they have to build something

430
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,220
that's an approximation of food

431
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,940
so it would sustain in liquid.

432
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,780
So yeah, all of that, it feels like some sort of like

433
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,400
gross 90s commercial where kids are going to a restaurant

434
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,000
that their parents want to go to

435
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,600
and they've built some like monstrosity

436
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,960
like to look like food your parents would like

437
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,900
that you hate and you want a cheeseburger

438
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,880
or you want pizza.

439
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,480
Today the burger-ooshies.

440
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,540
Yeah, and it's the lady with the beehive hairdo.

441
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,480
I eat your burger-ooshie or whatever.

442
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,400
And like that's what it looks like to me here.

443
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,580
Yeah, yeah.

444
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,540
This is, Carly, context here,

445
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,020
there's been other guests who we have like specifically sent

446
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,720
and made to go do things at City Walk Orlando

447
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,400
who all regretted our decision for them.

448
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,220
In this case, you had just because you're down there,

449
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,080
you go down there.

450
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,060
So you were willing, we did not force you to go to this place.

451
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,760
Not at all, I went on my own volition in the past, yes.

452
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,360
Solo or the?

453
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,980
Oh, always solo, yep.

454
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,180
Yeah, yeah.

455
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,180
Just me.

456
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,780
Better to test solo in case you ever bring other,

457
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,020
you don't want, I don't know, you like meet your mom down there.

458
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,500
You don't want to like, now your mom is having a tough time

459
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:11,920
with burgers.

460
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,780
Yeah, I didn't want to invite, you know, be there maybe on a vacation,

461
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,020
more of a vacation type of trip because it's always a little bit of work.

462
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,620
But I didn't want to bring anyone with and have them discover

463
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:30,120
if they liked burger-ooshie or cheese-berg-ooshie in person.

464
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:30,980
I went solo.

465
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,620
Basically it was like an intrepid reporter trip, you know,

466
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,080
just trying to find the truth in the sushi.

467
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:43,960
Now, as we keep saying this, what I am picturing would be like

468
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,360
tasting plat, like omakase, I believe is the tasting, right?

469
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,700
It's like a bunch of little plates.

470
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,060
The original name for Quibi, yes.

471
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,500
Yeah, the original name for Quibi.

472
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,260
And like someone would be making you a sashimi or like a Kobe beef,

473
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,080
like real beef, and like, it's little plates.

474
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,300
Well, this someone you're describing is already overshooting.

475
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,680
Yeah, I don't think that's what this is.

476
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,000
Curated, because omakase is like the finest I learned from the Quibi,

477
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,320
and it's like the curated, selected.

478
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,660
Very high quality.

479
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,500
And it's, I think the one Epcot restaurant does it.

480
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
It's like 10 or 12 courses.

481
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,180
Takumi-ten.

482
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:20,800
Yeah.

483
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,660
No burger-ooshie there.

484
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,700
No burger-ooshie.

485
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,160
Okay.

486
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,220
Is that like a fine…

487
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,800
They will serve meat and they will serve sushi,

488
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,400
but not in the manner that this place does.

489
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:34,940
Right.

490
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,880
Not in the sacrilege way Calprish does.

491
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,060
I kind of remember when this opened in the mid 2010s,

492
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,780
when a bunch of new stuff was coming to CityWalk Orlando,

493
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,540
and they're like, well, you know, bento boxes.

494
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,380
Well, imagine if bento boxes had burger and sushi.

495
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,180
Is that right?

496
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,280
That you're not wrong, but that's not the whole picture.

497
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:58,940
Okay.

498
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,180
So that is an option.

499
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,380
That is an option.

500
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:01,920
It is, yeah.

501
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,200
And that is what I got.

502
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,200
I got a bento box, but that is not something you have to get.

503
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,240
I tried some other things.

504
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,980
You got the bento box?

505
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,320
You went all the way to Calprish and got a bento box?

506
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,060
For the main, but we tried burger-ooshie.

507
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,760
Yeah, we split a burger-ooshie.

508
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,340
Okay.

509
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,000
Let me paint a little more of the picture of where you're…

510
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,460
Because the food is one thing, but the location.

511
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,660
You've got a couple odd things going on.

512
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,860
Weird art that mashes up a cow and a fish, this iconography.

513
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:39,680
Here's a big yelling trout or something, and there's a big saddle on his back.

514
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:48,280
Or here is, perhaps most inexplicably, Japanese-style art of Elvis eating…

515
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,300
Well, does he have…

516
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,880
No, wait, there's a pill.

517
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,380
Wait, that's very grim.

518
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,460
Elvis having pills?

519
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah, on his little table, there's a bunch of pills.

520
00:19:59,460 --> 00:19:59,940
Is he dying?

521
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,520
That's weird.

522
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,580
Well, Elvis famously was taking a lot of pills.

523
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,580
Yeah, that's true.

524
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,760
But he doesn't look good in this photo.

525
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:14,860
This is a very let-yourself-go Elvis eating a ton of burgers, but then Japanese text.

526
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,460
I wonder what it says.

527
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,140
Yes, somebody translate this if you can.

528
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:19,900
It's…

529
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,960
But you look at Elvis in this and you're like,

530
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,520
well, I don't know if I want to…

531
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,920
Is this food gonna make me look like that?

532
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,640
With all the pills?

533
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,060
The robe is open and there's pockets.

534
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,380
I mean, this looks like a private moment between him and his meal that we shouldn't be seeing.

535
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,780
Seems like the artist is signaling you to maybe give it another think

536
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,740
and decide if you really want to die here.

537
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,600
Elvis needed to be really peeled up to be able to eat cowfish.

538
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,680
That is something that's maybe saying.

539
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,120
Now, in the context of our trip, I set this one out.

540
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,940
This is after a couple of days of busy park stuff.

541
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,200
And the day, the Thursday of the week, where a lot of us were defeated.

542
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,100
The hell day, yeah.

543
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,040
Yeah, the hell day.

544
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,840
And so you guys opted for this for lunch, right?

545
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,420
Is that right?

546
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,300
That is correct, yes.

547
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:09,680
Okay.

548
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,200
We did.

549
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:10,980
We sure did.

550
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,360
We signed up.

551
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,480
We said, cowfish, I see you.

552
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,700
I will see you at a table.

553
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,480
Right.

554
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:26,400
And then also, this I'm curious to get your thoughts on, Carly, the gender binary

555
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:38,340
that is presented in the restroom signs in which men are bulls standing up and peeing into a tap toilet.

556
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,340
Not a urinal.

557
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:39,720
Not a urinal.

558
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,180
No, no, no.

559
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,000
Just like a big proud stream coming out of this bowl.

560
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,600
And then women are fish holding purses.

561
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,140
I hate what I'm looking at right now.

562
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,020
Yeah, I really don't care for this.

563
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,360
Not in a quality way, in a that shouldn't exist.

564
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,580
Someone should have said, maybe no.

565
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,720
It's very off-putting, yes.

566
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,120
I'm just confused a little bit by it.

567
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,440
I don't like seeing a cow pee into a toilet.

568
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,460
I don't like that.

569
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,060
I just don't know why you use that as a-

570
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:11,140
That's an abomination separate from the gender split, that all women are fishes.

571
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,980
Right, and they hold their purse.

572
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,820
I will say-

573
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,260
And they got a little baby lipstick.

574
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,080
They don't show a stream on the ladies side, at least.

575
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,300
That's good, I guess.

576
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,740
Well, shouldn't the fish be in the toilet?

577
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,280
Because that's her home.

578
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,120
That's true.

579
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,960
So basically we're watching her gasp for air and try to survive.

580
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,260
Oh, that's a very good-

581
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,260
She'll be dead after this silhouette is done.

582
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,600
Does the fish swim up through the toilet, pop out of the toilet,

583
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,880
go to the bathroom, and then flush itself?

584
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,620
Maybe.

585
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,620
Maybe, yeah.

586
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,920
Maybe it's a double flush.

587
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,100
This is somehow insulting to all parts of the gender spectrum.

588
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,300
Yes, to all humans and some animals.

589
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,200
It's really something.

590
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,500
You're taking this all in aesthetically.

591
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,720
As you're waiting for food, after some stuff has been explained to you,

592
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
nervous anticipation.

593
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,140
Carly, I guess I'm curious what you had.

594
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,540
We should go off of your-

595
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,380
How many times have you been here?

596
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,100
I've been once.

597
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,080
Oh, you've only been once?

598
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,360
I do think, because I usually go to Universal Solo,

599
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,220
if I had been traveling with children, a whole family visit,

600
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,760
I would be here way more often.

601
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,160
Because I don't usually do a sit-down dinner on my trips,

602
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,800
I'm just running in circles, I've only been once.

603
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,000
I don't want to say once was enough,

604
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,300
once was enough to know what burger-ooshie is.

605
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,940
And you did get burger-ooshie.

606
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,460
If you take any account, I'm not fucking around.

607
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,660
I'm getting the burger-ooshie.

608
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,320
Well, do you have any-

609
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,640
And I can narrow it down.

610
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,920
I can toss out some items, but I don't know if you remember

611
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,380
the gist of what you had.

612
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,180
I will say I don't remember everything I ordered,

613
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,160
but I would never forget the burger-ooshie.

614
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,220
I see, I see.

615
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,000
Okay, okay.

616
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,400
Appetizers, drinks, any of that?

617
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,300
Do you recall any of that?

618
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,840
I don't, because do they have anything that's as silly as the main attraction?

619
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,060
There's a couple.

620
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,340
Cowfish cooler, the moo fish punch.

621
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,800
Oh, I don't mess with that.

622
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,760
Japanese whiskey smash.

623
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,060
Yeah.

624
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,680
I'm seeing buffaloes and bacon.

625
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,660
That's what I see, buffalo.

626
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,420
Yeah, yeah.

627
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,840
That's like an old-fashioned, which I'm with all the bourbon.

628
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,720
Cherry liqueur, angostura and orange bitters, great.

629
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,500
Honey, okay.

630
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,580
Candy bacon, okay.

631
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,100
I like some of that.

632
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,660
I got a mocktail that day, because that was show day, right?

633
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,640
Yeah, so I was like, I can't get sleepy.

634
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,780
You ate this before you did a live show?

635
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,100
Two hours later.

636
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,140
We actually, this worked out.

637
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,360
This ended up working out well for us.

638
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,020
I did not have a cowfish cooler.

639
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:51,920
I had a time after time, which was thyme, lemon, muddled blueberries and Gosling's ginger beer.

640
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,420
That's what I had.

641
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,220
Oh yeah, Gosling's, fine ginger beer.

642
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,480
Jason, have you ever had Gosling's ginger, ginger beer guy?

643
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:58,620
Oh yeah.

644
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,620
You have had it.

645
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,360
I have.

646
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,720
I think I've tried a lot of ginger.

647
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,480
I like barrettes a lot.

648
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,940
You're a barrette's man.

649
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,180
I'm a barrette's man.

650
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,440
I think you can find it at some liher stores and stuff.

651
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,560
That's what, when my family went on a cruise to Bermuda, when I was like 11 or 12,

652
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,820
I feel like it was almost more common than Coca-Cola.

653
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,400
Ginger beer barrettes was.

654
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,720
I had a lot of restaurants down there.

655
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,260
Barrettes, ginger beer, yeah.

656
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,780
Oh, that's a really, that's-

657
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,020
Another topsy-turvy world where barrettes defeats Coca-Cola.

658
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,660
You're on vacation.

659
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,640
This is the inventive world the cowfish imagines.

660
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,480
This is what it looked like.

661
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,060
It looks like a piece of a bush fell into it.

662
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,700
It's kind of cute.

663
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,280
I don't hate it.

664
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,640
It was all right, yeah.

665
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,320
It's got some smashed blueberries in there, which I like a blueberry.

666
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,280
It wasn't anything special, I would say.

667
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,520
Didn't make you sick.

668
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,140
No, I didn't get sick the whole trip.

669
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,680
I'll tell you where the bar is in this series.

670
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,320
I'm seeing something called Bloody Mary Had a Little Cow,

671
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,420
which is three vodka, bloody Mary mixed,

672
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,920
garnished with a mini burger, beef jerky straw,

673
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,700
pickles of your pickled.

674
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,780
Oh, she got that.

675
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,460
Okra, green olives.

676
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,100
This is wrong.

677
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,100
So you could go insane with these drinks if you wanted to,

678
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,560
but you could also just go straight to the main deal.

679
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,300
Karly, I don't think you need to remember what your specific thing was,

680
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,680
but do you remember any ingredients?

681
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,680
I think we've got to tackle what is then when burguer comes out,

682
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,640
what are the primary components of burguer?

683
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,820
Well, I realized I have photos.

684
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,580
Ok, here we go.

685
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,680
I have photos in Google photos of when I went.

686
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,760
So I see a photo of, I guess I did order multiple things

687
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,360
because I was doing research for a story,

688
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,080
but I have what appears to be the cheeseburger-rushi,

689
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,340
and then also some sort of burger and fries.

690
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,180
Oh, ok.

691
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,420
Yeah, because you can do that.

692
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,980
Now, you can do both sides of the spectrum.

693
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,760
You could do just sushi, you could do just burgers.

694
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,220
Yes.

695
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,700
You could not cross the streams.

696
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,120
You could not play a Dr.

697
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,580
Moreau at the table

698
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,040
and just do a regular version of things.

699
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,180
I do like that they have kind of like a chicken exit,

700
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,340
if you get their emergency exit.

701
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,520
No chicken, but in terms of if you're too scared to combine them,

702
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,900
you can have them side by side.

703
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,960
The DB Cooper, you can bail.

704
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:16,800
Yes.

705
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,280
Safe word.

706
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,640
The safe word is burger.

707
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,720
Yes, but no, I mean, the one I'll never forget is what I believe is

708
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,660
the all-American bacon double cheeseburger-rushi.

709
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,480
I'm fairly certain this is what we got as well.

710
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,020
Yes.

711
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,080
Ok, black Angus beef, yellow cheddar cheese,

712
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,660
white cheddar cheese, and applewood smoked bacon wrapped in soy paper

713
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,780
and potato strings, then flash-fried, topped with dill pickle,

714
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,280
red onion, and roma tomato, served over our house-made cow fish sauce,

715
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,780
topped with ketchup and mustard.

716
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,960
We got a lot of ingredients.

717
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,200
Yes, we do.

718
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,800
But still, you order that and you still can't picture

719
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,220
what that's going to be.

720
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,620
Basically, I think the main thing to say is

721
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:06,740
the seaweed is replaced by a thin layer of potato French fry paper.

722
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,800
Yes, it's like wrapped in a thin French fry, basically.

723
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,800
The sushi is.

724
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:12,980
Ok.

725
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,940
And then there's rice, then the next layer is rice.

726
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,760
You still have it.

727
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,740
It was rice even in the list, we just said?

728
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,420
I don't remember.

729
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,760
There's major ingredients.

730
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,160
I think that's rice, unless that wasn't rice.

731
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,940
So still rice is there, but then the middle is a little puff of burger.

732
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,400
There's a little puff of burger.

733
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,100
But it's not just burger, it's burger and cheese and a little bacon.

734
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:37,540
Yes.

735
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,180
You see this wet area, Jason?

736
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,480
You see this wet area?

737
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,380
That's cheese right there, it's melted cheese.

738
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,240
This is a little piece of bacon, I think, hanging out here as well.

739
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,340
You see that dry part there?

740
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,460
That's bacon.

741
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:02,940
And can you just refresh my memory, because there's a lot of shades of black and brown going on.

742
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,180
Yeah, go ask me anything you want.

743
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,500
Is there seaweed?

744
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,740
No.

745
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,420
No.

746
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,580
Seaweed is the French fry.

747
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,380
The seaweed is the French fry paper.

748
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,260
This is what I thought was most fascinating.

749
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,480
A French fry casing on the piece of burguyshi.

750
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,240
And is the cow fish sauce just kind of like a thousand island kind of?

751
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,100
I will be honest with you, there are a lot of flavors happening at once,

752
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,100
and I don't really recall the flavor of the cow fish sauce.

753
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:33,400
I think probably in Thousand Island is probably the zone that it is.

754
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,680
Yeah, it's definitely some sort of mayonnaise with something in it to be special.

755
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:36,700
Right.

756
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,760
Maybe like a sriracha mayo.

757
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,900
Peach colored mayo, like a darker peach.

758
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,760
I hate to do this, could I give you a little quiz real quick?

759
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,360
I just want to make sure you learned what I taught you.

760
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,220
This is truly, I was having trouble keeping track of it.

761
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,940
That's what I thought.

762
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,500
That is French fry paper.

763
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,120
Go through it.

764
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,340
That's French fry paper.

765
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,680
And then sushi rice?

766
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,980
Sushi rice is, yes, next.

767
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,780
Okay, now I'm going to point to this.

768
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,280
Because it's not in the ingredient list.

769
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,820
Right, Jason, what is this wet looking part here?

770
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,600
Well, is that the bacon or the hamburger?

771
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,860
Oh, Jason, you weren't, I'm so sorry, that's the cheese.

772
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,560
That wet part is the cheese.

773
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,420
I'm so sorry to put you on the spot.

774
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,100
Heaven forbid it needs to be slightly moist.

775
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,960
And then this, you see this part here kind of sticking out that looks drier.

776
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,920
That's the bacon.

777
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,820
Now you've got it.

778
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,520
Now you understand.

779
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,740
That thin layer is bacon, not fry paper.

780
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,620
And then that dark part in the middle is?

781
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,380
That's got to be the hamburger.

782
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,560
That's burger.

783
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:49,580
That's right.

784
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,520
I'm going to give you a 10% on that test.

785
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,140
That was great.

786
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,580
Good job.

787
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,500
Good for me.

788
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,500
I'll take it.

789
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,980
So this is burgueshi.

790
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,060
Three sauces.

791
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:05,540
I think burgers usually for me it's ketchup mustard, ketchup mayo, or a thousand.

792
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,140
I feel like that's what I like the-

793
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,160
Yeah, I'm down to one if I can.

794
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,280
Usually two sauces.

795
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:10,780
Maybe one.

796
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,020
I'm trying to minimize that.

797
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,820
So three, we got a lot of.

798
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,460
And then like there's nothing can really prepare you visually or taste-wise for

799
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,420
pickle, diced pickles on what looks like sushi.

800
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,240
I was wondering if there was a pickle element.

801
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,290
So like they kind of just sprinkle the pickles as if it's a little like

802
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,820
rain shower on the top.

803
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,640
They're just scattering the pickles, like just a dusting of them.

804
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,400
Just a little bit.

805
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,940
Like a little fairy has kissed the top of the burgueshi with pickles.

806
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,640
Does this reflect what you had, Carly?

807
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,060
Is this what you're looking at when you see your photos?

808
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,560
This is making me so nauseous.

809
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,780
It's making me a little nauseous.

810
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:57,720
I do have to say, you know, I was kind of wiped out and trying to rest up for the show.

811
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,440
And this was a fatigue choice.

812
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,900
But as you were eating this, I was eating room service.

813
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,240
And that was not an indulgence.

814
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,440
That was a really tired-

815
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,060
A necessity.

816
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,180
I need like bacon and eggs or whatever.

817
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,640
Was that what you had, bacon and eggs?

818
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:19,360
I think we put like French toast and coffee and we might have had some eggs.

819
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,680
Yeah, but was like the bacon hidden inside the toast?

820
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:30,620
Was it an egg that like cracked open and said hello and then spit out a little morsel of French toast?

821
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,260
It seems like this, your meal does not sound inventive in the least.

822
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,240
The French toast had some toasted coconut.

823
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,540
Sapphire falls, tropical.

824
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,540
It sounds nice, but it's not, you know-

825
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:40,800
Guava juice.

826
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,000
It's guava juice.

827
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,960
It's not airing.

828
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,800
We want boldness here is what we want.

829
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,180
We want invention.

830
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,580
And that's what this place provides.

831
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:57,120
I guess now that we've described it, and I really don't know where you're coming at this from,

832
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,060
how did you feel about the burghushi?

833
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,540
So I didn't hate it.

834
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,320
I didn't hate it.

835
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,740
I thought I would absolutely just be horrified by it and I wasn't.

836
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:13,200
But kind of the overarching theme of it is that the rice shouldn't be there,

837
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,680
but then you just have a burger.

838
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,780
So every bite it's like why is there rice here?

839
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,180
Why is there rice here?

840
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,380
Burger and rice is strange.

841
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,660
Because rice doesn't fit with those things.

842
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,940
I love the shape.

843
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,620
I'm into the shape of it.

844
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,160
I think if they removed the rice, then you'd really be cooking.

845
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,680
Yeah, I think so.

846
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,400
That's the boldness.

847
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:41,120
A burger you eat in the manner of sushi fun, but the rice just didn't do it for me.

848
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:41,600
Right.

849
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:48,380
And it's not like loco moco, the wine dish that's like a hamburger patty gravy and rice.

850
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,680
No, because this has, I mean you got the little, the kisses of the pickles,

851
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,460
you got the tomatoes, you got bacon, you got two cheeses.

852
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,300
There's a lot.

853
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,440
Yeah, it's all American.

854
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,480
Because basically when you taste it, it's a burger with rice.

855
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,500
A cheese burger, a bacon cheeseburger with rice.

856
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:08,360
But then also what really pulls focus is that fry paper because that's the most, like.

857
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:08,780
Yeah.

858
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,560
That was really, you just, you have that and you're like huh,

859
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,180
I'm gonna wrap my head around this.

860
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,780
I neither, I'm not in love or hate or anything.

861
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,660
I'm just baffled.

862
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,280
I don't know why.

863
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,420
I agree.

864
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,840
I still am not exactly sure.

865
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:25,000
I don't think I've had food where I, I don't know if I'd give it like a grade.

866
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,880
I'm just like question mark.

867
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,700
It's just a fog for me.

868
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:28,840
Yes.

869
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,560
I don't know.

870
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,000
Yes, and that's what this whole restaurant is built around.

871
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,320
Isn't it fascinating?

872
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,160
The great mysteries of California.

873
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,120
When I first read about this place years ago,

874
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,700
I was picturing a couple sliders in a California roll.

875
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,420
Well, now that's more in line with what I had as the main.

876
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,500
That's kind of what my actual.

877
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,660
So I didn't imagine that.

878
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,300
You can't get that.

879
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,400
You can do, you know, this.

880
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,460
Yeah, okay.

881
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,380
If you want.

882
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:59,560
Yeah, you can get a bento box where there's a little, the tiniest,

883
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,720
what they call a mini hamburger and instead you,

884
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,880
I'm not sure it's big enough to be designated a slider even.

885
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,040
And then there's a roll of regular sushi and that is fine.

886
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,220
Then it's got all this stuff, wasabi and ginger and that is fine.

887
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,220
Then there is, boy, a ton of edamame.

888
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,880
Yeah, there's a lot of edamame.

889
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,840
Mainly edamame.

890
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,060
And then so much cucumber salad, which is.

891
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,080
They really.

892
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,520
That's being generous.

893
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,500
A pile of cucumbers, you might say.

894
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,620
They really pad out the meal with edamame and cucumber salad.

895
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,580
Yeah, all that kind of like the,

896
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,920
it's like wrapping paper.

897
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,340
It's like, or it's like, you know, it's like the kind of the hay paper

898
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,060
that fills out like a gift box.

899
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,420
That's like, yeah, but you can eat it.

900
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,280
That's when I had to fill like an eight page paper in high school

901
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,460
and I just had to do it.

902
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,360
I'd be a lot of filler because I was not prepared.

903
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,660
All these, these items in this bento box are the Sos and Veris.

904
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,260
They're fours.

905
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,960
They're fours of the food world.

906
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,980
Yeah, because really what you're looking at here is,

907
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:04,100
let's say 17 fries and four or five pieces of sushi.

908
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,620
I wouldn't even consider that little cheeseburger a cheat.

909
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,400
Like that is so nothing.

910
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:09,960
Yeah.

911
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,280
And it is so.

912
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,500
That's like you're at a cocktail hour

913
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,140
and they're passing out tiny one bite cheeseburgers.

914
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,660
Yeah.

915
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,340
It's smaller than a White Castle slider.

916
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,120
It is.

917
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,940
That cheeseburger sucks.

918
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,940
That cheeseburger is one of the worst,

919
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,280
one of the worst things I ate at City Walk.

920
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,800
That little cheeseburger.

921
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:33,900
Yeah.

922
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:39,680
Burnt to a crisp, cold, sure flavorless.

923
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,760
So worse than the frozen White Castle sliders.

924
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,220
Yes, I love frozen White Castle.

925
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,680
I love White Castle.

926
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,720
Surprisingly good.

927
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,720
White Castle is delicious.

928
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,700
So you understand that I'm not Mr.

929
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,060
Snooty

930
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,080
when it comes to any of this.

931
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:53,540
Yeah.

932
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,540
But I don't know.

933
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:58,040
Maybe this is one of the mysteries of the cowfish.

934
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,840
I'm only newly friends with him.

935
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,880
I'm still figuring it out.

936
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,900
Maybe there's a reason why his tiny burger

937
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,260
is one of the worst things you can eat at City Walk.

938
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,060
Well, it's giving him the benefit of the doubt.

939
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:10,760
He's good.

940
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,520
No, I'm sorry.

941
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,840
I don't mean to insult the cowfish who's here,

942
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,700
but this isn't his signature dish.

943
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,320
So perhaps he's trying to kind of be like,

944
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,900
lead you to the signature dish.

945
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,460
You're saying he's more fish than cow, maybe.

946
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,200
Well, I'm no, I'm not saying.

947
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,820
Well, but the burguis, you just want a cow.

948
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,440
You need both.

949
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,060
You need elementary both.

950
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:28,980
I'm saying he wants both.

951
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,640
He's not going to take time to make this anything special

952
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,000
when the prime example of his artistry is the burguis.

953
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,240
Focuses on the blending.

954
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,140
So puts it all into the burguis to make sure

955
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,380
that the burguis is impeccable, unimpeachable.

956
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,220
Did you two like the burguis?

957
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,960
I don't know if I got a read on it.

958
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,600
I don't think I do either.

959
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,700
I don't know if I got a read from any of you.

960
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,200
Here's what I'll say.

961
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,220
I'll warm up to what I might, maybe final conclusion

962
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,580
that is still filled with, I have a conclusion

963
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,480
that is still confusion, if I can rhyme.

964
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,340
The conclusion of confusion.

965
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,560
Like Johnny Cochran or something here.

966
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,820
A lot of different temperatures happening at once

967
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,460
in the burguis in my memory.

968
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,260
Yes, all living in harmony.

969
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,280
All living in harmony.

970
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,160
Boys, one of the layers is a little warm.

971
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,500
The next layer is cold.

972
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,440
The next layer is medium temperature.

973
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,040
Taking a bite of it all at once is a four dimensional

974
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,140
experience of dinner, lunch.

975
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,720
Yeah, so I would say that's a negative.

976
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,560
All right off the bat.

977
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,900
Okay, I see.

978
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,920
It seems not as about refreshing

979
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,520
like when you do a cold plunge and then you get in a warm

980
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,120
or you go right out of the hot tub, right into the cold pool.

981
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,980
Right, so that was, I would say that's a strike

982
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,080
against it right off the bat.

983
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,320
The more I think about it, the more I think like the

984
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,780
saltiness of like sushi, seaweed would pair.

985
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,680
Well with hamburger, but that was abandoned.

986
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,260
That's gone.

987
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,200
But the rice was kept.

988
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,920
It's the saltiness of fries.

989
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,020
I've had great meals that I can't taste in my mouth,

990
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,000
but I remember I have very firm sense memory

991
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,280
of the potato paper entering my mouth.

992
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,480
And again, I'm not sure if I liked it or not.

993
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,480
My stomach is like making so much noise right now

994
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,020
and it can't be unrelated.

995
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,180
It has to be related.

996
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:35,740
Blub, blub, blub.

997
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,520
It's really going wild right now.

998
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,720
Well, it's about to go especially wild because at this point,

999
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,740
an important reveal needs to be made

1000
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:49,600
because you just discussed the temperature issue

1001
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,360
and we're all discussing do we like this establishment or not.

1002
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,680
And I think now is the time to reveal a podcast runner,

1003
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,880
a series runner.

1004
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,220
Cowfish just may be the restaurant that gave

1005
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,980
our friend Eva Anderson food poisoning.

1006
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,700
If you wonder for us,

1007
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,520
well, not poisoning.

1008
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,340
My bad experience was Margaritaville.

1009
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,000
Hers was cowfish.

1010
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:22,380
And at this point, I feel like I should let her explain here now,

1011
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,040
Eva Anderson.

1012
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,480
Okay, Eva, we are now in the cowfish sector.

1013
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,140
It has been revealed that cowfish was the place that gave you trouble.

1014
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,600
What can you reveal about what you ate and what happened there?

1015
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,840
I went there at an off hour.

1016
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,740
I sat at the sushi bar in the back where no one was sitting,

1017
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,740
which was my first problem.

1018
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,140
My first mistake.

1019
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,160
I ordered something called the Flamin' Salmon Roll.

1020
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,020
Flamin' Salmon Roll, no G.

1021
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,940
Spicy salmon with togarashi, mayo, and spice.

1022
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,780
Minced pickled ginger, scallions, jalapenos, strings, flash fried,

1023
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,960
served over tempura flakes and topped with cayenne pepper strands.

1024
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,900
It came out lukewarm, which is never good for sushi

1025
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,960
and were kind of warm.

1026
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,580
And that I ate it anyway.

1027
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,100
There my troubles began.

1028
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,280
Here's a photo of what I ate.

1029
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,620
There we go.

1030
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,940
It seemed like a nice place.

1031
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,860
I wish I hadn't done Orlando Humid Weather Sushi.

1032
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,820
What was I thinking?

1033
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,300
Regardless of the cow element, the fish was not good either.

1034
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:28,880
Yes.

1035
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,240
So that's what I ate.

1036
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:36,160
And I want to thank the various Marriottes I stayed at for having

1037
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,320
lots of little pill sections in their gift shops, because that's what got me through.

1038
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,980
Dear God, I'm so sorry.

1039
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,580
All right.

1040
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,700
That is Eva's experience.

1041
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,120
Well, I want to say, first of all, does she know for sure that's the place she got sick?

1042
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,080
Yeah, not necessarily.

1043
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,300
You know why?

1044
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,760
Traveling and something, your system is all off.

1045
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,760
It's all, yeah.

1046
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,620
Oh, yeah, I'll travel and especially across time zones.

1047
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,800
And then you're just like weird.

1048
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,080
Yes, not regular anymore.

1049
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,560
Yeah, yeah, your bowel movements are all, I don't know.

1050
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,380
So yeah, we can't go.

1051
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,200
You know what?

1052
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,980
I mean, this is like how I feel like, you know, a lot of people have cast judgment on cowfish

1053
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,920
and wrote cowfish off as an outcast.

1054
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,940
And, you know, maybe even if cowfish did do this to Eva, what if cowfish was scared?

1055
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,740
What if cowfish was trying to protect itself?

1056
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,560
Family.

1057
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,900
And then the only way, and in that moment, the only way that it could be done

1058
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,280
was to give Eva food poisoning.

1059
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,620
We don't know.

1060
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,100
And maybe we'll never know.

1061
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,380
I won't lie.

1062
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,220
That story makes me want to eat there more.

1063
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,600
Did you just go on?

1064
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,800
Let me explain.

1065
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:51,800
Because a lot of these restaurants, like you get the gimmick, you know what you're getting

1066
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,620
at Margaritaville.

1067
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,360
Here, you don't know what the outcome is.

1068
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,220
And if you're coming from a theme park perspective straight into this restaurant,

1069
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,260
I find that thrilling.

1070
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,060
The fact that I have amnesia about my meal is already pretty entertaining,

1071
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:09,220
but it may or may not affect the way my next two days go.

1072
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,700
It's exciting.

1073
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,600
Who else can do that?

1074
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,740
This is really, you know what?

1075
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,860
I think we've all, we're all disappointed by Galaxy's Edge and how like the idea of

1076
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:21,580
like your reputation while you're in Bitu and then it will follow you into the, into Ogas

1077
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,340
and whatever.

1078
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,320
And that guy, oh, he didn't do good in the Falcon run or whatever.

1079
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,520
Like, you know, ultimately those are all kind of siloed experiences, really.

1080
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,700
But something like this, there's like, there's fate at play.

1081
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:39,840
Your entire real world vacation, your trip to Crime Con could be completely ruined

1082
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:47,140
because you chose wrong on the dial of destiny, if you will, at CalFish.

1083
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1084
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,660
Like Gandalf is like, choose wisely.

1085
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:55,620
Like when you start a vacation like this, because your fate could be worse than death.

1086
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,340
This is like Jackass or Fear Factor where, you know, he eats it.

1087
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,360
That's kind of what this is.

1088
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:06,880
This is like a, like a loud version of, I don't know, I'm going to eat, you know.

1089
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,340
Bugs.

1090
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,860
And I don't know what's going to happen to my body.

1091
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:16,940
This is like a sanctioned professional version of eating a bunch of weird anuses.

1092
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:17,380
Right.

1093
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,600
I agree.

1094
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,480
I'll eat the, if it was next door, I would eat it right now.

1095
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,640
I would do it again.

1096
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,460
Yeah, I've taken a, I've turned the corner.

1097
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,860
I went from being horrified at breaking down and zooming in an image of burgerushi on your phone.

1098
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,400
I don't want to be that close to it unless it's going into my mouth to eat.

1099
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,420
But I would go back and I would get it again.

1100
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,900
I wish it was up at our city walk.

1101
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:44,580
It might take like 10 trips before we figure out any official judge.

1102
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:49,180
It is, I mean, it's blowing my mind that we live in a TikTok age where people are making everything on their phones.

1103
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:49,580
Yeah.

1104
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:52,540
But this still just holds supreme in our minds.

1105
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,420
It's a food that I'm not eating at home.

1106
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,740
I don't see anywhere else except for at Cowfish.

1107
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:57,480
Yeah.

1108
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,320
It's so special they haven't replicated it anywhere else because it's daring.

1109
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,840
Maybe I do love it.

1110
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,220
Only Orlando, only the, like the theme park primed audience in Orlando.

1111
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,800
That's maybe the, like maybe the mistake that Eva made or anybody who's had trouble there has made

1112
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,120
is going there on a trip.

1113
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:18,900
I think that the local stomachs have been and the rest of their bodies have been primed,

1114
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:19,660
steeled.

1115
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,940
They're ready to embrace the Cowfish.

1116
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,760
But then again, your friend, the Cowfish has not made people sick from the burgerushi.

1117
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,280
So maybe all of this is just-

1118
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:28,940
Oh, right, you're right.

1119
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:29,820
This wasn't burgu-

1120
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:34,580
You come back and you tell your tale and you just, you go there and you get the signature dish.

1121
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,020
You don't mess around with the other stuff because who knows what horrors will befall you.

1122
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,860
Maybe this is the Cowfish's message.

1123
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,940
Have burgu-shi and don't stray from burgu-shi.

1124
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:49,860
He puts, this is how he, the way that the Lord creates tragedies that we can learn from and

1125
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,540
that create good after the fact.

1126
00:45:52,820 --> 00:46:00,880
Cowfish puts bad burgers and stomach melting sushi on the menu in order to teach you not to have them.

1127
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:07,340
Oh, it's like Indiana Jones trying to pick Christ's cup from the night at the end of Last Crusade.

1128
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,000
Right, you have to choose correctly.

1129
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,600
Yeah.

1130
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,160
Oh, it's Carpenter's cup.

1131
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:11,460
Right.

1132
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,000
Yeah.

1133
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,880
He makes that little hamburger patty look like a baby turd.

1134
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:27,520
But we learn from this turd, we study it, we teach future generations to avoid the turd burger.

1135
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,620
That's what this saga is about in a way.

1136
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:34,640
Eva's our good friend, we sympathize with what happened to Eva.

1137
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:44,320
I think that the Cowfish had something to impart to you that day.

1138
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,700
And just please don't judge the Cowfish, don't persecute the Cowfish.

1139
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,400
No one persecutes the Cowfish.

1140
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,360
The Cowfish is good and pure and led me back here to the show where I belong.

1141
00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:00,240
Well, keep that in mind, yeah, because if you have a negative experience at Cowfish,

1142
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:05,080
I want you to reevaluate what it was and now think about it in the way you're explaining.

1143
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:11,720
Remember what you had and has Burgushi ever done anyone wrong?

1144
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,000
Yeah, and I imagine the people that would say like negative and Cowfish,

1145
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:17,480
they have to be so few.

1146
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,780
There could be barely any, I'm sure.

1147
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,760
But the one, two, three, four, reevaluate it.

1148
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:24,780
That's what I'm saying.

1149
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,460
I mean, all that said-

1150
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:26,880
The small amount.

1151
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,040
I would love it if we wrapped it up because I do.

1152
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,280
I am feeling a little queasy just hearing about it.

1153
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,040
Are you gonna throw up on air?

1154
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,560
Oh, we've never had a puke on air.

1155
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,580
It's all part of the Cowfish's plans.

1156
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,180
He knows what great content this will make.

1157
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,940
He's furious we talked about the bento box.

1158
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:45,980
Jason, imagine a piece of sushi with the middle.

1159
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:50,380
The burger, it's this cold and it feels like that maybe was cooked two hours prior.

1160
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,420
Zoom into it again.

1161
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,380
And let me just zoom in.

1162
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:52,840
Teach him.

1163
00:47:55,820 --> 00:48:00,440
Like this was cooked two hours ago and the rice was maybe made somewhat fresh.

1164
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,860
Close your eyes, Jason.

1165
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,080
Stare it down.

1166
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:03,720
Face it.

1167
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,520
See what the Cowfish has to say.

1168
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,760
Hear of its tragedy and its victories.

1169
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,380
Yeah, yeah.

1170
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,400
Think about all of it.

1171
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:12,860
All right, well-

1172
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,760
I look like I'm punishing Jason in more of a thorough way than I expected to.

1173
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,040
I know your faces are so genuine.

1174
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,260
I am worried.

1175
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,680
I don't know.

1176
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,840
I don't think I've revealed this yet on this show, but I had a bout of food poisoning recently

1177
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:33,280
and it wasn't from this restaurant, but it didn't fully kick in until I had eaten

1178
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,060
at a claimed LA French restaurant Petite Troie.

1179
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,080
Oh no.

1180
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,420
So I-

1181
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,560
You don't think it happened there.

1182
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,700
You think it kicked in there.

1183
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,140
I think it kicked in, yes.

1184
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:46,480
Right.

1185
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,820
I think it was something at Goin' Bad that I had at my house.

1186
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:54,820
But yes, so the famous Big Mac, which they say is-

1187
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:55,860
Yes, they're known for a fun cheeseburger.

1188
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,500
Which they are known for a fun cheeseburger.

1189
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,700
I ate a couple times, but not in the way you would like.

1190
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:03,620
Well.

1191
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,360
That was the creepiest way to describe it.

1192
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:10,780
Yeah, that's what I'm going through right now, brother.

1193
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,260
You have it now?

1194
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:13,260
No, no, no.

1195
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,020
You're always feeling a flashing back.

1196
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:15,460
I'm flashing back.

1197
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,420
Do you need to get off mic?

1198
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,060
We can finish the episode without you.

1199
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:21,480
No, no, I'm saying I don't have the highest opinion of beef right now.

1200
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,280
I see, I see, I see.

1201
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,300
All right, we'll take a sip of water and we'll get to get out of here.

1202
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:24,960
I'll do that.

1203
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,680
Well, that's the problem.

1204
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:26,860
You know, don't drag cowfish.

1205
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,400
Cowfish is only part beef.

1206
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,380
Cowfish is a whole cornucopia of things.

1207
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,640
And that's where those bathroom signs suck too.

1208
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,420
The binary, beef boys, fish girls.

1209
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,220
That's not what the cowfish is.

1210
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,120
The cowfish is one and all at once.

1211
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:48,960
And cowfish, I love you and I thank you for providing us this very special experience.

1212
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,780
And for helping Carly Weisel get here.

1213
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,080
Carly, you survived Podcast the Ride, the Sun Rock Orlando Saga.

1214
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:57,700
Multiverse of madness.

1215
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,820
You did, I'm not sure everyone will.

1216
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,140
Multiverse of madness.

1217
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,980
Let's exit through the plug portal.

1218
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,600
Is there anything that you would like to plug?

1219
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,140
I'm nauseous again.

1220
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:19,780
There's my podcast, Very Amusing, where I talk about theme parks and travel and

1221
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,060
very nuanced Disney things.

1222
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:23,900
Check it out, it's weekly.

1223
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,660
It's me, Gavin, on the internet.

1224
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:29,340
And then you can follow me on Instagram, Carly Weisel, good luck spelling it.

1225
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:31,940
Great, great.

1226
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,600
And please keep, on all of those mediums, keep us posted if you go

1227
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,700
and visit the cowfish again and see the cowfish.

1228
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,580
I will say, I am planning a trip back to Universal Orlando.

1229
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:46,040
I do have to do some food stories and I will be returning to the cowfish.

1230
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:46,980
Wow, yes.

1231
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:47,880
When is that?

1232
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,140
Will that have happened by now?

1233
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,560
No, no, no, no.

1234
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,260
I have a little time.

1235
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,720
It's a while, you've got a while to go.

1236
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,280
You've got a while to prepare.

1237
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:00,220
My advice would be to buy a home in Orlando, get used to being there for two months,

1238
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,140
and then I think that's really the way that you can properly prep.

1239
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:08,000
Really acclimate to the weather, the water there, really dig my heels in.

1240
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,620
All those little things, you need to fully, but you need to become an

1241
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:14,500
Orlandian before you can truly see the cowfish.

1242
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,620
You're right, you're right.

1243
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:20,640
All right, well, as for us, thanks to Erin Gertner for the art, our own Mike Carlson

Wait, the stone, the sector stone is appearing.

1250
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:41,920
Oh, yeah.

1251
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,980
What is it, Jason?

1252
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:48,280
It's a roll of burghushi sitting on the toilet.

1253
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,880
Could you touch it?

1254
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,120
Is it the same temperature?

1255
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,340
I why it's like my hand is going through all temperatures.

1256
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:57,960
Oh, wow.

1257
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,520
It's cold.

1258
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,040
It's hot.

1259
00:51:59,140 --> 00:51:59,560
It's cold.

1260
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:00,120
It's hot.

1261
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:00,740
Look at your hand.

1262
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,680
Your hand is turning.

1263
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,780
Parts of it are blue and parts of it are orange and parts of it are beet red.

1264
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:06,180
Wow.

1265
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,480
It's like the rainbow of fishes scales.

1266
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:12,140
It is like the rainbow.

1267
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:12,900
I know what you mean.

1268
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,380
You have that magical glistening.

1269
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,020
The magical.

1270
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,820
The lamps are like in cowfish.

1271
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,780
And the cowfish itself.

1272
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:19,460
Right.

1273
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:19,920
Wow.

1274
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,760
I hope your hand always stays that way.

1275
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,760
May your hand keep that color forever.

1276
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:30,820
Cowfish, thanks for being here.
