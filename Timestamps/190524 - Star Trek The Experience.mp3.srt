1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,080
Starting 1998, we picked up a distress signal from our listeners who demand a two hour exploration

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,880
of sloping foam parties, mercurial timeshare owners, the holy rings of Betazet, and alcoholic

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,280
beverages approved by Luwak-Sana-Troy.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,160
Set course for a frontier called the Las Vegas Hill.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,680
It's the Star Trek Experience on Podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:52,720
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three men who boldly go on

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,160
and on and on to anyone who will listen about one pre-show videos and robots.

10
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,160
My name is Mike Carlson, I fumbled the joke too.

11
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,320
You warned us.

12
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,040
I warned you that the joke was lame, I wrote it about five minutes ago.

13
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,440
I also had my cursor in the middle of it as I was reading it and then I fumbled over whatever

14
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
word.

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,920
Well that, look, if something appeared in, if you were reading a teleprompter and then

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,040
a bug flew into it, could you really be expected to take responsibility?

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,040
No, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,200
I have sympathy for you and I enjoyed it.

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Thank you.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
I'm Scott Gardner.

21
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,680
Jason Sheridan's also here.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
Hi, yes.

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,280
I was trying to think on the drive over of a boldly go joke and just didn't have it and

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,560
I was like, no, that'll be two.

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,600
And then you gave up and you started thinking about some else.

26
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Yeah.

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Well, I figured you would have it because I think it's easy to, fair to say that you

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,240
are probably the biggest Star Trek fan out of the three of us.

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,680
I think I could easily say that.

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,320
I think you could fill in almost anything and that would be the case.

31
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,680
I'm a bigger fan of everything.

32
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,920
Except for in the case of this episode, politics of who owned what Vegas hotel at what time.

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,560
Yeah, you are the king of that.

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,920
Yeah, so it's a perfect episode.

35
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,920
There's a lot for all of us to talk about.

36
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,720
Yes, there is.

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,800
And I guess for then what would Jason's be?

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,600
I guess, you know, fried tribbles.

39
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:25,880
Yeah, fried tribbles from like, yeah, the very stiff promotional footage.

40
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,480
Well, my thing, which it's the Vegas episode.

41
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
Oh, yeah.

42
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
You kind of.

43
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,480
It is the first thing we're addressing.

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,120
Yeah, we haven't really talked Vegas too much.

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,240
Oh, and just to say in general, we're talking about Star Trek, the experience, which ran

46
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,920
from what, 97, 98 to 2007?

47
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,480
98 to 2008, I believe.

48
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,680
In that range, late 90s to late 2000s.

49
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,120
And this was an immersive Star Trek experience that was open at the Las Vegas Hilton.

50
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,000
What then was the Las Vegas Hilton?

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,520
It included a ride, it included 40 experiences, restaurants, the only like really big immersive

52
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:10,400
like miniature Star Wars, I'm sorry, Star Trek theme park that has existed thus far.

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,200
Yeah, the rumors are flying around about that other stuff.

54
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:21,520
And to clarify, it is not Star Trek, the adventure or the Star Trek adventure.

55
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
Who knows?

56
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:29,200
There was another thing at Universal Studios where they inserted guests into a Star Trek

57
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,640
movie or show.

58
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,880
But we will be talking about that on the Patreon.

59
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,720
It is a Star Trek block.

60
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,800
But today, right now, what you're listening to is about Las Vegas.

61
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah, we're doing this, of course, to celebrate the Star Wars land opening soon, because honestly,

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,920
as you're looking through this, this really is similar to some things that we've read

63
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
about Star Wars land.

64
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,240
Well, as you, as we've heard for a long time, that we will be going to a very immersive

65
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:02,440
multi-part experience, a part of which recreates a very famous ship and all of the interiors

66
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,920
and hallways and corridors and rides where there's like the ride part of the ride, but

67
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,000
buildups and weird elevators that take you there.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Turbolifts.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And a place where there are actors who are very steeped in the mythology and various

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
languages.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
A lot of actors.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Tons of actors.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,200
Who are really committed and really love it.

74
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,680
And a space-themed bar that offers colorful drinks that are in like tubes and steam up

75
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,600
and shit.

76
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,240
We've been hearing about this coming to Disneyland for a long time, and something very similar

77
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,360
to it existed in the magical land of Las Vegas, but a decade ago.

78
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:50,120
And both bars, presumably in terms of the cantina at Star Wars, very much products of

79
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,560
their times in that, like we live in a time of craft cocktail, exhausting craft cocktail

80
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,160
nonsense, and Quarks was more of a time of like really dense looking pizza and buffalo

81
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
chicken fingers.

82
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
Yes.

83
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,400
That was the height of themed entertainment.

84
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:15,400
Melon liqueur and alize and something called razzmatazz in the drink warp core breach.

85
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,360
I'm really excited to talk to Quarks bar.

86
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,360
But one thing at a time, as you say, we haven't really talked Vegas much at all, which is

87
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,360
very exciting.

88
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,520
I hope everyone thinks that Vegas is in bounds for us to talk about on this podcast because

89
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:36,320
if it's less theme parks and more themed experiences, Lord knows the 90s were an explosion of themed

90
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,080
experiences in Las Vegas.

91
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,960
And that's what ultimately led to this, this Star Trek thing.

92
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,640
But we haven't talked about all of the bullshit that used to be at the Excalibur and the Luxor

93
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
and all that.

94
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
There's too much.

95
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,560
And when this episode comes out, I will be in Las Vegas.

96
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,560
Hey, yeah.

97
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,560
So, okay.

98
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,080
And tell me to do something weird.

99
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
I mean, that's true.

100
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,400
Tell me if there's an experience or something.

101
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,900
Don't like, I'm not going to like eat shit out of a toilet or something.

102
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,880
And you're not going to do that thing where you like ride a tractor, like move like mechanical

103
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
arms around.

104
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,520
There's some attraction that's like, you know, drive construction equipment around a field.

105
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,400
I might do that if it was close to the hotel, maybe.

106
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
It depends.

107
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,760
I'd have to look into it.

108
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,120
I need to see Yelp review.

109
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,640
Something that'll come up later in this episode.

110
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:25,560
You do have the opportunity to see something in Las Vegas called Bongzilla, but I'll elaborate

111
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,920
later as to what Bongzilla is all about.

112
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,680
I know that we've like, I think people have even tweeted us or I've seen discussion on

113
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,840
What's like theme park stuff in Vegas?

114
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,040
And there's not as much as there used to be.

115
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
Yeah.

116
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,360
Like you were just looking for what the hell do you do when you're there?

117
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,600
I've recommended strongly the movie that plays in the M&M store, which I hope you check out.

118
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Is that free?

119
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Yeah, oh, you know it.

120
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Good.

121
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,840
I recommended something that is sadly actually gone.

122
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,160
The circus circus where you could get a drink served in a toilet mug.

123
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
Vince Neil.

124
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,200
Vince Neils Tattoo-Auto.

125
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,480
We were trying to figure out which scum rock, scum rock guy.

126
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,720
You would guess David Lee Roth.

127
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,000
I was thinking it was David Lee Roth.

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,960
I didn't think as a restaurateur, although it's waiting for him whenever he wants to

129
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
do it.

130
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Vince Neils has a thing?

131
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
But it's gone.

132
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
I think it's gone.

133
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,960
Well, the restaurant might still be there.

134
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,960
I gotta get to Vince Neils restaurant.

135
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Tattoo-Auto in circus.

136
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,880
Because there's that stretch with Margaritaville, Cabo Wabo Cantina and Toby Keith's I Love

137
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
This Bar and Grill.

138
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
Oh, that's right.

139
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,080
And then there's that also where that Guy Fury restaurant that where we ate.

140
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,480
Oh, well, that was by the link that was sold by.

141
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Oh, yeah, you're right.

142
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
That was farther down there.

143
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,280
Yeah, where we very sadly ate like chicken lollipops.

144
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,040
We competed in Guy's Cheesecake Challenge.

145
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
We did get the cheese.

146
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Who won?

147
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,120
Jason wins when cheesecake is involved.

148
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,560
I don't think anyone ate it.

149
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,160
That didn't even seem like it had defrosted all the way.

150
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,160
We ate it though.

151
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
We ate it.

152
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
There was no Victor that day.

153
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
It was a sad.

154
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,800
We were like on the way out of a weekend in Vegas and nothing was particularly good that

155
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
we ordered.

156
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,560
Like nachos topped with a lot of Coquita cheese, which doesn't really melt.

157
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,480
Like it's such an odd choice.

158
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,680
You usually like sprinkle a little on top, but this was just so much.

159
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,680
I'm sure the meal was set at reasonable prices.

160
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,480
I don't recall, but probably not.

161
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
Probably not.

162
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
But I don't think it was that.

163
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,080
I would assume it was overpriced.

164
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,600
It was at the end of real quick.

165
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
I'll tell the story.

166
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Yeah.

167
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,800
So this is my Mike's Mike like Star Trek.

168
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Scott likes Vegas.

169
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,960
You know, who owns stuff in Vegas?

170
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,000
And I guess I like experiencing one crazy night sort of stories.

171
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,360
Yes, that's true.

172
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,720
But this story I'm going to tell is not a crazy night at all.

173
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,800
Well, it was crazy night for me.

174
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
It is a mild, very mild night.

175
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
Could not be lower.

176
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
So all right.

177
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Keep crazy night in your head as you listen to this.

178
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Yes.

179
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,120
So to Jason, what I'm about to describe is a crazy night.

180
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
So we were there for a bachelor party.

181
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,120
We went to I forget the name of it, but it's like a German beer hall.

182
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
I know what it was called.

183
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
Hoffbrau House.

184
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
Hoffbrau House.

185
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,120
OK. And there's a woman in like Liederhosen who comes around and will paddle you for a

186
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
dollar.

187
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,120
If you want to do a shot out of a.

188
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
If you want to do a shot.

189
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Which is like, you know, I'm not that doesn't a lot of people signing up for it.

190
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Like a lot of people getting paddled during the meal.

191
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Not you, Mike.

192
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,440
Not believe it or not, me, not me.

193
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,240
And so we were it was a big it was a big group of us for this bachelor party.

194
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,440
And prior to this, there was a weed cookie that was eaten by some people, Jason

195
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
included.

196
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,480
I concluded I had a little bit of it.

197
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,320
I think you had a lot more than me.

198
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,040
I thought I took a little piece and I was wrong.

199
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,760
Yeah, no, because I remember being like, oh, it's a little and I don't even think

200
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,280
anything that was felt.

201
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,720
I didn't feel anything really.

202
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,720
That's what I would do. I would take the tiniest little sliver.

203
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,800
But when you got a cookie in front of him, no matter what the ingredients are, if it

204
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,600
was PCP tunnel vision.

205
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,320
So we're eating. So we're at the beer hall.

206
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,000
We're having a fine time.

207
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,880
And then a friend of ours came over and there was a man.

208
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,880
This part is a little bit hazy.

209
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,800
So tell me if you you remember this better than I do.

210
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,480
There was like a band playing or lip syncing or lip syncing.

211
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,320
We were never sure.

212
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,160
They were in the back of the beer hall.

213
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
Yeah. So they were at the back of the beer hall.

214
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,760
One of them was had some sort of animatronic cat looked like the sorting hat from

215
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,080
Harry Potter because the hat was moving to.

216
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,160
I don't remember the moving hat.

217
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,240
I don't know if that's true.

218
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,120
I think it was just that was moving a little.

219
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,640
I think it was a big hat.

220
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,800
The hat was it was a big line.

221
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,520
The hat is this is interesting because now I have never we've never talked about

222
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,640
the moving hat.

223
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:06,200
I but we regardless we there is a full band and we don't know if they were playing

224
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,080
or lip syncing like it's a bit playing to a track or something.

225
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,320
But we couldn't tell because we were in the we were in the front of the restaurant

226
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,120
and that was in the way back.

227
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,560
Because this was a restaurant that had a real vibe.

228
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,120
Had a real atmosphere, real draw to be because you had to do like toasts and you had to

229
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,600
bang your beer steins.

230
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,520
It's a lot of process.

231
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
It started fun.

232
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,880
Yeah. So my recollection is that then you started laughing a little bit too much at

233
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,480
everything. Started laughing a little bit.

234
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,040
A friend of ours came over and he made this is where my memory is fuzzy.

235
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,640
He made the comment that the hat on this man looked like Pharrell's big hat.

236
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,680
Pharrell at the time had been wearing that large like he had just worn the big hat

237
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,040
was mountie like Dudley Do-Right kind of style hat.

238
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
And you lost it.

239
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,240
Like I've never seen you laugh so much.

240
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,160
And you kept like kind of like Pharrell's big hat and you were laughing like I've

241
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,960
never seen you.

242
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,520
See, in my mind, I was the one who could who said Pharrell's big hat first.

243
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,120
Very possible.

244
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,520
And that's why I could barely get it out.

245
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,800
It's very possible.

246
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:17,880
Because it was also just a little past the topical deadline for that joke.

247
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,840
That brief window.

248
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,640
That brief window.

249
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,960
Because it's not it just became not topical.

250
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,280
Right.

251
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,680
Right. So you were laughing and everybody everybody started catching wind that you

252
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,200
were laughing and everybody kind of came over and like were joking around with you

253
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,480
and you were having a great time.

254
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,640
And you had this giant sandwich.

255
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,040
You had like a foot long sandwich.

256
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,560
Foot long sausage because everything was platters.

257
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,960
It was like, oh, you got you picked your meats and then you got like two or three

258
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,600
sides.

259
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,760
And I was in that hunger.

260
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,080
I was like, oh, I'll just get the one sandwich on the thing.

261
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,120
How big can it be?

262
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,560
Because it was also cheaper than the other platters.

263
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,840
And then it was bigger than everyone's regular.

264
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,000
It sounds like it was bigger than Pharrell's big hat.

265
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,800
It was.

266
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,920
It was appropriate.

267
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,880
And there were like big burly men at this table with us like eating.

268
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,480
You were the biggest plate of food by far of anyone, I think.

269
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,080
Or just at least the look of it.

270
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,120
And you held this thing up.

271
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,440
It looked like Homer's sandwich in the episode where he keeps finding it and he gets

272
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,720
sick because he's eating it.

273
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,800
And the second but the second smallest beer, not the smallest beer, because they were

274
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,200
mean to anyone who ordered a pint.

275
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,840
They were mean to me.

276
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,200
I had the smallest beer.

277
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,760
I accidentally ordered a smaller beer.

278
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,640
Which was a regular sized beer.

279
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,280
I ordered a regular pint and I got roasted.

280
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,240
They razzed you.

281
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,320
I got roasted for that.

282
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,280
I forget.

283
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,960
It was probably something like sex.

284
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,320
They called me a woman or something.

285
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,840
Like they probably said something like that.

286
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,480
I think it was.

287
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,120
Not the woman.

288
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,920
But this is, you know, it's a historical place, you know, so they have to.

289
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,520
We've been doing this since 2004.

290
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,960
You have to insult you in the way they would have 10 years ago.

291
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,800
So this is about when the dam breaks for me.

292
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,880
So you're because everyone is saying that is the biggest sausage I've ever.

293
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,840
Like everyone is talking about how big the sausage is.

294
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,600
And then I'm like everyone's talking how big the sausage is.

295
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,520
Like it's repeating.

296
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,880
Like I feel like I'm in like the merit.

297
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,920
Like is it safe?

298
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,280
Is it safe?

299
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,040
Like I that's what to me.

300
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,680
Some people probably said it like three times.

301
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,360
But to me, it's just echoing.

302
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,400
That everyone is talking about how big the sausage is.

303
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,320
And then I'm still like, is the band playing or not?

304
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,440
Like I feel like I'm in a Thomas Pynchon novel where everything's a conspiracy.

305
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,720
Everything's a trick.

306
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,520
Like and because so.

307
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,400
So from my vantage point, I think we like joked about the sandwich a little bit.

308
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,680
And then we started eating and talking about something else.

309
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:02,680
And then all of a sudden I see you and you go from, you know, zero to 60 laughing.

310
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,840
60 to zero.

311
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,680
I see you.

312
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,400
This is.

313
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,120
Fade.

314
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,160
Again, Vegas.

315
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,000
We're on the edge of the desert by Barstow when the drugs kicked in.

316
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,120
Like this is.

317
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,360
But this, but at this point the drugs kicked off in a way.

318
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,760
Or I guess, you know, I guess, you know, they kicked in.

319
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,160
Yeah, you're right.

320
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,400
Yeah.

321
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,360
The paranoia is what's setting.

322
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,640
They're starting to show up.

323
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,520
The laughing has stopped and the bats are starting to show up.

324
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,880
So I look at you and now I'm legit like concerned.

325
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,280
You are drooped over a little bit like you're not sitting up straight

326
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,680
and you're holding the sandwich still.

327
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:44,520
And it's like you're trying to eat this giant sandwich, but you're falling asleep or something.

328
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
And then I'm like, hey, are you OK?

329
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,400
And you were just like, yeah, like you were a little hazy and you're trying to eat it.

330
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,720
And then like you're just like you were in slow motion for a few minutes.

331
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,520
And I'm like, oh, and this happened so fast.

332
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
I've never seen a transformation like this.

333
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,680
Running through my mind is I have to get the fuck out of here.

334
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,040
So this actually sort of happened.

335
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,920
I'm trying to think of the timetable, how long you were actually like that.

336
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,600
Because then at a certain point, it was clear that some of the group was already done in leaving.

337
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,040
Maybe everybody didn't have dinner.

338
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,440
And I think I didn't even have very much.

339
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,680
So I was like, we are we're leaving soon.

340
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,040
And you were like, I have to go.

341
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,880
And I said, well, we're all see everyone's like packing up

342
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,560
and we're going to leave in a couple of minutes.

343
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,800
Just wait for us because you don't you go.

344
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,040
I have to go now because what I can't keep.

345
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,720
I keep my eye keeps going to is the woman with the test tube shots

346
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,160
and the paddle is inching closer to us.

347
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,400
And I am like, she's coming for me.

348
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:55,880
Like, again, I think I am in a Kafka ask a nightmare where it's like someone's going to

349
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,640
buy that and make me do that.

350
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,280
And I am just like, I got to get out of here.

351
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,920
Yeah, sure.

352
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,400
So what that paddle could have been in your in your mind,

353
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,240
that would have seemed like 700 feet tall and like it like knocked you back to California.

354
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:18,120
I just thought it was like it would hurt a lot because I could tell like my sentence

355
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,800
senses are heightened.

356
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,240
Like this is like Daredevil, but a pain in the ass.

357
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,640
So you threw twenty dollars on the table and walked out.

358
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:29,960
Yes.

359
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:37,640
And then I'll tell my side of then what the rest of the night was,

360
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,400
and then you will tell what you did.

361
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:46,440
OK, so why don't I tell my journey and you tell tell what reality actually is.

362
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,800
It's just good to the end of the story.

363
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,520
He got Jason got married to the big sausage.

364
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,280
I got married to the still technically married to this day.

365
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,080
And the woman with the paddle broken and paddled the boat.

366
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:05,560
I went out to the hostess station and did the thing where when you're a little out of it,

367
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,640
you try to be extra with adult with it.

368
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,360
And it went, excuse me, where can I get a taxi around here?

369
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,400
And she said, just go across the street to the Hard Rock Hotel.

370
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,680
They have a taxi stand.

371
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,800
And I went, thank you.

372
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:28,840
And I went outside and across the street was like six or eight lanes of a major thoroughfare,

373
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,600
thankfully with crosswalks.

374
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,360
So I was like, OK, here we go.

375
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:40,520
Got across the street to the Hard Rock, went up to the cab stand and when I had like a cab,

376
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:49,240
and then I gave him I probably gave him to like because they just whistle or they just go

377
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,280
over there, sir.

378
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,640
Like they had a line of caps.

379
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,080
I didn't need to talk to anyone.

380
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:00,600
But I handed that man a $10 bill and then I got in the cab and the cab took me back to the Venetian.

381
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:10,600
And I went back to the room and got in bed, got under the cover.

382
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,840
This is called the person I was dating at the time to go like, hey,

383
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,680
I just just wanted to say hi.

384
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,640
Like calm you down.

385
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,200
Like, yeah, just talking down specifically.

386
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,800
And I remember her going, where where are you?

387
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,560
And I went, I'm under the Cubs.

388
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,800
Like you said Cubs, not covers.

389
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,440
Yeah, Scott jumped out of his chair when you said Cubs.

390
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,160
Cubs.

391
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,920
I was under the Cubs.

392
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,240
This is also under the Cubs.

393
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,960
So this is like 9 p.m.

394
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,280
So this is reality.

395
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:52,440
So I get under the Cubs and I turn on the TV and I go to sleep for what I think is hours.

396
00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:00,360
And wake up and my friends are standing at the foot of the bed.

397
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,200
And I was just like, hey guys, what's up?

398
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,560
What's going on?

399
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,760
Everyone good?

400
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,920
So Mike, what was the reality?

401
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,560
Well, I think we came back to sort of to check on you.

402
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,600
And I think it was like 1030 and you thought it was like you had been asleep for eight hours.

403
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,040
I thought it was five in the morning.

404
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,880
And the King of Queens was on the TV.

405
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:23,880
Yes.

406
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,680
And you were yeah, so you were in bed.

407
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,600
And I believe then we went out a little bit more.

408
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,360
We did not have a very late night though.

409
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,240
We came back probably 1 a.m. and went to bed.

410
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,400
So then this is my favorite part of the story.

411
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,720
We wake up at 10 a.m.

412
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,800
And everyone's deciding what to do.

413
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,840
I'm going to go to the pool.

414
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,440
I'm going to go with some other people.

415
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,840
And then another one of our friends is going to gamble.

416
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,280
And I go, Jason, let's go to the pool.

417
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,760
And you go, oh, I can't.

418
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,880
I gotta.

419
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,040
And I go, come on, let's go.

420
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,840
We're in Las Vegas.

421
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,320
Let's go.

422
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,960
It's a bachelor.

423
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,920
I go, what time is it?

424
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,080
And I go, it's 10 a.m.

425
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,560
What are you?

426
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,640
And you're like, I thought it feels like seven.

427
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,440
And I go, you've been sleeping for like 12 hours.

428
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,640
Geez.

429
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,000
You've been sleeping for like at least 12 hours, maybe more.

430
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,560
And you go, you go, go on without me.

431
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,160
Hit me like a ton of risk.

432
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:20,120
I eventually got up around like noonish, 1130 noonish.

433
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,040
Bringing the total like 14?

434
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,960
14 hour sleep or so.

435
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,000
And then I did you not have a nap in the afternoon too?

436
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,560
I did go back a few hours later and nap.

437
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:35,080
So then what I did, I got up and found that despite Vegas never closing,

438
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,440
they stopped serving breakfast at 10 a.m. everywhere.

439
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,480
Because all I wanted was a bacon, egg and cheese.

440
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,880
And I was like walking through the mall that's in the Venetian Palazzo.

441
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:53,240
Eventually I landed at the Grimaldi's Pizza and ate a small pepperoni pizza all by myself.

442
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,640
And then I went back to the room.

443
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,080
And then you shopped in the Michael Jackson store.

444
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,320
And you got the free champagne flute.

445
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,600
Not the one that's themed after him or the one where he walked around and said,

446
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,640
I own this, I own that.

447
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,200
The one he walked around with Martin Bashir.

448
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,520
And I went in because I went 30 when I'm a Mosa.

449
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,880
Oh, and the how?

450
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,320
And I was like, yes, I do.

451
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,200
And then everywhere in that store, they have TVs playing the Bashir.

452
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,320
Just that clip.

453
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,080
Just the clip of them walking around.

454
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,160
I have this tomb.

455
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,360
I have all the tombs.

456
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,360
You didn't buy a tomb?

457
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,240
I didn't buy a tomb.

458
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,000
You wanted to crawl in one for a nap though.

459
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,840
So you had the champagne and then you went back and napped.

460
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,640
So the whole time, it's like we're only there for two days.

461
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,040
We're like texting you like, what are you doing?

462
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,920
We're all hanging out.

463
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,880
It's a bachelor party.

464
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:46,280
You had gotten like 14 to 16 hours of sleep in Las Vegas.

465
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,720
Hey, everybody makes Vegas their own.

466
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,320
I think he lived like a king.

467
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,200
He did.

468
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah, look, I walked around the big innuendoor mall.

469
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,200
I liked the gondola.

470
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,120
I looked at the gondolas for a while.

471
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,080
What is impressive?

472
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,120
I will say this about you.

473
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,280
When I've ever been on a trip with you, it does swing either way.

474
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,800
There's been times when you are the one who's out till 6 a.m.

475
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,680
Till the sun comes up.

476
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:10,920
Sure.

477
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,360
Till the sun comes up and we're all sleeping and we're like, wow, Jason's wild.

478
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,240
And then there's the Vegas story where you sleep 16 hours and barely see us.

479
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,720
Yeah, yeah.

480
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,840
I'm a man of extremes.

481
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,120
I'm a Libra just constantly trying to balance those scales, baby.

482
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,160
Well, you heard it here first.

483
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,520
You heard it here first.

484
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,600
And they really dip when you put a gigantic sausage on one end of them.

485
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,240
Yeah.

486
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,840
Is that your only Vegas trip?

487
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,000
No, I actually spent one of my first jobs.

488
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,800
I was an intern for the HBO Comedy Festival and then they upgraded us to production assistants.

489
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,160
They only ran two or three of them.

490
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,120
It was just called the Comedy Festival and they would do it at Caesars.

491
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,440
And so I stayed at Vegas.

492
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,240
I lived at Vegas for like nine or ten days at Caesars.

493
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,480
Had a badge.

494
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,000
We ate in the employee cafeteria and stuff.

495
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,560
And so, yeah, so that was very fun.

496
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,760
So, but I mean, that was work, but we didn't have a lot of time off.

497
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,560
Sure.

498
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,200
Well, that sounds much more pleasant.

499
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,760
Yeah.

500
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,640
I've been to Vegas dozens and dozens of times.

501
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,360
How many do you think?

502
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,280
Every time I'm there, I realize I can't count because it's a go-to trip with Erin and I.

503
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,480
And her family.

504
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,240
And I've done it for work wherein I went to Wayne Newton's house.

505
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:39,480
I've been to Wayne Newton's estate where we filmed one shot of a weird like video game ad.

506
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:46,280
And we got to his young children came out and were like, do you want to see his penguins?

507
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,920
And they were holding penguins as if they were babies.

508
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,480
Oh my God.

509
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,240
It was the strangest scenario.

510
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,360
Did you hold a penguin?

511
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,120
I don't think I held the penguin, but I like watched a penguin in my head.

512
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,760
Someone tell me if this is impossible that a penguin could be fed with a bottle.

513
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,200
And they say it out loud.

514
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,640
That doesn't seem right.

515
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,320
No, no, I think I can see that.

516
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:05,640
You think?

517
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,360
I could see that.

518
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,040
Well, that may stick their beaks up.

519
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,400
And a very young one.

520
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,720
Yeah.

521
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,400
Well, I may have watched the feeding of a penguin at Wayne Newton's house

522
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,560
and took photos and like his empty foyer.

523
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,840
If you watch Vegas Vacation, like there's scenes shot in there and that's a room I was in.

524
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,280
Until he showed up, I just had to myself.

525
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,320
Aaron was there too and a couple other crew people.

526
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,520
And that's wild.

527
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,880
Yeah, that's some Vegas stuff.

528
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,720
But I've been so, so many times and I don't even like all the stuff.

529
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,440
I don't gamble.

530
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,600
I don't drink insanely.

531
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,760
I don't go to the firing range.

532
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,120
I just like being there.

533
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,040
I like dumb shows of Chris Angel, David Copperfield stuff I've seen lately.

534
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,760
But I didn't really like Vegas growing up.

535
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,200
I think my parents tried to do.

536
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,360
I did MGM Grand, the theme park, but it was never our favorite.

537
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,440
It wasn't my parents' favorite until I started going with Aaron.

538
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,360
I didn't really dig it.

539
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,080
But the first time we ever went together and the first trip we ever took together as a couple,

540
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:09,640
in fact, was in 2006 to the Las Vegas Hilton during which time the Star Trek experience was open.

541
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,240
We did not go to the Star Trek experience.

542
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,760
And it's funny, like we just remembered that and we're like,

543
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,600
how could that be?

544
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,440
Today we'd be all over that.

545
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:26,200
And now it seems like that doesn't even sound like us to not go to the in the hotel Star Trek experience.

546
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,760
It's right there that it's the hotel you stayed at.

547
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,800
And did anyone find pricing for it?

548
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,040
I didn't really come across that.

549
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,760
In my head it was a lot, but yeah, something like 30, 40 bucks.

550
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,400
Okay, yeah.

551
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:43,720
I mean, everything in Vegas is to a certain extent priced to move because they're competing rooms

552
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,360
and shows and stuff.

553
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,240
I mean, Lady Gaga's residency, I had to look it up recently.

554
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,320
Those tickets are 700 dollars.

555
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,600
But the magic show like Copperfield has like 60 bucks.

556
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,440
Yeah, you can get some cheap stuff.

557
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,040
If you find some weird like little ticket zone, you can get stuff for cheap.

558
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,600
We did not go.

559
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,120
I think it was like the furthest out of my theme park orbit I ever was.

560
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,160
And probably a new cool girl I'm dating.

561
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,120
I'm not going to just like sew and throw all that shit at her.

562
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,240
Do you know who Quark is?

563
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,120
And I still don't know who Quark is.

564
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,240
So that's also part of that.

565
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,360
I think I wasn't like my theme park gene was like at its most dormant and I'm not really

566
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,640
a Star Trek guy.

567
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:28,680
We did, however, like our elevator up to the room, like the first time we went up there,

568
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,680
a just married Star Trek clad couple got in the elevator with us.

569
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,000
Wow.

570
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,040
Both in uniforms.

571
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,200
One of them might have been a Klingon.

572
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Maybe one of them was feeding a penguin with a bottle.

573
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,320
That's what's in all my memories.

574
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,440
But yeah, it looms very large in the first trip we ever took together.

575
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,600
And we go back, we went back there a few years ago just to like reminisce about that.

576
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:58,120
And what's so odd is that even though there is like no, this thing is gone and has been

577
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,080
gone since 2008, 2009, still Star Trek, there's little clues everywhere.

578
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,400
There's a wing of the casino that is still the theme to a spaceport.

579
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,240
And on the outside of the building, and I think probably still to this day, I checked

580
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,000
Google Maps and it was true, the giant Star Trek emblem.

581
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,680
Nobody bothered to take it down.

582
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,280
Why not?

583
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,800
That seems like if you're going to disavow this attraction,

584
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:26,360
take off the like giant famous shape that's on the outside of your building.

585
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,480
I mean, what happened after I think might have some answers to that because the people

586
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,200
who would go on to own this property.

587
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,760
Oh, sure.

588
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,440
What is this?

589
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:36,920
David.

590
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,480
What is his last name?

591
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,160
Wait, who are you thinking?

592
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,080
I'm thinking the Queen of Versailles guy.

593
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,480
Oh, yeah.

594
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:43,880
Oh, yeah.

595
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,520
Yeah.

596
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:44,760
Yes.

597
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,240
Well, now it is a Westgate hotel.

598
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,560
Yeah, now it's a Westgate and David.

599
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,120
What's his name?

600
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,840
It starts with a B.

601
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,160
Yeah, if you've seen the documentary Queen of Versailles, which we probably have more

602
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,840
discussion about, but it's like that.

603
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,800
It's a timeshare building now.

604
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,680
David Siegel.

605
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,600
David Siegel.

606
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,960
The worst man in America.

607
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,520
He explains everything.

608
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,800
He ties together Bush and Trump and the financial collapse.

609
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,840
Told his employees he would have to start laying people off if Obama gets elected.

610
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,880
Like was trying to affect how his employees were voting in 2008.

611
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,240
Oh, God.

612
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,000
Oh, and wasn't he a guy, isn't it in the documentary that like he knew he's like,

613
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,320
we'll get this in the bag for you, Bush.

614
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,120
He like knew somehow it was going to go that way.

615
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,320
Oh, in 2000?

616
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:31,800
Yeah.

617
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,200
Maybe he was part of rigging it in Florida, in the county where it mattered.

618
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,240
Probably.

619
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,280
He has more money than God.

620
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:44,280
He has the biggest house built on like American soil, or at least it was for a short time,

621
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,360
but also incredibly cheap.

622
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,840
Like he's stingy.

623
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,080
Yeah, and a mean man who's bad to his children he doesn't want to have.

624
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,320
It's really icky.

625
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,080
And so yeah, that was the weirdest thing.

626
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,800
Like, oh, remember when we stayed here and there was the Star Trek thing?

627
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,240
Oh, it's all still here.

628
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,080
There's a whole wing of like slot machines that still looks like a spaceport.

629
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,960
And the welcome set, like the preview center where you get timeshare presentations

630
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,040
is in a spaceport for no reason.

631
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:17,320
And so like all the Westgate signage and like, you know, where you get the little stump speeches

632
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,400
and then a little store, what used to be the Star Trek gift shop is now full of Queen of

633
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,680
Versailles merchandise.

634
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,960
They sell hot sauce and mints and it's presented like it's me, the Queen of Versailles,

635
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,600
like Paris Hilton, the simple life, like owning.

636
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,520
Kind of a trashy diva.

637
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,920
But like that documentary is very sad.

638
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,280
It's not very sad.

639
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,680
You know, yeah, the heights of luxury.

640
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,560
So if you're going to Vegas, I'd recommend it to you.

641
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:47,000
You might walk around the weird remnants of the Star Trek experience.

642
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,560
The bathrooms have portholes and like weird little laser lines around the mirror.

643
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,920
It's so, so weird.

644
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,240
And yeah, anyway, I guess we should talk about what it was before.

645
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,440
That's what it is today.

646
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,400
Westgate vacations are a great deal for you and your family.

647
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,560
Of course, they co-own the show now.

648
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:11,720
So you'll be getting upsold on these podcasts as much as possible.

649
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,220
Yeah.

650
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,120
Time with your family is crucial.

651
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,480
And if you don't do it now, you might die and never get to do it.

652
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,720
So invest in your family and your future.

653
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,920
You get to pay us on.

654
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,400
You can't own property as easily.

655
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,360
You can own this.

656
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,160
Maybe I can see if I can buy the Star Trek insignia.

657
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,380
Sure.

658
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,800
We just give me a giant piece of plastic outside the hotel.

659
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,600
It's weird that they didn't because there were a lot of auctions for things,

660
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,200
I think, after this or at least one.

661
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,080
And it all disappeared.

662
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,240
Yeah, which made it impossible to bring back.

663
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,400
Anyway, before we talk about what became of it,

664
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,480
because that's all a weird, interesting mess too, let's talk about what it was.

665
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,960
I mean, I explained it a little bit.

666
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,520
This was this immersive Star Trek experience involved rides and restaurants.

667
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,480
Although you know what?

668
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,920
There's this whole other thing.

669
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,160
Did you guys look into what was originally supposed to be the first

670
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,480
Star Trek experience in Las Vegas?

671
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:03,880
Yes.

672
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,120
Oh, the big enterprise?

673
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,640
The giant enterprise.

674
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,520
OK, so the year is 1992.

675
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,320
The strip is on the grow.

676
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,120
There's the Mirage, there's the Luxor, there's the MGM Grand,

677
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,480
all of these family attractions that are heavily themed.

678
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,640
Downtown Vegas, Fremont Street, is turning into a real shithole.

679
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,720
That's sort of like former Vegas.

680
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,160
It's not where families go.

681
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,640
How can we balance these sides out?

682
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,520
So the main, like the people in charge of downtown put it out

683
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,200
to all these themed entertainment places.

684
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,680
You know, what can we do?

685
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,400
What's what could be our the big thing that lures people in?

686
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,680
We know today that they settled on the world's dimmest screen,

687
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,400
which is now above Fremont.

688
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,840
This bizarre, like a fading jumbotron that displays, you know,

689
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,560
top tier graphics circa 2005.

690
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,480
But that was the second choice because what they wanted to do

691
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,680
was build a gigantic Star Trek enterprise that was so big.

692
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,120
There's a little like chart that showed how big it was supposed to be.

693
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,800
It was supposed to be as long as the Eiffel Tower is tall.

694
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,520
It was taller than the pyramids of Giza.

695
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,720
You'd be able to see it from the sky as you landed.

696
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,960
This was going to be mammoth.

697
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,320
And probably have stuff like the Star Trek experience inside,

698
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,080
like recreations of the decks and rides and restaurants and all that.

699
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,960
And this seemed like a slam dunk done deal

700
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,320
until it went up to the CEO of Paramount, Stanley Jaffe.

701
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,560
Also the Oscar winning producer of Kramer versus Kramer before that.

702
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,200
Yeah, I believe he appears in the Robert Evans book,

703
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,240
Kid Stays in the Picture.

704
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,720
I believe because I remember it was like the audiobook, Stanley Jaffe.

705
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,920
That's that has a little Robert Evans.

706
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,880
He ring, doesn't it?

707
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,120
Yeah.

708
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,400
So they do this major pitch to him that has, by the way, the city has signed off.

709
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,280
Vegas is like super excited about this.

710
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,600
Everyone was except for Stanley Jaffe.

711
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:12,760
Yes, who in the meeting, they present all of their diagrams and their videos

712
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,400
and everything that this is going to be and do for the city.

713
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,480
And he says, well, this is all very nice and I like what you did.

714
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,800
But here's where I'm coming from here at Paramount.

715
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,680
If we release a movie and it bombs, you just shove it in a drawer and forget it ever happened.

716
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,680
If I build a giant building and it bombs, it's there forever.

717
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,120
I don't want to be the guy that approved this.

718
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,680
And then it's a flop and sitting out there in Vegas forever.

719
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,480
Which that'd be unprecedented that some Vegas thing didn't work out

720
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,560
and you just imploded or something.

721
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,080
But he just walked out of the meeting.

722
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,600
Very nice to meet you.

723
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,600
That was the end of that.

724
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,320
Never built.

725
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,440
Well, that's it.

726
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,600
The guy pitching it was Gary Goddard, who always seemed like a huckster piece of shit.

727
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,880
And as we have now learned, he's also a creep piece of shit.

728
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,720
And I'll let the listeners Google him.

729
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,160
Creep might be an understatement.

730
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,040
It's not quite.

731
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:08,120
We talked about this, Jason, how Gary Goddard is like this ghost that has haunted the podcast.

732
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:13,560
We've done a lot of topics where Gary Goddard was part of and we've discussed how do we address this

733
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,000
and do we discuss everything that happened with it.

734
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,720
I don't want to die.

735
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,720
I don't think the only thing we can say is fuck you, Gary Goddard.

736
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,320
There's a special place in hell.

737
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,560
Yes.

738
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,360
It's a bummer.

739
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,560
And if you just need a clue, he's a Brian Singer guy.

740
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,360
He's one of his last projects with Brian Singer.

741
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,720
Fill in the blanks.

742
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,480
If you Google him, there's some very thorough articles.

743
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,600
So it sucks.

744
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,480
He was part of some amazing things and stuff that we've talked about at length

745
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,760
on this podcast.

746
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,920
And it's such a bummer that we have to like.

747
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,640
We like to talk about in years who did this and here's who did this.

748
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,440
In this case, like, let's not give this guy credit.

749
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,080
Let's erase his legacy because the things he should be known for

750
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,680
is being a creep piece of shit.

751
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,160
Allegedly, allegedly, allegedly.

752
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,720
If it is true.

753
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,320
Now it's up to you to figure out.

754
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,640
Do your own personal Gary Goddard or don't.

755
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,200
Maybe don't.

756
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,280
But anyway, so maybe that's good that it didn't work out because, you know, not a good.

757
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,600
Yeah, I mean, look, there's unlike, you know, films, there's hundreds of people work on it,

758
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,000
but it's it's usually the director is the author.

759
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,600
Some people think there's different schools of thought on that.

760
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,320
But films usually associate with directors, themed entertainment.

761
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,840
There's so much input from so many different avenues and different people behind it.

762
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,040
Yeah, it's hard to say.

763
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,640
There's just the one guy.

764
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,560
Yeah, even stuff even like Tony Baxter of hundreds of people.

765
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,060
Yeah.

766
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,480
Attractions.

767
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,480
We say like, oh, yeah, Tony Baxter ever saw this came up with these ideas.

768
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,360
But yeah, there's hundreds and hundreds of people working on these things.

769
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,120
That being said, let me give a little credit to the guy who built the world's dimmest screen,

770
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,640
what is now at Fremont Street.

771
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,240
John Jertie, father of City Walk.

772
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,800
Oh, yeah.

773
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,480
He did the dim screen.

774
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,080
He did the big dim screen.

775
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,580
Yes.

776
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,420
So much credit.

777
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,300
Dimmest screen.

778
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,140
Thank you for slightly brightening the Las Vegas sky.

779
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,900
So it didn't work out.

780
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:26,860
But then cut to 1996, the same dynamic is occurring with the Las Vegas Hilton because

781
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,980
the strip is booming.

782
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,500
Families are going to the strip.

783
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,980
The Las Vegas Hilton is not on the strip.

784
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,900
It is now part of the monorail line, but it is separate from all that stuff.

785
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,620
And it's kind of associated with old Vegas.

786
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:44,220
Do you guys know much about the history of the Hilton for any particular reason,

787
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,740
or the big things that happened there?

788
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:46,940
I don't know.

789
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,580
I don't think so.

790
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,580
I didn't know any of this.

791
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,980
Opened in 1969, it was called the International Hotel.

792
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:57,340
First of all, it's not just a Benihana, something called the Benihana Village.

793
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,220
What?

794
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,460
It's like an entire, yeah, maybe that's where you want to go.

795
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,100
I think it's still there.

796
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:01,980
Is that there?

797
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,700
Yeah, I guess so.

798
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,020
Oh my god.

799
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,380
It seems like, what's that Yamashiro that's up on the top of the Hollywood Hills?

800
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:13,660
It seems like where it's this little shrine, essentially, that you can explore.

801
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,500
But it's ultimately for a Benihana.

802
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,660
So check out Benihana Village.

803
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,060
This thing opens in 1969.

804
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,220
The first, and one of the big attractions of it, gigantic showroom.

805
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,820
Because by that point, they're attract Vegas hotels are attracted in the Rat Pack.

806
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,340
We want to have the biggest, best one.

807
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,100
They got Barbra Streisand to be the first performer for a solid month.

808
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,420
Second performer, Elvis Presley.

809
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,020
And that's where Elvis played.

810
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:41,020
Elvis in Vegas equals the Las Vegas Hilton, at least until his death.

811
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,460
He did seven years, upwards of 600 shows.

812
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,860
And that's when he lived in that hotel.

813
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:52,860
And there was a suite called the Elvis Suite for a long time, until it got blown up.

814
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,860
Because the wing got removed.

815
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,020
Colonel Tom Parker lived in the Hilton for a long time.

816
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,580
What hotel did Colonel Tom Parker live in, though?

817
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,020
He might have hopped from play.

818
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,220
He might have also taken 10, 16 hours of sleep at night.

819
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,180
Hey, just like Sloppy Telly.

820
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,940
They will all be living in various hotels someday.

821
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,220
We'll all just go visit each other.

822
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:14,620
God willing.

823
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,420
We're lucky.

824
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,140
Pick one now.

825
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,300
And then also, late 70s, early 80s, Liberace.

826
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:29,900
Everything portrayed, the era portrayed in Buying the Candelabra is the Las Vegas Hilton.

827
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,820
Late 80s, early 90s, Wayne Newton.

828
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,020
So this is like above Vegas-y, Vegas place.

829
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:39,980
But by the 90s, that is becoming passe and family entertainment is the new thing.

830
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,020
So how do we compete?

831
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:47,820
And they compete by arranging a deal with Paramount and Cedar Fair for the Star Trek property.

832
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,620
Wow.

833
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,500
I didn't realize it.

834
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,620
I was all in that.

835
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,300
Hey, there's your Vegas factoids.

836
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,180
And the only thing that still exists is the Benihana Village.

837
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,180
Of all of this, yes.

838
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,620
Interesting.

839
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:02,060
Dreams have died and yet the Benihana Village remains.

840
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,620
Yeah, that's right.

841
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:08,140
This was an interesting holdover because Paramount Parks technically ran Star Trek The Experience.

842
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,020
Then they got bought by Cedar Fair.

843
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,740
Oh, is that what happened?

844
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,340
Cedar Fair even kept it going for a couple years longer.

845
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,180
They did work out whatever licensing.

846
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:24,700
And when Star Trek The Experience closed, it was supposed to reopen somewhere else.

847
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,940
I believe at a mall called Neonopolis.

848
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,180
I'll save Neonopolis stuff.

849
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:31,820
I'll save it.

850
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,420
Let's talk about the spaceships first.

851
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,580
That's a whole thing too.

852
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,660
This thing came out of the gate with a lot of hype.

853
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,180
And I remember reading about it at the time and it sounded pretty insane.

854
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,460
And how often do you see a freestanding themed experience?

855
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:52,860
It's not part of a park that has this hyped up or has this good of reviews.

856
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,380
This level of coif detail.

857
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,740
I remember reading about it and I will also say

858
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,020
I also did not go to the Star Trek The Experience.

859
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,580
I was in Vegas for the first time ever in December of 2007.

860
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,300
So I could have done it.

861
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:08,700
Wow.

862
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,140
I was a little bit as my theme park gene was a little dormant.

863
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,940
It was probably a few months before I would get well,

864
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,420
I maybe had an annual pass already to Disneyland.

865
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:21,180
But before I would start really reading up about stuff, I didn't even think about it.

866
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,380
It breaks my heart.

867
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,980
What a dark time for both of us.

868
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,340
Everything's perfect now.

869
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,340
We stayed at the MGM Grand.

870
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,500
I don't even think we did anything silly.

871
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,620
The first time I would have been there for that job was the fall of 2006.

872
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,500
But I don't think I knew this existed.

873
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,980
I think I had heard about it over the years, but I had assumed it had closed by this point.

874
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:49,340
It was also a time, I guess, when I was always so to talk my Star Trek,

875
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,740
my relationship with Star Trek, I was a next generation kid.

876
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,340
We were at the hospital.

877
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,060
My sister had some stomach pain and they thought it might be like

878
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,900
appendicitis or something and it was not.

879
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,020
It was everything was fine.

880
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,660
But I remember watching Star Trek, the next generation for the first time on the TV in

881
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,580
the waiting room and being like, this is the coolest thing I've ever seen.

882
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:15,660
And I wanted to live on the enterprise as a child.

883
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:20,140
Like I wanted, I was so obsessed with the idea of getting my own little quarters

884
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,260
and the replicator and I could have whatever food I wanted.

885
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,860
You're going to be a little Wheaton.

886
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,300
I wanted to be a little Wil Wheaton.

887
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,860
I wanted to be on the bridge.

888
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,100
Actually, I think I didn't want to be on the bridge.

889
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,980
I didn't want to like shoot.

890
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,820
I didn't really want to shoot a phase.

891
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,100
You don't have anything to do.

892
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,820
Yeah, I don't want to be like visiting your dad who works there.

893
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:44,140
Yeah, or like maybe work 10 forward with Guinan would be Goldberg.

894
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,660
There's a large support staff.

895
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,100
So I would.

896
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:54,380
So that's what makes me more upset about this is that I wasn't even on my radar at the time

897
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,140
or I wasn't thinking about it or I just took it for granted that it would always be there.

898
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,580
But this was Star Trek The Next Generation primarily.

899
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:06,220
Quark's bar is from Deep Space Nine, which is a show I watched a little bit,

900
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:09,260
but I'm not way into it like I was Next Generation.

901
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,180
It seems like it sort of transitioned you.

902
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:16,540
Like the main experience was more next gen than anything and the ship was more next gen.

903
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:23,260
Yeah, it was the NC 1701D, which is the proper ship from the TV show, not the movies.

904
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,260
Because then they got they blew the ship, of course, famously blew up in Star Trek

905
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:32,300
Generations. They crash landed the ship on an alien planet and then they debuted.

906
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:32,780
Forever?

907
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:38,300
Yeah, but then the NC 1701E was in first contact was the ship.

908
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,940
And that was the ship they used the next gen cast used for the rest of their movies.

909
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:49,900
But to be clear, Quark was Deep Space Nine, which was a space station, not a ship.

910
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,180
Eventually, they added a ship in later seasons.

911
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,900
Well, the Defiant was their like famous littler ship.

912
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,820
Their little mission and like fights and stuff.

913
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:04,780
And the second attraction added was Voyager was Star Trek Voyager based.

914
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:09,980
Yeah, it had Captain Janeway, of course, from Star Trek Voyager, Kate Mulgrew,

915
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,260
which I honestly I watched a lot of Voyager as a kid for whatever reason,

916
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,100
next gen and Voyager were my two for whatever reason.

917
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,380
Can I say mine?

918
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:25,420
Most of mine as a kid was watching the original show in syndication on TV in the summers.

919
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,500
I like that next gen I would watch every now and then.

920
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,460
And I remember when the action figures came out, but it never really like hooked me.

921
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:40,220
I associate it with King's Dominion in Virginia because they had a presence,

922
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,060
a Star Trek presence in that park.

923
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:43,900
What was it again?

924
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,740
Oh, we'll get to that in the Patreon.

925
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,220
Don't worry.

926
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,700
Oh, yeah. Okay. We'll do the ancillary Star Trek.

927
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,140
That's right. Yes. Head over to the Patreon.

928
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,340
But I was never I like next generation when I would see it.

929
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:58,060
I never really hunted it out. I was much more of a Star Wars kid.

930
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,300
I was way into this before Star Wars.

931
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,860
My parents, my parents were not in either of these things.

932
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,220
Not that they hated it. They like saw the first Star Wars.

933
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:09,100
I was good. You know, maybe we'll see.

934
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,220
Then maybe they saw the second one.

935
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,540
Maybe. But that was it.

936
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,460
So like I found all this stuff on my own.

937
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,980
I'm more like them. I don't know.

938
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:23,580
It all seems it all seems nice. It's too late for me now.

939
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,100
I just saw a bunch of the movies hit the canopy.

940
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,900
One of the library streaming service websites.

941
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,580
I haven't really seen a lot of the movies.

942
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,700
Have you seen any of the movies?

943
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:42,220
I've seen four. I've stolen Aaron's Star Trek trajectory,

944
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,540
which is she likes four because it has the whales.

945
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,020
Oh, yeah.

946
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,100
Yeah. That's the one that we like.

947
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,100
Chris Pine. I saw the first Chris Pine movie.

948
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,540
So how many have you seen?

949
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:51,900
Of the movies?

950
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,380
Yeah.

951
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,660
Just the first Chris Pine movie.

952
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,620
Oh, that's it? Really?

953
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:57,180
That's it. Maybe other little clips on cable and stuff.

954
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,700
We're going to stay here and I'm going to make you watch

955
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,620
Star Trek Generations where Picard and William Shatner

956
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,580
meet in Montana and chop wood together.

957
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,540
And ride horses.

958
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,820
The captains finally meet and what do they do?

959
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:14,140
They're in a little log cabin and then they like help each other on the farm.

960
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:17,340
Seems like boringness is kind of built into this franchise.

961
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:17,660
Yes.

962
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:23,100
Because a lot of these early movies from what I've gathered are a little like turgid.

963
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,500
Oh, yeah. The first movie is very boring.

964
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,780
I like it, but it's very boring.

965
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:33,820
And what J.J. Abrams did and I like the first J.J. Abrams movie and I kind of like the second one.

966
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:39,580
What J.J. did, unfortunately, was try to make Star Trek fun and cool and sexy and no.

967
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,660
What are you doing, man?

968
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:45,820
The exciting stuff is supposed to be when they're all like 20s gangsters or like

969
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:48,460
Mark Twain shows up for a whole episode.

970
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:53,900
Their idea for to boost, I mean, they did put a sexy lady on Star Trek Voyager,

971
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:58,940
but one of their other ideas to boost ratings was to regularly have a subplot where Catherine

972
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,980
Janeway would go talk to Leonardo da Vinci on the holodeck.

973
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:07,660
That was when they built a big Leonardo da Vinci set and cast like an actor.

974
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,220
So a big thing and they're like, oh, this is going to be good for the ratings.

975
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,980
This is when we add Da Vinci as a recurring character.

976
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,020
So like that is sort of what Star Trek is.

977
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:22,620
I think there was a fan backlash when Seven of Nine who came onto the show.

978
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,820
Seven of Nine was a Borg.

979
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:28,380
Jerry Ryan played her, Jerry Ryan, a very tall, attractive woman,

980
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,340
and she was wearing like a bodysuit.

981
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:36,460
So to get the ratings up in season three or four, it's like here's a sexy Borg lady.

982
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,180
And the fans were pissed off.

983
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:39,980
They were mad.

984
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:43,340
They were mad about the sexy lady on the show.

985
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,900
Now we're deep into like Hercules, Zena era.

986
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,020
You got to show skin.

987
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,020
And she just had a bodysuit on.

988
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,940
It wasn't like she was Voyager.

989
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,060
This was also the launch of UPN around this time, right?

990
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:58,460
Voyager was like the big thing helping launch UPN.

991
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:05,100
So yeah, so Star Trek fans in general are like nothing sensational or interesting.

992
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:09,820
We want dry diplomacy and that's sort of the fun of it.

993
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:19,420
So while I do like the JJ movies, I do think that a big part of Star Trek is dry, boring diplomacy

994
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,380
and ethics, a lot of ethics.

995
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,260
A lot of ethics.

996
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,140
I like that.

997
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,260
I mean, the first series.

998
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,900
Tea, he drinks a lot of Earl Grey tea, right?

999
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:33,340
The first series I will say with Gene Roddenberry is a little sexier.

1000
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:40,380
Shatner is a very like horny captain and women are in the skirts and like there's a very kind of

1001
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,620
swing and 60s kind of vibe.

1002
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,580
There's some like guest babes that show up from different planets.

1003
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,700
And there's weird horny stuff on all of them.

1004
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,860
And Spock, Spock has weird like.

1005
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:54,220
Ponfar is, yeah, every seven years.

1006
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,580
Do you know about this, Scott?

1007
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,060
No.

1008
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:59,900
Every seven years, Vulcan's mate and they get insane.

1009
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,020
There's like a couple of weeks or whatever where they get insane.

1010
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,300
So you got to like steer clear of them when they're horny.

1011
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,940
They're very emotional because they're normally not emotional.

1012
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,980
Right, so they let all their emotions out in that moment.

1013
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,060
That's like when the Amish people like go experiment.

1014
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:17,820
Yeah, it's like Rob Spring, yeah.

1015
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:20,940
Oh, I like the term, wow.

1016
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:27,260
Data has sex in one of the first few seasons or first season, I forget if second season.

1017
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:31,180
He has sex and he tells, he tells, who does he have sex with?

1018
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:37,420
Tasha Yar or something that he's fully functional, which is gross.

1019
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,940
Meaning that like data is creator Dr. Noonian Song.

1020
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,660
He created data and then had to work very hard on his penis.

1021
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:52,220
Like he had to work very hard on this robot penis that's fully functional.

1022
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:55,100
You're gesturing like you have tools, like a little hammer and chisel.

1023
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:55,600
Right.

1024
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:02,720
You had a little checklist, it's like all right, language, check, morals, check, ethics, check,

1025
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,640
dorking dong, check.

1026
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:09,360
And it has to change because data is not walking around with a boner the whole time.

1027
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,320
So it has to move.

1028
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,720
Like he made it move somehow realistically.

1029
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,040
This creepy old doctor or a scientist who made data.

1030
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:23,200
Which to invent technology that can be small and then spring up and be hard and long,

1031
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,000
that's difficult.

1032
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,000
It seems like it would be.

1033
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,120
And that it's got to tie into your brain mechanisms and something has to trigger it.

1034
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,160
Yeah.

1035
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,720
The human anatomy is incredibly complex.

1036
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,440
Like they say the iris is like the most intense lens and so like they'll never be able to

1037
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,720
perfectly replicate like the human eye lenses.

1038
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,560
It sounds intense, but not as intense as manufacturing the boner.

1039
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,920
Dr. Song, I don't know.

1040
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,760
We don't know if he perfected the boner though.

1041
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,920
He might've just gotten like a version one.

1042
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,720
It might have just been like two modes.

1043
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,320
You also get into does it work?

1044
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,280
Does data feel pleasure or does it work?

1045
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,920
It works more for the partner.

1046
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,840
Well, data well, famously data did not have emotions for the run of the show.

1047
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:19,440
Dr. Noonan Song created an emotion ship that was not fully working yet and it was too much.

1048
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,600
And data finally fully put it into his brain and Star Trek Generations.

1049
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,040
And it fucked him up.

1050
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,640
He got so scared.

1051
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:32,240
He'd let Geordi be captured by Malcolm McDowell, Dr. Sohran.

1052
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,120
So don't have emotions ever is the moral of this.

1053
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,000
And he also was trying.

1054
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,680
He'd always was trying to grasp humor.

1055
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,320
You know data.

1056
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,480
He was trying to figure it out and it was always coming.

1057
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,520
He was always looking like a fool because he would make a joke that wasn't funny.

1058
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,680
So anyway.

1059
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,720
He started just saying is this humor and pointing to his boner.

1060
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,800
Well, he'd be right.

1061
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,400
Yes, actually.

1062
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,320
You've got it.

1063
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,280
My God.

1064
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,240
Riker would have liked that.

1065
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,520
Maybe Bucard would have thought that was not cool.

1066
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,600
So anyway, I was obsessed.

1067
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,640
I was obsessed with this.

1068
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,840
So this is again why this breaks my heart so much is that it was at the enterprise from next

1069
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,720
generation.

1070
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,400
And do you watch a video of this and go by God, they nailed it.

1071
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,280
They kind of did.

1072
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,240
It seems like it.

1073
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:22,720
Yeah, because like I would really like a big maybe complaint I would have as a kid that I

1074
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,680
wouldn't really complain about would be that you couldn't sit in the room in Peter Pan on

1075
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,160
the ride.

1076
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,400
You couldn't actually kind of walk around.

1077
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:36,800
You were on a path and you didn't quite get to make it your own little experience.

1078
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,760
It was great.

1079
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,960
But I think part of me was always like I'd like to walk around in these settings on the

1080
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,760
rides.

1081
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,640
So especially to be on the actual bridge and be in the turbo lift and walk down the

1082
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,560
hallways look exactly right.

1083
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,920
That was a fantasy of mine as a child would have been unbelievable.

1084
00:52:53,920 --> 00:53:02,000
And it's kind of cool that you're being guided around by different crew members who can

1085
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,240
seemingly shape the experience a little bit depending on their performance and that it's

1086
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,440
very like here come this way.

1087
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,320
It seems to when you watch videos of this, it seems to have like a like a haunt quality

1088
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,360
a little bit and where it's confusing in there and here follow me.

1089
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,080
But then they might be wrong and something might happen to them.

1090
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:26,000
It definitely isn't like star tours you get in a line and now it's time to get on the

1091
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,640
ship and like you're not cut loose.

1092
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,080
But there's a little more of that feeling.

1093
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,040
So the main ride when it first opened was the Klingon encounter.

1094
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:35,200
Right.

1095
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,040
But it was not called that at the time.

1096
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,960
Until there was a divider until they opened the second one.

1097
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,920
It was just called.

1098
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,160
That was the Star Trek experience.

1099
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,520
But now it's the Klingon encounter.

1100
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:51,040
This is a very interesting concept for this because it acknowledges that the guests are

1101
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,880
20th century people.

1102
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:58,400
Normally I would be against it but I think it does it in such a fun way.

1103
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,040
Yeah I like it.

1104
00:53:59,040 --> 00:53:59,920
I like it too.

1105
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,960
Because at first I would be like well it's better if you just you're in that century

1106
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,040
as well and you're recruits or something.

1107
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,600
And this was apparently a rewrite done by writers on next generation.

1108
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,240
Yes.

1109
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,600
There was I forget what writer was but somebody was trying to write it and they were like how

1110
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,760
do you do this because there's a simulator that happens.

1111
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,640
How do you write a simulator?

1112
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,200
Did you see this?

1113
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:17,520
Yeah.

1114
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,720
How do you write a simulator ride?

1115
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,400
And then they're like we're going to Disneyland.

1116
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,280
And they just went down to Disneyland and did star tours.

1117
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,480
For research and then went back to the boring room and wrote the thing.

1118
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,720
And that's what's something that's cool about it is that it plays with your expectations

1119
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,960
of what you expect out of a ride.

1120
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,200
And like what I was saying that you end up with a little more freedom and it's more of

1121
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,800
a customized experience.

1122
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:46,160
But they like they presented initially and forgive me I didn't see like video of this

1123
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:52,320
part but it seems like you were brought into a room where it's a lot more it's spelled out

1124
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,480
you're going on a simulator.

1125
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,760
Yeah they have like a junkie simulator.

1126
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,840
I think I've heard Tony Baxter talk about it.

1127
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:04,000
Like he was lined up and he goes oh and it looks exactly like star tours and I think

1128
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,280
he was saying he was rolling his eyes like oh here we go.

1129
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,640
And you're watching a video.

1130
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,360
Yes.

1131
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:15,440
It is very much the star tours video same angles you watch people get on it like you

1132
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:20,720
know it seems a little funny or something like they're you know like as you board and

1133
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,480
you're putting belongings under your chair but then it starts to flicker out.

1134
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:30,960
And any video I saw I don't think does it justice to what the effect is.

1135
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,800
No I don't I don't have a good sense of how this work but it sounds so cool.

1136
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,120
Yeah so basically they're simulating you getting beamed up to the enterprise.

1137
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:44,080
I think what so the lights would go out and then like walls would be removed essentially

1138
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:48,480
so you would be in the transporter room and there would be some sort of flickering light

1139
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,320
and noise that would sort of disorient you a little bit and then all of a sudden you

1140
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,200
were in a different room.

1141
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:54,400
Yeah.

1142
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,360
Which yeah everyone describes it as being like very magical like they did a very good

1143
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:05,200
job of making you kind of think like what I'm not that you were actually being transported.

1144
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,800
But it doesn't seem like people know like it was like it was a total surprise to you.

1145
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,960
And the idea of them like playing with the trope of all right the video yeah I get it

1146
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,200
and then like nope wrong that is not what this is.

1147
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:15,600
That's great.

1148
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,000
Even though later there is a simulator.

1149
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,160
Yes.

1150
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,560
But by that point they have like there's so much more of an exciting experience leading up to it

1151
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:27,680
and it just goes to show they convey the feeling of like this isn't a ride you're in it.

1152
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,920
It's pretty yeah it's really cool.

1153
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:35,760
I have to say there's a pretty good ride through video online of the full experience

1154
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,360
of both experiences.

1155
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:44,560
And to me it seems like because it's it's decent quality footage and what what I read I would guess

1156
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:51,760
that it was either officially made or from what I had seen it was cast members who knew

1157
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,640
it was going away and were trying to preserve it.

1158
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,120
Yeah.

1159
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,640
Because like it's got like a steady cam.

1160
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:02,880
It's got a steady cam and like there are no they were going in crazy angles and stuff and like it

1161
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,120
looks pretty good.

1162
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:11,840
So preserved in a way that a lot of non Disney and even some older Disney stuff is not preserved

1163
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:12,480
on YouTube.

1164
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,800
So yeah now you're on the bridge is that correct.

1165
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,280
Yeah that's why I was maybe I'm a little confused was it in the transporter room and then you walk

1166
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,840
to the bridge or no the first experience was you just ended up on the bridge and you were in the

1167
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:30,400
I think maybe and somebody just starts talking to you and explains that you're in the year

1168
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,840
2371 now.

1169
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,720
That's the first version.

1170
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,240
At least as far as we know there's not like a really like solid video of this.

1171
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,000
But the Borg one I think maybe you end up in the transporter room first.

1172
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,240
Okay.

1173
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:40,880
That comes later.

1174
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,200
Sure.

1175
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,880
No I think this one you start you start in the transporter room because she's like this is going

1176
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:49,520
to sound crazy but here's the deal and then she takes you to the bridge.

1177
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,280
That's what I thought but I can't tell if they changed that a little later.

1178
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,960
But yeah you've been you've been beamed into what you call the future.

1179
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,800
You're in the 24th century.

1180
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:58,960
Right.

1181
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,640
And pretty quickly there is a video with Riker.

1182
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,960
Yes video of Riker and he explains about the whole narrative right.

1183
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,080
He's the one who says the he kind of sets it up.

1184
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,720
Yeah him him and LeVar.

1185
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,840
So what Jonathan Frakes and LeVar Burton both in this thing.

1186
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,120
So you got real actors.

1187
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,480
And this is yeah and this is right after the show is over because the show or no a couple

1188
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,520
years after the show is over because the first movie comes out in like 96.

1189
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,560
Yeah.

1190
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:32,960
So and then Riker explains to you he's the one who explains about one of you being Picard's

1191
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,240
relative right.

1192
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:38,640
Yes one of you is which is the early it's a precursor to the rebel spy.

1193
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:39,920
Oh yeah.

1194
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,520
If you think about it because they're saying well they except they don't say who it is.

1195
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:52,480
So they say one of you is a long lost relative of Captain Picard and you are targeted by what's

1196
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,800
is the Klingon who's blanking on your death.

1197
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,280
Corath.

1198
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:55,680
Thank you.

1199
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,040
Corath wants to kill you because if you don't exist then Captain Picard won't exist and

1200
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:06,960
obviously like that's very important to keeping maybe the Klingons at bay.

1201
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,960
I guess they think that'll be crazy.

1202
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,240
They think that like if Picard is gone then the Klingons will reign which I don't know

1203
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,320
that the logic of that holds up but fine.

1204
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,640
It's a killing baby Hitler scenario.

1205
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:16,880
Yeah.

1206
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:22,320
By killing you your baby Hitler to them or like the or the baby Hitler's

1207
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,800
grandfather or mother.

1208
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,200
Right.

1209
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:32,000
Different timeline rules than Avengers Endgame which creates an offshoot.

1210
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,080
I can't explain the timeline.

1211
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:39,360
The timeline was actually one of the strongest explanations of time travel

1212
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,600
and or the way timelines theoretically may work.

1213
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,880
It I thought it was really simple.

1214
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,360
Really?

1215
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,320
They did it really quickly.

1216
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,600
I was confused.

1217
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:52,000
It was just anytime someone goes back in time and does something that affects stuff it creates

1218
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,920
another timeline.

1219
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,840
But unless you put everything back in the right place.

1220
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,840
Unless you put everything back yeah that seems more like set up for future stuff so I don't

1221
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,240
know what that is.

1222
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,040
I mean I like timelines I just think that it was a little confusing.

1223
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,080
But this is operating on back to the future rules where if you.

1224
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,720
There's only one time.

1225
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,560
But Picard is missing because you've been transported it's been explained.

1226
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:17,280
The instant that you were beamed onto the ship Picard disappeared thus nicely justifying why

1227
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,760
Patrick Stewart does not appear in this ride.

1228
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,480
You're right.

1229
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,600
Not that he didn't want to.

1230
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,360
He would have loved to do it.

1231
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,720
It's just the narrative wasn't there.

1232
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,840
Yeah a little bit of narration at the end a little bit of voiceover.

1233
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:28,080
Yes.

1234
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:28,240
Yeah.

1235
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:28,720
That's true.

1236
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,360
Which is a nice little because I wasn't even sure if he.

1237
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:34,640
He did that on the phone from a resort somewhere.

1238
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,960
Kate Mulgrew does not appear in the other one either.

1239
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:37,200
Right.

1240
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,600
But she chimes in at the end.

1241
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:44,480
I'm now flashing to like if you scanned the room for wait someone in this room is an ancestor

1242
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,640
of Picard and you're scanning the room it's a bunch of dumpy Vegas people and then in the back

1243
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,560
a very tall handsome bald man.

1244
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,400
Who could it be?

1245
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,600
There should have been a plant every time of like a very handsome bald man.

1246
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,040
An ancestor you say.

1247
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,960
Sir what's your name?

1248
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,840
Fred Picard.

1249
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,240
Well we must protect you at all costs.

1250
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,520
What's who are they talking about?

1251
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,320
Then like a Klingon slices his throat.

1252
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,680
Oh you're free to go then.

1253
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,560
All right enjoy the slots shrimp cocktails available.

1254
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,040
That's right.

1255
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,960
Guess aren't just from the 20th century.

1256
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,680
They're from 20th century Las Vegas.

1257
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,880
Yeah specifically Vegas.

1258
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,160
Specifically Vegas.

1259
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:34,320
I like this as somebody who does think well how come in Star Trek or not start I'm confusing

1260
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,000
them all in Star Tours.

1261
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,200
How is it that I'm leaving from some spaceport because I was just at Disneyland a second ago.

1262
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,720
Now would I like the ride better if we left from Tomorrowland?

1263
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,440
I don't know maybe honestly I like it.

1264
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:53,920
But it's the only maybe the only ride where you do actually leave from where you started.

1265
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,920
And then end up exactly I mean I guess soaring you end up in Disney World.

1266
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,280
Disneyland and Disney World.

1267
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,000
Yeah true.

1268
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,880
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

1269
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,880
So that's that's the other one I guess.

1270
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,000
But in this one you do you start there and then you end up there.

1271
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,760
And there's fun like Vegas visual hijinks.

1272
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,600
Yeah yes which is a lot of fun.

1273
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,920
So it does have some really good logic.

1274
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:21,840
So I guess in the logic though Quarks Bar is a Vegas attraction with people dressed as the aliens.

1275
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:26,240
I think this is correct because I watched a video you can watch a video that was I think on a Star

1276
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:30,480
Trek Voyager DVD that shows all of the amenities.

1277
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,760
It's almost like they're just pitching it to you like you can have a corporate event here.

1278
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:40,320
But they go into Quarks Bar for a while in that video and there is a part where they say

1279
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,640
we just got the word from the 24th century Janeway has conquered the borg.

1280
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:51,120
We thought what do we do with him so we ground him up and put him on the menu.

1281
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:55,600
And that's why they serve hamburgers at Quarks Bar.

1282
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:04,160
From that yes the mythology is you are eating borg meat that was exported back in time 500 years.

1283
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,520
Also borg are humans often.

1284
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,320
Oh yeah.

1285
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:13,360
Borg are off are assimilated alien races which most of them are all humanoid if not all.

1286
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,880
I don't think I've actually can think of one that's not at least a humanoid.

1287
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,280
So you're eating humans and aliens.

1288
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,320
Humans and metal.

1289
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:25,360
Humans and metal yeah and yeah implant metal implants and yeah.

1290
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:28,400
And tribbles because you're eating triple tenders.

1291
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,600
So yeah you're eating I mean that's a little less weird because they

1292
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,240
they you know they don't think seemingly.

1293
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,520
Well they eat a little bit.

1294
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,160
I guess a little yeah.

1295
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,760
But a little not so much.

1296
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,200
It's more like eating a dog.

1297
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,400
It's like eating a dog.

1298
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:40,880
Oh good.

1299
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,000
But yeah you're eating a yeah a human.

1300
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:52,240
I hope they're like if you know what's the equivalent in Star Wars if you're like what a Lando burger.

1301
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,280
Yeah it's him.

1302
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,200
It would be or like it would be oh here here's what it would be it would be

1303
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:05,920
Django Fett burgers because Django was cloned to make storm troopers famously in the prequels.

1304
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,760
It's all supposedly all of the storm troopers are Django Fett.

1305
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,160
Oh so if you had a Django Rito.

1306
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,040
Yes.

1307
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:17,280
That would be a tortilla in which the innards are Django Fett's body.

1308
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,280
Yeah the clone army is all Django Fett by the time they get to storm troopers I think they've

1309
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,320
started recruiting.

1310
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:27,920
Oh wait that's fair yeah you're right so in the prequels basically yeah yeah and then by the time

1311
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:32,320
New Hope rolls around I'm sure there's a few Django's hanging around.

1312
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:38,640
Oh yeah I bet we'll find out the answer on the Mandalorian coming to Disney Plus soon.

1313
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,520
I bet we won't.

1314
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,240
No you don't think.

1315
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,680
Maybe we will IG 88 is in the trailer though.

1316
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,800
That's fun yeah.

1317
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,920
I do think you would like Star Trek more than Star Wars.

1318
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,560
Maybe.

1319
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:56,160
I think it's junkier it's cheaper it's less exciting which I think is appealing to you.

1320
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,440
So potentially.

1321
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,880
I think there's I think there's stuff in there you would like I'm not saying like you're going

1322
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,800
to become a Trekkie but I think there's stuff in there that you would very much appreciate.

1323
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,960
Well I know 60s I would 60s Star Trek I'd probably appreciate in like a Twilight Zone

1324
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,000
kind of way where it's these like little allegorical tales.

1325
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,640
Well and certainly Jean-Luc Picard enjoys a fine bottle of wine much like yourself.

1326
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,480
Yes that's true.

1327
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:18,880
Sure that's true.

1328
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,440
If I can just watch a guy kind of like in a nice chair swivel a drink around.

1329
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,000
Oh sure.

1330
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,720
Yeah and he's not a he's not an action captain.

1331
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:32,480
Picard Picard was a very like he would have the away team do his his dirty work.

1332
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,880
Wow I just get to like hang out in his study and watch him learn about history.

1333
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,160
Uh-huh in his ready room.

1334
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:42,560
Oh but the only issue is he doesn't he really like Gilbert and Sullivan.

1335
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:47,040
Everyone on Star Trek loves Gilbert and Sullivan.

1336
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:47,920
There is a scene.

1337
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,600
Just like there in Sorkin shows.

1338
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:49,840
Yes.

1339
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,280
The one big thing in common.

1340
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:59,200
I will give JJ Abrams credit because in in 2009 Star Trek it has sabotage playing from by the

1341
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:04,480
Beastie Boys and it does make sense that people would be listening to music that happened after

1342
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:10,400
1930 because that had not happened in Star Trek yet where it's like everyone likes there's a

1343
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:19,440
scene in Star Trek 9 I believe or 10 no I think it's 9 where to jog data's memory Picard starts

1344
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,800
singing Gilbert and Sullivan.

1345
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:27,840
It's the opening of the movie I believe with like and it's insane it's insane.

1346
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:32,880
That's like a running thing through Aaron Sork through like West Wing and Studio 60 is like

1347
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:39,040
Gilbert and Sullivan route and that's truly what like uh hoity-toity like this is what smart people

1348
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:45,280
think is funny and it's it's fine it's its own little thing but it's it's not fun.

1349
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:51,440
One of my favorite things about Cap maybe my favorite thing in Captain Marvel was the scroll

1350
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,520
makeup. Yeah.

1351
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:57,040
Because it looked like junkie next generation aliens.

1352
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:57,680
Yeah I like that.

1353
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,760
I am just I love so much.

1354
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,360
Oh it's a little like sloppy.

1355
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:06,000
Yeah and he's like the suit is a little it's a Ben Mendelsohn and he's like real clunky in the

1356
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:12,320
suit and like it's real fun and there's a point and it's kind of out of tone of the movie but he

1357
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:18,720
like takes a drink from like a soda cup that's an alien and I'm like oh this is good I like this.

1358
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,240
Sounds like Game of Thrones now.

1359
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,680
Is he drinking Starbucks now?

1360
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,000
I'll recommend you an episode or two where there's a lot of aliens.

1361
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,840
By the way are you guys excited for JJ Abrams reboot of the HMS Pinafore?

1362
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,720
Are you really gonna make it more populous?

1363
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,080
It's just called Pinafore.

1364
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,080
Oh I like it.

1365
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,080
Yeah.

1366
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,640
Got a lot more stunts now.

1367
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,840
A lot of lens flare.

1368
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:53,040
Okay so yeah in your crew is an ancestor of Picard you gotta stay away from the Klingons who they

1369
01:07:53,040 --> 01:08:00,640
call in and yell at you Korath. Korath is played by Von Armstrong who so Korath is in other things

1370
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:04,640
but Von Armstrong is in many Star Trek shows seemingly.

1371
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:05,200
Yes.

1372
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:11,120
And also just really fast he is in an episode of the show Eagle Heart directed by our friend Jason

1373
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:17,040
Wallner the episode Tramps. I'm just gonna leave this as a clue to anyone listening just watch

1374
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:23,680
find the episode Tramps of Eagle Heart it is very relevant to our interests and theme parks and I

1375
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:24,320
don't want to spoil it.

1376
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:28,480
And Von is the father of Jace Armstrong a guy we know.

1377
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,680
What? Oh I still remember that.

1378
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:30,880
Did you not know that?

1379
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:31,360
No.

1380
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,000
You didn't know that?

1381
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,560
I did not.

1382
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,040
Wow.

1383
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,640
So she produced anything on Nathan for you among other things and performed at UCB.

1384
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,760
Yeah Jace is an improv guy very funny guy and a friend of ours.

1385
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,800
His dad is Von Armstrong.

1386
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,920
It seemed like Von Armstrong also on Decker so he's on like all the funny shows.

1387
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:55,040
Yeah he's on he holds some sort of Star Trek record of like most of guest stars appearances.

1388
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:55,360
He's been on the most series.

1389
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:57,360
And has like different characters and stuff.

1390
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:57,840
Wow.

1391
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,360
And he does all the cons and stuff.

1392
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,800
Yeah he does the con circuit.

1393
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,200
Wow I'm so glad I brought up his name.

1394
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:03,840
That's crazy.

1395
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,240
Yeah.

1396
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:04,880
Very cool.

1397
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,360
Look up Eagle Heart Tramps Von Armstrong is great in this.

1398
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:11,840
He's it's a fun Klingon performance because you can't really bring it to be a Klingon.

1399
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,800
You need the most like just screamy, yelly, scene chewing.

1400
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:17,920
It's a lot of fun.

1401
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,400
Maybe that's what I'm gonna look up.

1402
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,000
I need to look up Korath episodes.

1403
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,040
I'm not sure where Korath might be a Deep Space Nine or a Voyager.

1404
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,000
I'm not totally sure.

1405
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,920
Years later I'm for whatever reason now there's a Star Trek fan yelling at me and being like

1406
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,280
you're a fraud because I can't think of what episode Korath is on.

1407
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,960
There's a lot of great Klingon characters.

1408
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,520
Christopher Lloyd plays a Klingon in Star Trek 3.

1409
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:37,920
Oh.

1410
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:38,800
Which is really great.

1411
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:43,520
And then Christopher Plummer plays a Klingon in 6.

1412
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,080
Really?

1413
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,880
So you got a bunch of great character reactors.

1414
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,560
I think my way in is Korath because I love theme park specific characters

1415
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,160
and if I could get more sweet sweet Korath that's my in.

1416
01:09:55,120 --> 01:10:00,320
But he explains like we gotta get you guys back to your time.

1417
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,920
We're gonna try to lose the Klingons in a nearby nebula.

1418
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,880
Seems like a good plan to me if there is one nearby.

1419
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:12,480
And at this point you're like that's where you are ushered to the real ship that is not a

1420
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,400
simulator because we dealt with that.

1421
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,000
This is where now in a real spaceship.

1422
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:22,400
And during which you watch a different pre-ride video but this one's more futurey.

1423
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:28,160
And when it starts it's in the wrong language and Jordy who's doing the narration

1424
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:31,120
has to flip it into English and like ah there we go.

1425
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:31,280
Right.

1426
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,800
Which is a fun little moment.

1427
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:37,200
I just want to say Korath first appears on the ride and then does show up.

1428
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,240
He was in the ride first?

1429
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:38,800
Yes.

1430
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,720
Yes that's the best combo.

1431
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:44,560
If you take ride mythology and take it into a show or a movie.

1432
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,720
And then he was on Voyager and they brought Korath back.

1433
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:49,680
Korath back yeah.

1434
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,880
All right I'm looking up Korath.

1435
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,560
Jace was a full producer on Nathan for you.

1436
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,240
Hey all right good work.

1437
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,040
Yeah great.

1438
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,120
Good show.

1439
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,040
Hey here's something it's not good do you know the name of the ship that you get on

1440
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,800
in the in the.

1441
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,080
Yeah the goddard.

1442
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,040
It's called the goddard.

1443
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,080
It's the goddard.

1444
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:08,880
Fuck you goddard.

1445
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,360
Fuck you.

1446
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,080
Stop putting your stamp on everything.

1447
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,040
So that's not good but the video is fun.

1448
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:20,720
And then the ride itself it's more like back to the future.

1449
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:25,440
Than Star Tours in that there is a screen that is stationary and separate from the vehicle

1450
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,160
that you're on.

1451
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:32,320
But the vehicle itself is like it's like it's like if Star Tours had a open roof.

1452
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,760
It was a convertible.

1453
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,560
And it shakes around and gets like a pretty severe degree of motion.

1454
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,160
It seems like it could do a lot.

1455
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,600
But it's sort of a more back to the future ride vibe.

1456
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,320
I don't have a lot to say about the ride itself.

1457
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,760
It does the ride seems a little more like CGI goopy.

1458
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,000
Yes.

1459
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,080
But it seems plenty neat though.

1460
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:54,560
Right.

1461
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,120
Yeah.

1462
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:58,000
And like a fun little like action thing to end.

1463
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:58,320
Yeah.

1464
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:58,880
Absolutely.

1465
01:11:58,880 --> 01:11:59,280
Yeah.

1466
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,560
You go through a wormhole.

1467
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,160
I forget everything that happened on the way.

1468
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,080
But you're like being you're running around.

1469
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:08,720
They built so many corridors and the square footage of this thing is massive.

1470
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:12,320
The turbo lift I think there's a little scene in that too as well.

1471
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,560
Like that you got it under attack and it like shakes.

1472
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,640
And like that's a whole different.

1473
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:17,760
Sort of like Journey to the Center of the Earth.

1474
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,840
I was going to say yeah like Journey to the Center of the Earth.

1475
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,480
Yeah.

1476
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,760
Shaking elevator.

1477
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:26,160
And that's all and it's all crazy like and then and then doors open and then another person like

1478
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,520
okay now you got to get over here.

1479
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,480
They create this frenzy that is a lot of fun.

1480
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:30,720
Yeah.

1481
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,680
And a little confusing.

1482
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,960
What direction am I going now?

1483
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:33,680
Yeah it is a haunt.

1484
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:34,400
It is a haunt.

1485
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:34,720
Mm hmm.

1486
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,360
It's like and then they make it more of a haunt.

1487
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:41,520
And I wonder how similar Rise of the Resistance especially is going to be to this.

1488
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:47,120
Well we I mean we know kind of how what the gist is for it and it's very similar.

1489
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,840
It's in different orders I think of what happens.

1490
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,040
When it opens in 2025.

1491
01:12:55,040 --> 01:13:02,720
Spoiler alert though you get on some sort of a ship first that sounds like a platform much like

1492
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:07,680
the elevator or something where you're all standing in a ship and it shakes a little bit but you're

1493
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,880
like seeing a screen.

1494
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,280
It's the first thing I went to when it was said like it's a ride but also there's these other parts.

1495
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:13,760
Yeah.

1496
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,760
That sounds like Star Trek experience to me.

1497
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,960
Yeah and then you get off that.

1498
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,200
Walked in another queue and then you get on the official like ride vehicle.

1499
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,840
But I think there's fun nonsense to be had in between everything and.

1500
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,340
Yeah.

1501
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:32,400
Unlike Star Trek experience it doesn't seem like Rise of the Resistance will take you ultimately

1502
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,000
to modern Las Vegas.

1503
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:34,320
Yes.

1504
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:34,720
No.

1505
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,880
Because you go back through time.

1506
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,360
You go back in time to your time.

1507
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,520
But you didn't lose the Klingons.

1508
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,400
No they followed you.

1509
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,120
So you're avoiding a Klingon ship but over current strip.

1510
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,560
You started Excalibur.

1511
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,080
You soar over MGM Grand.

1512
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:56,240
There's an MGM Grand marquee where you can see a sign for FX which I'm so I need to look into this.

1513
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:00,480
It was some show that like who's in it Michael Crawford and David Cassidy.

1514
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,600
It's some weird like futuristic magic show that seems insane.

1515
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,680
It was at the MGM Grand forever.

1516
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,520
Oh man we need to find that.

1517
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,000
There's yeah.

1518
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,240
Oh you know what similar to that also long time residency at the

1519
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,480
Las Vegas Hilton Starlight Express.

1520
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:15,680
Wow.

1521
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,120
The train musical.

1522
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:17,760
Of course.

1523
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:18,160
Yes.

1524
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,880
And yeah like on a massive scale.

1525
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:22,800
Yeah.

1526
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,880
Which it has to be to fit all those roller skaters.

1527
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,880
Such a perfect Vegas musical.

1528
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:27,280
Yeah.

1529
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:27,600
Yeah.

1530
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,480
We'll get to wait.

1531
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:28,800
Yeah.

1532
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:29,600
We'll do Starlight Express.

1533
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,320
If anybody's excited about Starlight Express it's coming.

1534
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:32,880
I am.

1535
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,200
Yeah.

1536
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:42,160
So MGM Grand marquee you also see an ad for a Mike Tyson fight and I looked it up and this

1537
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:46,800
would have opened in the precise window when Mike Tyson was banned from fighting because

1538
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,320
he bit off Holyfield's ear.

1539
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:48,640
Wow.

1540
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,120
Wow.

1541
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,800
At the MGM Grand I believe.

1542
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,840
So incorrect.

1543
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,520
Got to dock points there.

1544
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,960
You could not have seen a Mike Tyson fight.

1545
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:57,120
Right.

1546
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,000
Impossible.

1547
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,200
You also you pass by my favorite part you pass by a different marquee for another hotel

1548
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:06,480
that is advertising a concert by the Moody Blues.

1549
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,520
This is in a ride.

1550
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:07,920
Nice.

1551
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:14,240
Thus making it the first of two Moody Blues related theme park attractions.

1552
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:14,480
Right.

1553
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,360
Second being the Knights in White Saffron ride.

1554
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,520
I had no idea what a pioneer this was.

1555
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,000
Wow.

1556
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,800
More Moody Blues interactive content please.

1557
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,560
Video games avoid.

1558
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,360
It's up to them.

1559
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,280
Use your property wisely.

1560
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,040
TV shows based on their songs.

1561
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:31,680
Absolutely.

1562
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,960
Show for each song.

1563
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:33,520
Yes.

1564
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,320
Disney Plus.

1565
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:34,880
Get on it.

1566
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:35,440
Buy the Moody Blues.

1567
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,120
You own so many great properties.

1568
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,240
Buy the Moody Blues.

1569
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:41,200
JJ Abrams reboot just called Satin.

1570
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,440
That's a number one thing he gets in there.

1571
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,800
He shaves off words.

1572
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,560
That's his home renovation style.

1573
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,680
And then you end up back at the Las Vegas Hilton which really makes me smile.

1574
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:58,960
You're just looking at like a hotel brand name in this ride and then you crash into the sign.

1575
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,680
Very important they say we're going to get you back to those simulators.

1576
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,800
Remember that you're about to get on we're going to take you back there

1577
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:09,120
and then you crash into the Hilton sign and because by then Back to the Future ride has happened

1578
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:13,360
it's very important that you just crash into logos that you recognize.

1579
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,880
But why would they not like lower you.

1580
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,240
You would have to fuck up the hotel.

1581
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,760
It should be a gentle landing.

1582
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:20,240
Yeah.

1583
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,280
But that's fine.

1584
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,480
It's fun we know.

1585
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,880
But then you're like traveling down the shaft and that's when you hear the voice of Picard

1586
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,920
and you know that he has been restored to the timeline.

1587
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,000
The ancestor is safe and he is safe.

1588
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:37,520
And he says a funny little monologue the part of which the gist is

1589
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:42,480
only one of you is my ancestor but each of you guards the future.

1590
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:44,960
So funny.

1591
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:45,600
Yeah.

1592
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,400
So silly.

1593
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,400
And I just hope that ancestor has a good life.

1594
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:55,280
I wish the Picard bloodline a happy history.

1595
01:16:55,280 --> 01:17:00,000
I like the idea that Picard has so many different relatives that there's just one in each group.

1596
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,920
Just by the way it breaks down.

1597
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:02,800
Oh yeah.

1598
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,240
Every single tourist group.

1599
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,400
Yeah well we're talking like 200 a day.

1600
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:06,960
Yeah.

1601
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,800
Yep every day 365.

1602
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:17,360
Some horny Picard was past Picard was getting busy all over the nation.

1603
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:17,860
Yeah.

1604
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:23,120
Another great thing after you leave is that the TV's were playing

1605
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,720
a news report of UFO sightings over Las Vegas.

1606
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,840
What I didn't know that.

1607
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:28,480
Yeah.

1608
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:32,720
So you would get like a little thing that was I don't know if it was at the bar it would just

1609
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:39,280
say like you know unknown objects or yeah we're flying over Las Vegas.

1610
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,440
That's so fun that's like the Men in Black ride.

1611
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:41,760
Yeah.

1612
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,520
There's like a blackout and you justify oh here's what this was and.

1613
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,200
Yeah that's a very fun detail.

1614
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,320
Really fun.

1615
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,520
Wow this is great.

1616
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:50,320
Yeah.

1617
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,680
Fun experience.

1618
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:57,680
The only yeah the only thing I would prefer Quarks bar to be real but that's minor

1619
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,240
because people were dressed up as like Ferengi and.

1620
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,800
Yeah so why is that then why is there a Ferengi walking around.

1621
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:06,880
Right I guess that's just like this is the fun goo fever and these are actors and they're dressed

1622
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,520
up as these alien characters.

1623
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:14,000
Sure sure but yeah you're led into the well at this point it's you go through the history of

1624
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,840
the future museum which has a bunch of Star Trek or like memorabilia probably the largest

1625
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,080
standing collection of Star Trek memorabilia.

1626
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:27,280
There's a lot of like boring details in the video of like this wasn't on camera

1627
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:31,200
but it's a replica it is photo ready but it was not photographed.

1628
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:36,000
Right this feels like this feels like what you would expect the experience to be you'd expect

1629
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,080
a Vegas Star Trek thing to be like you walk through and there's some props and there's a video.

1630
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,120
And it's only that sure.

1631
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:47,360
It's that there's a Marvel thing now in Vegas that I know has like some like Hulkbuster suit

1632
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,960
or whatever but I feel like that will be underwhelming.

1633
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,520
Who is the spooling that doesn't seem like.

1634
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:58,400
Yeah and it's like there's an interactive games for kids and I'm like these games will not be fun

1635
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,160
for man in his 30s.

1636
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,360
I guess I'll have to go to.

1637
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:07,760
I will give you money but I won't fully enjoy it.

1638
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,160
I want fun for all ages.

1639
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:15,360
Not only I guess we should back up and say that it's in 2004 they added a second attraction.

1640
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:22,480
Oh yes the Borg invasion 40 and I don't know a lot about this I watched a video it's a

1641
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:27,360
little harder to ascertain what's going on but feel free.

1642
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:32,800
Yeah I mean this is I mean it's it's very similar to the thing to the other one so they basically

1643
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:38,640
it seems like they peeled off two of the bridges or two of the excuse I'm trying to remember

1644
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,320
they basically whatever the capacity for the Klingon version of it was.

1645
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,440
It took some of it away.

1646
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:47,440
Take two of them away and made them the Borg so there would be two different versions you could

1647
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:51,840
go on it would be the Klingon version and the Borg version and the Borg version was

1648
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,440
a true haunt.

1649
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,160
Yeah this is unnerving.

1650
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:02,240
Yeah this is like true like this is Horror Nights it's not fully well maybe it's close.

1651
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:07,200
I mean it's scary cast members get assimilated you know cast members get assimilated so let's

1652
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,480
talk quickly about the Borg.

1653
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:11,760
10 minutes later.

1654
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:12,480
Hour later.

1655
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:20,160
The Borg scared the shit out of me as a kid I was so goddamn scared of the Borg of all the bad guys

1656
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:20,800
on the show.

1657
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,760
What's the Borg?

1658
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:27,600
So the Borg are basically like robot men essentially robot men and women so they have like

1659
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,200
weird do you know what they look like?

1660
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:29,920
Yeah yeah I watched it.

1661
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,720
Okay so you know they have things over their eyes with little like lights and basically

1662
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:40,080
basically what will happen is if a Borg beams onto the ship you can shoot them with your phasers

1663
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:44,000
like for a couple seconds and then they assimilate to the frequency and then there's

1664
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,040
like a little shield so they keep assimilating and changing and then basically if they get to

1665
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:55,040
you it's like a zombie or a vampire and they just put their little hands that have little

1666
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:59,520
tendrils and they just go into your neck and they start assimilating you.

1667
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,560
They're parasites.

1668
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,520
They're like techno parasites.

1669
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,520
So it's a zombie thing happening too.

1670
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:09,600
Zombie thing and then they put like they fully assimilate you on their Borg cube which is a

1671
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,360
scary cube ship.

1672
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,720
I was scared of the ship.

1673
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:15,200
And that's in the ride or the 4D experience.

1674
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,120
In the ride.

1675
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:21,680
And then on their ship it's a very like dark and like just like platforms and these like

1676
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:27,200
charging stations for the new Borg so like there's just people kind of like this like

1677
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:32,880
zombies or mummies essentially and they're like charging them up as they fully become Borg.

1678
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:33,440
This is cool.

1679
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,080
This sounds very scary.

1680
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,000
It's very cool very scary.

1681
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,520
Picard famously was assimilated in one of the episodes at the

1682
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,360
Best of Both Worlds is the episode.

1683
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:45,440
Am I wrong about that?

1684
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:46,320
Am I going to get yelled at?

1685
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:48,320
Let me just look that up.

1686
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,840
You better drop everything and find out.

1687
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,280
Wait wait what happens to him?

1688
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,440
He gets assimilated and then how do they?

1689
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:54,800
So that's it's a cliffhanger.

1690
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:58,240
They end the season with Picard assimilated.

1691
01:21:58,240 --> 01:21:59,920
Oh no what a great cliffhanger.

1692
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:05,520
Riker has to figure out if it's worth going in to save Picard or not because this could

1693
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:10,000
be a bad idea so of course they ultimately decide to do it and they get him back and

1694
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:17,040
then they follow this plot thread through for Star Trek First Contact which Picard is like

1695
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:22,400
haunted by the Borg and they introduce the Borg Queen which is a very sexy character,

1696
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:29,600
very horny character and to tie it into theme parks highly influenced by Angelica Houston

1697
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,800
from Captain EO.

1698
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,160
You think influenced by?

1699
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:32,720
100%.

1700
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,000
Wow.

1701
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,280
She has.

1702
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,320
She shows up in this.

1703
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,160
She shows up in the Borg invasion.

1704
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,120
Oh that's that like.

1705
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,160
That's the villain.

1706
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:40,400
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1707
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,520
The Borg Queen.

1708
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:46,160
So it's like half she's like half body and she comes down when there's all these things.

1709
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:46,320
Oh yeah.

1710
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:49,280
Like it's 100% Captain EO.

1711
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,560
All right there we go.

1712
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:57,440
There's a tie in there and so they follow that plot thread through into that movie.

1713
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:57,760
Okay.

1714
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:01,920
So the idea of being in a place where the Borgs are following you.

1715
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:07,360
Being in a place where the Borg I think especially me in 2007 maybe I wasn't ready to handle it

1716
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:10,480
honestly because I'm such a such a brave man now.

1717
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:14,480
In 2007 maybe I would have been too scared to confront the Borg.

1718
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:15,920
I think I can now.

1719
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:20,880
So the premise of this is that you have been taken on to the the medical bay

1720
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:25,840
of the Deep Space Nine station and the doctor what is the doctor's name?

1721
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:26,560
Just the doctor.

1722
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:30,080
I mean he eventually gets a name but he's mostly it's the doctor he's a hologram.

1723
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:30,400
Oh.

1724
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:33,360
He's played by Robert Picardo another great character actor.

1725
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:37,200
He's a great character he's just very funny in this and he's like we think

1726
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:44,640
you all seem to have the genes that can like counteract the Borg infections so we may be able

1727
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:47,920
to figure out some sort of antidote from you and then.

1728
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,960
We have that and we're Picard's ancestors?

1729
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:51,440
Well it's different.

1730
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:52,640
It's different.

1731
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:53,280
It's different.

1732
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:58,800
Because they're like separate I think they're self-contained stories.

1733
01:23:58,800 --> 01:23:59,280
Okay.

1734
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,240
Oh no certainly but positive you did them both back to back.

1735
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:02,640
Good point.

1736
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:03,120
Good science.

1737
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:03,920
That's funny who does it.

1738
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:04,640
Someone might.

1739
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:07,040
He's a Picard ancestor who's an anti-Borg.

1740
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:10,800
So then of course the Borg shows up because they can't have any of that and then

1741
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:21,760
they start attacking the ship and suck the wing you are in onto the Borg ship and then

1742
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:22,960
they come and save you.

1743
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:28,960
And you're going through like corridors again but this time they're lit much scarier

1744
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:35,840
it's a lot more it's got it's a much more of like a scary Dalyan vibe and you end up ultimately

1745
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:39,760
seeing a 4D movie that ties the plot up.

1746
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:40,080
Yeah.

1747
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:44,080
But until that point yeah you end up like you're being chased by a couple of them.

1748
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:46,560
Crew members get yeah taken over by them.

1749
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,680
Whoa a person gets sucked into the ceiling that looks awesome.

1750
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:50,240
They're on a.

1751
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:51,120
Easy looking.

1752
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:55,200
Yeah they're on like a little lift essentially and then they get like taken into the ceiling

1753
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,840
there's another person I think gets pulled into the wall

1754
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,800
there's a couple there's another effect like that too.

1755
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,240
A lot of red shirts eating it.

1756
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,840
Famously the red shirts in Star Trek always die.

1757
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,480
Oh okay but like the generic people that you know.

1758
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:08,560
Yes.

1759
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:09,920
Really now yeah okay.

1760
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:15,120
That was mostly on the first series and then they of course I think they sent it up in the

1761
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,320
first JJ Star Trek.

1762
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:17,920
Something like that.

1763
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:21,040
There's like a red shirt guy he like dies immediately.

1764
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:21,280
Okay.

1765
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:24,480
He like jumps off I think it's when they skydive off of that giant drill.

1766
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,840
Yeah he eats it.

1767
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:28,640
I want to watch all of these things so bad right now.

1768
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:32,960
I'm so excited I want to watch the JJ one I want to watch all of next gen.

1769
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:34,880
I'm getting so excited.

1770
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:39,440
We're gonna have to pause and watch eight movies and then keep going pause and.

1771
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,240
Okay we're back.

1772
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:47,600
So and then what like this also was a little similarly without being there it was really

1773
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:53,360
hard to gather what Borg 4D the movie was all about.

1774
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:58,960
Yeah it seems a little like wonkier graphic wise than the other thing.

1775
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:03,360
Yeah the other thing I think is probably a better the Klingon version I think is probably

1776
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,240
better but.

1777
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:08,560
If you consider this like here's a B not a B ticket a D ticket as opposed to it.

1778
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,640
This is a major E ticket attraction.

1779
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:13,600
This is Monsters After Dark Guardians of the Galaxy.

1780
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,680
This is just a little bit of an extra fun theory.

1781
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:18,800
Yeah side attraction yeah but it's cool seems cool.

1782
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:21,920
It's very cool this was in 2004 right we said that.

1783
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:27,600
So that that they're still adding stuff and that to the Museum of the Future they're

1784
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:32,400
updating it to acknowledge Voyager and Enterprise that even more that even later on.

1785
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:32,640
Right.

1786
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:34,240
Newer show.

1787
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:39,440
It feels like they're I mean Star Trek was on the way out a little bit at this point

1788
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:43,760
but it does feel like there was just a rights situate like a deal hadn't been reached.

1789
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,920
It feels like there was a chance they could have.

1790
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:50,960
Well that's what they wanted it to try and get it reopened somewhere else in 2009 to

1791
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,880
coincide with the Chris Pine movie.

1792
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:53,440
Right.

1793
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:58,000
And that got pushed back and then in 2011 they were finally just like we lost.

1794
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,280
It's not happening.

1795
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:03,680
Yeah it seems unclear why it stopped happening at the Hilton specifically.

1796
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:09,440
It seemed like it seemed like it was just like allusions to like Cedar Fair said that

1797
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,320
the Hilton did not meet the terms of the contract.

1798
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:18,000
Maybe they weren't pumping in as much money as they needed to be or keeping it up or

1799
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,560
there was just some maintenance issue and Cedar Fair maybe thought we could get this

1800
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,600
moved elsewhere and keep the quality high.

1801
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:26,320
Right.

1802
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:36,240
But unfortunately they took it to a place called Neonopolis which is I think I could

1803
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:41,680
be wrong about this I think oddly my guess is that this is a strip mall that was built on the land

1804
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:46,800
that was intended for the Enterprise back in 92 or at least around there kind of at the end of

1805
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,400
Fremont Street.

1806
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:48,900
Right.

1807
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:54,960
And I got interested in Neonopolis a couple years ago and like oh I should go walk around there and

1808
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:01,360
I started walking up to it and it was as if meth zombies were like coming out of it.

1809
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:04,560
It was exactly like the Borg now that you say it.

1810
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:10,240
It was I feel like there was literally mist and then they start just like lurching forward.

1811
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:13,120
It felt very video gamey like what's that?

1812
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,000
Is that a friend?

1813
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,040
No no kill it.

1814
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:21,920
It was so scary instantly it's like really it's the end of where Vegas is an acceptable place to be.

1815
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:30,400
And so this is a mall that does exist there's stuff there they got that novelty heart attack

1816
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:36,160
grill you know where you get weighed and they you're in a hospital gown and I think there's a

1817
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:41,040
thing there's a waitress thing there too like they put it mean yeah like this is like I'm gonna put a

1818
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:41,840
needle in your butt.

1819
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:47,200
Everything's famously unhealthy and I think oh if you're over a certain number of pounds you can

1820
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:47,920
eat for free.

1821
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:53,360
Jason would you let a woman put a needle in you at heart attack grill?

1822
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:58,720
I mean I like I have a vitamin B shot yeah I have at a doctor like when I've been sick with

1823
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,080
the flu or something.

1824
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:03,680
I don't know that I do that at a place called the heart attack grill.

1825
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:07,680
What's funny is that I know that you get vitamin B shots.

1826
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:12,560
You talk about it like that I like the hyperbaric chamber.

1827
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,240
I want to get in a hyperbaric chamber real bad.

1828
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,440
You want to do that so bad.

1829
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,400
Like Michael Jackson?

1830
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,200
Yeah but it healed.

1831
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,080
Did he do that?

1832
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,640
Oh yeah he did but it healed I mean I don't know if it worked for him.

1833
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,400
It's keeping Quincy Jones young.

1834
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,000
It healed Daniel Bryan's concussions.

1835
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,440
Yeah it healed Daniel Bryan.

1836
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,880
He can wrestle again because of it.

1837
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,920
Joe Namath swears by them too.

1838
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,600
Well and then there's well you know what there's something else that

1839
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,960
can maybe help heal the old brain up.

1840
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:42,000
You could go at Neonopolis you could check out Bongzilla the world's largest bond.

1841
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,360
Yes I should go to Bongzilla this week.

1842
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,160
Yeah hey go check out Bongzilla.

1843
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:50,000
I don't know if you can use Bongzilla.

1844
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,120
My guess is no.

1845
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,960
I don't want anything to do with marijuana.

1846
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:56,640
I bet you can buy a small replica of Bongzilla.

1847
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:00,240
You can buy a small world's largest.

1848
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:05,680
I believe Bongzilla came along when they was it pre-legalization because it is recreationally

1849
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:07,520
legal in Nevada I think now.

1850
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,240
Oh it is?

1851
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:08,640
Okay.

1852
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:13,280
If you're listening to this right now I may be staring at Bongzilla in real time.

1853
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,280
That's maybe what's happening.

1854
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:18,000
Navigate yourself while listening to this to Bongzilla.

1855
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,680
You might be planted right there right now.

1856
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:26,560
There's also a Denny's with a wedding chapel so Neonopolis is just like novelty city and there

1857
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:32,320
was a moment where they were maybe going to have the Star Trek experience and where the

1858
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:38,320
owners were just talking as if yep it's coming it's coming and it never came and it was starting

1859
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:43,040
to be you know like you said they were trying to get it opened in 2009 for the JJ movie and

1860
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:48,080
then nothing had happened by 2010 there was just an auction where they sold off everything

1861
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:52,640
from the history of the future museum and like the captain's chair so that is all in the hands

1862
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:56,800
of various collectors at this point so they couldn't reopen the thing if they wanted to.

1863
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:00,560
And anything that didn't sell they just destroyed.

1864
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:01,200
Really?

1865
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:01,920
That's what I saw.

1866
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:10,800
But in a nicer thing they did decommission the attraction and the longest serving actor

1867
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:15,280
the person who had been there the longest there was a banner that had flown over it and they're

1868
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:21,200
like according with naval decommission you are entitled to and they folded it up and gave it

1869
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:25,280
to her and I believe she was playing a Vulcan and she was in character and when they're like

1870
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:32,000
we're giving you this as the longest serving crew member she starts like crying it's a very emotional

1871
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,200
moment and she.

1872
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,160
Understandably.

1873
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:40,080
But like yeah they had people there from the show they did do a big close a big grand finale.

1874
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,280
That's nice of them.

1875
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:44,800
And I like when they do that they feel like they did that they they sent off

1876
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:48,720
back to the future ride with a little ceremony and it's yeah it's nice when

1877
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,560
something's acknowledged in that way.

1878
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:56,080
Can I just say one more thing about Neonopolis that like it's a shame that the Star Trek

1879
01:31:56,080 --> 01:32:00,400
experience ultimately like fell victim to Vegas shadiness because like this is a thing where like

1880
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:06,080
it seems like the main developer is shady and the city was not sure if they wanted Neonopolis

1881
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:06,720
there at all.

1882
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:10,480
He's promised all this stuff and owes all these taxes but then within that there was another

1883
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:15,760
like a separate shady guy who opened a couple businesses one of which was something called

1884
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:21,440
Crave Massive which was billing itself as what would be the world's largest gay nightclub

1885
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:26,640
and the space that they were going to use for a Crave Massive was a movie theater that the other

1886
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:33,600
shitty owner like ran into the ground because it was I mean a bad movie theater all the regular

1887
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,600
stuff went wrong but also it stopped having air conditioning you know in Vegas in the summer.

1888
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:42,640
So we're going to take a dilapidated movie theater and turn it into the world's largest

1889
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:47,760
gay nightclub which technically square footage wise it was except that they only opened you

1890
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:53,040
know two of the rooms which were former movie theaters and they didn't change the sign so it

1891
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:56,480
just said like theater two and then that was a dance floor.

1892
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:04,640
You'd go into the various rooms and drinks would be wildly different prices between like a vodka

1893
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:09,520
soda is six dollars more in theater one than it is in theater three.

1894
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:14,560
They said really big on the website we validate parking and then you'd get there and they would

1895
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:22,800
not. This thing is such a funny disaster. The guy who built it like had people overlooked the fact

1896
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:29,920
that he had years prior done jail time because he used his seven-year-old son's social security

1897
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:35,760
number to get seventy thousand dollars in bank loans in San Antonio went to jail for a year.

1898
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:39,920
Somehow this guy's still yes Vegas do whatever you want. He's in the Trump cabinet now.

1899
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:45,280
That's the shit that gets you into like secretary of something. He's incoming secretary. He'll be

1900
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:50,640
organizing the Iran efforts but anyway and this is a fucking disaster in the thing like you know

1901
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:56,000
they owed seven hundred thousand dollars to the city but my favorite thing about this club is that

1902
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:04,240
so they had foam parties reasonable thing for a nightclub to have but keep in mind the all of

1903
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:10,640
the dance floors were built out of former movie theaters movie theaters slope they slope to one

1904
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:17,040
corner and they didn't fix that so all of the foam would just pool on one end of the floor

1905
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:22,480
and you'd be in there trying to dance and then just like slightly drift over to the bottom.

1906
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,000
Oh my god that's insane.

1907
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:30,640
The insane is yes how was this allowed to be built and on top of that oh so if I get in though will

1908
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:36,080
it be a nice experience no you will be charged radically different price somebody described

1909
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:39,840
this is almost too awful to say somebody described like we went in there and we got in the elevator

1910
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:46,960
and my boyfriend leaned up against the wall and it was just covered in lube the wall why so neon

1911
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:52,480
neon crave massive at neon opolis hell on earth what could have been how these things never would

1912
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:57,520
have sat next to each other they're gonna do a top tier cedar fair theme park experience next to a

1913
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:05,440
lube elevator mike mike and i also ended up at a we've been to a party together what but not on

1914
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:11,920
purpose it was we went to the it was the only bar left open like in that strip of los feliz silver

1915
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:15,840
lake like that it was a long weekend i remember it was like memorial day or president's day or

1916
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:21,040
something like that all the other bars are closed that one was still open and it had an empty patio

1917
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:24,720
the patio was totally empty and we're like oh let's just go in and get some beers and go out

1918
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:29,360
on the patio we walked inside we didn't say we didn't know anything about the patio necessarily

1919
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:32,960
i could see i'm just saying like we didn't go there because we're gonna go to the patio i was

1920
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:37,520
just like oh we're gonna go home party no we didn't it was still open and we walked in and there was a

1921
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:42,000
phone party and when you were not prepared for a phone when you're just trying to buy some coronas

1922
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:49,680
a phone party when you're not dressed for it or not there intending it it's just a slip and fall

1923
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:54,880
hazard because everything is so soapy and we literally went and we got our drinks at the bar

1924
01:35:54,880 --> 01:36:00,560
went out to the patio but like yeah we're just kind of like stepping over fove and stuff what's

1925
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:04,960
interesting it was in my old neighborhood and it's just down by the it was it used to be it's now a

1926
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:11,360
different place it was right by that trader joe's and uh it's i hadn't we had never been there i and

1927
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:16,000
i wasn't someone's like oh you know mj's open and mj's is a gay bar and i go oh yeah we haven't we've

1928
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:20,160
never been in there so let's just go down there it's open so we went in there and it was a fucking

1929
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:25,280
party man i didn't realize that a party on that street like that street's relatively quiet i mean

1930
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:31,200
there's a few bars and stuff but it's not across from the former disney uh that's where snow white

1931
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:37,120
was animated where that now there's snow white foam so we walked in and like everyone is like

1932
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:42,160
almost naked like they have underwear on and they're shirtless and yeah we walked in the

1933
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:47,200
foam party one a.m on a sunday night and like we went into the bathroom and the guys are like

1934
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:53,120
why aren't you in the foam because everyone's soaking wet and soapy like there was not a we

1935
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:58,320
were the only like clothed people we were like yeah so we went onto the porch because yeah everybody

1936
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:03,680
was like i mean do i don't think we ever considered well maybe we should just take the shirts off and

1937
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:08,560
try yeah find the final log everybody yeah you're near your apartment just like head back grab some

1938
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:13,760
flip flops and some scuba gear if you want if everyone was on board maybe i could have been

1939
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:18,880
convinced it seems but even the people there for the foam party as like they're like you know the

1940
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:24,800
last call we're closing up you know everyone is almost eating shit everyone is almost falling even

1941
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:31,520
the people who came prepared are almost slipping yeah so i guess we're coming out with a stance

1942
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:38,480
against surprise foam parties plan home party's great again it seems like yeah it does you just

1943
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:43,680
got to prepare for it yeah i think it would have been good if it said if there was like a like you

1944
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:48,960
know how a hotel has a vacancy sign or an apartment as vacancy if it just was foam party lit up there's

1945
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:53,760
a neon foam party sign you just light it up to me and put it outside so we know when we're getting

1946
01:37:53,760 --> 01:38:00,000
in there we're about to walk into a foam party foam today foam today yes or no foam today it's

1947
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,280
a vacancy situation yeah right the the funniest current client of neon opulence is that is where

1948
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:11,520
the telemundo affiliate is now in the las vegas telemundo affiliate is also on the third floor

1949
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:18,960
of neon opulence functional business functional business studio confusing yes sloping foam

1950
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:25,680
parties an axe throwing one of those ax throwing ranges yeah yeah what a weird that's neon opulence

1951
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:30,320
is where vegas goes to die and it is where the star trek experience died we need to mark

1952
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:38,000
uh confusing sloping foam parties for the intro to this episode yeah yeah good idea yeah uh uh but um

1953
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:43,920
hey let's back it up to bars a little bit yeah yeah you know and this is maybe a good way to close it

1954
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:48,000
uh we gotta talk a little about corks bar and grill did you guys find out stuff about corks bar and

1955
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:53,680
grill a little bit but i maybe you have more i think well i do in that i i mean i have some menu

1956
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:59,040
screenshots yeah yeah yeah is what i have okay so i'm glad you found that stuff uh i also found oh

1957
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:04,320
now i don't have it i found details of like what would happen if you got married at the uh at the

1958
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:11,200
star trek experience uh um i i read like what is like the ultimate like package yeah yeah yeah the

1959
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:17,040
commander package or whatever and you get a lot of tickets to the borgen counter you mainly get like

1960
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:22,640
a suited like so there you will have a witness there who is either a faranghi or a or a borg you

1961
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:28,960
could have a borg i think i think you could yeah if you're like a dark person i guess so yeah yeah

1962
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:35,200
you're on the gothier side what alien from star trek would you want at your wedding corath corath

1963
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:42,320
um the green one that uh kirk has to hit with a rock from the original show the one the fight

1964
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:46,960
in the yeah the fight yeah oh you're right that guy rules yeah i like that guy and it's i like

1965
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:53,040
a little figure of him mike i'm trying to it's going back and forth between i like quark himself

1966
01:39:53,600 --> 01:40:00,320
uh quark is played by this guy armin shimmerman who is just a fantastic character actor um but

1967
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:05,040
also then there's a faranghi played by wallace shawn who i'm forgetting his name on deep space nine

1968
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:10,640
and he's great because it's wallace shawn dressed as a faranghi then that being said i also like

1969
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:16,480
neelix from star trek voyager who's another weird little character actor man who's fantastic and an

1970
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:22,720
alien makeup so i'm gonna say i'm gonna say quark himself but i'll take any i'll take a faranghi

1971
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:28,320
i mean i think you would have had a generic for i don't think i know actor unless you that's the

1972
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:34,720
ultimate what's the top tier of star trek ranking uh it might be commander i don't know if you're

1973
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:39,280
the captain is number one okay but it's so then a birth admiral is sorry emperor you gotta do the

1974
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:43,360
emperor's package and they'll call they'll call the real actor for the queue package

1975
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:50,800
uh but so if you got married in the star trek experience your reception would be at quark's

1976
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:56,560
bar and grill um and you could customize the menu and we have some of the some of the items mainly

1977
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:02,160
i got especially interested in this because of this video which we'll post a link to from the

1978
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:08,800
voyager dvd uh where you get to watch the executive chef of quark's bar and grill explain how the the

1979
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:15,520
menu was landed on and he is sort of doing this at gunpoint he's a little bit uh hesitant awkward

1980
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:19,600
and just talking about you know so we you know we try to have some we get a little bit creative

1981
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:23,520
with the stuff um you know i i presented the menu and they said that's great we like that and you

1982
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:28,320
know sounds good now trek it out and i said what does that mean and they said you figure it out

1983
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:32,240
so you know that's when we came up with you know that there's like pizzas in a triangle shape or

1984
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:37,280
you know we have the hamburgers or um you know we really really checked it out um here you see the

1985
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:42,080
holy rings of betas ad uh which is you know we took the onion rings and we stacked them stacked

1986
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:47,600
them up on a pole so um you know we we have fun with the stuff and uh and then and then it cuts

1987
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:54,160
to a guy who's a lot more enthusiastic than the executive chef sorry the holy rings of betas

1988
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:59,200
what did i say didn't you say that or maybe i misheard i don't i have holy rings of betas ad

1989
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:03,120
i think i miss her written and written in my notes which is always a good thing to write down

1990
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:08,640
anywhere sorry i do like that presentation for onion rings it's very fun but i think it's funny

1991
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:14,640
that that's presented as trekking it out because i've done that at red robin not not trekked out

1992
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:21,200
as far as i know place by ucb theater birds that does that too they do it really yeah oh wow uh man

1993
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:26,800
they tracked it out um but so then you cut from this guy who like yeah so you know i was told to

1994
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:33,520
think of space and i thought of a triangle bun uh to a guy who loves it the most cheeseball

1995
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:37,840
waiter who is he is he just in a uniform i don't think he's a cling on or anything though

1996
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:42,560
you know like a cling on or a farang or you would walk up to your table at this restaurant and like

1997
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:49,120
bother you a little bit um but this guy presenting the specialist uh hey we have and we have the

1998
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:56,080
rap of con it's like a chicken fajita only it's wrapped up for you it's in a spinach tortilla

1999
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:02,560
and then he explains the hamburger uh which is ground up borg meat think of it as as borg the

2000
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:09,680
other red meat anyway uh it's oh it's the most cheeseball thing you're seeing uh and it's also

2001
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:14,720
the they also are in this video it's explained that uh there is a drink that has dilithium

2002
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:20,320
crystals in it and if you listen closely it might even belch i mean that's dangerous first of all

2003
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:26,400
dilithium crystals are what power the ship oh god they're in the warp core like that doesn't

2004
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:31,520
make any sense to have that well one of the drinks is the warp core breach is that it that's the big

2005
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:36,320
one that served for two and it's got the dry ice does that have the crystals in it well i think so

2006
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:41,200
i can read the description this is like this is from the turbo lift uh menu it says be careful

2007
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:45,520
with these cocktails they'll send you to the upper deck uh and then it's cut off from there the upper

2008
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:49,760
deck of drunkenness um this is like a tiki kind of drink where you like maybe just more than two

2009
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:55,280
people share it uh red alert order this drink and prepare to separate your saucer section

2010
01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:03,040
what so that means okay so what that means is that the enterprise nc 1701 d is able to

2011
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:08,240
separate the circle part at the top from the other ship that's the saucer section that's the saucer

2012
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:13,920
section so that's a little pretty good you know i will say this though obviously as we read these

2013
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:20,560
things i'm read they're kind of funny and cheesy i do i like that they wrote jokes yeah in the menu

2014
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:29,760
it's pretty fun in this drink five five different flavored rums razzmatazz what the fuck is that

2015
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:35,920
no and fruit juice we add pure ice crystals from the planet x-o-3 you'll need more you'll need more

2016
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:42,560
than one officer to handle this situation these drinks sound like nightmares to me i mean i i'm

2017
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:47,520
excited they are the most up mike sally and the least of mine okay i'm trying to figure out the

2018
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:56,080
economics of these drinks because the warp core breach which is for for two or more 10 ounces of

2019
01:44:56,080 --> 01:45:02,240
liquor 2950 okay so yeah all right it's a big party drink it's a big bowl it's got dry ice

2020
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:10,240
a mini warp core five ounces of liquor half as much liquor 1475 it's just straight in half okay

2021
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:15,360
it's straight in half i thought it said 475 oh i thought i was going insane and i was like

2022
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:20,720
dollars for a two-person drink it's full of razzmatazz in the late 90s that's like hell at the

2023
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:27,120
moon i think yeah i i think that's my problem with it i can let me read this other one this they don't

2024
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:34,720
elaborate a lot about the liquid latinum but these flavors fuck me spiced rum melon liqueur

2025
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:42,320
alize red passion liqueur and blue curacao will put a faranghi into a daydream about

2026
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:50,960
precious latinum bars what a nightmare several liqueurs these are these flavors are not

2027
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:56,720
you know they're not meant to be digested by human beings there's one or two cocktails on the

2028
01:45:57,360 --> 01:46:05,040
cantina menu from coming to star wars coming to the galaxy's edge yes there's one or two cocktails

2029
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:12,240
where i'm like i'm assuming you had a professional making this because like i don't know that like

2030
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:16,800
coke and bloody mary mix sounds that good or something there's some weird disparate

2031
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:22,400
flavor combinations i don't like any of this i mean like are you down with those mike melon

2032
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:27,360
liqueur and i would try it try it that could be doesn't mean you would love it because hell at

2033
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:32,160
the moon don't forget that drink sucked ass yeah it was not a good drink um but i think like a melon

2034
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:37,680
liqueur could taste like a watermelon regular rum i can see but the spiced rum is kind of rubbing

2035
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:42,080
me there i'm not sure there's no bait what i just listed there's not like one that's just regular

2036
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:48,640
because if one of the ingredients was unadorned yeah okay it's yeah it's spiced rum and it's

2037
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:54,880
watermelon whatever too many things there's a lot of things i'm skeptical yeah but it could be okay

2038
01:46:56,400 --> 01:47:01,920
it could be fine um what else are you guys seeing well i mean there's stuff on the menu that like

2039
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:08,080
like it says deep space wines which is great space wines wonder girl chief o'brien's bottle

2040
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:13,200
bruise because chief o'brien was the he was in uh the transporter room on next generation but

2041
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:18,320
then he was the engineer on deep space nine he's colmeenie that's the actor's name so he's like an

2042
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:24,080
irish guy like to drink and they they make his uh little section what position he was in the

2043
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:27,600
transporter room and then he went to what a next generation he was transporter room and then on

2044
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:32,720
deep space nine he was the engineer oh so he got a promotion so yeah sure and then and he also got

2045
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:37,200
more money because he was a regular oh that's true sorry which drink is that uh that's the whole

2046
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:42,640
section called chief o'brien's bottle bruise oh so he like they've named all the beers after

2047
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:47,920
chief miles o'brien can i read this one really fast from the deep space wine menu this would be

2048
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:56,800
my choice i think the sacred chalice the sacred chalice of ricks only wine from what but tazed

2049
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:03,520
finest grapes is acceptable for the sacred chalice of ricks personally overseen by lawaksana troy

2050
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:09,520
herself parentheses cabernet seven lawaksana troy is diana troy's mother she's played by um

2051
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:14,480
magel i always forget her name is magel barrett who is jean roddenberry's wife oh and who does

2052
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:18,880
the voice of the computer and she did it until she died a couple years ago wow but she even

2053
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:24,480
did the voice in the first jj movie oh oh so it was a little tie back and that's the voice that

2054
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:28,800
supposedly they've been working on because they've they've got so much of her voice down

2055
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:35,840
is that people want that for siri because i want that for siri oh yeah oh gotcha like but so so

2056
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:39,760
we'll see when it's good if it's ever coming it's a funny thing about this menu that like i guess

2057
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:45,440
that's a care that's a beloved character who oversaw the production of this wine and there's

2058
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:51,280
other ones like that where like pacard said these chicken fingers were okay like the main not even

2059
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:58,560
like side character like jordy leforge thought of this like french dip this is a she was the one who

2060
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:03,840
thought to crush up captain crunch and roll the chicken finger batter in it i'm curious about

2061
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:14,560
salad because it says a frequent visitor to corks bar he was not the same time period yeah they'd

2062
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:18,720
all unravels that doesn't make sense yeah that one doesn't you got to drink enough until you

2063
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:25,920
don't care about conflicting timelines yeah i like shuttle salad all right like i don't know

2064
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:32,400
what's an s word that's in start a shuttle oh yeah fuck it shuttle shuttle salad in terms of giving

2065
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:39,840
up similarly if i could read glop on a stick also known as jumja this station treat looks like an

2066
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:48,320
awful lot like a corn dog served with fries in fact it is yeah yeah yeah whatever yeah there's

2067
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:53,680
footage of a guy going around after people have had their food served in costume and and he asked

2068
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:59,440
the child it's like do you like your triples that we were told they taste like chicken but to humans

2069
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:06,800
everything tastes like chicken just kind of like razz and the kids just blank face like to smile

2070
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:13,600
okay too i don't know i'm having chicken don't bother me yeah dads dad's irritated yeah the one

2071
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:19,920
thing that bothers me and maybe it's maybe i'm not seeing it presented in a different way is that they

2072
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:28,320
have on the menu different ales they have klingon war war nog ale they have kardassian ale fulcan

2073
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:34,960
ale promenade ales and then they have romulan ale which very famously through the run of

2074
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:42,320
like most of the series they talk about romulan ale as being illegal it is so highly alcoholic

2075
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:47,680
that like you know like i got a little romulan ale like guinan has a little romulan ale behind

2076
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:54,480
the bar for you if she knows you and she trusts you like yes it's 10 000 percent yes but this is

2077
01:50:54,560 --> 01:51:00,480
just presented it's four dollars or like the other ones there's this should have its own thing this

2078
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:06,880
should be what you want this is the blue milk this is the butter beer this and like earl gray tea hot

2079
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:11,600
should be the two things that you want to drink when you go to a star trek themed bar

2080
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:16,800
and they're not presenting it in a big enough way or making a big deal out of it i'm going to make

2081
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:21,600
this prediction for galaxy's edge because the blue milk the kind of frozen blue milk smoothie you get

2082
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:28,080
at the stands is different than the blue milk in the cantina right and that difference until i sample

2083
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:34,720
both is going to drive me insane like you know it's like i try not to be too much of a completeness

2084
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:41,840
nowadays but but i have to sample both milks to see which i like more what would you get on this

2085
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:48,480
menu on this menu on the star trek menu oh i'm not sure i have enough of it in front of me i mean

2086
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:55,200
sacred chalice i'd have maybe three or four sacred chalices of ricks i think i would want to try the

2087
01:51:55,200 --> 01:52:02,480
warp core breach with the with the um even as sweet as it sounds even with the dry with the dry

2088
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:10,720
ice and everything so there's uh they have glop on a stick hue borger now that's this is just me uh

2089
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:18,080
mike explaining you star trek uh characters hue borger hue is a character they rescue a borg at a

2090
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:23,200
certain point in next generation and they sort of rehabilitate him and he is he's like they finally

2091
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:28,640
like they name him hue and he's like a little sweet guy and his name is hue of borg and they

2092
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:32,640
like rehabilitate him but he still kind of has his borg stuff on but he's like a cute borg anyway

2093
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:37,920
they grant him up into meat so anyway fuck him he's a hamburger now uh i don't think i have enough

2094
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:42,960
of the food in front of me these are all from the cadet menu i have to say if anyone out there has

2095
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:49,200
these old restaurant menus if you could just scan them in a high resolution and put them in one

2096
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:58,000
album between this and marvel mania trying to track down all the pages is so crazy that is the

2097
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:03,440
cadet menu i was reading from uh yeah because they have jordy's nanite pizza specially engineered

2098
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:10,000
by lieutenant commander jordy laforge for a younger cadet what why is he engineering that

2099
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:18,800
one of the main characters took some time to engineer a pizza yeah joseph cisco's bayou linguini

2100
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:26,000
that's it yeah i gotta add that i didn't see that one joseph cisco is uh benjamin cisco

2101
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:31,280
which is the keys the captain of deep space nine yeah that's his kid and for whatever reason his

2102
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:38,240
kid has bayou linguini um hey i got a shout out that we're back to drinks but the james t kirk

2103
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:46,560
spelled like t uh made with beef eater gin bacardi limon frizz vodka what the fuck is that

2104
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:56,160
blue curacao what no retire this ingredient the sour mix and gatorade alpine snow oh fuck you

2105
01:53:56,160 --> 01:54:04,160
kirk's too smart to drink this gatorade i thought that was like the long island iced tea but it's

2106
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:09,680
such a shit show it says this drink on earth a long island iced tea i don't even like when

2107
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:14,480
places are like with us with a sierra mist float and i was like i don't know why that

2108
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:23,760
no scratch that bums bums me out in the wrong way i did you find the menu with mccoy's martinis

2109
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:32,400
no there's so many mccoy's martinis there's a bullion sunrise red shirt vulcan nerve pinch

2110
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:38,080
the badlands and the royale and then on the other side of this menu is the neutral zone which is

2111
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:45,680
non-alcoholic drinks and data's day is the name of the first drink uh and of course it's not a

2112
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:50,720
serious drinker of alcohol mr data nevertheless enjoys a tasty beverage every now and then

2113
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:55,920
especially now that he's installed his emotions chip he needs to install a chip that lets him have

2114
01:54:56,640 --> 01:55:03,360
like water in him liquids if he can't taste strawberry and pineapple juice

2115
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:09,040
unless he has his emotion chips and data has actually been known to say i love this drink

2116
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:17,360
he he has emotion about something only in this case um west oh there's also one called wesley's

2117
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:24,880
crush um well i mean this is like a real tome this menu which is pretty exciting

2118
01:55:25,120 --> 01:55:31,040
we'll post like stills of this but i think you know what i think actually within the uh within

2119
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:36,240
the menu it is listed as the final frontier and perhaps it should be the final frontier of the

2120

pie this recipe for a delicious pie came directly from the holy orbs themselves yes graham cracker

2129
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:47,680
crust with a sense holy to me with a combination of dark tlayen chocolate mousse and bajoran

2130
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:53,280
peanut butter topping drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauce and topped with chopped bajoran

2131
01:56:53,280 --> 01:57:00,080
peanuts this dessert is truly blessed my child wow i love it so it's like a peanut butter pie

2132
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:07,840
not quite a mud pie but i'm into it and blessed and holy and the most sacred dessert you could

2142
01:58:06,160 --> 01:58:11,920
solid mix solution why do they think melon is a big flavor in star trick yeah i think that was

2143
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:18,800
just the time all right what's that what's that um what is that famous melon liqueur called

2144
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:24,560
i don't know yeah you feel like i heard a lot of people it's like that was their first like

2147
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:45,200
trick someone into drinking yeah that's the way to maduri is the way to go uh what a world of wonder

2148
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:52,400
so much to do from realizing you're in a group with picard's ancestor to facing the borg

2149
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:59,360
themselves is that right too well they are they all could refer to themselves as one we are borg

2150
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:09,760
so how what would it be oh it's like a rat king yeah kind of yeah to seeing the borg to uh eating

2151
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:15,440
uh eating a corn dog that's called some that's called jumja for no reason there's you could do

2152
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:24,160
everything there uh and what a bummer tragedy yeah so yeah it's a stupid neonopolis for given false

2153
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:29,680
hope to cedar fair and i don't think we're gonna even like there's rumors of universe i don't i

2154
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:33,520
right now it doesn't seem like we're getting a star trek land at the fantastic worlds part

2155
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:38,000
no i don't think it seemed too late like if they'd been on the more more on the ball it was

2156
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:43,360
rumored that it was going to replace terminator but as matt roger said it's going to be born

2157
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:47,520
it's going to be jason born i'm skeptical that that's even happening now we broke that story

2158
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:54,640
is like if stuff if i feel like the buzz has died down i feel like generally it's i'm skeptical

2159
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:58,320
it's gonna happen right now we're hearing a lot of tomorrowland rumors so if i feel like if this

2160
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:03,120
buzz sustains to d23 we got something but if this dies down we don't hear anything about it for a

2161
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:08,880
year and a half then i think they're back to not i mean yeah it seems like fantastic uh worlds is

2162
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:12,400
what how to train your dragon universal monsters

2163
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:22,240
nintendo and nintendo and fantastic beasts yeah bulworth the bulworth small foot

2164
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:30,400
but i think even if i'm sure they could do a very cool star trek ride and like there's some concept

2165
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:37,280
art and things on like the starfleet academy land area but i don't know i don't think it's

2166
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:42,560
gonna have the charm that this seems to have yeah this has the junkie charm of star trek that i love

2167
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:48,080
and i think if they do something it'll be like almost too big budget it'll almost be too it'll

2168
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:53,520
be great it could it could be very great but like i don't think they'll be like well we should make

2169
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:59,040
it look like that junkie looking syndicated show that people love from the 90s it's gonna look like
