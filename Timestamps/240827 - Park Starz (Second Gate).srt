1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,240
I'm a big bright shining star.

2
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,240
Park star.

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,920
Welcome to Podcast the Ride the Second Gate.

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,920
My name is Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,520
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,680
I was curious how you were going to do that after you said, what is Mark Wahlberg say

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,680
at the end of Boogie Nights?

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,920
And then I did it in the best possible way, the smoothest possible way.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,920
Yeah, yeah.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,920
There's a lot to take in.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,920
Seamless, actually.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,360
Scott Gardner is well here.

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,280
Yes, I could have done that with like a slick like audio trick.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,040
I could have done it before.

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,720
I could have put it in later, but I didn't.

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,720
We did it live.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,400
The live innovation, fuck it, we'll do it live is what you, is what you want.

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,400
I was wondering if you had an idea that I had, which I didn't really want to like make

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,040
a whole song or anything, but just thinking about Park Stars.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,000
I've just been singing that phrase to myself over the Crosby, Stills and Nash song, Dark

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,640
Star.

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,240
That's funny because I was thinking of Baby I'm a Star by Prince from Purple Rain.

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,640
I also thought about Star is Born, some sort of Jackson Maine tie-in, which Jason would

24
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
have appreciated.

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,440
Oh, I'm a huge Jackson Maine fan.

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
Are you kidding?

27
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,040
We all would have peed our pants in solidarity.

28
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,040
Yeah, Rock Star, another Mark Wahlberg movie.

29
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,240
Rock, well no, Rock of Ages doesn't have star in it because I wanted to do a Stacey Jacks

30
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,240
reference, but.

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,520
Now you're just free associating words.

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,320
Yeah, now I'm just free associating.

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,760
All ages is a type of establishment you can have.

34
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,240
All state is an insurance.

35
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,040
State is a place that you live.

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,840
Spoken word, free association poetry that I'm doing here, which is what I do on this

37
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,600
show often.

38
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,840
That is sort of what I do.

39
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
It is?

40
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
Sometimes.

41
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
Well, I don't do it in that way, but.

42
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:15,120
You know, podcasting is like jazz, you know, free association, you got a torch wielding

43
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,920
mob comes to the door, boo, get him.

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
Yeah, that's true.

45
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
I'm upset too.

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,000
But yeah, so there were many.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,320
There's a lot of things with star in the title.

48
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,760
We could have done any of them.

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,760
My choice.

50
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
My rhyme is all I'm saying.

51
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
That's why I thought of it.

52
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
The rest did not rhyme.

53
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
Oh, because of Dark.

54
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

55
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
Yeah, you're right.

56
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,160
It doesn't make it better, but.

57
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,760
I went with the dirty line or the dirty penis scene from the movie.

58
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
That's what I chose.

59
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,640
When are you imagining one of these little figurines, these are figurines of theme park

60
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,640
specific characters.

61
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,680
Are you imagining one of them with what for them would be a particularly large member

62
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:05,840
to buy at their proportions would be the Abe Lincoln one inch as opposed to, you know,

63
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,880
the four percent of.

64
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
Right.

65
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,080
Yeah, I was thinking of the Abe Lincoln one dropping his pants like at the end of Boogie

66
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,560
Nights and then saying that to him to like pump himself up.

67
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,400
You're a bright shining star.

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
But today.

69
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,080
OK, we're talking about Park stars.

70
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,040
Now, you may know we've spoken about this before on the show.

71
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,880
They were they introduced these things called Vinylmations in like 2008 and what Vinylmations

72
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,760
were were these little basically like they all had the same exact shape.

73
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,840
They were Mickey Mouse and then they would have artists paint things on them.

74
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,680
Oftentimes it was characters, but then sometimes it would be almost an abstraction or like

75
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,240
a ride thing.

76
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,400
And it was sort of the trend that I think was started in 2001 by Bear Bricks.

77
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,200
You've seen these Bear Bricks, very famous people oftentimes have very expensive Bear

78
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Bricks.

79
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,640
I was going to say Kid Robot.

80
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,640
I think it was the first I.

81
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
Yeah.

82
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
L.A. toy company.

83
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,600
Basically, what Disney did was there was a trend of like art toys and many, many years

84
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,200
later they decided we should do that too, as is their style in general for anything

85
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,400
pop culture related us also and a little worse.

86
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Yeah.

87
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,000
Bear Bricks are these things and they're all just like they have the shape of a bear and

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,560
then different artists like draw.

89
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
I don't know.

90
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
That's not the biggest photo in the world.

91
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
If you can see that.

92
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
OK.

93
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,200
But they're all like the same basic like plastic shape.

94
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,320
And then you can draw different characters on them.

95
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,920
There's a Garfield Bear Brick right here.

96
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,400
That's like a chrome Garfield that has been painted over this like bear shape.

97
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
That's very confusing.

98
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,160
How is he Garfield if he's chrome?

99
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,440
It is very confusing.

100
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,840
And would you believe that I have this in a box in my garage?

101
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,840
Melting.

102
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
I don't.

103
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
Yes, I know.

104
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,320
It's got to be a movement to move some of my toys outside of there.

105
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,800
I don't have any Bear Bricks open.

106
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,480
I don't even know that I intend to keep this.

107
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,400
This was just on sale many years ago.

108
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,160
And I think I was texting Griffin and he was like, you have to get that.

109
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,720
And I was like, I think I do have to get it.

110
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,480
I have to let that sit in a box in the garage.

111
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,760
They're the size of like a toddler.

112
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,760
They're giant.

113
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
This is giant.

114
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,440
And I was like, I don't have any room for this, but it's sitting in a box.

115
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,080
So I may sell it one day.

116
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,400
So Disney years later decided, okay, we better get in on this trend while it's hot.

117
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,620
Five, six, seven, eight, ten years later.

118
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:38,300
And then a couple years into doing Vinylmations, which I had a few of and I still have a couple,

119
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,500
they started doing something called Park Stars, which were different shapes.

120
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,700
And they would almost exclusively represent characters that you would find in the parks.

121
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,940
Park exclusive characters.

122
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,300
Not always there's a couple that aren't necessarily exclusive to the parks, but mostly things

123
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,800
you would see in the parks.

124
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,940
The dog with the key in its mouth, the redhead on Pirates, Rex from Star Tours.

125
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,940
Yeti.

126
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,940
Yeti.

127
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,940
Yeah.

128
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,940
Dynamite Goat.

129
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,940
Dynamite Goat.

130
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,940
From Big Thunder Mountain.

131
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,940
From Small World.

132
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,940
Yes.

133
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,940
For specific characters.

134
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,200
All the three hitchhiking ghosts.

135
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,800
And this is a dream for us, I think.

136
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:22,240
This is what we want the most possible, is the specificity of a character who you gotta

137
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:29,240
go to a place to meet and then to tribute that with the specific, because do we need

138
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
a Pluto?

139
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,240
Do we need a Cogsworth?

140
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
Do you need a Cogsworth?

141
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Well, sure.

142
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:41,320
I have a Mrs. Potts at home that sits in the kitchen, I kinda like that, but you know what

143
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
I mean?

144
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,360
Like the specificity of, you only know this guy if you've been in this place and now there's

145
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,840
a little item of him.

146
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,400
It's the Funmeister.

147
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,720
It's from Pleasure Island.

148
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Mr. Funmeister.

149
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,160
I got that one.

150
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,960
This is a rare line that I have a couple of, because I don't collect much at all, but it's

151
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,240
so up my alley, the theme park specificity.

152
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,680
And you love blind boxes, which is an important detail.

153
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,120
You have to roll the dice with your $15, $16.

154
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,800
Well, I don't because I buy them on eBay, I only get what I know I want.

155
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,200
Did you ever do, Mike, the blind version of these?

156
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,240
Well, I absolutely, so the first few waves, I think I've like, toward the end of the first,

157
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,640
they've done five waves of these and they stopped doing them in 2017, which is very

158
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
upsetting.

159
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,000
We'll have a call to action at the end of the show, as far as I see there's a, there's

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,880
at least a couple like change.org petitions to get Vinylmations going again.

161
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,600
And if we know anything from the last eight years or so, those work.

162
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,960
Work really well, especially when they're under 500 signatures.

163
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,880
Use your voice.

164
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:55,160
If we all raise our voices, maybe now we can overturn the opened Tiana ride.

165
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
Right, right.

166
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,960
So I think that's, yeah, toward the first wave is when I noticed them and started getting

167
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,960
them.

168
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,480
We did, Jason and I would go a lot to the parks together around this time.

169
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,360
And I think I was almost exclusively just doing buying a box, a couple of boxes when

170
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
I would go and see what you get.

171
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,120
Maybe sell one if it's a duplicate or we would trade, I forget.

172
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
Maybe we traded.

173
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
I don't know.

174
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,840
You get these in the park or in one of these downtown Disney sort of both, both.

175
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,000
You would get it at D Street, which is now the Disney home goods store, whatever that's

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
called.

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,240
But there used to be that hip edgy store at downtown Disney for the collectibles for the

178
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,840
sophisticated fan, not just your normal grandma sweatshirt.

179
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,880
This is vinylmation.

180
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,960
These are exclusive vinylmations.

181
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,840
These are different art prints.

182
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,480
That's where you're going is D Street.

183
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:49,240
And do they really want an edgy art scene, you know, burgeoning within downtown Disney?

184
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
I don't know.

185
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
You know, they're a little bit of stiff shirts.

186
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,520
I don't know if they were up for the edginess.

187
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,360
I don't think they were either because they closed it.

188
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,720
It was, I don't know how long it was open.

189
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
They closed that.

190
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
They closed House of Blues.

191
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Yeah.

192
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Oh boy.

193
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
It's too powerful.

194
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,360
They sanctioned great art at downtown Disney.

195
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Yeah.

196
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,000
But you could get them, I'm trying to remember, you could get them in that first gift shop

197
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,040
to the right in California Adventure.

198
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,200
And I think there was a place in Disneyland to get it as well.

199
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,520
But as it went on, I was like, I like all of these.

200
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:23,240
Why don't I just go on Shop Disney or whatever it was called at the time and buy the box?

201
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,560
I got the 10% off or I got a 10, well, you get 10% off in the park.

202
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,240
But then I would have like a coupon code or something for Shop Disney.

203
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,480
And I just buy the box because the box had one per in the box.

204
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,000
So it wasn't like, I mean, it was still expensive, but it was like, why am I going to go and

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,840
just like kill myself buying 50 of these to get the whole set and may as well just buy

206
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,320
the box.

207
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,760
So the last couple I bought the entire box and then I think maybe I sold a couple if

208
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
I didn't want them.

209
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,920
But I wanted most of them because they're pretty good.

210
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,280
Did you end up with repeats very often?

211
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Not when I bought the box.

212
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,000
The box didn't really have any repeat.

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,240
The box was just that the amount that they had for per line.

214
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,600
Yeah, if you buy the case, you would get one of the basically occasionally a chase.

215
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,400
Early on, I'm sure I did get one or two.

216
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,960
I remember Jason and I were on the hunt for the orange bird early on in one of the first

217
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,280
waves. And I pulled it.

218
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,640
You pulled it because we were doing a whole show and I was trying to shake like trying

219
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,800
to feel the weight because these blind boxes and blind bags, if you've ever played with

220
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,800
any any version of these toys, when you're in the store, it's kind of fun to be like,

221
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
OK, I want this one.

222
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,520
And it's a bigger toy.

223
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,720
So then you start weighing them in your hands.

224
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,480
Then you start doing a little shake.

225
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:41,000
Sometimes they have blind bags that are more like just actually a bag, not a box.

226
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,720
Yeah, with the bag, you can kind of feel it.

227
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,680
So the bag you're trying to feel, you're trying to see, oh, is this the one I want?

228
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,720
And they try to throw you off.

229
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,080
They try to put a little cardboard in if it's like a there's these like bag clips I buy

230
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,120
now that have like Ninja Turtles on them.

231
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,240
But they try to put a little like piece of cardboard so you can't feel, but you can kind

232
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,880
of feel still if you really have the ambition for it.

233
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
Tricky cardboard. Yeah.

234
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,040
So we were trying, I think we were at Downtown Disney.

235
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,240
We were at Downtown Disney.

236
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,800
And we were doing, Jason and I were doing this.

237
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,920
We were doing the shake.

238
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,360
We were shaking and weighing. This is God knows 2012.

239
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,560
Doing your rattles.

240
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,800
Doing the rattles.

241
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,000
And I swore I had it because it felt heavier.

242
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,600
And Mike's where he at it.

243
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,000
And I said I could feel it.

244
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,720
He said he could feel it.

245
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,760
And he was right.

246
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,040
Because he did have it.

247
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,200
And I bought one.

248
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,040
I think I bought one and I opened it up as the Orange Bird.

249
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,600
Wow.

250
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
And I opened it up and it was the dinosaur from Dinosaur.

251
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,920
Waa waa.

252
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,400
I don't know. That's kind of good.

253
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,320
I like that.

254
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,520
I've seen a picture of that one.

255
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,760
I mean, I like it, too.

256
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,360
I like it, too.

257
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,240
But the Orange Bird immediately hit.

258
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:49,360
Like it tripled in price as soon as, it's like still 80 or 90 dollars on eBay.

259
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,520
And I have it. I think I so I brought him as well.

260
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,920
I have a little case full.

261
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,120
Oh, he's still rubbing it in my face.

262
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,480
Eleven years later.

263
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,960
Your tackle box.

264
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,840
How many have you got in there?

265
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,960
I don't know. I put this together right before I left.

266
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,400
The reason I have this tackle box is because I had to buy a couple of new tackle boxes

267
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,960
because I put all of the figure accessories in these plastic boxes.

268
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,360
OK.

269
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,640
So I have like five of these at home full of little hands, little heads, guns,

270
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,240
like bowstaffs, nunchucks, different Batman accessories, batarangs.

271
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,280
And you reckon this is this this is common practice and you recommend

272
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,840
the tackle boxes as a good organization.

273
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:34,320
I don't recommend having a collecting addiction to have to have these.

274
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,240
But if you do have one, I recommend these like Amazon tackle boxes.

275
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,240
I think these are actually more sewing boxes.

276
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,560
OK, yeah.

277
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,800
But yeah, these are pretty good because you can switch.

278
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,800
You can change like the size of the different compartments in each one

279
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,480
because you can pull these plastic pieces out.

280
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,920
Look who has kept their container store brain alive.

281
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,480
You're managing space customization.

282
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,320
I'll pull up.

283
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,560
Well, this is really customized.

284
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,520
See, I went a different route.

285
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,160
Jane's mom, like with Christmas stuff, sent us a box,

286
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,840
the famous blue tin of Danish butter cookies.

287
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,880
And as we were finishing them, I was like, hey,

288
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,720
can I keep that tin?

289
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:23,520
I will put heads and weapons and like my grandmother before me,

290
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,360
I will use the Danish butter cookie as storage, not for sewing,

291
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,120
for action figure pieces.

292
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,200
Because Jason's got a nice little collection of figures.

293
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
I know that sounded demeaning.

294
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,160
I didn't mean it to sound kind of it really did.

295
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,960
I would say I sounded like a nice little starter.

296
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,000
He's trying and I appreciate what he's doing.

297
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,680
And he has a few little pieces.

298
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,440
He doesn't quite have the same size as mine, but OK.

299
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,800
But yeah, you have the new, like I guess it's not new.

300
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,000
It's probably the last 10 or 20 years in trend and action figures

301
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,640
is to give you a lot of options, faces, hands, different eyes sometimes

302
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,800
depending on like how you want to express your character, your toy.

303
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,240
So now the problem is you have to store all this somewhere.

304
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,360
And then sometimes, especially if you have a child

305
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,200
and you don't have a lot of time to reorganize your action figures

306
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,120
every day or every few months.

307
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,360
Every day.

308
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Well, I didn't do it every day before that.

309
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,040
But you could spend a little more time doing that.

310
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,080
In the same way that an old guy who likes a train, who has a little train

311
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,040
set and he likes to like make sure that the shrubs look OK

312
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,720
in his little town where his train runs around,

313
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,800
I make sure that the party I've staged in my Ninja Turtle sewer lair

314
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,680
looks good every day.

315
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,440
I make sure Michelangelo's hat is on right.

316
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,040
I make sure the boombox is in the right spot.

317
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,280
And I make sure that the punk frogs are all having a good time partying.

318
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,560
You guys. So you guys are good because you know each other.

319
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,400
But if you ever want to mingle with the others, right, you know,

320
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,000
because parties are for, you know, you don't just need to stay with your own kind.

321
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,400
But if you're more comfortable there, that's OK, too, frogs. Right.

322
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,440
And then one day, maybe I like introduce the bad guys into the party

323
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,760
to like break it up and like hell comes to the sewer.

324
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,400
Like there's a siege on the sewer.

325
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,880
But they got instruments to fight back with.

326
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,800
They sure do. So everything should be fine. Right.

327
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,600
So so anyway, I have these already and I had an empty one.

328
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,880
So I was like, oh, this will this will be perfect to bring

329
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,560
my parks, a handful of park stars to the record.

330
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,800
Well, you've handed them out.

331
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,360
You gave one row to Jason, one row to me.

332
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,840
I guess you've continued to rub it in by giving me the orange bird.

333
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,000
He doesn't even have it right now.

334
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,800
All I have is the real life man, Wally Boak.

335
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah, I love that.

336
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,120
There are some that where we were trying to remember all the real people

337
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,640
because there is an Abraham Lincoln. OK, yeah.

338
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,800
And there is a Wally Boak.

339
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,880
You know, there's a president, Millard Fillmore.

340
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,400
They only did Millard Fillmore out of all of the hall of fame, right?

341
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,920
And to put Lincoln as Lincoln, it's like a super president.

342
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,400
He doesn't really count as one of the riffraff presidents.

343
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,280
Yeah, of course.

344
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,000
So they did Mark Twain. Wait, I'm looking at another way.

345
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,840
That was it. We were trying to remember the third.

346
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,360
OK, right.

347
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,320
So, yeah, I bought a handful of them.

348
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,360
I still have a lot of them.

349
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,040
I will say right now they are not displayed in my my toy display

350
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,600
because the Disney section kind of fell to the Ninja Turtles

351
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,120
and some of the Batman stuff. Wow. Right now.

352
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,440
Conquered. And it's just it's I don't this shouldn't be an episode

353
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,800
just about my toy philosophy right now or my toy display philosophy,

354
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
but it will be a little bit about that. I don't see why not.

355
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,160
Well, I don't see why not being like humble.

356
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,320
I say that really. I'll give you permission.

357
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,480
Thank you. Thank you for doing that.

358
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,800
But it is like just having some like the Disney stuff is so disparate right now

359
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,080
as far as like like if there's a lot of different kinds of Disney things I have.

360
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,600
I have two park stars, but then I have that great Mickey

361
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,280
that Lindsay got me from Tokyo, Disney Sea.

362
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,920
And then I just have it's a very different.

363
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,520
You mean that's like that looks like the suit in the park.

364
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,720
Exactly. Small.

365
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,320
So that doesn't look like a park star.

366
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,200
I see what you're saying.

367
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,560
And then I have some Funko Pops and then I have some Funko Pops

368
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,400
of the actual like what I like with the Funko Pops in general

369
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,080
is the actual buildings, because you can get the Funko Pops

370
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,800
that have, you know, the Space Mountain

371
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,720
that actually have the plastic building, which I like of having a version.

372
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,160
Oh, yes, I have that one.

373
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,960
I got that up on the mantle.

374
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,720
Finally, my son's been playing with that.

375
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,680
And and he's been asking you, you give me that and you gave us

376
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,560
I think you guys Mickey in a Skyliner.

377
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,280
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

378
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,400
Which those alternatively have been staring at my son while he sleeps.

379
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,440
He asked for a Mickey to be watching over him.

380
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,480
So thank you for that.

381
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,920
My daughter on the way.

382
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,280
Don't wake up.

383
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,880
I got eyes on you, pal.

384
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,080
I'm skylining all night.

385
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,320
You better wake up with a 20 in your pocket or I don't care about you.

386
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,280
Most people have to pay to see this ride.

387
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,040
Not you, I guess.

388
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,120
I was leaving with these and my daughter

389
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,600
caught a glimpse that there were fun characters with bright colors in a box

390
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,240
as I was leaving and she goes, whoa, on the way out.

391
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,120
And she ran over to them and I was like, Daddy's running a little late.

392
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,480
He has to go.

393
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,560
She's like started and then she started getting upset.

394
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,720
I was like, I don't know.

395
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,920
And then I just gave her the 20,000 Leagues octopus.

396
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,920
And I was like, got to go. Great.

397
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,960
Diversion near and it worked.

398
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,360
She was like, all right, fine. New thing.

399
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,520
It was good. Yeah. Arbitrary one.

400
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,680
So there's and then there's other Disney stuff people have given me.

401
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,960
And it almost feels like there's just so much disparate stuff right now.

402
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,360
I can't make a cohesive display with all of it, with the room I have.

403
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,840
And with the turtle stuff, which is overwhelmingly what I have,

404
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,080
it's also uniform, it's all to scale.

405
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,960
Now I have dioramas and it's just completely overtaken this limited.

406
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,360
I mean, it's a wall, but it's a limited amount of display space. Yeah.

407
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,240
So right now, these are actually a lot of them are in a box.

408
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,040
Some of them are not.

409
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,480
So I have like figment and dream dream finder out on the shelf.

410
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,440
And some of the some of the selects are out right now.

411
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,760
And then meanwhile, back in the garage, a lonely chrome Garfield.

412
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,680
Don't I get to come inside?

413
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,240
I'm fancier than a regular Garfield.

414
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,480
His face is melted off because of the heat in Los Angeles right now.

415
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,600
No love for me.

416
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,880
You're never going to be able to pay for your daughter's college fund,

417
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,800
your Neuralink fund, you know, whatever they're doing.

418
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,720
She's going to need a Neuralink pretty soon.

419
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,400
Oh, yeah. No, I'm saying down the line.

420
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,680
Oh, down the line. Sure.

421
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,000
Well, if I keep that Garfield in the box,

422
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,640
maybe the price of that will skyrocket, especially, I don't know, after.

423
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,600
Did the Garfield movie come out? It did, right?

424
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,960
Yeah, it already came out.

425
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,360
I can't tell. Seemingly no impact.

426
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,600
But a lot of things with no impact are big hits that I don't realize.

427
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,560
So Chris Pratt, Garfield. Yeah.

428
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,720
But maybe something. Yeah, wait, I did.

429
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,120
That was such an out of date Garfield impression I was doing.

430
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,120
Hey, it's me, Garfield.

431
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,800
Hey, it's me, Mario.

432
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,080
Hey, it's me.

433
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,200
And tomorrow, tomorrow.

434
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,520
Hey, Cowan. Hey, Owen.

435
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,360
Cowan. Oh, no, Cowan.

436
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,640
My buddy resembles Mike Mitchell.

437
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,440
We got to fight this tomorrow.

438
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,720
Yeah, yeah. Hey, Luigi.

439
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,000
You got to move faster than Cowan.

440
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,400
We're going to defeat Bowser.

441
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,080
My impression is, hey, it's me.

442
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,160
I'm everyone. Hey.

443
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,480
Yeah, let's do all of our.

444
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,880
Well, he can be everyone in the box.

445
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,480
Hey, it's me, Orange Bird.

446
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,120
Hey, it's me, Dynamite Goat.

447
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,480
Hey, it's me, Mark Twain.

448
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,960
But Owen Grady is not in the next Jurassic World.

449
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,000
They're just rebooting fresh.

450
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,960
It's that right?

451
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,040
I don't really. With Scarlett Johansson is in it.

452
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,240
I do know that. I don't know.

453
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,640
But what a move to if there's suddenly an Owen Grady Easter egg.

454
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,320
Yes, that's right.

455
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,000
Nostalgia alert.

456
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,920
Is it 2015 again?

457
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,320
Owen Grady, wow, his fans with surprise appearance

458
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,720
in New Jurassic World.

459
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,880
Are those Claire Dearing's running heels stuck in the ground

460
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,800
or they pull in the ground?

461
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,600
They pull like a sheet off of Claire's dusty like heels

462
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
in this movie.

463
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,120
Whoa.

464
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,720
These are the original heels from the original park

465
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,600
that referenced the other original park.

466
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,920
Well, it's really funny if they were like a copy of a death certificate

467
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:17,360
of Claire Dearing's assistant who didn't pay the boys enough attention.

468
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,400
That really that would be really good if they were 10 years later

469
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,360
treating it nostalgia wise.

470
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,320
They will be.

471
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,480
Maybe. Yeah, maybe.

472
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:25,880
What were it?

473
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,240
Didn't they?

474
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,480
Isn't one of the wasn't it?

475
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,640
Didn't there was there a newer Pirates that was like, and look who's here?

476
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,000
Orlando Bloom.

477
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,560
Yeah, yeah.

478
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,800
And they got it. Wow.

479
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,640
It's can you believe it's been six years?

480
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,280
Yeah, yeah.

481
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,600
Wow. What a blast from the past.

482
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,520
It was like the fifth one.

483
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,160
I think they he comes back at the end with Keira Knightley.

484
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,960
Yeah. And those are bad.

485
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,160
The fourth and fifth one are bad.

486
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,960
And I think I saw the fifth one.

487
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,680
Is that Ian McShane?

488
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,080
We watched that as Blackbeard anything for who gives a shit.

489
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,640
You said that I thought Ian McShane was an old author, too.

490
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,080
I don't know anything.

491
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,720
He's from Deadwood. Yeah.

492
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,120
He does speak very well.

493
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,800
They all speak eloquently in Deadwood.

494
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,600
You just need like a giant problem gambler to write up your words.

495
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,680
And then I and I say recently, I probably was five years ago.

496
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,000
We watched some of Deadwood and I was like, there's just an episode

497
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,160
where Ian McShane is trying to pass a kidney stone.

498
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,000
Yes. It's great television.

499
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,440
It's very thrilling, although it'll make you worry.

500
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,280
You have a kidney stone.

501
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,280
Well, sure. Any ailment on TV, I worry I have it.

502
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,560
Mike doesn't need to watch something about a kidney stone to worry about.

503
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,040
If I watch Batman and Robin, I think that I have McGregor's syndrome,

504
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,000
the illness that Alfred had, which isn't real.

505
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,480
But they start talking McGregor's syndrome and I go, shit,

506
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,920
I feel like I'm coming down with McGregor's syndrome.

507
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,040
What if I have to freeze my daughter until they find a cure?

508
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,840
Wait, did his wife have McGregor's syndrome?

509
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,960
Well, is that the things that he they're both they they are aligned,

510
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,280
good and evil, looking for the same cure.

511
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,000
Oh, I guess. Right.

512
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,640
It would have to. I can't imagine there were two diseases in play,

513
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,360
but I don't quite remember.

514
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,440
Jason, can you look up if if Victor freezes his wife?

515
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,800
Nora. Nora had McGregor's syndrome.

516
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,360
I guess you're probably right.

517
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,480
Why wouldn't it be that? Right. Yeah.

518
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,680
Huh. That's interesting.

519
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,400
Because he and the cure is diamonds, right?

520
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,640
That's why he steals diamonds. Yes.

521
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,480
Because diamonds might be the cure for McGregor's syndrome.

522
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,920
Yeah. Yes.

523
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,600
One. Oh, yeah.

524
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,600
He say one more giant diamond.

525
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,920
One more.

526
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,960
And then they go to like.

527
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,080
But then he has to put it in that like telescope

528
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,360
at the end of the thing that shoots a beam into the sky.

529
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,640
You were Nora.

530
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,000
Freeze did have McGregor.

531
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,240
OK, Scott was right there.

532
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,120
A fictional condition in the Batman mythos.

533
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,920
Well, I have it too now.

534
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,160
Now that we're talking about it, whatever it is, psychosomatic

535
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,440
McGregor's syndrome, I think that's just what Nora Freeze has.

536
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,040
Mike only has been stealing diamonds.

537
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,120
I'm like a hypochondriac, but it's all for fictional diseases

538
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,720
from comic books and comic book movies, like just different.

539
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,960
Like I have.

540
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,920
What's the what's the virus in X-Men?

541
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,640
The legacy of the legacy of the legacy virus as well.

542
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,920
That colossus sacrifices himself.

543
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,920
Yeah, I can't come.

544
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,000
I can't hang out tonight.

545
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,360
I have the legacy virus.

546
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,960
Yeah, I think I have the thing that makes humans dumber

547
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,600
and apes smarter that enables the planet of the apes.

548
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,560
Have you noticed my vocabulary has been lesser on the show lately?

549
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,160
I think it's because of whatever that was.

550
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,760
Ape syndrome. Yeah.

551
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,840
Ooh, syndrome.

552
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,400
Yeah. So look, I everything I do every even my

553
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,200
my worries are based in some pop culture I absorbed as a child.

554
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,920
Even my true fears.

555
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,840
I am. Are you worried?

556
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,240
I don't know if he's dead.

557
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,560
Is he dead? No. OK.

558
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,320
I was going to say, is Bobby Sherman still alive?

559
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,480
Yes, he is alive.

560
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,120
And you don't have to worry about dying of what Bobby Sherman died of

561
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,200
until he dies.

562
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,320
That's true. Yeah, because my mom will say it like she will put it

563
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,000
still put it in my head or whatever.

564
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,320
Whenever he passes away, she will be like, well, you know, you got to be careful,

565
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,720
depending on how Bobby Sherman died, whatever it is.

566
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,680
If it's a fall, if he has, I don't know, lung cancer,

567
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,520
I don't know that he smoked.

568
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,120
He seemed like a wholesome nonsmoker to me, but I don't know that.

569
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,440
That's the way he was portrayed as far as my mind.

570
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,320
He's so nice. Bobby Sherman seems so nice.

571
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,880
How would he ever smoke or do anything bad ever?

572
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,560
So we'll see. He's so nice.

573
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,080
I can't believe that he died of old age.

574
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,880
Be careful, Michael, be careful about being older.

575
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,280
So so, yeah, so the Park Stars will come back into the display

576
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,600
at a certain point when I become very rich and have a big house

577
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,640
or when I just start shuffling stuff around, which I want to do,

578
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,120
but I don't have too much time for that anymore because you want to shuffle

579
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,040
things out, you want to shuffle things in.

580
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,360
And then having a collection is also this it's a giant

581
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,760
I think of it as like a giant living organism.

582
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,680
You're constantly like pruning.

583
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,000
You're constantly reassessing what you have.

584
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,560
Do I still like this?

585
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,960
Do I want this?

586
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,840
Do I want this?

587
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,800
But I want to just store it away for a while.

588
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,840
And it never ends.

589
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,960
Some might say it's an albatross around your neck.

590
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,000
Yeah, I was going to say a curse.

591
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,160
Some might call it a curse,

592
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,960
but some might call it a nice little hobby.

593
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,360
Compulsion is a bit of a compulsion.

594
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,880
There is a thing, though, with collecting,

595
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,560
where I really try to be honest with myself and look at everything I have.

596
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,760
And I do the Marie Kondo thing.

597
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,400
And I'm like, is this sparking joy in me?

598
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,280
Is this giving me pleasure when I look at it?

599
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,160
And the answer? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

600
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,920
Got one no, 100 more yeses.

601
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,880
That's a that's a big problem, because actually in some ways

602
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,280
you'd be like, it'd be great if I looked at it.

603
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,080
And I went, no, actually, it doesn't.

604
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,840
It's a compulsion.

605
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,320
It's something where I just felt a need to complete a set

606
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,160
because that exists as well.

607
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,920
The answer is almost everything I have displayed is awesome.

608
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,440
And every time I look at it, I get a little thrill.

609
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,280
I get a little fun in the head.

610
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,680
Like I get a little like shot of adrenaline

611
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,360
because it looks like something I liked probably when I was a kid.

612
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,200
So so I think when we're talking to park stars,

613
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,560
I think maybe if I'm psychoanalyzing myself,

614
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,960
if these things look even more like the actual robots

615
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,920
and characters in the park, they might still be on the display right now.

616
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,960
But the abstraction.

617
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,960
But in some cases, at least for a couple of them,

618
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,280
you got you kind of look and you go, what's that?

619
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,640
And if there's any percentage of what's that?

620
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,320
And not with what you're showing, you're you're taking a few out of your box

621
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,360
and putting them on a little stand here.

622
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,320
And there's that's obviously figment.

623
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,000
It's obviously right. It's obviously redhead.

624
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,560
Now that now this one, I'm a little sure.

625
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,680
Is that Phantom Phantom?

626
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,880
It does say on the bottom of them what they are.

627
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,640
Not the turtle from Electric Light Parade.

628
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,560
I think that's a later series innovation is stamping

629
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,800
or an earlier series innovation.

630
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,560
Well, it's like here's Skippy from extraterrestrial

631
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,240
alien encounter, right? Good full branding.

632
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,120
I well, it's on the bottom.

633
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,320
I read it like you were paid for by the Disney company

634
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,680
to read that full title. Yeah.

635
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,960
Wouldn't it be funny if you had been like paid the whole time?

636
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,440
We didn't know. Yeah.

637
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,240
Only Jason. Seven years.

638
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,080
Jason, taking a deal with Disney.

639
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,960
No, I'm not. I'm just, you know, I'm just back from visiting.

640
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,920
Look out key at Lighthouse Point.

641
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,080
Scott, you up on Lookout Key on Lighthouse Point?

642
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,000
It's their newest cruise destination.

643
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,480
It's full of bugs.

644
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,520
There are a lot of bugs.

645
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,880
There are a lot of bugs crawling on the.

646
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,800
And everything is really far away.

647
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,960
They should do an alien encounter where they just release a bunch of bugs

648
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,440
in the room, like a bunch of insects for real.

649
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,120
Because like, as long as they're not they don't have stingers,

650
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,880
you're not going to get hurt.

651
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
But you might get a fly in the mouth or something.

652
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:14,000
Well, that and that's what I I, you know, the the nut jobs online

653
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,640
are like New World Order is going to make you eat bugs.

654
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,000
And I am on record as saying, give me those bugs.

655
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,960
I want to eat the bugs.

656
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,760
In all seriousness, have you had like bug anything?

657
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,200
Only I think I don't even remember if I bought

658
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,440
like the novelty lollipops that had a cricket or something in them.

659
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,760
Where the tequila with those were like, you know, souvenir shops.

660
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,680
I haven't ever seen. Have you ever seen that?

661
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,240
No. Well, yeah, like big suckers that have like a worm or a.

662
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,360
But they have a scorpion.

663
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,760
It's kind of fun. It's like all day.

664
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,040
How close to it do you get with the tequila with the bug?

665
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,400
Sure. Yeah, but that's like a worm.

666
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,920
Yeah. Yeah, that's not a bug.

667
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,400
But you never had like crickets or something.

668
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,360
You know, like I think maybe I got the.

669
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,200
Or did I try that?

670
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,480
Was there a margarita at the Mexico Pavilion and napkin with the

671
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,200
with a rim of bugs?

672
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,520
Ants, ants. OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

673
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,240
Yeah, I kind of like that.

674
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,080
But your world order, you didn't eat.

675
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,600
You didn't eat the pond eels.

676
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,520
No, no, God.

677
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,920
Who knows where that marsh goes to?

678
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,560
Oh, you even if you cook them?

679
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,040
I don't I don't know.

680
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,080
I don't think I would risk. Yeah.

681
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,320
Cooking a pond eel. No. Yeah.

682
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,240
I think once or twice we had like if we were camping with the Boy Scouts,

683
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,320
if someone caught like a big trout or something,

684
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,360
but that's so what you have to cut the scales off.

685
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,960
You have to debone it.

686
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,600
I also would say that eating a trout is nowhere close to eating a pond eel.

687
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,320
No, I don't think trout is a thing that you eat.

688
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,000
As opposed to pond eels is what I was saying.

689
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,040
Well, you're right.

690
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,040
Little guppies or goldies or whatever.

691
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,360
Like I haven't eaten an eel.

692
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,800
I have eaten a yellowtail.

693
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,960
Well, that's a different way.

694
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,760
What would have eaten a burger?

695
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,320
What was the name of the fish you would catch that you would guppies or sunnies?

696
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,600
Sunnies. That's right.

697
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,840
You wouldn't eat the sunnies.

698
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,880
No, we wouldn't eat.

699
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,400
God knows how much meat is even on those things.

700
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,120
Not much, probably.

701
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:28,080
But yeah, so so if these I think also would trend like my collector brain,

702
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,720
I do like things to look exactly like they appear either on a show or in real life, too.

703
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,760
So I think probably if the ultimate version of something like this,

704
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,360
if Disney were to do it again, I would kind of want a full sized phantom

705
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,640
that just looked exactly like the robot on Phantom Manor.

706
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,360
Because figments kind of style, like I don't know how to describe it.

707
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:55,720
They're all cartoon versions of inflatable, old fashioned, like punching bags or like

708
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,600
they're just like basically cartoonified versions of all the characters.

709
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,920
And some people, some characters lend themselves more to that style than others.

710
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,400
So some of the ones when you go, like, I don't know what that one is.

711
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,400
It's because they've cartoonified like, I don't know, like maybe that turtle.

712
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,640
Yeah, Wally Bo. Right.

713
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,920
Wally Bo. You know, a little bit of his soul is in every one of these.

714
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:23,000
They they I was going to say there was a comic book where they an editor passed away

715
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,280
and they put his actual ashes in the printing of the comic.

716
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,760
So his soul is in that.

717
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,640
Yes. Is that guy's name?

718
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,000
Grunwald. Yeah.

719
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,640
Kiss the kiss comic book.

720
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,400
Put blood in the ink.

721
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,760
There's no one.

722
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,480
No one. Wally Bo didn't do any of that for this toy.

723
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,240
We have to make that clear.

724
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,400
Unless it was against his will.

725
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,240
Unless it was against it.

726
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,840
No one dug up his grave.

727
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,720
New World Order Bugs.

728
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,320
Disney has soul capturing devices.

729
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,640
Why do you keep saying New World Order?

730
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,040
I don't know. It's just conspiracy.

731
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
It's like an Alex Jones thing.

732
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,160
I think it's an Alex Jones thing.

733
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,160
The New World Order is going to be huge.

734
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,280
OK, right. It's like, yeah, bugs.

735
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,920
Order whatever.

736
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,560
Not Order 66.

737
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,520
But there was like some U.S.

738
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,160
military exercise exercises.

739
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,440
And there were like this preparation for New World Order.

740
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,600
OK, yeah, yeah.

741
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,520
But I don't know.

742
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,200
What other toys are in your box, Mike?

743
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,400
So what we got here?

744
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,880
Yeah, I have the Dream Finder in the water.

745
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,160
I have like the Polynesian kind of icon here.

746
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,320
Now, what I was keeping tabs on, like

747
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,040
I had never maybe looked at the full list of these.

748
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,800
And that's one.

749
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,400
I was like, do I want any more of these?

750
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,680
That is definitely one that I might go for.

751
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,960
Yeah, yeah, pretty cool.

752
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,640
And some. Yeah, that's that's on there.

753
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,960
They have I'm trying to think there are.

754
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,120
There's not really like an icon

755
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,320
of the contemporary or anything.

756
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,040
But they're like even like a park star of the contemporary

757
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,800
because they didn't do buildings or anything

758
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,840
would be really fun, I feel like. Sure.

759
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,600
But they did do 2017 Trader Sam.

760
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,080
Yes, I have that as well.

761
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,520
Eventually removed. Right.

762
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,760
So that's a canceled one.

763
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,360
Like the redhead is gone now.

764
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,360
Oh, yeah. Over here.

765
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,000
She's out of the.

766
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,160
That is not warrior redhead.

767
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,880
I have Trader Sam, but yeah,

768
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,480
they probably would not make him now.

769
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,200
Waldo, Waldo, I got Waldo over here.

770
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,000
That's also on my list of I wouldn't mind having a Waldo.

771
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,360
Do you have Sonny Eclipse as well?

772
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,720
I do have Sonny Eclipse. OK, that's I have bought

773
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,320
Funmeister love that because the Funmeister

774
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,280
lives like almost entirely as logo.

775
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,800
Yes. And that's like he's kind of in the factory

776
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,920
pomo squiggle style.

777
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,840
And I like having a figured that one.

778
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,560
I get your joy seeing that like

779
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,480
Rex. It's not my favorite depiction of Rex.

780
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,920
But I like you, Mike.

781
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,120
I think I like my action figure that just looks like him more.

782
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,400
Of course, the giant one.

783
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,480
They did the plays music.

784
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,080
And Sonny Eclipse, I have loved that.

785
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,040
And Smart One, I have.

786
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,240
And Smart One is important to me because.

787
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:00,080
OK, so my Aaron and I both always liked kind of like simple

788
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,400
little stout 80s robots.

789
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,720
And our wedding cake toppers were

790
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,640
R2D2 with a little tuxedo

791
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,720
triangle. That was me.

792
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,320
And then the bride was Ernie, who is this little robot with a jetpack,

793
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,480
who is the icon of this event, Expo 86 in Vancouver,

794
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,560
who's who has a veil.

795
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,640
And we've kept those and displayed them in our home.

796
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,520
And then we had our son.

797
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,720
We were like, well, he's got to join the collection.

798
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,520
There's this little alcove in our outside of our bedroom

799
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,840
that's probably like where a phone used to go.

800
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,320
But now it's like, well, what do we put there?

801
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,480
I would have better little robots.

802
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,800
And we got to we got to make one of them our son.

803
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,080
And that's Smart One.

804
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,240
That's really we have a little and the proportions are great.

805
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,600
There's a little robot who's the son of the two slightly bigger robots.

806
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,760
That's really so smart.

807
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,680
Yeah. So Smart One's ended up being very important that that doing that

808
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,320
almost made me because I don't really say his name on the show.

809
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,880
And you're showing him right now. He's always wonderful.

810
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,600
I don't say my son's name on the show.

811
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,280
And I thought when we had him,

812
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,760
what if we just what if we call him Smart One?

813
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,280
What if that's the code?

814
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,760
And but I've never I was like,

815
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,560
that might get very complicated as the years go by.

816
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,320
So I'm not done.

817
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,760
But I was almost like, all right, if I can get used to like.

818
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,000
So, you know, we're out with Smart One.

819
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,800
And in theory, it's like good.

820
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,840
But like actually in practice, I feel like it would be like confusing.

821
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,720
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

822
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,680
Then that's like then the listeners have to like,

823
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,720
why does he keep saying smart?

824
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
What's that about his code for his kid?

825
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,280
And then if I were to have another, then like, does that imply

826
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,160
that's not the smart one?

827
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,520
Yeah, that's a good. Yeah.

828
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,920
Smart One Hendrix. Come on.

829
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,240
We have to go.

830
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,360
And then like Smart Two, like you get a different one

831
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,920
and like customize it or something.

832
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,680
Oh, that's not smart. One and Smart Two.

833
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,440
Oh, sure. Yeah.

834
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,560
So I guess that's OK. Yeah.

835
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,840
I'll give him a complex.

836
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,960
I'm the second. You're number two.

837
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,400
You're always number two.

838
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,600
What happens, Jason, do you have yours displayed right now at home?

839
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,440
No, I still have it in a box.

840
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,880
So I don't have them displayed either.

841
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,240
Which ones do you have again?

842
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,880
I have about a dozen, I think, between the five series.

843
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,480
Yeah, because I always I told you when we were driving over,

844
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,000
I like the thrill of the blind box.

845
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,800
Sometimes he said, yes, Jason said I like he likes the sort of mystery of it.

846
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,760
You said I like the chase, I think.

847
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,600
Oh, I do like the chase, not to be confused with the chaser variance.

848
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,720
Right. Because so they call when there's blind boxes and there's they'll say,

849
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,600
OK, here's here's all the different things you can get in a blind box.

850
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,360
And then there will be a couple of things with a question mark that says the chase.

851
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,640
And that's the mystery thing.

852
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,920
Jason didn't mean that he was looking for the chase.

853
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,800
He just meant he wanted he liked the surprise of opening up the box.

854
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,200
Yeah, I don't think I like some of the variance.

855
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,360
Hey, tell me what you don't like.

856
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:57,120
I don't know. I just some of the ones that I don't like the diamond celebration ones.

857
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,000
Well, that's true. I don't.

858
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
So basically, you know, they would release series, a series of these,

859
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,240
and then they would do like special ones where you wouldn't be blind.

860
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,280
It would just be like the diamond release version of like,

861
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,440
I don't know, the Yeti or something or the Tiki Bird.

862
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,200
And they would just like sort of paint it like a diamond color,

863
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,520
which is really just like silver and blue.

864
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,440
And it's like with these they call these variants in the figure world.

865
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,320
It's like, what do we get?

866
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,600
What are we getting out of these?

867
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,800
What joy are you seeing seeing a character

868
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,040
painted a color that doesn't look like it looks in the park?

869
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,760
Like, it's not so fun.

870
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,360
There's one that's pretty clever, and it's the Abraham Lincoln one

871
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,600
that looks like a penny.

872
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,560
Yes, which I have.

873
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,440
And you can at least appreciate the cleverness of making Lincoln

874
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,040
in like a copper at the very least.

875
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,200
Oh, ha ha ha.

876
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,840
Oh, ha ha ha is what you say.

877
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,600
And that's every time Mike sees it. Oh, ha ha.

878
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,440
I say, oh, ha ha ha.

879
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,160
And I and I was so ha ha ha.

880
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,120
Come on, pop pop pop pop.

881
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,280
Come on, Danny, let's go, ha ha ha.

882
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,760
Do you have the what's his name from the Avengers Club, Jason?

883
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,280
The Colonel? I don't know if I do at the car.

884
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,800
That feels like one you should have.

885
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,080
Yeah, as I'm looking at this list, I was I had the same reaction.

886
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,560
Oh, I should have the car.

887
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,200
I am realizing, as I said earlier, I have the corner

888
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,880
tourists from Dinosaur.

889
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,320
Oh, yeah. I think Aladar did get made. Did he?

890
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:31,000
There is one that just says I don't think Aladar is in there.

891
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,960
Yeah, there's a generic kind of looking dinosaur in series four.

892
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,320
You think that's Aladar?

893
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,720
I think it's supposed to be Aladar for the

894
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,920
whatever kind of dinosaur you're going to need to confirm that.

895
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,960
I'll keep looking and I'll see if I think I have that somewhere.

896
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,800
I had a mission. Oh, you know what?

897
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,240
I had a mission space astronaut, but I sold it out of spite.

898
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,920
I don't want mission space because I don't like mission space.

899
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,960
What was it?

900
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,240
It was just this kind of like generic astronaut looking guy right here.

901
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,160
He's kind of got a red spacesuit.

902
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,120
I don't think this is because that because Aladar is not blue.

903
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,160
It's not. What is this from?

904
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,960
This is is it like?

905
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,160
Well, it's not like the the

906
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,560
Gertie from Disney and James Studios, right?

907
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,040
No, it's not the Windsor.

908
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,400
No, yeah. Yeah.

909
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,800
Gertie, I mean, yeah, I don't know.

910
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,000
I would have to look go back through here.

911
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,720
This is a thing with the Park Stars was that like, oh, it's the caveman

912
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,240
from such and such, you know, like, no, that's actually from spaceship

913
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,800
or or like anything that could like, oh, it's the astronaut from Epcot.

914
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,440
It's like, no, it's from the original Disney.

915
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,880
Well, there was so it could be mission space.

916
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,920
Astronaut could be a space mountain astronaut.

917
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,640
There was a blue version, I think, that was Space Mountain,

918
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,520
but they use it was basically just the same sculpt

919
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,920
and they would use it for mission space then as well.

920
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,200
Yeah. You know, now I'm seeing it as a Guanadon.

921
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,760
So it could be I think that's what Aladar is, Aladar.

922
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:07,240
Yeah, I just it's confusing because the color is not his color,

923
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,920
which we know is the cutest, cutest,

924
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,600
very, very beige, as beige as his little shit,

925
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,200
which is the cutest little shit in all of history or prehistory.

926
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:28,360
As beige as Windows 95 or whatever version of Linux was out in 98 would allow.

927
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,560
So, yeah, so there's I'm just so yeah, you don't have any of yours displayed

928
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,760
just because do you do you have a place in the display for them right now?

929
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,960
Or do you think like you're just going to have to eventually figure out

930
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,800
where to put it eventually?

931
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,160
Well, you know, what part of the problem is, is that I like the tins

932
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,200
I have them all in the tins they sold them in and they take up so much root.

933
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,000
The first few series had tins that you would actually get them in.

934
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,960
They weren't eventually they switched more to paper, to cardboard,

935
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,080
cardboard, thicker stock, but still.

936
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,520
But you would get like these substantial tins

937
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,200
when you would just get one of them or get obviously all of them.

938
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,200
But that was also sort of a fun way to display, perhaps as well,

939
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,480
like put them on top of them or in front of them,

940
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,280
because generally when you buy a toy, I open most of the toys I have,

941
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,120
except for Garfield, who's sitting sweltering in the heat.

942
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,120
But suffering, suffering, some might say.

943
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,440
But yeah, you did feel like there was some extra value in getting a tin,

944
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,160
getting a little tin along with your toy.

945
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,760
And I think I threw some of them up, but I do have some of them

946
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,400
whenever they return to a display.

947
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,240
It's always the quickest thing to go for me is if when I need space

948
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,400
or if I'm cleaning up, it's like whatever the toy came in.

949
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,840
I keep it for a while.

950
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,160
Like you might end up one day and maybe you put them in, like, no out.

951
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,960
He saves so much room when you know, I know I end up doing that as well,

952
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,240
because some stuff, especially now with toys and like certain collector toys,

953
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,000
like the boxes are really great.

954
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,160
So you can like display things and it looks pretty good.

955
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,640
And even if you even click like boxes will come with like a backdrop

956
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,600
that looks cool to display a figure in front of.

957
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,200
So there's like a lot of stuff

958
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,760
that you can actually use for a display.

959
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,440
But if you have a bunch of crap like I do, you probably got to throw the box away.

960
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,760
Like it's just so much room is taken up with with the box.

961
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,120
Yeah, I mean, Marvel Legends, by and large, come in

962
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:28,520
like kind of generic black boxes, packaging.

963
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:34,720
But they start doing more and more throwback cards, which in my house

964
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,720
they always called them backers and would drive my mom nuts.

965
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,160
There just be stacks of backers

966
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,600
if we have action figures, partially because the figures were kind of basic.

967
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,200
But the art on the card transport was cool.

968
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,280
Yeah. Well, yeah.

969
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,200
And in like my when I would have my Ninja Turtles,

970
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,040
I would have them all in like a big like suitcase.

971
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,440
And then you would have the like backs of the cards

972
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,960
because they would have like stats on Donatello, like Donatello five, three,

973
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:07,280
16 years old skills, science, not driving, not driving.

974
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,720
Not driving.

975
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,240
But so I had all that stuff, but I never did anything with it.

976
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,800
But we I kept them forever.

977
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,040
I don't know if I still have any of those.

978
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,960
That's real. Let's talk like.

979
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,800
Why these are gone, you can't find a good reason why

980
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,480
vilemation in general was discontinued, why these were discontinued.

981
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,960
They did five series of them.

982
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,560
I'm guessing what happened was they were replaced by

983
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,680
things called Tsum Tsums, if you've seen those in the park.

984
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,880
There are things called munchlings now.

985
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,200
Have you seen munchlings, Jason?

986
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:46,240
I think I've seen munchlings and munchlings are not squishamallows.

987
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,040
Munchlings are not squish mellows. Squish mellows.

988
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,440
If we're going into this area, can I say

989
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,640
and I was going to say this for the end is a potential assignment.

990
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,200
But let me let me just because this is exactly where you're heading.

991
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:04,120
While back, I threw out like what are second gates that you want online

992
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:08,720
and Avery at Bolton Nerdist had an idea

993
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,280
that I filed away because this is pretty good.

994
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,160
Here it is. An episode entitled Into the Plush Pile,

995
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,560
where you explain the differences between munchlings,

996
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,400
weemos, Tsum Tsums, wishables,

997
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,400
doorables and all the other varieties of plushes in the Disney universe.

998
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,920
I think that's great, Avery.

999
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,400
And then that didn't even include the one Jason just said.

1000
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,440
There's a whole other one, which are not Disney specific.

1001
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,360
OK, yeah, I don't know that I'm prepared to do that.

1002
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,600
Well, not now, but in the future.

1003
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,080
I think it's a great place to go to take us into the plush pile.

1004
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:48,080
Like what I know about munchlings, which are like little plush things,

1005
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,800
is like they combine Disney and food.

1006
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,880
They combine like Mickey Mouse and like here's Mickey Mouse as a cupcake

1007
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,720
or here Daisy is as a cup of coffee.

1008
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,880
And they're like little plush characters.

1009
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,480
I don't know if they're blind or not.

1010
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,000
This looks like I'm trying to look this looks like some sort of Disney bear

1011
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,720
that's also like a Swiss cake roll or something. Hello.

1012
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,200
So I don't know, Jason might have to get into these right now.

1013
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,800
I can't have them in the house. Try to eat them.

1014
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,920
I did. I looked up because there's a great Funko

1015
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,080
that comes with a little Tower of Terror.

1016
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,760
And I put off I was going to buy this thing because it was for Disney's 50th.

1017
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:33,000
It was on clearance on Amazon for like months and it was $15.

1018
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:38,360
And then suddenly the price jumped up to 50 or now it's $70.

1019
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,120
Yeah, that's what happened. They clear them out.

1020
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:45,280
And then a really cute Tower of Terror Funko plush. Oh, OK.

1021
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,320
Look at how cute it's $6. That doesn't do a lot for me.

1022
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,080
I'll say that. Really? If you like it, I'm not going to try to dissuade you from that.

1023
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,880
But I don't. That doesn't do a lot for me.

1024
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,800
That doesn't look anything like the Tower of Terror to me.

1025
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,720
Also, is Jason ever fillier than when saying Tower of Terror?

1026
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,360
Terror, terror. That brings it out.

1027
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,480
Yeah. You know, so it's a plush.

1028
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,920
It looks kind of like the turr turr.

1029
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,200
We go on a turr turr.

1030
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,920
I think it apparently gets worse as I like worked up her time

1031
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,160
because Jane's like, I don't know what that sentence you just said.

1032
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,240
And I'm like, what are you talking about?

1033
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,560
We've been together for a year.

1034
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,880
And like, she says it back to me.

1035
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,160
I'm like, OK, that does sound like gibberish.

1036
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,640
So, yeah, so that's the munchlings.

1037
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,160
Soom Sooms are just these little like,

1038
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,480
I guess they're like three inches, four inches.

1039
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,560
And they're just these kind of like, what would you even call them?

1040
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,920
Like little eggs, they're little eggless eggs with like little cute faces

1041
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,800
on them that are all the characters, the Disney characters.

1042
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,600
There's just there's tons of them.

1043
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,680
I don't know. We may have one or two.

1044
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,520
But then there's also numeos.

1045
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,000
Did we did was numeo in there?

1046
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,520
That's on the list. Yeah.

1047
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:02,440
Numeos, which I'm a little more intrigued about, though I haven't dabbled.

1048
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:07,640
Numeos are just little plush, but then you can get little outfits for them.

1049
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,480
And that's what I'm all about.

1050
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,840
If you can buy a little leather jacket for Mickey,

1051
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,720
you can get him like kind of a hip like jean and jacket set here.

1052
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,760
And you can really like mix and match the clothes for the plush.

1053
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,560
This is I feel like the use of your use of hip has really

1054
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,280
expanded on the show in the last couple of months.

1055
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,160
And it's always mildly questionable.

1056
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,440
Well, Mickey's so hip.

1057
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,200
Mickey's as hip as the musicians I listen to who are hip.

1058
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,920
Everything is relative when I say hip, as far as this podcast is concerned.

1059
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,320
Mike's running into that Mickey 2013 at Emo Night in Echo Park.

1060
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,680
Sure. Oh, it's pleased to be 11 years ago.

1061
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,040
You can give Mickey, you know, you can finally like kind of have Mickey

1062
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,640
like dress like you would want him when you're hanging out with him

1063
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,520
in your location of your choice, basically.

1064
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,680
So, yeah, you can have Echo Park Mickey.

1065
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,720
But if you don't want that, you can dress them any way you want.

1066
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,760
You can make Mickey who make Mickey your own is what Numeos should

1067
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,400
should be saying. That should be their tagline.

1068
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,000
Do they have a night shirt and a big sleeping cap?

1069
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,560
They have so many clothes. I don't know.

1070
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,720
I hope they do, because then you could have all your care.

1071
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,080
Think about this, Jason.

1072
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,360
Every Disney character, you can now give them a night shirt and a cap,

1073
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,720
and you could all have them like tucked away right by the bedside.

1074
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,520
And so they could all be ready to go to sleep 24 7.

1075
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,560
They're all mad because they're like, I couldn't have seen Marley.

1076
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,080
Must have been a crust of bread or a spot of mustard.

1077
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,360
So they're all going through the night before Christmas. Yeah.

1078
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,680
The torturing them all with ghosts.

1079
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,640
It's Christmas Eve.

1080
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,880
They're being tortured by the chains they forged in life.

1081
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,200
I'm sure there are Christmas night shirt

1082
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,480
numeos where you could do the night before Christmas every night.

1083
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,480
Like you do personally. Yeah.

1084
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,040
Where you have your own night shirt and cap

1085
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,120
and you see Jacob Marley before you go to bed

1086
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,240
and you have the candle, I assume, when you go to the kitchen.

1087
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,280
Yeah. Yeah. A candle holder.

1088
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,320
Because that wax going to drip. Yeah, you're not holding a loose candle.

1089
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,440
When you go to the kitchen. It's ridiculous.

1090
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,560
If you can, if you can make it so that you can put all of your Disney characters

1091
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,720
in sleeping caps and pajamas and keep them, keep them in your bed.

1092
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,200
It's a much easier way for post your death, your relatives to come in

1093
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,600
and realize that you were a more disturbed person than they knew.

1094
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:36,960
Oh, wow. Who, who had any clue what he was going through?

1095
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,280
Yeah. He forged a lot of chains in life. My God.

1096
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,040
I don't let my mom go into the room with all the toys because she,

1097
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,080
she doesn't like it. She's upset by it.

1098
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,720
Well, yeah, because if they have napkin bedding, it's going to burst in the flames.

1099
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,040
Stop everything.

1100
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,840
That's the craziest thing ever said on the show.

1101
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,360
Your mother won't go see your.

1102
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,600
Like I said, no, I don't want her to go in there.

1103
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,880
That's not her saying.

1104
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,960
That's that's not like I can't see my, that's because the way you frame that,

1105
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,760
it was like, you know, you don't want to go into the coroner's office

1106
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,800
and ID your child like, no, it's them.

1107
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,680
No, she doesn't want to like, she doesn't want to acknowledge the reality

1108
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,000
that I have this large collection.

1109
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,760
That's what it sounded like. Yeah.

1110
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,000
But is it her? Is it you?

1111
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,920
Well, it's mostly like I just like, I don't want her going in there

1112
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,840
because I don't want to hear it.

1113
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,280
I don't want to hear anything like, don't you think you have a little too much

1114
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,200
or don't like then she'll try to make like points, like side points that she thinks.

1115
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,960
She does this with everything where she tries to make like a point

1116
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,920
about another person she knows, but clearly she's talking about me.

1117
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,440
And she's trying to, you know, I knew, you know, Mrs.

1118
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:47,760
Collins's son when there was an earthquake was buried in his toys.

1119
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,200
Yeah, I think a little I think it must have been a little like

1120
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:58,360
daffy duck got lodged in his throat and he choked on it and never woke up.

1121
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,400
So exactly.

1122
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,600
That's just an unrelated story to what I've just seen in this room.

1123
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,240
Every aspect of my life, this is how it goes.

1124
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,480
This is what my mom will do.

1125
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,520
And she'll tell a story about somebody else.

1126
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,960
And then I go, I know what you're doing.

1127
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,040
Oh, I know I'm not.

1128
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:11,920
She'll deny it.

1129
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,120
She'll just like as if that story came into her head for no reason

1130
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,000
other than just, oh, it's an interesting story, isn't it?

1131
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,320
So do you need to so she's around helping out with your daughter.

1132
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:26,240
And do you need to kind of like up, up, up, up, up, up on there?

1133
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,560
What's easy about it is that we close that door just general

1134
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,640
because there's that's just a bunch of crap in there.

1135
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,040
And we don't want the daughter or our daughter is too young

1136
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,520
to be in a room with a bunch of little stuff still.

1137
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,960
I thought that she's like eating a ton of stuff, but it's better.

1138
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,560
It's better to have that door closed anyway.

1139
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,360
So if she's watching her, she's not going to open that door.

1140
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,280
OK, because of the baby, because of the child.

1141
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:55,400
So that's why right now is not the door is closed for her safety,

1142
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,800
not for your grown mother's safety psychologically.

1143
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,600
Exactly. Yes.

1144
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,520
And it's like you're talking about a porno dungeon.

1145
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,280
We get that close.

1146
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,800
You keep the porno dungeon wide open, but the toys,

1147
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,280
the Ninja Turtle room, the room with the sex swing is off limits.

1148
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,720
Yeah. House. Yeah.

1149
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,480
You'd be fine with it if you had that.

1150
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,040
That'd be less embarrassing.

1151
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,600
If my mother saw my sex swing, she would know that I've progressed

1152
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,360
and matured in some way.

1153
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,560
She sees a room full of just so.

1154
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,760
Wait, it's the toys that I bought for you growing up,

1155
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,520
but 10 times more of them recently purchased.

1156
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,560
Why can you not just have a bunch of vibrators like a regular person?

1157
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,320
Yeah, that would be.

1158
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,560
Yeah, that would be an easier sell plushes.

1159
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,160
No pocket pussies. Yes.

1160
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,560
That phrase, my mom would pass out if that phrase was ever

1161
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,200
uttered around her.

1162
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,240
Look, mom, you should be proud of me.

1163
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,400
I bought a pocket.

1164
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,760
My dad, when he's listening to this, is going to wait, wait, wait.

1165
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:03,080
I make your dad.

1166
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,960
What do your dad sees either of us?

1167
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,480
Does he kind of like take a deep breath?

1168
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,320
He knows everything he's heard.

1169
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,160
Let's go talk to him.

1170
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,840
He knows he has it all in there.

1171
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,880
I thought he was doing OK.

1172
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,960
I thought he could have afforded a flashlight.

1173
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,240
I don't know why he's got all these generic pocket pussies around.

1174
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,520
They're so gummy.

1175
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,560
I've also had an argument where I'm like, Mom, the show isn't that dirty.

1176
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,040
I've also had that argument with her in general.

1177
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,400
So here's this one.

1178
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,720
This will completely disprove what I was trying to say.

1179
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,840
There's nothing wrong with having a sex toy or two around the house.

1180
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,800
You're an adult man.

1181
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,960
Well, he's going to be there's where do you if you're her

1182
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,800
and you're listening to this, where do you start?

1183
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:45,200
The last 10 minutes of this is five avenues to unpack.

1184
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,080
Oh, no, it's going to be a problem.

1185
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,800
Maybe I like try to like unsubscribe my dad's phone or something

1186
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,320
for like, how do you how do you close the door on a podcast?

1187
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,240
Up, up, up. Don't go in there.

1188
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,440
Don't go. Make sure to not go in that one room in my house

1189
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,000
and don't go in that one gate on my podcast.

1190
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,600
Oh, I just keep my mom.

1191
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,120
Not for you.

1192
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,920
It's because I'm worried that my daughter will choke on topics in that game.

1193
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,720
Right, right.

1194
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,800
My mom stays on the East Coast.

1195
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,000
She saw my apartment.

1196
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,600
She was like, how do you have comic book boxes out here, too?

1197
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,000
You're not getting the ones out of my house.

1198
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,680
I'm like, yeah, I don't.

1199
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,960
How do you transport those across country?

1200
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,120
I get a pod.

1201
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,360
You did. Yeah.

1202
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,440
Did you get one of those pot like you?

1203
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,520
No, I'm trying to think.

1204
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,160
My parents, I guess, did you try for?

1205
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,680
How did I get some of them out?

1206
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,840
Huh? That is a good question.

1207
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,800
What other toys do we have?

1208
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,560
Well, these are a little few more photos of new meals.

1209
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,080
So heavy. Here's Mickey and Minnie.

1210
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,040
Here are them in sleeping bags to talk about

1211
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,040
one of my mother not letting me use napkins as sleeping bags for characters.

1212
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,440
These are official sleeping bags.

1213
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,240
How big are those?

1214
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,840
And now here's hip clothes for Pooh and friends.

1215
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,360
Who wears jeans and a vest and a striped shirt.

1216
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,480
And yours got like a jean jacket.

1217
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,400
Hang on. Are you sure that's really the Pooh?

1218
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,400
Are you not showing me a photo of a band on the Garden State soundtrack?

1219
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,520
Is this is that just a promotional photo for a set at Bumbershoot?

1220
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,760
It could be.

1221
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,120
This could be a hip band.

1222
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,200
They're playing the NUEMO festival.

1223
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,160
Look at the shoes. Look at Portland.

1224
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,600
Look at Piglet's shoes.

1225
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,200
Look at his cool shoes.

1226
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,160
Pooh. Yeah, Pooh.

1227
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,000
Oh, no, Pooh's shoes as well.

1228
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,600
Pooh's got like brown shoes.

1229
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,160
Pooh's shoes as well.

1230
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,200
They've never been that high on the show.

1231
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,440
Brown Oxford's on.

1232
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,920
So like all this stuff replaced Vinylmation stuff in the park.

1233
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,000
I don't fully think it's completely the same audience, though.

1234
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,640
I still think like this is more this can be more for younger kids.

1235
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,160
These park stars are for us.

1236
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,520
These are for sick, twisted, older collectors

1237
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,240
who like specific characters for the theme park.

1238
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,480
And I think that they're a victim of, especially the park stars.

1239
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,800
They're a victim of something that just didn't make enough money.

1240
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:08,160
It probably made money, but it doesn't make enough money for Disney

1241
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,400
to want to continue doing it. Sure.

1242
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,840
Because they'd always like almost always be sold out.

1243
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,480
Like the waves would go.

1244
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,920
And it's I mean, I'm assuming it's a fairly limited release.

1245
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,600
But it's one of those things where like,

1246
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:23,080
oh, Parkstar has only made us one hundred thousand dollars a year.

1247
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,080
What's the point? OK.

1248
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,480
That's what I'm guessing would happen.

1249
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,280
And all the different molds and stuff, you know, it's they're all.

1250
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,560
It's like particular to make.

1251
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:35,000
Yes. And it's like you could probably you're going to sell more Mickey.

1252
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:39,080
All that stuff we just mentioned is still like Mickey Donald Goofy.

1253
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,160
Different whatever version you want.

1254
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,040
Do you want them as a breakfast pastry?

1255
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,840
Do you want Mickey as a little egg?

1256
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:51,120
Do you want Mickey as a hip Silver Lake coffee drinker?

1257
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:55,400
Not well, I guess you could have Silver Lake New Meal Mickey drinking coffee

1258
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:59,040
Mickey of a month as a munchling if you wanted.

1259
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,520
And then he's also eating egg Mickey from the Tsum Tsum.

1260
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:08,160
So you could really do it up with Mickey eating and drinking himself

1261
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,320
in a coffee drinker appropriate clothing

1262
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,360
from the New Meal.

1263
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,320
But yes, it's not.

1264
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,560
Yeah. And there are other certain

1265
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,120
clothings that are not appropriate for a coffee drinker.

1266
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,080
Well, sure. Very specific.

1267
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,640
Some think of a type of coffee drinker, the Silver Lake, sort of

1268
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,640
intelligentsia coffee drinker.

1269
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:33,680
Silver Lake is a hip place from a book that I read from 1996.

1270
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,360
Silver Lake is a tip.

1271
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,760
There you see Jason.

1272
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,000
Well, Jason said it and it got in my head.

1273
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,400
And Jason knows all about hip stuff and cool stuff.

1274
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,320
So that's what I was going to our friend over here in the Atlantic

1275
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,480
City Planet Hollywood shirt knows.

1276
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,640
Cool. Jason knows.

1277
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:53,600
Cool. So so I just it sucks because I wish they would.

1278
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,760
Disney will like obviously they do a lot of licensed products

1279
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,720
and other companies make their stuff.

1280
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,800
But it's almost like something that like it would have to be produced out of how

1281
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,240
it would have to be produced by a different company

1282
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,160
that wants to do something like this.

1283
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,400
And from what I also understand, it's very hard for other companies

1284
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,840
to make park specific stuff.

1285
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,800
Disney is still pretty like strict about what you're allowed to make.

1286
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,480
If you're just a toy company that wants to make Disney toys,

1287
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,200
you can make Mickey, you can make Minnie, you can do stuff like that.

1288
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:26,720
But I think like Hatbox Ghost, you cannot make like they are still

1289
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,800
like really like proprietary about their park characters for some reason.

1290
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,800
So I think it's I don't I don't ever see them doing anything like this again.

1291
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,840
And it seems like it's going to be really tough for another company

1292
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,080
to make a parks line.

1293
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:47,040
But but like a company called Super 7 has made some like Haunted Mansion toys

1294
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,560
of some of the different characters.

1295
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:52,640
But that seems like that's the only ride they're like kind of flexible with.

1296
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,600
But I know they can where they feel like there's money to be made

1297
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,320
in the cult of it, that there's the people are picking apart every detail enough.

1298
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:03,280
Yes. But but also just like I think Disney is looking for a certain

1299
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,440
amount of money that things can make.

1300
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,520
And there are companies that would make park stuff and make a profit on it.

1301
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,120
But is it enough to then pay Disney some money from the license

1302
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,760
that would make it feel like it was still worth their while

1303
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,680
to let them use their characters? Right.

1304
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,400
This is kind of guessing on my part.

1305
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,440
But you're saying that this is the kind of thing that makes like a cult type of money,

1306
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,080
but which doesn't rate if you're Disney.

1307
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:30,400
That's what I think is happening, because I don't know why there wouldn't be

1308
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,240
tons of versions of this, why there wouldn't be Tsum Tsums of the Phantom

1309
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,960
or of Wally. Why isn't there a Tsum Tsum of Wally Bogue?

1310
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,880
Why isn't there a Numio of Wally Bogue?

1311
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,080
You want just a little cuddled up baby sized Wally Bogue.

1312
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,520
Yeah. A real man who walks this earth.

1313
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,240
Mark Twain Numio.

1314
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,280
Jason would have the Mark Twain Numio.

1315
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:49,960
Oh, I would love that.

1316
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,480
And dress him in all sorts of little outfits, which would be fun.

1317
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,080
But obviously, like, that's not for the general public.

1318
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:00,800
That's one little Mark Twain to dress up as eggs and bacon.

1319
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,880
Jason Wood, which food would you want Mark Twain to be for muchlings?

1320
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,600
Oh, that's a great, great question.

1321
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:11,080
I was going to say dress him up in a little sailor suit,

1322
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:14,440
like he was working on the riverboat.

1323
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,120
That's for his Numio.

1324
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,200
Oh, that's for his Numio.

1325
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,280
I'm talking about for a Mark Twain munchling.

1326
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,120
Maybe something

1327
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:28,160
appropriate, maybe like some sarsaparilla.

1328
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:32,400
OK. Maybe a sarsaparilla float, like a big root beer float in his hand.

1329
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,040
And his hair is like the foam.

1330
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,360
His hair is like the foam.

1331
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,160
That's great. Yeah.

1332
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,800
But yeah, so I just I'm disappointed

1333
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,320
because it feels like we'll never get this again.

1334
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,080
Now, I've thought that about toys before.

1335
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,880
Well, there's no way we'll ever get blank.

1336
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:46,640
And then it happens.

1337
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,440
So I hope I am wrong about it.

1338
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:52,240
But a full like there's still so much to make

1339
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,000
as far as characters that have never been made before.

1340
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,440
There's what's his name?

1341
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,120
Uncle What's his name from the Carousel of Progress?

1342
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,240
Uncle Orville. Thank you.

1343
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,640
Uncle Orville, all the characters from the Carousel of Progress.

1344
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,680
Do they not ever? There's not one Carousel of Progress.

1345
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,800
There's a John Vinylmation.

1346
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,360
Yeah, he's wearing all of his outfits, kind of.

1347
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,400
Yeah, and I don't really like it.

1348
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,800
Patchwork. Yeah, I don't love it.

1349
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,240
I don't like the I don't like the having to incorporate the mouse ears.

1350
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,440
Yeah, some of the characters look OK with the mouse ears.

1351
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,160
But yeah, there's a Vinylmation, but like they didn't make those characters.

1352
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,280
They didn't make there isn't a hatbox ghost.

1353
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,680
There is. There's some big ones that they haven't done.

1354
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,480
And I just like I'm again, a sad I'm always sad at the end of these episodes.

1355
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,160
Sad that I feel like there's we're not getting more.

1356
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:40,080
We're never going to get all this stuff that we want because it's still sort of obscure.

1357
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:46,200
They were doing more limited run like than like they used to have that line of T-shirts.

1358
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,160
The yesteryear line.

1359
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,400
Yes, which I have a handful of those with throwback stuff.

1360
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,920
Right. And it feels like they don't do though.

1361
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,920
Once in a while on Shop Disney, they'll have like a retro shirt.

1362
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,720
But they really don't do that as much anymore.

1363
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,120
Unless like a ride is closing.

1364
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:03,360
They'll do like a run of shirts of like if they're destroying a classic ride.

1365
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,600
They're taking we don't have any great at the door.

1366
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,840
There's no great movie ride merchandise until we're destroying the ride.

1367
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,240
And then there will be a shirt or two that you can get.

1368
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:19,520
We're taking a wrecking ball to bear Fox's head, but we need the guts in P intact.

1369
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,560
So be careful.

1370
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:25,960
Uh huh. So, yeah, I mean, my dream is a full line that's like,

1371
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:30,600
yeah, they're like six or seven inches and they're all to scale, which is important to me.

1372
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,400
I'm a real scale hound.

1373
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,320
I don't know what you would call it.

1374
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,920
I really like scale queen.

1375
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,480
I'm a scale size.

1376
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,640
I'm a size queen.

1377
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,520
I think that's what you could say that about me.

1378
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,400
What that means, though, is that I want my figures to scale.

1379
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,200
I want to make sure that if the.

1380
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,960
You want all your big, your bright, beautiful park stars.

1381
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,200
Yes, right.

1382
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,480
My big right.

1383
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,080
For their size to be adequate.

1384
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,560
This is not look at this.

1385
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,880
Figment and the Dreamfinder are almost the same height.

1386
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,520
This is ridiculous.

1387
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,160
It's ridiculous.

1388
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:08,080
That is definitely worth being mad about.

1389
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:12,080
Well, I'm just saying, would you prefer to have them both the same size like this?

1390
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:15,040
Or would you want Dreamfinder to be like seven inches

1391
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:17,480
and then Figment to be like one or two, two inches?

1392
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:22,120
I mean, Figment can grow and shrink and change his outfit and stuff.

1393
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,080
So I understand that, but he's not big all the time.

1394
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,080
Right. Well, let me ask you guys this.

1395
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,080
Is there a if you just have to think about it as a thought exercise,

1396
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:35,000
is there a like a version, would you want plushes of some of these characters?

1397
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,800
Would you want six inch figures?

1398
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,640
They're just a couple of characters.

1399
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:41,560
You would want like a 12, like a big would you buy a big Figment

1400
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,240
figure if it was like the size of that Rex from Galaxy's Edge?

1401
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,280
The answer could be no.

1402
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,520
I like 12 inches.

1403
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:53,200
We are now dealing with like a major, a lot of space.

1404
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,560
It's a lot of commitment. Yeah.

1405
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,600
And I do have like big theme park display

1406
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:02,000
signs and stuff, but like it's got I got to love the character.

1407
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,960
Right. Do I love Figment?

1408
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,680
I do like Figment, but do I do I 12 inches love Figment?

1409
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,560
Big question. Big question.

1410
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,640
Do you love 12 inches worth of Figment?

1411
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
How many inches of Figment do you like?

1412
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,320
12 tall purple inches of Figment.

1413
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,160
Do you want six inches of Figment or do you want 12?

1414
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:25,600
I would have to say I think I think I could handle

1415
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,320
six inches of Figment.

1416
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,760
So shorter. But would you want it wider?

1417
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,440
Yeah. Like a chode? Chode Figment.

1418
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:36,960
Jason, what do you think?

1419
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,560
What do you what do you want from like these park characters?

1420
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,360
Because like we're all yeah, you want the characters themselves.

1421
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,560
Well, what version of them or do you want just more park stars?

1422
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,680
I'd love more park stars.

1423
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:51,280
I think I'd like something maybe a little taller,

1424
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,400
maybe like seven.

1425
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,000
Sorry, not to what up you, Scott.

1426
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,440
But that's the traditional like Marvel Legends.

1427
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,360
Marvel Legends are like seven inches.

1428
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:02,480
OK, so something I can handle seven.

1429
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:07,160
Something a little taller and articulate it so you can pose them.

1430
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:11,320
I think I'd like that's what I always wanted as a kid.

1431
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,600
I had so many like PVC figurines as a kid.

1432
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,720
And you would have to imagine it moving

1433
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,600
because you couldn't bend like Star Wars

1434
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,480
or like Disney character or like PVC figures.

1435
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,360
That's what I want. Yes. Yeah.

1436
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:31,880
So six, seven inch scale articulation, little hands,

1437
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,960
different heads, different expressions like the ultimates

1438
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,040
that NECA makes or Super Seven makes or.

1439
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,400
Yeah. I mean, the thing I like about

1440
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:45,000
the park stars or Marvel Marvel Legends

1441
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,720
is that you can pose them,

1442
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:51,840
but you can also put them on the top of a dresser or bookshelf or something.

1443
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,920
Plushes take up so much room.

1444
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:59,400
So I like the little ones like the like Mr.

1445
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,520
Taffy that I brought you guys.

1446
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,600
And we have a couple sure around the house.

1447
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:09,160
But like, I don't think I'd want I couldn't handle 12 inches of Mr. Taffy.

1448
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,760
I disagree.

1449
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,600
I think you could.

1450
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:14,760
12 inches of Taffy.

1451
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,720
OK, all right.

1452
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:18,600
Mr. Taffy is too much of a scam.

1453
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,920
How is the Taffy soft or is it firm?

1454
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:22,800
Somewhere in between.

1455
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,040
12, well. Do you need a massage to get it firm?

1456
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,360
You like the Taffy, you warm it up?

1457
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,160
You warm the Taffy up before you eat?

1458
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:33,240
If Taffy is hard, you can warm it between your hands to soften it.

1459
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,240
We've been over this.

1460
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,880
Well, that refreshes it for another year.

1461
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:36,840
It refreshes it.

1462
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,400
You can also put it in the freezer and take it down.

1463
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,280
Right. Sure.

1464
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,680
But I was asking your preference.

1465
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:47,920
Oh, I like Taffy, like fresh off the lot, like pretty soft, you know.

1466
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,200
Soft Taffy Jason likes.

1467
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,920
Not pull your teeth out.

1468
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:54,800
Give it to him soft is what I would say to a Taffy maker.

1469
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,120
OK, so there's a list.

1470
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:03,560
I found a list of of people's wants as far as other characters,

1471
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,440
which I guess is a good place to maybe end.

1472
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,320
Sure. Yeah.

1473
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,880
Be hopeful, not be negative about what we won't.

1474
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,560
Yeah, OK, we want to do every name.

1475
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,080
And I'm like, oh, they don't have it.

1476
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,920
Weezy from Toy Story at the end of the Slinky Dog Dash,

1477
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,840
which I think is would be a good one.

1478
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,560
Yeah. It's in a movie.

1479
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,920
I don't want it. I want things that are only in parts.

1480
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:27,680
Space Mountain Lab Retriever,

1481
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,640
which I'm trying to remember what that even is.

1482
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:30,760
Is that a Disney World?

1483
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:33,520
Computer engineer for the 70s.

1484
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,160
Yes, they do on Spaceship Earth. Yes.

1485
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,680
And I have her too.

1486
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,760
They have, let's see, Lab Retriever.

1487
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,400
Is that there's a dog?

1488
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,440
Is there a dog like when?

1489
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:49,840
Is this something with a there's a dog in like a with like a Victrola?

1490
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,880
Was RCA a sponsor?

1491
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,200
Yeah, that's that's what this is.

1492
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,560
Yeah, yeah. OK. I've never I don't know this section

1493
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:58,920
because this is before my time at Disney World.

1494
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,960
But yeah, OK, RCA was the sponsor.

1495
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,080
So it's a little dog next to a record player.

1496
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,120
Wow. I've never seen this before.

1497
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,520
The Haunted Mansion guy holding the gun

1498
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,200
in the portrait that turns around with the gun.

1499
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,440
Well, you would need both.

1500
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,360
You didn't. Yeah. Well, I was just when you mentioned Haunted Mansion earlier,

1501
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,800
I was like, why don't I have any merch of the Dueling portraits?

1502
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:19,720
Right. Yeah.

1503
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:22,000
Somebody wrote on here, Steven Tyler with Mike Stanton.

1504
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,040
That'd be good. We know what you want.

1505
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,840
That'll be my third Steven Tyler toy.

1506
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,360
What are the is there like a Simpsons?

1507
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:31,280
And no, that's right.

1508
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,920
You got me the Funko Pop.

1509
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,960
And then I have a Simpsons Steven Tyler as well.

1510
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,600
Well, so I would like a friend of Park Star.

1511
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,080
Yeah, go ahead. Yeah.

1512
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:44,760
I was going to say, because there is an Albert from Mystic Manor.

1513
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,760
Yes. Yeah, I have him. Yeah.

1514
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,320
Is it Henry Mystic?

1515
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,160
Oh, yeah. Any of those sea guys?

1516
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:54,280
Right. Yeah, some sea guys.

1517
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:57,240
Well, I also was going to say that, like, yeah, they're like girls.

1518
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:01,080
Camelia Falco, like Tony Baxter, character.

1519
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:02,720
Vinyl. Yeah, yeah.

1520
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,120
Oh, that's a shame. Yeah.

1521
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,520
Joe Rody, Harrison Hightower.

1522
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:11,840
But what I would prefer is a very realistic looking figure that looks exactly.

1523
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,000
They've scanned Tony's face.

1524
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,880
He looks just right.

1525
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:16,840
That's what I would prefer.

1526
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:20,000
But if there's any hope of getting Tony back on the show,

1527
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,280
do not start talking about how you want like a little posable Tony Baxter

1528
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:27,720
to snuggle with at night and to dress up in a breakfast sausage.

1529
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,760
I'm not talking about munchling Tony Baxter or New Meo Tony Baxter.

1530
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:32,440
Making sure.

1531
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:36,160
Although, wait a minute, we already burnt the bridge with both of your parents.

1532
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,880
So we're not going to now burn it with Tony.

1533
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,000
Hold on a second.

1534
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:44,440
If New Meo wanted to do Imagineers and we could dress the Imagineers in little clothes,

1535
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,600
then maybe I'm on board.

1536
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,080
I go to the bathroom while you work this idea out.

1537
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:54,400
You want to put Marty Sklar in like a little puffer vest, which I do.

1538
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,600
I can't be so distant because like, all right.

1539
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,880
Just ask me, do you want an action figure of Marty Sklar?

1540
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,400
Yes, absolutely.

1541
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,120
Do you want to be able to dress up Marty Sklar in a little outfit?

1542
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,600
No, you freak.

1543
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,000
You took it too far.

1544
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,240
Well, I'm only a little weird.

1545
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,920
This is starting to become the Mr.

1546
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,280
Belvedere support group sketch from SNL.

1547
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,520
I call him Brock Toon.

1548
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,120
Yeah.

1549
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:22,120
So I so there is something if they wanted to start making Imagineers

1550
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,680
as these new characters, like any version of Imagineer I am,

1551
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:30,080
I'm in favor of and would probably buy if they want.

1552
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,800
So series one is, you know, it's Tony, it's Joe, it's

1553
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,640
Claude Coats.

1554
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:36,640
Well, is it?

1555
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,320
I don't know what Claude Coats looks like.

1556
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,760
Claude, we got to go with icon.

1557
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,520
We got to go with I know the face.

1558
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,800
I think that's really Mark and Alice Davis.

1559
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,960
Maybe one.

1560
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,120
Maybe, uh, uh, getting Marty Sklar's in there.

1561
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,720
Yeah, Bob Gershir.

1562
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,880
Yeah, I think that's a girl's got to have a toy.

1563
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:53,800
There was somebody.

1564
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,880
Didn't they make a fungal pop of Bob Gershir or something?

1565
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,040
Somebody made Bob Gershir merchandise.

1566
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,800
He's got like a clothing line now.

1567
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,800
Yeah, he's got a talk show.

1568
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:02,960
I'm not sure what happened.

1569
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,440
I'm thrilled for him.

1570
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,840
I'm just like, what's going on?

1571
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,520
Going up the girl industry.

1572
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,400
I'm happy for him.

1573
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:08,840
Yeah.

1574
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,720
So maybe there are some girls girl would have a new meal.

1575
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:14,960
And then later, I think you'd, you know, not to say not do it.

1576
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,000
I'll buy a coats.

1577
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,240
I just think I just I can't picture what Claude Coats.

1578
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,760
Claude Coats is wave three.

1579
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,560
That's wave three.

1580
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,320
That's wave four.

1581
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,000
That's when you're starting.

1582
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:27,360
That's when you're doing Joe Lance's zero and Bruce Gordon.

1583
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:31,240
And it's maybe Scott Trowbridge is famous enough to be wavy.

1584
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,680
Yeah, maybe.

1585
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,800
Yeah, you want a couple of a couple newer people.

1586
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,200
Yeah.

1587
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,520
In wave two.

1588
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,000
So it's not all old folks.

1589
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,360
And you know, before you even get to before you've even made a single one of these tomorrow.

1590
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,760
Give me that tomorrow.

1591
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,920
Give me every outfit in the world for him.

1592
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,440
Wow.

1593
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,480
There's not one breakfast pastry.

1594
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,560
I don't want to see daddy tomorrow.

1595
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,600
You would buy him.

1596
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,360
You would give him one of each new meal outfit, too.

1597
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,720
So you could give him a new outfit every day.

1598
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:05,440
Given the clear plastic backpack so he can get into the Honda Center.

1599
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,000
You forgot to dress our son.

1600
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:12,400
You were so busy dressing and undressing tomorrow.

1601
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:18,920
So so, yeah, somebody also wrote here there are other people giving their wish list.

1602
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:22,720
Divine, of course, which I think we recently talked about.

1603
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:23,120
What?

1604
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,520
Do you guys not know what I'm talking about?

1605
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:24,920
I don't.

1606
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:27,640
I think the vine is from Epcot.

1607
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:32,440
And some might say, oh, no, sorry, Animal Kingdom.

1608
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,120
And I have no idea what this is.

1609
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:34,720
Really?

1610
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,920
I thought we talked about it, but maybe I talked about it with somebody else.

1611
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,760
Divine, you might cheating on us.

1612
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,800
You might not have some other podcast.

1613
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,960
Divine is the tree.

1614
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:45,560
The tree lady.

1615
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,080
We were talking about the tree.

1616
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:50,040
OK, who we have not talked about too much on the show.

1617
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,040
Scary tree.

1618
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,360
Yeah, scary tree lady.

1619
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,920
I know the Scott is going to be a problem for you.

1620
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:54,960
No, thanks.

1621
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,880
If we talked, maybe I tuned it out if we talked about it before.

1622
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:03,360
But I don't know if she still appears, but it says Divine occasionally appears in Disney's

1623
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,800
Animal Kingdom around 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.

1624
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,720
Occasionally around the park entrance, sometimes camouflaged.

1625
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:14,840
And there's different like like Divine is like kind of a green.

1626
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:18,600
She's a woman, like a human woman with like a green face and then just like a bunch of

1627
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:23,120
leaves around her so she can hide in the brush, I suppose.

1628
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:26,240
And I guess she's some sort of like maybe stay in there.

1629
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:27,920
Maybe turn your back.

1630
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:31,880
I don't know. I wonder if anyone has seen Divine in person.

1631
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:37,040
I don't know if she's still out or when the last time somebody saw her years and years ago.

1632
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,720
Yeah, but can you be sure that you saw her?

1633
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,480
You might have seen just a big bush.

1634
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:48,160
Well, Divine episode coming soon when Scott least expect it when he's sleeping.

1635
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:52,760
Well, one of us has to be dressed as Divine when he walks in.

1636
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,840
Jason dressed as Divine.

1637
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,720
The Peacock from Spectro Magic.

1638
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:00,160
I can't picture that either.

1639
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:03,760
But the Dolphi Spectroman is definitely one.

1640
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,880
Unfortunately, that is a good one.

1641
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,440
It is a good one.

1642
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:10,880
You know what they had very specific that did make Park Stars?

1643
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:15,840
The like ribbon creature from the Millennium Celebration at Epcot.

1644
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:16,720
Is that what that is?

1645
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,320
Yeah, Discman.

1646
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,800
Discman.

1647
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,360
I don't actually have Discman.

1648
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,520
But that is one that they have.

1649
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:28,720
I guess Ellen from Ellen's Energy Adventure.

1650
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,040
Well, I would like that.

1651
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:35,720
I want it to be as disheveled as the one I just got to stand next to in the Van Eten gallery.

1652
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:36,720
Right.

1653
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:37,880
Collapsing.

1654
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:43,880
And that's the one where the charm of it would almost be lost if they cutified it in a Park Stars way.

1655
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:47,440
You would want it to be more of a figure that looks disheveled.

1656
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,920
I'd like to see them try though.

1657
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,640
Try to do a cute version of 1996 Ellen.

1658
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:51,720
I'm not against it.

1659
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:52,720
1996 Ellen.

1660
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:58,520
I mean, yeah, Trump, Park Star, they're not doing a Biden Park Star.

1661
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,720
They're done with the presidents.

1662
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:04,200
I wonder if the Hall of Presidents, we thought it was going to be done last time, but maybe

1663
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:09,400
like this next round, let's just, let's get rid of it maybe.

1664
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,400
But there's a lot.

1665
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,920
I think there's a lot left.

1666
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,840
And then there's other characters they just haven't done.

1667
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,720
And I don't know if there's any chance of them ever at least doing Park Stars again,

1668
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,240
but it looks doubtful to me.

1669
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:23,400
How do you know they should do a Partners statue?

1670
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,120
Oh yeah, that's good.

1671
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,120
Yeah, sure.

1672
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:29,680
And they could do the Walt sitting, the Epcot Walt sitting one.

1673
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:30,680
The unbuilt, the pooping one.

1674
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:31,680
Sure, did they build that?

1675
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:32,680
No, they built it.

1676
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:33,680
They did build it.

1677
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:34,680
He's pooping in Epcot.

1678
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:35,680
Oh, that's right.

1679
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:36,680
They put in the pooping one.

1680
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:39,520
Less extravagant for sure, but yeah.

1681
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,200
So there's still, I mean, they got to attribute all the new stuff from the parks, like the

1682
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:49,240
grass and the cornhole games and the hula hoops.

1683
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:50,800
They could do cornhole, yeah.

1684
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,080
A mild bush, the small bush they put in.

1685
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,080
I think that's good.

1686
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,200
Yeah, all the new stuff.

1687
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,800
There's some new characters on the Tiana ride too.

1688
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,320
I think specific new characters to the ride.

1689
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:07,080
Yeah, there's a lot of cute animals playing instruments.

1690
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,680
There's an armadillo that people are really excited about.

1691
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:11,680
Okay.

1692
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:12,960
So yeah.

1693
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:22,480
Well, and I want those Pan Galactic pizza board characters that I want the most.

1694
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:29,200
Tony Solaroni, Officer Zizek's twin international cousin of Sunny Eclipse.

1695
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,200
That's the stuff I want.

1696
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:33,560
I forgot that there is a plush of Tony Solaroni.

1697
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,760
Price is high on that because it's a Japan exclusive.

1698
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:36,760
I'm looking it up right now.

1699
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,840
They had a smaller version of them too, I thought, but maybe not.

1700
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,840
Oh, really?

1701
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:46,080
Japan does these blind, they love blind boxes there and they have so many cool little things

1702
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,080
in their ride vehicles and characters there.

1703
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:53,240
It feels like their merch is better than our, everything is better there, blah, blah, blah.

1704
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,240
But yeah, I don't know.

1705
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,240
Maybe I'm wrong.

1706
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,240
Maybe they don't have a smaller one.

1707
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,240
Maybe I'm misremembering.

1708
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,240
I'm seeing one on eBay.

1709
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:59,240
It's plushes.

1710
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,760
I mean, I'd like to have that, but I don't know if I'm paying a hundred bucks for it.

1711
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,420
This is the thing where I get so spoiled with certain other, like the Ninja Turtles and

1712
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:10,640
other things is because then what you could start to do with Park Stars or any other merch

1713
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:14,440
is you could start to make characters of never built things.

1714
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:18,280
This is like, you could make a Plectu's Galactic Reveal.

1715
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:24,560
You could make characters that we've only seen in concept art and stuff and different

1716
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,640
versions of things.

1717
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:29,840
You could have, I don't know, country bears in the different outfits from the three different

1718
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:33,360
shows that they've done or whatever.

1719
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:38,480
You really could start to get obscure with this stuff.

1720
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,480
But Disney, yeah.

1721
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:46,600
Josh, tomorrow on the swing, on Swing and Teddy Bear's swing, squeeze it up next to

1722
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:51,640
her or just solo, it's really, I mean, it's up to you, just pairs.

1723
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,840
How many characters can tomorrow be hanging out with?

1724
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:55,840
Yeah, it's true.

1725
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,840
Yeah.

1726
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:06,880
Or it's a great idea, I mean, so I feel like I could like map out like ten line, like waves

1727
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:13,320
of a perfect theme park figure line full of like, you know, crowd pleasers like Dreamfinder

1728
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:18,960
and Figment and then you put in like Plectu as well and put in other characters and put

1729
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:25,360
in an Imagineer or two, put Sneak Eisner in as like a Build-A-Figure or something, you

1730
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:29,680
know, something to get all that stuff in that we want.

1731
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:30,800
And there's got to be-

1732
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:35,480
Michael Clarke Duncan doing an introduction to Armageddon in France.

1733
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,480
Yeah.

1734
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,480
Yes.

1735
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:43,880
Benicio, the street clothes, Benicio del Toro doing the introduction for the Guardians ride

1736
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:48,680
at the opening ceremony or whatever George Lucas is wearing at his Michael Eisner opening

1737
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:54,560
Star Tours ceremony in the 80s with the care, like Mickey and Goofy in their like outfits

1738
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,560
and stuff.

1739
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:59,080
Michael Jackson in disguise attending the Captain EO opening.

1740
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,080
Yes.

1741
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,680
Did he do that?

1742
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:02,680
That's a rumor.

1743
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:03,680
Oh, okay.

1744
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,680
It's possible that happened.

1745
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,920
If that's too outlandish, if we don't think that really happened, then Jack Nicholson

1746
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:13,440
attending the Captain EO opening as Angelica Houston's date.

1747
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,440
Right.

1748
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:15,440
Yeah.

1749
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,440
We could really-

1750
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,440
Whatever he was wearing.

1751
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,440
We could really do it up.

1752
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:19,440
This, you know what?

1753
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,960
This is something I might actually do by the time this comes out.

1754
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,320
I will write out like 10 waves of figures that I want.

1755
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,320
Wow.

1756
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,320
Maybe I'll do five.

1757
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,680
We'll see how ambitious I get.

1758
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:30,680
Yeah.

1759
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:32,600
But it is a fun, it is fun.

1760
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,760
Actually, really now I'm just, will you do me a favor if you do that?

1761
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:40,440
Is it okay if a line is just everyone who attended the Captain EO opening?

1762
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:41,440
Yeah.

1763
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:45,960
Because then you get, I think like, you know, it's like Patrick Duffy, it's Coppola himself,

1764
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,600
it's I want to say OJ Simpson.

1765
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,960
We got a good lineup in there.

1766
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:50,960
Wow.

1767
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,880
Well, what you would do generally, you would try to, I think you would want to spread those

1768
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,040
out in every wave.

1769
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,040
Okay.

1770
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,040
It depends.

1771
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,040
So you don't get sick of it.

1772
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,320
Then you don't get people not buying the whole set.

1773
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,320
Exactly.

1774
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:06,880
So people will be like, well, you know, I got the Captain EO opening wave.

1775
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,280
It's not as exciting to me.

1776
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:12,520
You want to sneak in a Coppola in one of them and then you want to sneak in.

1777
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:13,520
Yeah.

1778
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,520
Belinda Carlisle.

1779
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,520
Yes.

1780
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,520
Yeah, yeah.

1781
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:17,520
Robert Palmer.

1782
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,520
Uh-huh.

1783
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:19,520
It doesn't make sense.

1784
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:26,840
Why is, like the moody blues are all the same height, but famously the bassist is shorter

1785
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,080
than the singer.

1786
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,800
This is as crazy as Dreamfinder and Figment.

1787
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,640
God, it makes me want to do the Captain EO opening.

1788
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:41,400
Can I throw out the, because I was thinking like, you know, we've said something we've

1789
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:46,760
gotten away from maybe is like episodes about specific characters, which I think has been

1790
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:47,760
a good format here.

1791
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:48,760
Oh yeah.

1792
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:49,760
Yeah.

1793
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:50,760
We've done it here and there.

1794
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:55,720
If we, let's go with the characters who were in this room right now.

1795
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,520
Maybe just, can you tilt yours up, Jason?

1796
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:00,560
I'll make my, like of the ones that you brought.

1797
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:04,840
If we had to pick one to piece off an entire episode about, because this is a good way

1798
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:05,840
to go.

1799
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:06,840
Oh yeah, yeah.

1800
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:07,840
All right.

1801
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:08,840
To tribute an entire character.

1802
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:09,840
Right.

1803
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,920
Which there's, you know, plenty you could do.

1804
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,480
Almost there could be just a full other Rex episode.

1805
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,480
All of them might be redundant.

1806
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:16,480
Yeah.

1807
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,480
We've talked a lot of Rex before.

1808
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:21,640
But like, there's good candidates here.

1809
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:24,600
Here, I'll lift mine.

1810
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,680
Dynamite Goat is a possibility.

1811
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:27,680
Orange Bird.

1812
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:28,680
Orange Bird.

1813
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:29,680
Is an interesting one.

1814
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:33,840
That might be the most attractive one off the top of my head.

1815
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:34,840
Wally Bogues.

1816
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:36,200
Wally Bogues certainly coming.

1817
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:41,440
We haven't really touched on him, but Dog with Key and Mouth from Pirates.

1818
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,440
That's good too.

1819
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:45,040
We obviously haven't done Pirates in general.

1820
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,040
Yeah.

1821
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,040
I'm thinking Orange Bird.

1822
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,720
I mean, Phantom is such an interesting character to me.

1823
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:52,040
I'm wondering what else is out there as far as info on the Phantom.

1824
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:56,040
But I don't know if Phantom can be separate from Phantom Manor or should it be?

1825
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,040
I don't know that either.

1826
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,600
Is the pick maybe, is it Orange Bird?

1827
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:03,960
I think Orange Bird is the answer.

1828
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:09,560
Well, let's do an Orange Bird and let's do Into the Plush Pile.

1829
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:12,720
You go learn everything.

1830
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,920
You go start doing your research.

1831
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:21,600
Hole up in that room that your mother is not allowed in and allow me to pretend that I

1832
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:26,160
am interested in all the differences between nemos and mush-mushes and everything that

1833
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:33,560
there is just as cover to get more of my parents' psychology specifics out.

1834
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:34,560
Okay, sure.

1835
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:35,560
Yeah, yeah.

1836
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:36,560
I'll forget.

1837
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,160
No, I just want to talk about the different models.

1838
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,160
Okay.

1839
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:44,160
Now, what did your grandmother think of all this?

1840
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:46,840
It's just a therapy session, really, what this is.

1841
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,360
Anytime I get to talk about toys.

1842
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,920
I'll need to give you key.

1843
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:55,320
You will need to come by and save me because if I get too much plush, I'm just going to

1844
01:23:55,320 --> 01:24:00,360
want to snooze under them and I want to suffocate under all this fabric and vinyl.

1845
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:01,360
Under them?

1846
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:02,360
Under them.

1847
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:03,360
Yeah.

1848
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,360
Oh, those big plush piles at toy stores.

1849
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:07,520
I was always like, let me crawl, let me get in there.

1850
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:11,480
My daughter has a big plush pile in this little tent in the living room right now.

1851
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:14,480
So if you saw it, you would have no, you would just go right forward and just go to sleep.

1852
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:19,280
Oh, do you want me to pop over and try to see if I can, I'll pay for the dry cleaning.

1853
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,280
I've got coupons.

1854
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:21,280
Why would you have to dry?

1855
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,280
Because you're going to sweat all over them?

1856
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:23,280
Yeah, sometimes I get sweaty.

1857
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:27,240
You're going to secrete on them?

1858
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,240
I don't know.

1859
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:29,240
Ew.

1860
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:30,240
This is your real daughter.

1861
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:31,240
He said it.

1862
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:32,240
I did not.

1863
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,240
He didn't say secrete.

1864
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,240
He did not say secrete.

1865
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:42,520
I was just trying to be considerate that if I was going to sleep.

1866
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:47,720
As someone who is entering your daughter's plush pile, I'm going to get them all dry

1867
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:48,720
cleaned.

1868
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:49,720
You see?

1869
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:50,720
That's considerate.

1870
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:51,720
That's a normal thing.

1871
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,720
You're right.

1872
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,160
We're all saying all episode has been normal.

1873
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,160
Sweating is, by the way, secreting.

1874
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:00,160
I didn't mean, like secreting is just stuff coming out.

1875
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:02,160
Yeah, but you said it in the nastiest way.

1876
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,160
I did not.

1877
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:05,160
I just don't want the plushes to smell like, I don't know.

1878
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:06,160
Snodder?

1879
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,160
Did you think it got in?

1880
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,160
Snodder?

1881
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,160
It's not weirder when Mike said secrete.

1882
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,160
It's because of what was earlier in the episode.

1883
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:13,600
It's because you had it in your head that way and then I just said that specific term

1884
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:18,800
because I'm a smart guy with a good vocabulary and everyone's on my ass about it.

1885
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:19,800
That's what's happening here.

1886
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:24,560
It's incredible that that usurped the strangeness in general of what Jason said.

1887
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:29,160
Actually wasn't it your suggestion that Jason crawl into your, into the plush pile?

1888
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:32,040
I don't even want to start repeating weird phrases.

1889
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:34,160
You have a plush pile meant for your daughter.

1890
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:36,160
I was just clarifying what he meant.

1891
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:39,160
He said it and I was clarifying what he meant.

1892
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:42,160
I don't want it to smell like tied in the green cool rush.

1893
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:46,520
I'm just trying to show this picture of Eisner and Lucas and Mickey and Minnie in those fun

1894
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:51,440
rainbow space space mountain or Tomorrowland outfits and say like,

1895
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:52,800
You think that's going to fix everything?

1896
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:57,160
You think that's going to make us forget everything that's been said in the last two minutes?

1897
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:00,320
Epcot space character outfits is good.

1898
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:05,840
I mean that's Vogue profile, that Vogue photo spread was going around recently.

1899
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:12,520
They don't have good, other than that expensive Tokyo Disney, they don't make good suit like

1900
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,720
toys for the main characters, Mickey and Minnie.

1901
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:20,280
There's something that's pretty close right now in shop Disney for Mickey and Minnie,

1902
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:23,280
but they're like in these weird outfits and Minnie is the body of a human woman.

1903
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,560
It's kind of strange, but it's close.

1904
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:27,520
The heads are close, but what I always wanted.

1905
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,000
That's so confusing for you.

1906
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,280
You don't want that.

1907
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:33,280
No, no thank you.

1908
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:37,360
It's just, you know, it's like I need to know that at the end of the day she's a mouse

1909
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,080
and I shouldn't be going near it.

1910
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:43,080
But the more, you know, but if she has the shape that I'm familiar with and let's be

1911
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:52,080
honest attracted to, I'm going to start getting some ideas soon enough, I'm secreting and

1912
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:56,640
then this toy needs to go to the dry cleaner.

1913
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:58,440
This is what we're dealing with.

1914
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:01,760
This is what they're selling.

1915
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,760
This is what you described as having a human shape?

1916
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,320
Yeah, they are kind of, it's kind of a human silhouette.

1917
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:11,240
Minnie is a little more, yeah, like thin in her arms and her body than she is in the

1918
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:12,240
park.

1919
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:13,240
The suit is not like that.

1920
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:18,160
You are still showing her in a red dress with hearts all over it.

1921
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,160
It's just so human.

1922
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:23,040
You know, it's just like, I think it's honestly kind of an inappropriate toy to be selling

1923
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,720
because people are going to start getting ideas.

1924
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:25,720
Look at her.

1925
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:26,720
You see that dress.

1926
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,720
You see those shoes.

1927
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:28,720
Look at her legs.

1928
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:29,720
Shapeless calves.

1929
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:30,720
They used to be puffier.

1930
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:33,520
You can kind of see their clear human arms and legs now.

1931
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:36,800
Yeah, they don't have, they need to make all the characters like that.

1932
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,720
They can't be making figures with such caressable calves.

1933
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:43,520
They need to make them more, like they look like a suit.

1934
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,640
That's my gripe with it.

1935
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:47,640
That's what I want.

1936
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:49,160
Jason, you want the suit toys?

1937
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:52,560
Yeah, but I want them a little more whimsical.

1938
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,280
What do you mean by that?

1939
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:58,000
Like puffy, like the character outfits used to be.

1940
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,520
I'm agreeing with you.

1941
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,520
Thank you.

1942
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,960
I'm saying too much human shapes.

1943
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:04,400
Thank you.

1944
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,400
You're giving me ideas.

1945
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,400
Thank you.

1946
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,400
This mini needs to cover up.

1947
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,400
That's not what I'm saying.

1948
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,320
That's not what I'm saying.

1949
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:13,520
Not what I'm saying.

1950
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,400
You're saying normal things, regular things for people.

1951
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,080
What I'm saying is normal.

1952
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:20,600
Normal things, hip things.

1953
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:21,600
That's what's being said in this episode.

1954
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,600
Well, I am saying yes.

1955
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:23,600
I do say hip things.

1956
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:28,080
Whatever happened about, you know, sometimes what's more attractive is what's not revealed.

1957
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,760
Well, that's true.

1958
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,200
Michael, let me take a look in your office.

1959
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:40,280
And that's why the next second gate will be us storming into Mike's office with his mother.

1960
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:42,040
Oh, I'm not allowed in there either.

1961
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:46,400
I'll just get too rambunctious, too ramby, and I'll just start knocking things over.

1962
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:49,080
Yeah, I don't want that.

1963
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:50,840
So I don't know.

1964
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:51,840
That's the end of the episode, I think.

1965
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:52,840
I think we're good.

1966
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:53,840
Let's get out of here.

1967
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:54,840
I think we've got to get out of here.

1968
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:55,840
I think we survived podcast The Ride.

1969
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,080

We cannot promise that all future episodes around here or on Club 3 will be as strange

1973
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:17,880
and creepy, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that Into the Plush Pile will be, if not

1974
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:18,880
more so.

1975
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:19,880
I think that's right.

1976
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:23,160

1977

I don't know what that is.

1978
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,880
Wow, a bookmark.

1979
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:36,120
An artist will draw a very, a very tender portrait of you and Minnie making love.

1980
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,120
Oh, okay.

1981
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,120
That's pretty good.

1982
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,000
Oh, I accidentally put two in my shopping cart.
