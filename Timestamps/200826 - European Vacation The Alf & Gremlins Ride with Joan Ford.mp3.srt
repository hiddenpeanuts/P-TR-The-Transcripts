00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Welcome to Podcast The believe it or not podcast.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm Mike Carlson joining me as always Scott Gardner.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But in which order though? I guess we'll find out.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's the big thing. You gotta wait till the end to find out which one I'm talking about.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I mean, it's yeah, you feel like there should be a twist. There's not a twist. It's the obvious one.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Jason Sheridan. The scary ones. Yes, sure. Yeah, the scary ones.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I mean, I think it's a good thing that we're talking about.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I mean, I think it's a good thing that we're talking about.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I mean, I think it's a good thing that we're talking about.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Jason Sheridan. The scary ones. Yes, sure. Yeah, the scary ones.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Jason Sheridan also here. Yeah, I had the same question because I think I had stuffed animals of both of the protagonists, I guess, of this attraction.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, the protagonists are different than the gremlins.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Like, we'll talk about that, obviously. We'll talk about that.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, and there's some in a way there's a there's live action protagonists too,

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
because there's a the rides introduced by someone who then doesn't factor in in any other way.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But she is your way in. There's a lot going on. There's so much going on in this ride.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm so excited for talking about it. There's a lot going on.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And this is a little bit of a side trip because we've been doing, you know, European parks.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But we're going to focus hyper focus on this one ride today, which I'm very excited about.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And we've been we've been hopping around current 2020 Europe.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But this is a trip into the past because this ride disappeared in 2004, I believe, if my stats are correct.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So this is both a travel to Europe and a travel back in time.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes. So let's get right to it. Let's bring our guest in here.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She's a writer whose credits include DC Superhero Girls and Thundercats Roar.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But more importantly, she's a Gremlins expert scholar. What would you say? It's Joan Ford.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'd say, yeah, I don't know if I can qualify myself as a scholar.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't know. There's like a like you can get a Ph.D. in like Gremlinomics or whatever.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But I do. Yeah, as close as I am, I am an expert.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And right off the bat, I have to ask, are we do we are you saving?

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Are you saving like talk about the Australian version of this ride and the end?

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Are we going to talk about the Australian version?

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Are we hyper focusing on the German version?

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I think we need to mention it at least. OK, yes.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We're primarily interested in the German one, which for my money is the weirder of the two.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Agreed. Agreed. They're both weird combos.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
They both make both make no sense.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And listeners might be so confused at this point of what is going on and what is it and what it's called.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Which I feel is probably the mindset you were like people were in when they were entering this ride in from 1990 till 2004.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Right. I'd have to think so.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And I but you know, isn't isn't it a little cool that you like,

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
especially if you didn't like look up at the marquee of the ride that you were going on and then it just started,

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
you might genuinely be faked out by it in a very Gremlin spirit.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This film, at least at least part two that has these these meta moments and fourth wall breaks.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It is in a way a ride that has that maybe in bigger ways than other rides have.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, I agree. I mean, I think both Gremlins movies to some degree,

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
are kind of like bait and switches where like the first one is like the first half is like a kind of like Norman Rockwell

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
ask like Christmas movie with some weird elements turned in before it goes into full like like horror cartoon.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And then like the second one is just like kind of like picking up that spirit and like going insane with that.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But yeah, it is like if you write as a couple.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This right as a couple. And I think Jason, you kind of mentioned this right now has like a couple bait and switches like up top,

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
like from where you like like the first thing you see to what it like turns into.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't know. We'll get into it. But yeah, it's a it's it throws you.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This is the I agree. This is a good ride to go in with no information.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And that's probably pretty enjoyable. Well, let's first confirm the name because this is one of the most poorly documented.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Like there's stuff out here about this ride, but like every post contradicts every other post like

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
there's a lot of weird fan sites.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm voting for just calling the episode The Gremlins and Alf Ride or The Alf and Gremlins Ride.

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So you're listener, you're looking at the title already because we got to let people know, you know, one of the big stars of the show.

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But technically what we are talking about is called it has a title that has no indication of the Alf presence,

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
which is Gremlins invasion. Yes. Yes. OK.

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Meanwhile, the other one and just basic facts.

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This ride was at Warner Brothers Movie World Germany, which is now called Movie Park Germany,

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
which is not movie land Italy, which we kicked off the series with and as many alternate names as well.

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We are dense in the weeds of name confusion. Yeah.

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And I might be I mean, like you said, the like facts about this ride are very obscure, like obscured by time.

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Am I right? That it's the original ride. The original version of this ride was in Australia.

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And then it and then it moved to the Gold Coast movie land.

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And then it moved to like a year or two later. It was it opened in Austria in Germany with a same ride, but with a different with a very different protagonist.

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Correct. And if someone else wants to do the honors of the bizarre other name, because that's true, that's like one of the worst titles of a ride.

70
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I mean, you can go ahead. Yeah, it's very confusing. Very. Yeah.

71
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I mean, we complain about our Disney's our mission breakouts and our like apostrophes and our colons and our dot dot dots.

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But this is right, like that the Australian one is called Warner Brothers Classics and Great Gremlins Adventure.

73
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And and although you're really burying the lead there, Warner Brothers Classic sounds like nothing.

74
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That just sounds like a brand of a videotape. And like you're going to shove into the second half of the title that the exciting chaos get gremlins are part of it.

75
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And then and and the and the costar, the protagonist or whatever you are, I guess you're the protagonist of the ride, but you're like you're like your host, you know, co-writer.

76
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah, your host is is none other than the ghost with the most Beetlejuice.

77
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Beetlejuice, it's very weird.

78
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And I will say this is exciting in the in the sense that like we like mashups of characters.

79
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But yes, Beetlejuice is in the movies.

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
There was no like I think it's great, but also weird.

81
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Well, also, I mean, I just take issue with the idea of like Beetlejuice like teaming up with you instead of the gremlins,

82
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:50,000
because it really seems like Beetlejuice would be like much more like into the gremlins into their maybe be like, you know, like I want to party with these guys, not like, oh, like I, I will help you escape the gremlins.

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He'd be buzzed with them. They'd like, you know, they're they're all very creative, like he'd, you know, like throw on crazy costumes with them and stuff.

84
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't know. They're all agents of chaos.

85
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, yeah, I can't like, you know, maybe that's what like breaks them up at the end.

86
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You know, they like I feel like agents of chaos usually will end up bouncing off of each other at some point.

87
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But like you feel like it's, you know, at least at first they would be collaborating, you know, coming up with like they're like fun movie riffs they could work on together.

88
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah, I wonder what I guess I wonder what the thought process is.

89
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And I wonder if by the time they got to Germany, they were like, Beetlejuice doesn't work.

90
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We need like a more of an uptight character, like a real straight laced character to really be like your way in to be your conduit.

91
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Conduit is humans.

92
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But we need a star.

93
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And in Germany, this guy is.

94
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah, I'm assuming you have an hour on that part of the Alps international popularity.

95
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Not an hour, but some.

96
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I there's certainly some stuff I'm delighted to talk about here.

97
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You know, let me let me save it, though, because I want to I want to be able to hear him first.

98
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I think when we get into the meat of the ride, we'll talk about it.

99
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The strange thing is that, OK, I mean, we can sort of talk about both rides because they're essentially the same in both settings.

100
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You are taking some tour ostensibly of a behind the scenes facility at a Warner Brothers studio, because these are both Warner Brothers, like, you know, universal theme parks devoted to Warner Brothers properties.

101
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So both involve that you've been invited on this little tour and then the Gremlins interrupt a video.

102
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And now you're sent on this madcap adventure with them.

103
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
If I'm correct, neither the Beetlejuice or the Al version.

104
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh, wait, while is in the video, the Beatles, the Beatles version, isn't he just suddenly in the ride?

105
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Like, he's. Yeah, I don't I don't believe there is a pre show that indicates Beetlejuice's presence anywhere in this universe.

106
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We're in Beetlejuice is just he's uninvoluntarily heard that you've you're under attack by the Gremlins and he like, like, I guess Beetlejuice does.

107
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He shows up to save the day.

108
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah, it's it's a I would be jarring, I guess.

109
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But maybe that's really what they were going for.

110
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Alpha's you know, you slowly introduce yourself in the pre show on the other part of the ride.

111
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So, yeah, he's weaved in there.

112
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I guess I do like the idea.

113
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Wouldn't we love if in, you know, we tried to do Rise of the Resistance without knowing a lot.

114
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And there were genuine surprises.

115
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You don't know how you're going to get out of this room.

116
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You don't know what's the escape here.

117
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And if part of that was a Beetlejuice showing up like Beetlejuice, you know, shows up instead of Kylo Ren at the ends.

118
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I would have gone nuts. I would have loved it.

119
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's genuinely thrilling.

120
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Drop Dead Fred is somehow piloting your exit vehicle.

121
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
A character who's not from space, who doesn't exist in the same century.

122
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah, I mean, that would be incredible.

123
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So I do I can appreciate both approaches because, you know, sometimes some viewers of things and some people go on rides, they probably need their handheld a little more than some like a big, bold surprise.

124
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah.

125
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So, you know, if if you were a parkour in the mid 90s, good try, you try both.

126
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
See which one is your flavor.

127
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Try to bring in friends to like and surprise that even if you know the spoilers, try to just have them on and see if it takes them by surprise.

128
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Australia and Germany.

129
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Really? Yeah.

130
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I wish it like comes down to like, who's your guys at Alpha Beetlejuice?

131
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You know, who are you?

132
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I would say me personally, I'm much more of an elf.

133
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I guess we should pull everybody.

134
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah.

135
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Well, I'm going to say I mean, generally, like I'm more of a Beetlejuice, but for this specific ride, like I'm definitely an elf, like elf, I think was is the better conduit for this ride.

136
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Jason, what are you thinking?

137
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I think, yes.

138
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yeah, for sure.

139
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You know, I think I have a lot of very vague memories of Alf and a lot more specific ones of Beetlejuice, vague memories of Alf, much in the same way I had vague memories of the two Gremlins movies, which I've watched over the last couple of days and I forgot they're awesome.

140
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Like they're great.

141
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Well, I'm asking though, you personally, are you more of a Beetlejuice or an Alf type, you think?

142
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I think I would need to watch some Alf to get a better bearing.

143
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Wow, you don't even want to commit.

144
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You don't want to commit.

145
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What do you think?

146
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What do you think?

147
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Who someone clearly has a better grasp?

148
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I think you're Alf all the way.

149
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay.

150
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah.

151
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
How are we classified?

152
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Like, what is it to be?

153
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Like, I have a very firm understanding of what it is to be like a Beetlejuice.

154
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Also, I didn't realize that's how we were defined.

155
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't know if I'm a Beetlejuice.

156
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm just in terms of preference.

157
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I think I go Beetlejuice.

158
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I don't know if I consider myself a Beetlejuice.

159
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But how do we define an Alf?

160
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Who is your quintessential Alf?

161
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I think Alf is very dry.

162
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
He's very low key.

163
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
He's sardonic.

164
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He's got sort of a cynical take about the world, but he's also optimistic.

165
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And that's sort of hidden a little bit more.

166
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That is actually pretty good.

167
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's a pretty fair description of me.

168
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So maybe I am an Alf.

169
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And he likes big sandwiches.

170
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I mean, you don't like cats as the ingredient, but he'll eat a big, long set.

171
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You'd put like a more traditional meat in there.

172
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But besides that, similar food taste.

173
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That's true.

174
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah. The eating cat stuff.

175
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The eating cat adds a layer of complication to Alf.

176
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Much in the way that Gizmo is very cute, but is de facto responsible for the chaos of these movies.

177
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah.

178
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yes. Also, I mean, yeah, I mean, Beetlejuice is all problem.

179
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I mean, yes, they're all problematic figures.

180
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Beetlejuice is problematic.

181
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We all have to like, yeah.

182
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So Scott, are you an Alf or a Beetlejuice?

183
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Do you feel like?

184
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Hmm. Maybe.

185
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Maybe more of an Alf.

186
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Again, I've been eating a lot of sandwiches during quarantine.

187
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm judging that is the primary criteria.

188
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
A lot of Hawaiian shirts, too.

189
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

190
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Just chilling in the house.

191
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Just chilling in the house with a Hawaiian shirt and no pants.

192
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Just like, just Alf in it.

193
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So maybe we change the change in the tagline of the podcast to a podcast about theme parks hosted by three Alfs.

194
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Because now we can't say Childish Men anymore, of course.

195
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Well, we could just open the next episode with that.

196
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And then it's a test of how many listeners have followed us to the second gate and know what we're talking about.

197
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Or, yeah, or how many more?

198
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Well, many more, I think, if we start saying that, too, on the main feed.

199
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I guess let's take this real quick.

200
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Let's take this opportunity.

201
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I just watched Gremlins 1 and 2 for the first time in my life in the last 48 hours.

202
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Really?

203
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Wow.

204
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I am not joking when I say the fear of it as a kid had kept me away from Gremlins my whole life.

205
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And last night I watched 1 and I watched 2 this morning.

206
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And I like 1, but 2 was obviously I love 2.

207
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
2 is like, yeah, 2 is like kind of a masterpiece.

208
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I love 1, but 2 is just like, you know, the only movie like it.

209
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Once you start getting other types of Gremlin, once you start getting Bat Gremlin and Spider Gremlin and Brain Gremlin, Sexy Lady Gremlin, the limiter is off, man.

210
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You're just going like 60 miles an hour then.

211
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Robert Picardo steps out of the limo at the start of 2 and I was like, oh, good.

212
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes.

213
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You're just like, yeah.

214
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And then the slam dunk was when Gizmo starts dancing out of the cage in front of Christopher Lee and the two twin scientists.

215
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And I'm like, oh, yeah, this is, oh, I get it.

216
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That is so delightful and like comped in there in a way that's clearly a little dated, but not in a distractingly fuzzy green screen.

217
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's an unwatchable effect.

218
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Like I like that it goes to suddenly clearly a comped Gizmo.

219
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't know. And then such a such a charming dance.

220
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
He really shines in it in general.

221
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
All his Rambo moments.

222
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yes.

223
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
To a song they had to retrofit his dancing to that song.

224
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I forget what the name of the song is in the movie, but originally he was dance.

225
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I believe originally they shot it to him dancing to a Billy Idol song and then like somewhere along the line down the line, Billy Idol was like, no, I don't I don't want this in there.

226
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So they had to like they had to like re edit his dancing to fit this like fifties song that they picked.

227
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Wow.

228
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah.

229
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Crazy.

230
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's there because there is some modern music in it, but that choice specifically, I don't know.

231
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
That's it feels better that it's like an older rock and roll song.

232
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah, that seems like more like what Gizmo would actually be into.

233
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I also it as a it though most of the movie is in an atrium.

234
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's in a very oh yeah yeah yeah.

235
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
He's early 90s atrium.

236
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's very mall esque.

237
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So it's my vibe big time.

238
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I would love to if I could if I somehow had some bizarre option to spend the rest of quarantine in that set.

239
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I would so happily do it the rest of my life.

240
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Clamp center.

241
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Clamp center.

242
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yes.

243
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yet another film with a Trump stand in.

244
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's weird that we were raised on all of these Trump villain films that would have like planted the seeds for us as five to ten year olds and now like he is the villain of our adulthoods.

245
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It feels very simulation.

246
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's very simulationy.

247
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yeah.

248
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah.

249
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I had a very odd experience because I watched this like two nights ago and then yesterday in the day I watched that John Carpenter movie in the mouth of madness where it's like Sam Neill's trying to track down a Stephen King like character whose books are

250
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:17,000
drive people crazy and the actor who plays clamp it runs an insane asylum in the John Carpenter movie and I like sat up like so quick in my chair was like clamp it's it's him and the guy who creates poison ivy in Batman and Robin.

251
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah.

252
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Isn't he and isn't he in smallville isn't he like Lex Luthor senior.

253
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yes.

254
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yes.

255
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
He is Lex Luthor's father.

256
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I can't pull the name.

257
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah.

258
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah.

259
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:46,000
He's like he is like one of those actors that like I've like saw gremlins to so many times the kid before I ever saw him anything else that I can only like seen him as like anything else is like feels weird and wrong.

260
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah.

261
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It would be like if Jay Leno was playing a character in a movie.

262
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yes.

263
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
There'll be no way like that.

264
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And honestly another Trump analog like see like seeing like Biff like years later in Thomas Wilson years later and like freaks and geeks it was like, but this guy and this guy's Biff what's like this doesn't make sense.

265
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah, they got that sitcom sort of locked into this role forever.

266
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yeah.

267
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Mike I think I had a sense I did not see either of these films till recently either gremlins the first one I think I thought I had seen it and slowly realized that I had not seen it while I was in a 40x screening which was a blast.

268
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That is probably my best 40x experience.

269
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You get hit by a snowball that was one of the water effects.

270
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah, it's cool that you there's like a benign one it's not action and you getting hit by you know with bullets or something scary.

271
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's it's kind of nice.

272
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's a little missed.

273
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I did.

274
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I did that last I did that last last winter that went to the 40x gremlins.

275
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It was like a blast.

276
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It was so nice to see it like I don't know I'll pretty much go see it whenever it's playing anywhere.

277
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But it's like getting to see it new under those circumstances was so much fun.

278
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's a really good job.

279
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I thought I was really well programmed.

280
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I might be at that point now.

281
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Maybe I just go to gremlins revivals when they happen.

282
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah.

283
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh my gosh.

284
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The I mean like the scene where you the gremlins are in the movie theater and you're kind of like rocking along with them is like the best like just like the best most aversive use of 40x like I think I've ever experienced.

285
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Well, that's cool.

286
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Dancing.

287
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
The so I guess I'm curious then.

288
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Then, John, if we were all we were all Freddy cats about it.

289
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I was just afraid of like the just the gremlins.

290
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The poster was enough to keep me away for a long time.

291
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That scared that hand with the cigar and gizmo hiding in the drawer.

292
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But this was a staple of your childhood.

293
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You were not scared away by what is your your gremlin story?

294
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Honestly, I was like I remember like when I was really little when it was like for like when I was first aware of it.

295
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I remember being like I was like really like I think I had the same reaction.

296
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I was like very terrified of it.

297
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And then I never really wanted to watch it.

298
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And then I I was kind of like forced to watch it at like a friend's sleepover.

299
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And it was really scary.

300
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
But it was also like just a lot of fun.

301
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And I think there was something about it being like the first movie that I was like genuinely like scared of seeing that like I kind of like like always able to like kind of like overcome that and watch it and have a lot of fun and enjoy it.

302
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That kind of like cemented it for me as like kind of like instrumental to my like falling in love with like what I like about horror movies and why I like being scared going to movies.

303
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So I feel like there's a lot of that like as much as I like like like just like the movies themselves.

304
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I think it's still like kind of like a milestone as a like this was kind of like a threshold movie for me when I was very young.

305
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And yeah.

306
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So yeah, I was just like being forced to conquer that was like a like really awesome was like what ingrained it is an important movie for me.

307
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

308
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I don't know that I have such a milestone moment, but it is literally in the last decade when I start watching these types of movies that as a kid there was a mental block because I think I thought they were just like snuff films.

309
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I think I assumed that like the gremlins were just murdering humans and it was just like grotesque and it was treated very seriously like some sort of like murder procedural.

310
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I think that's in my head what it was.

311
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And then when you watch it, you're like, oh, this is kitschy and campy and yeah, like, and like, especially because like there's so much like out like about the first one there was so much outcry about like the like kitchen scene was like a big deal that was like it was like scandalous.

312
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:43,000
People are like kids are going to like kids are going to do that to their cats like there's a for those who know there's a scene where like the mom explodes a gremlin in the microwave.

313
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I mean, there was controversy about people being like someone's going to do that to their kids going to do that to their cat.

314
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And like, I think there was this like, even though, yeah, like you said, it's very like campy and goofy and pretty silly as far as horror movies go.

315
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:04,000
There was just so I there was so much like controversy around it that it did feel like a very like taboo almost like yeah like snuff movie at the time.

316
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah, I think it was just literally the design of the gremlins and I just going to like movies because we all went we're all old enough to blockbuster as children and you would see as Scott said the poster or the box.

317
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And it's just like your mind would run wild with what you thought because obviously I wasn't young enough to even I don't think be aware of what controversy was happening at the time.

318
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But yeah, it's just murder after murder. No story.

319
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Just the story says gremlins to the no bad.

320
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And then it's just claws who put in putting somebody into a meat grinder.

321
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Just like 400 kills.

322
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Yeah, like Freddy Krueger, all of it.

323
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Jason, Freddy Krueger.

324
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I thought there was like no Freddy Krueger, who's just this insane caricature.

325
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I was like, oh, there must this must be humorless.

326
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
There must be nothing silly about this.

327
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Yeah, and it's all that all and I'm slowly making my way watching all this stuff that I just knew was bad for me as a kid.

328
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Did you know then how silly it was?

329
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Like, were you surprised that it involves all the gremlins singing New York, New York and being on talk shows and stuff?

330
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I have a couple years ago, someone finally and I somebody finally explained to me that the second one is like kind of a parody or a satire or whatever the first one.

331
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So I knew that the second one was even though it's got a lower IMDB score that I think and correct me if I'm wrong, Joan, that the hard cores think too is better and it's more insane and silly and weird.

332
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yes, I think like in general, like, like I really love both of them.

333
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But I think in general, the heart of the like the the main like line of thinking is that like that like gremlins is the first gremlins is like great is like great.

334
00:24:48,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It's like a fun like Little Monster. It's a fun little monster movie and gremlins to is like considered to be like like genius by a big group of like people like there are like reassessments written on it on its 20th and 30th anniversary about how like it's this like like like rare gem of like the Hollywood like blockbuster of Hollywood blockbusters that was actually like really like like smart and like kind of like, you know, I don't know.

335
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't know. It just yeah. So I would say yes, the subversive. That's the word I was looking for smart and subversive. And it it you know, it's just like a rare it's like something really rare to see in a like in like what was essentially like a giant summer movie at the time it came out.

336
00:25:36,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yeah, I feel like too. It's like they took it's as if I watched one and they were like, well, what do you like in one and we're going to multiply it by 50. And I was like, well, I really like when the gremlins are in the bar. That's great. Yeah. Like I want a little more of that. And like, oh, character actor slash country music singer who wrote the no no song Hoyt Axon is in the first movie. All right. More fun like weird actors like that, please. Yeah. All over the place.

337
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Get that towns guy, get him to New York City for some indistinct reason. Yeah, like just like no like let's like characters who died in the first one who gives a shit there like the will explain it away by just like they were mildly hurt. And now they're in their visiting.

338
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:34,000
They're visiting like it's even just insane that the Futtermans are visiting like like like like what do you're like old like who's ever had their like old neighbors come visit them in the in the city they currently live. But whatever. Mr.

339
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:50,920
Feeney following you somewhere. Mr. Building. Why is your principal on vacation? I don't know because they need to be there for comedy. Yeah, but I do agree. Like I do agree. Like what totally agree with you saying Mike, I think like it makes the it kind of like does not make the mistake that I think a lot.

340
00:26:50,920 --> 00:27:05,840
Of movie sequels make that are like, OK, like we, you know, it's like we have to restart at like ground at like ground zero, like like the way you like any given like Jurassic Park sequel is like, well, we got to do the same kind of like basic trajectory of like first, the dinosaurs are like like inspiring and then they're scary.

341
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:17,880
It's like, no, it's just like like we kind of got to like a hunt. We got to like 110 in the first one with the craziness and we're going to start there in the second. This is one of my biggest pet peeves about things.

342
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:33,760
It's like even like a movie I like, like Ghostbusters 2, they have to restart. We're like the Ghostbusters are not being taken seriously anymore, despite the fact there was a giant ghost outbreak a few years ago and they're still like, no, these lousy Ghostbusters have to get out of here.

343
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,840
They're frauds. And it's like there was a marshmallow man stomping his way down the city.

344
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,960
We have to see B and Malcolm as a like sad, thought to be crazy man on the subway.

345
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:52,920
We have to deal with shit for 35 minutes before there's a dinosaur as opposed to a dinosaur in.

346
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,760
I mean, there's a little cold open, but like as opposed to just pure dinosaurs for the first 20 minutes.

347
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:11,280
Yeah, it says like, yeah, and like Gremlins 2 just kicks off with like it's like bugs and Daffy like talking to you in a war in the start of the cart at the like pre cartoon.

348
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,320
It's like it's just like it's like kind of bug nuts from the beginning.

349
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,680
Yeah, and it's also something I've talked about.

350
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,400
So I had nauseam on the show, which is the original George Lucas idea for Indiana Jones.

351
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:32,320
Every movie is a different genre because why not like why not plug in the characters and see them in a variety of tones and plenty scenarios like it's just much more fun.

352
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:40,280
Like if there was a third Gremlins movie, which I know Gremlins I've heard is grown only grown in popularity and multiplied much like the Gremlins themselves.

353
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,120
If you want a third one, I feel like it's got to be something even more insane that we don't even know.

354
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,880
I'm not thinking of right now.

355
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,160
Yeah. And I mean, they are.

356
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,720
You know, they're doing the HBO Max.

357
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
Yeah, right.

358
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Right.

359
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,720
Yes, the cartoon.

360
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,640
It's like a prequel.

361
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,720
And it'll be really interesting.

362
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,520
I'm really interested to see, like, how do you translate that like tone to a series?

363
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,480
And like, what's it like?

364
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,360
Like, are they resetting?

365
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,880
I wonder if it's going to be more in the tone of like the first movie, the second movie.

366
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:14,680
But it is really hard to imagine, like it working, like going back, like, you know, trying to reset that tone of the first movie.

367
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,600
Yeah. I mean, I hope I would.

368
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:24,160
I would if it's off the top of my head, I'm like, well, let's see the Gremlins like partying through the different era, like different eras, different centuries.

369
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
The Dark Ages.

370
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,880
And like, let's see that.

371
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,760
That sounds great.

372
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,960
Unfortunately, the direction they're going in is BoJack Horseman.

373
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,320
So Gizmo is depressed.

374
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,160
He's drunk and he's horny, but his dick don't work.

375
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,800
So, you know.

376
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,600
Oh, no.

377
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Showrunner Jason Sheridan.

378
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,840
Give them the kids what they want.

379
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,440
Sorry.

380
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:54,680
The kids, you know, it's got to look like one of two possible cartoons and some characters got to do depression.

381
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,160
That's true.

382
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,400
That is two types of cartoon eyeballs.

383
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:04,440
And if a new cartoon comes out that isn't one of the two types of eyeballs, audiences eyeballs themselves will explode.

384
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,280
That's right.

385
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,000
What are the Rick and Morty eyeballs and what's the second?

386
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,400
I would say like kind of sort of like pseudo family guy.

387
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:21,040
Well, do you know our family guy eyeballs and Bob's Burgers eyeballs, different eyeballs?

388
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:28,040
I think those are different eyeballs, but I think it is somewhere between like Rick and Morty and Bob's Burgers might be it.

389
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,400
Yeah, I think those merged.

390
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:37,080
I think Bob's and Rick and Morty became one set of eyeballs and rip off family guys is set number two.

391
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,240
Yeah.

392
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,760
Well, let's know your lazily designed cartoon eyeballs.

393
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,760
Let's let's put a guide up on the Twitter so everyone knows what kind of eyeballs.

394
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,240
Is this people size?

395
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,600
How perfectly round they are.

396
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,120
I think we could talk about the movies forever.

397
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,000
And boy, I mean, yeah, I'm with you on Masterpiece.

398
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,400
And I just also have like just the craftsmanship.

399
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,200
I mean, it's the movie itself, I think, is so wonderful.

400
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:11,800
If you take a step back and go like, is this the peak of puppeteering and physical effects in a movie?

401
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,120
Yeah.

402
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,320
Many there are and that you aren't aware of the size issues.

403
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,280
Our friend Andrew Grissom made me aware that for a lot of that movie, the gizmo is a is giant.

404
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:27,960
You're looking at like they built the head really big so that they could do the subtlety of that, which is extreme.

405
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
I think that's my Joan.

406
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:36,800
I have this ongoing fear of things that should be small, but that are giant in a in a small room.

407
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,440
Does that explain the fear correctly, guys?

408
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,800
Yeah, it sounds like it's like you're afraid of like a giant bullet in Mario.

409
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,560
Yes, because we know it is small.

410
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,680
And then when you see it extremely big, it just freaks me out.

411
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,880
So I get a little of that weirdness seeing the gizmo.

412
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,120
However, I like gizmo so much that I can get over some of the.

413
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,080
Yeah.

414
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:02,400
But the first time I saw that, I actually I have like the 1984 Cinefax from that,

415
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,920
like the original and seeing like that, seeing that image of like, oh,

416
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:13,360
because like in these shots, because his head was actually like person sized is like very, very disjarring.

417
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,480
And when the first one too.

418
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,040
OK, I didn't know if that was a.

419
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,080
Yeah, I know they made like I don't have it.

420
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,840
But yeah, on the first one, they made like all the close ups, a lot of the close ups of gizmos are just like a big like

421
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,320
animatronic head that like they just did close ups on.

422
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,000
Oh, wow. So so strange.

423
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,960
Yeah, so just so technologically advanced.

424
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,800
Amazing to look at. But I guess I guess what I'm curious is, you know, we've we're all clearly so excited about the spirit of these movies.

425
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:47,640
And the only theme park attractions that came out of this franchise are these.

426
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,960
And we can talk about what they what the ride is.

427
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,480
And that can help us determine. But do we think that they got the spirit correct?

428
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,920
Yeah, yeah, yes, I think.

429
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,880
I mean, it's it's mayhem. It's unpredictable.

430
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,720
There's weird movie turns and fourth wall breaking.

431
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:13,520
Yeah. It's the way they got the spirit was just repeating, repeating some set pieces.

432
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,400
Yeah. Or in some cases, like literally just like using footage from the gremlins to.

433
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,640
Oh, yes, you do just get a big stint of that, of the projection stuff.

434
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:28,160
Yes. Joan, did we make you aware of this ride or were you aware in a in a in a

435
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,120
perversely fascinated way as a gremlins fan?

436
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,080
I was I was definitely I was aware of this.

437
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,800
I remember hearing about this, like, I don't know, remember how long, but I've been aware of this for a while.

438
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,160
But definitely like not until after it had gone, it had all shut down.

439
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:49,600
So I think the first like time I read about it, I was like, oh, he is like probably some like slash

440
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,000
film article that was like the extent gremlins ride you never knew existed.

441
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,280
But I've known about I've definitely known about it.

442
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,120
Yeah, I'm trying to remember when I think it was a couple of years ago.

443
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,840
And maybe it was even because we were doing the podcast that I was like, oh, OK, this

444
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,320
there's a lot of weird stuff I am not aware of even.

445
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,040
Could we just quickly talk about Elf?

446
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,240
Certainly. OK, I love.

447
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,280
Yeah. Oh, well, for the show, he's in the show.

448
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,800
The show is like fine, but I love Elf.

449
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,920
Yeah, I'll have to show it's not a masterpiece by any means, but I love Elf.

450
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,680
I like those like those Oscar movies where it's like, oh, this movie sucks.

451
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,320
This one performance is incredible.

452
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,680
I think that's right. I think I think you go, you know, this elf is going to work again

453
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,920
in a better project.

454
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,960
So you like him like cameoing on something or appearing in, say,

455
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,080
cartoon all stars to the rescue.

456
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,280
We still haven't done it yet.

457
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,600
We got to get there. Yeah.

458
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,920
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

459
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,160
I love Elf in the promo from was it on NBC, I think, right?

460
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,360
Or was it ABC? I forget.

461
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,080
I think NBC, NBC.

462
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:01,120
There's an NBC promo with like all the stars of the network and Elf and Bob Hope

463
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,960
are sitting at a piano and Elf like puts his head on Bob Hope's show.

464
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,640
Like that's probably much better than the whole series of Elf.

465
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,640
It's just that moment.

466
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,840
But his recent cameo on the Amy

467
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,920
Polar Animates that come Duncanville.

468
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,640
Great. Fantastic.

469
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,520
That was Elf. Was it was it voice of Elf?

470
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,520
Paul Fusco.

471
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,800
So here's what I guess. Here's what I know about Alf.

472
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,360
He Paul Fusco like retains the rights to to Alf.

473
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,240
So he can he can do whatever he wants.

474
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:41,240
So I know the creators of Duncanville approached him for a cameo and he said yes.

475
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:41,920
Wow. OK.

476
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,840
So we could we could ask and see if Alf would do the show.

477
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,200
Yes, yes. Wow.

478
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,680
Just as Elf.

479
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,240
Yeah, yeah. Just Elf on to discuss whatever he wants.

480
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,880
I mean, if you could get out, if you needed to, I would totally understand

481
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,400
if you got out and needed to record this episode without me.

482
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,600
I would totally understand.

483
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,440
I would say, go to this point on.

484
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,760
All right. So it worked. We got it.

485
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,440
And now, yeah, we're talking about my right.

486
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,640
Don't even acknowledge that I laugh.

487
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,520
Just like Alf pops it.

488
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,560
It's now a surprise.

489
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,040
Alf appearance like the right itself.

490
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,600
Yes. Yeah.

491
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,120
But I don't want the elf doesn't want to talk about this ride.

492
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,000
He wants to talk about like, I love the living seas.

493
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,480
What have they done to Epcot?

494
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,240
Yeah. Well, yeah, I wonder if Paul Fusco like is this

495
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,320
I wonder how much because obviously it's not the ride.

496
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,480
It's not Paul Fusco doing the voice of German Alf.

497
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,680
I wonder how much it's like, I wonder like what

498
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,000
how much say Paul Fusco had in the ride knowing that he kind of like had control.

499
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,360
I don't know how to like control over.

500
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,880
That's interesting because if you say he retains some ownership over it,

501
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,240
it does feel like this is just like from the archives we own, Alf put Alf in.

502
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,800
Like, why would we want to make a separate deal for Alf?

503
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,600
Like they would have found a different character if it was like a big headache.

504
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,920
That's yeah, maybe it's like maybe he like got the right.

505
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,400
Maybe it was like NBC Universe or whatever, whoever had like

506
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,960
like momentary rights to him, but he got he got them back like mid 90s,

507
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,480
which would explain why Alf was able to do the ABC movie in 1996.

508
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,280
Right, which is the finale of the finale,

509
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,960
because the actual ending of the actual official series,

510
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,600
which honestly is kind of recent that I think that I've even been aware of this

511
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,880
is just Alf getting abducted by the feds,

512
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,920
getting hunted like an X-Files episode, I believe.

513
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,520
Yeah, I that's the end.

514
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,880
The last shot of like the official series, I think, is like like FBI agents

515
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,000
like storming the Tanner's house.

516
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,680
Yeah. And they're like all like freaks.

517
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,960
Scott, have you seen this?

518
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,240
No, I haven't seen the very end.

519
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,040
Oh, my God. This is I'm surprised.

520
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,560
This is this is right up your alley.

521
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,160
It is like Project Alf either.

522
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,240
Maybe I'm not an elf guy.

523
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,800
I like the idea of all this, but I've never I've never put in the time.

524
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,200
They intended to come back, I think, for another season.

525
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,320
So they left the season off on a cliffhanger where Alf literally

526
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,880
in a very scary thing, especially, I assume, for kids,

527
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,000
Alf gets taken into custody by the government.

528
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,440
And the family's just like sitting there freaked out.

529
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,800
And that's the end of the whole show forever.

530
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,520
You know, I was more of what was the other puppet sitcom with the dinosaurs?

531
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,040
No, no. Well, I love dinosaurs.

532
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,680
That's no there was a filthy one on Bob with Bob.

533
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,360
Bob Bobcat's voice.

534
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,920
Are you talking about as like a like dirty bunny rabbit?

535
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,760
Am I Matt? Oh, that's are you talking about?

536
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,600
Was that happily Greg the bunny?

537
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,120
Not Greg the bunny.

538
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,880
No, that happily ever.

539
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,280
It was a happily ever after happily ever after with Nicky Cox.

540
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,280
Yeah. And Kevin Conway, which was like, yes, it was.

541
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,720
That was like just married with children.

542
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,280
But Al Bundy also had like a like a like a bunny rabbit friend

543
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,560
that he would visit that he would visit in a basement.

544
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,760
Yeah. And I was too young for married with children.

545
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,600
But when I was like 10 or 11 and unhappily ever after was on, I was like,

546
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,480
oh, yeah, this is this is good.

547
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,480
This is this is like bad kid stuff.

548
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,720
You got a fine ass Nicky Cox says eye candy.

549
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,080
And then you got your fun puppet Sunday nights were a little

550
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,800
before the Simpsons were on Sunday.

551
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,200
Sunday nights was a little more the Wild Wild West for television.

552
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,440
I feel like Jason.

553
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,680
Congratulations on that on your Barstool Sports podcast,

554
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,520
where you watch every episode of Unhappily Ever After.

555
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,920
I think it's going to be big.

556
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,080
It is very Barstool Sports.

557
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,280
Yeah. I just thinking it's perfect.

558
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,640
Jason and Dave Portnoy host

559
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,440
Unhappily Ever Podcast.

560
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,360
I only know Barstool Sports through like comedy references.

561
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,680
I don't I've never actually looked into what it is.

562
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,760
I know what you mean. I've never.

563
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,840
Yeah, like I've never organically just been part

564
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,280
doing Barstool Sports.

565
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,440
Yeah, if Barstool Sports is just something Brad

566
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,120
and Brad Evans and Nick Sorelli made up, I would be I would be like, yeah,

567
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,520
that's I know I feel like they invented it.

568
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,400
What an empire.

569
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,840
What a man they created.

570
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,360
It's a sign up on their part.

571
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,280
Yeah, they like created it and then made like a career out of like blam

572
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,680
proving it. What a great comment.

573
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,200
I mean, money from the people who like it and then you get the cred

574
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,880
to make fun of it. Yeah.

575
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:33,040
OK, congratulations to Nick and Brad on the Stephen Stills, Billy Porter sketch.

576
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,240
That was incredible.

577
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,080
That I don't know.

578
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,400
We all still haven't seen that from now on.

579
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,920
You haven't seen it.

580
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,680
What's going on? Oh, you got to see it.

581
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,520
It's a it's a it's a what's I can never think of the song

582
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,440
Oh, children. What's that sound?

583
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,280
What's that song? The Crosby, Sills and Nash song.

584
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,280
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this is something happening here.

585
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,280
There's a very Tim and Eric music video made by Billy Porter

586
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,800
and Stephen Stills for the Democratic National Convention.

587
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,760
Oh, no, they really got the very.

588
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,120
You have to. Oh, my God.

589
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,960
We have to see it right after very happily not watching any of the DNC.

590
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,360
So why there there has not been a potent combination like that

591
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,920
since Alf met the gremlins.

592
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,560
Yeah. Well, you want to you want to go on the ride here?

593
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,680
Yes, please.

594
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,640
This one is so might just require the step through what the hell's going on.

595
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,640
And by the way, you know, you brought up a report.

596
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,280
So Project Alf 1996, oddly, the same year that this ride was put in in Germany.

597
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,400
Alf, the series ended in 1990.

598
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,880
Gremlins to the new batch 1990 as well.

599
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,760
So we're we're deep into this is a ride six years after

600
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,920
we've last seen the properties, except for Project Alf,

601
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,400
which is obviously made Alf, you know, more relevant than ever.

602
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,960
But so you go into just kind of a very,

603
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:01,400
you know, studio lot facility and you're walking through an office building.

604
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,080
It's just like very it's it's, you know, the kind of place where you go

605
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:09,640
see the screening on a lot or like the scoring stage for a film score.

606
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,040
And you're ushered into a little private screening room.

607
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,800
And the lights go down and the film starts and the film, of course,

608
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,800
stars Sandra Bullock.

609
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,480
Of course. OK.

610
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,000
Yes. If you weren't aware, it of course would follow that Sandra Bullock shows up.

611
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,880
Sandra Bullock films just for this, I believe.

612
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,760
And in German, dubbed in German,

613
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,320
like one of my favorite fascinations, the Armageddon attraction in France

614
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,080
that exists only in a version where Michael Clarke Duncan is dubbed over.

615
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,920
Similar to the Hasselhoff thing that we saw at the start of all this, too.

616
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,120
I don't have a good like catch all for what it is when you film a cameo

617
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:00,320
for something and then the language your your voice is never heard.

618
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,960
There's no chance of it because where it's going to be playing.

619
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,040
Yeah. Yeah. So why are you even talking?

620
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,440
Maybe they didn't. Maybe he just mouthed words.

621
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,000
Let's fill in something later. It's cheaper. Yeah.

622
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,880
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You don't have to pay them for the voiceover fee.

623
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,520
So Sandra Bullock, Sandra Bullock is here

624
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:24,760
to play a montage of some of the movie world's greatest bloopers.

625
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,040
Got it done on board.

626
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,640
And can you? Yeah, that's all I want to do.

627
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,160
Take my time out of my day for this. Thank you.

628
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,440
I had a theme park.

629
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,000
Just a mellow screening of bloopers.

630
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,920
And OK, so you mean like

631
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,360
some of my favorite films that I've seen in theaters lately, like Batman Returns?

632
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,840
Yes, sure. Yes. One clip from Batman Returns.

633
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,120
The entire rest of it, very old black and white films

634
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,040
where, you know, none of us got to see this in person.

635
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,400
So I'm going off of, you know, filmed on a handy cam pretty like.

636
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,200
There's no good ride through of this that you can watch.

637
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,040
But that being said, just with the black and white nature,

638
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,200
I don't I can't tell what the bloopers are.

639
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,480
No, it's hard.

640
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,840
It's hard to tell what happens in the corner of the frame and the shadows.

641
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,000
So I'm not sure what went wrong, if anything.

642
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,040
And it's also like it's movies that people I think were hits in there.

643
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,520
But it's like, I don't know that people are going to be in Germany

644
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,120
are going to be like, oh, look, it's a blooper from like

645
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,800
Paint Your Wagon or The Gold Diggers of 1933.

646
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,560
Did you recognize them, Jason?

647
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,280
I couldn't really recognize.

648
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,400
I was trying.

649
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,240
I would probably recognize the like Footlight Parade bloopers. But

650
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,560
one of the dancers fell off the cake or whatever. Yeah, there is.

651
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,000
And I go ahead, John.

652
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,840
Is there a doc?

653
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,800
So I was to say, is there a doc Hollywood in there?

654
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,520
I thought I thought there was like one other like in color.

655
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,560
And it's like Michael J.

656
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,240
Fox getting like dragged away by a pig.

657
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,080
And I think that's right.

658
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,400
What else would that be?

659
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,640
And I thought it was Michael J.

660
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,320
Fox asked me sort of it's a dark footage.

661
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,440
And I've never seen Doc Hollywood, so I couldn't tell.

662
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,960
Isn't Dennis the Menace Walter Mathau in there, too, real briefly?

663
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,760
Oh, or am I thinking of the other one?

664
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,840
On you guys, I don't.

665
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,080
Walter Mathau for sure is in one unless I was watching the other one

666
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:23,800
and I got confused.

667
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,840
The Australia. Oh, Mathau was exclusive to Australia, perhaps.

668
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,120
But I don't think I think he was in there briefly, too.

669
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,200
I think it was Dennis the Menace Mathau.

670
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,400
I think that sounds right.

671
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,360
There's a Humphrey Bogart at some point.

672
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,200
He flips over in a chair.

673
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,240
I don't know from what film or why.

674
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,960
But so I think if you're in the Australian one,

675
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,000
it's pretty cut and dry like you're watching this.

676
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,240
And then the gremlins start messing with the film.

677
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,960
And as Joan said, it's the same footage from to

678
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:02,000
this wonderful part of to, oh, my God, where they get into the projector booth

679
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
and they make bunny ears and Lincoln's face and all that.

680
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,960
In the German version, things get a lot more convoluted.

681
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,440
And now I don't speak German despite having had to learn

682
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,760
some when I lived kind of close to this theme park, honestly.

683
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,600
So I don't know what they say.

684
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,600
The only word I recognize is elf.

685
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,560
And it seems like it's just kind of a ladies and gentlemen elf.

686
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:31,000
And then you're taken to the set and it's sort of it's like a pan

687
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,400
across the set where we're not in diegetically in the world of Alf.

688
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,280
We are looking at crew members and such.

689
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,680
And then we go into sort of a little scene.

690
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,200
So so I'm confused.

691
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,600
First of all, so why the bloopers then?

692
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,240
Like, are we going to see a blooper of Alf?

693
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,080
But then that's not really what happens.

694
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,840
Yes, it also.

695
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:59,480
Yeah, I mean, it's it's already a little jarring that they go from like these.

696
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,520
Here are your favorite movie bloopers to, I don't know, unless like

697
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,960
Project Alf played in cinemas in Germany.

698
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,480
It's like this is not a movie.

699
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,040
This is definitely not a movie.

700
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,520
Yeah, it's like, yeah, we're taking it now.

701
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,760
We're like behind the scenes with Alf. Yes.

702
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,360
And then you just watch a film, which I just wanted to play this brief

703
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,840
sound bite of if I could share the screen.

704
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,000
OK, so here now, as we said, this is not Paul Fusco,

705
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,720
but rather the a German voice of Alf.

706
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,160
Turn up.

707
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,320
Oh, excellent.

708
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,480
Tight, tight, tight.

709
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,600
Come on, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy.

710
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,600
Come pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy.

711
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,760
That's that's a lot of fun.

712
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,840
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Agreed.

713
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,760
Somebody should, by the way,

714
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,560
for a follow up to Cardi B and Megan the Stallion,

715
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,360
they should sample that for.

716
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,800
Yeah. WAP2.

717
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,160
I think it's waiting to be a hook.

718
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,960
Yeah, that's that would be a good hook.

719
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,240
Come pussy, pussy.

720
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,080
And here's the thing, maybe we have to make it.

721
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,120
I don't know.

722
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,200
Oh, damn it.

723
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,480
I don't work plus the garage.

724
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,320
Maybe start showing on some beats.

725
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,320
Yeah. Anyway, yes.

726
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,200
All right. So Alf lays down some come pussy, pussy.

727
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,040
And at this point,

728
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,400
Jason is why I wanted to delay my German material, please,

729
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,800
just to get a taste of that guy.

730
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,560
He is no Paul Fusco, the famous in America voice of Alf.

731
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,280
But he this guy is famous in his own right.

732
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,920
This is Tommy Piper.

733
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,440
And an article that I was reading pointed out that Tommy Piper

734
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,920
you know, Germany loved Alf for some reason,

735
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,680
and they specifically loved Tommy Piper as Alf.

736
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,520
And in Germany, Tommy Piper recorded two albums as Alf,

737
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,320
which spawned four top 10 singles.

738
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,520
Holy shit.

739
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,240
Yeah, much better than Alf's try

740
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,200
charting much higher than Alf in the States, who only had those

741
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,080
burger, those Burger King records.

742
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,280
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow.

743
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,800
Sounds familiar.

744
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,160
And you got to come back for us to do this.

745
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,400
We got to do these.

746
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,920
We got to do these all for. Yeah.

747
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,600
They were they were like they weren't even like records.

748
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,680
They were like these like square, like thin pieces of plastic

749
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,120
that could play one song.

750
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,200
McDonald's quick hit, whatever that played like in sync.

751
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,640
I'm loving it.

752
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,920
A flexi disc, right? Flexi.

753
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,720
Yes, that's it. Yes. I think that's right.

754
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,960
Yeah, I was just in this. I will go right back to this.

755
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,400
I was just made aware that Webster had a hit in Japan.

756
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,720
What? Yeah. Do you not know?

757
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,120
Do you not know this, Scott?

758
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,800
No, I don't miss. Oh, my God.

759
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,920
I was just somebody.

760
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,840
One of my friends was like, hey, did you know Webster had a hit in Japan?

761
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,200
And I went, oh, my God.

762
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,280
No way. When he was on the show,

763
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,240
Manuel Lewis had a like chop charting single.

764
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,320
What's the gist of it?

765
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,600
I think it's about maybe partying, I think.

766
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,800
Good for him.

767
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,640
It's good. Very city pop.

768
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,200
Well, oh, really? OK.

769
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,520
I mean, while you do that,

770
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,600
let me just screen show one more time so you guys can see the cover of this one.

771
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,280
This is a compilation album called Alph's Summer Hit Parade,

772
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,240
which has he I think there is an Alph song called Alice Paradiso.

773
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,400
And there is some original Tommy Piper material on here.

774
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,520
But otherwise, it's just like fine young cannibals.

775
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,560
She drives me crazy.

776
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,840
And cool and getting celebration.

777
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,720
It's the it's 28 Internet.

778
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,960
So now top hits and only one of the 28 is Alph.

779
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,200
Did you wait? Is it not even it's not even Alph covering?

780
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,520
She drives me crazy. It's just she drives me crazy.

781
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,840
Fine young cannibals, just the regular one.

782
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:06,000
But it's it's it's this is like if Alph curated his favorite.

783
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,280
OK, this is like you got Alph summer like play like Alph summer playlist.

784
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,120
Like this would be a Spotify thing.

785
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,160
Like between seasons, if they were making Alph now, you'd get like Alph

786
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,440
summer playlists. Right.

787
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,400
For some summer hits.

788
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,920
Chilling on with these cool tunes.

789
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,240
Barack Obama took the idea of doing a summer playlist from Alph from Al.

790
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,520
Yeah. Now, that's what I call music.

791
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,640
Oh, a lot of money to Alph summer hits parade.

792
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,600
Nobody had thought of putting this together until I'm high.

793
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,520
Yeah. Yeah. Compiling music.

794
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,920
All outside. Webster's song is called City Connection.

795
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,840
Emanuel Lewis, City Connection.

796
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,360
And it is credit to Emanuel Lewis.

797
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,560
The YouTube clip I initially saw said Webster, but it is Emanuel Lewis.

798
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,400
City Connection.

799
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,800
And it is very good title. Wow.

800
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,800
No, it's it's a cool song.

801
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,480
I would like this city connection if that was a if that was a song,

802
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,080
if it was a place that you could go, if that was a bar I can hang in.

803
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,400
That's just a good phrase.

804
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:08,800
Like like an early 90s, like kind of like like, you know, cop thriller.

805
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,120
Like the city connection seems. Yeah.

806
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,800
Some boring Jason Patrick kind of movie.

807
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,240
Yeah, yeah.

808
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,880
So what one more clip, just to give you a taste of the Alph music.

809
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,360
I wanted to hear him talk before I shared the clip of the song.

810
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,440
This is Alph's biggest hit.

811
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,640
Hello, Alph, Aries to Rhonda.

812
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,840
Is anyone does anyone know Rhonda offhand?

813
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,960
Is anyone an Alph fan enough to know Rhonda?

814
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,280
Rhonda was his girlfriend back on Melamac.

815
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,200
You go. Wow. Geez.

816
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,480
You had it.

817
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,200
I didn't know about Rhonda till this.

818
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,840
And we're looking at Rhonda right now.

819
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:49,520
Rhonda sings the first part via pre-recorded looped remixed material.

820
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,320
And then you will see Tommy Piper, the German Alph. Here we go.

821
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,800
So just to loop the listeners in,

822
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:22,720
Tommy Piper is singing next to just an endlessly floating pink.

823
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,040
Like it's what the Superman two villains get trapped in.

824
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,840
It never stops rotating and Rhonda is trapped inside of it.

825
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,560
Well, Tommy Piper sings and Tommy is.

826
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,720
I mean, I've been in my head calling him German Randy Newman.

827
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,760
Yeah, that's very accurate.

828
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,320
Yeah, that's it. Yes.

829
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:46,240
Also, they they Germany had a Rhonda puppet.

830
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,680
We did it like that.

831
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,920
We didn't have like Rhonda in puppet form, I think.

832
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,320
She was only like a concept.

833
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,200
I think she showed up in the animated show, but like that's

834
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,520
I didn't realize how like deeply into Al of Germany was.

835
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,960
It was maybe not a puppet Rhonda until Germany.

836
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,240
Germany. Yeah, they were like, we need to fill this part of the lore.

837
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,040
This is whatever this this German hits show

838
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,160
top music or whatever needs to we need to see Rhonda.

839
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,960
This is we got to do a whole we have to all do a whole thing here.

840
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

841
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,600
Yeah, if I mean, if only I don't know if he's still around,

842
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,640
but if Tommy Piper, if Tommy Piper himself could do the official

843
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,640
come buzzy buzzy, is there still time?

844
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,680
And it's August.

845
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,760
Can we still get this in as song of the summer?

846
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,080
Our come buzzy buzzy with Tommy Piper.

847
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,240
I think we can. Yeah.

848
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:42,040
I mean, everything is everything is delayed at the moment.

849
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,600
So I think we can just say it's still summer whenever.

850
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,400
Oh, like taxes, like taxes happen three months later.

851
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:52,000
So some of the summer entries can still come in, you know, by October.

852
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,400
We're not going to age.

853
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,080
Just don't even count the birthday this year.

854
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,800
Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, it doesn't.

855
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,040
Doesn't count. Our bodies will be nice to us, right?

856
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,280
They won't add wrinkles.

857
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,600
They'll cut us a break.

858
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,960
Trees won't grow rings.

859
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,000
Yeah, nothing stressful.

860
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,440
Nothing stressful will make us

861
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,560
older. So that's wow.

862
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,160
That's Alves love affair with Germany, which seemingly fueled them,

863
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,560
you know, putting this in like, you know, the Gremlins aren't going to be enough.

864
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,840
We have to marry them with Germany's favorite son, Alf.

865
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,080
And all. Hey, wait, all of that was a distraction from what happens

866
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,480
in the scene.

867
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,080
So we're just watching a regular scene of Alf.

868
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,760
There's a there's a buzzy and he goes after it.

869
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,840
And I the only word I understood was Essen, which is eat.

870
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,960
So clearly he's trying to eat the cat and he reaches into the sink

871
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,760
to go for this cat and finds not a cat, but in fact a Gremlin.

872
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,800
And then out from drawers burst Gremlins and cabinets and microwaves.

873
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,680
And this just feels like the movie.

874
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,240
This is like getting a little theme park exclusive Gremlin sequel.

875
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,480
Yeah. Yeah.

876
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,920
Yeah. I actually think there's like there's some like the music

877
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,840
and the audio and some of the audio is like lifted directly.

878
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,680
It's definitely new puppeteering, but like a lot of the audio,

879
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:13,680
I think, is almost lifted directly from the kitchen attack scene in Gremlins, too.

880
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,760
Oh, that's why.

881
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,440
So it's completely the vibe because they're just using the sounds.

882
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,400
Well, well, yeah, definitely.

883
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,640
It's definitely the same track.

884
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,480
That's amazing.

885
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,480
So they so that's a logistics thing that they had to do.

886
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,480
And they had to make new Gremlin puppets just for this.

887
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,880
And also, as I said, Alf has been off the air for six years.

888
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,680
So they had to make a new Alf set just to do this.

889
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,760
Wow. And it's it's very close to like what the Alf Kitchen set is.

890
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,400
Yeah, yeah.

891
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,120
They had to get it out of the Smithsonian.

892
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,720
I was going to say, was it in maybe like the Smithsonian or the Germans?

893
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,960
That's exactly what I was about to say.

894
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,200
Was it in the German Smithsonian already?

895
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,200
And then they just filmed it there.

896
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,400
Yeah, we have the cheer set.

897
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,880
They have the Alf Kitchen Smithsonian guys in.

898
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,440
Yeah, yeah.

899
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,080
That's right.

900
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,280
I yeah, we need a deep dive into it.

901
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,040
Like was Hasselhoff more?

902
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,560
Was he bigger in Germany or was Alf bigger?

903
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,680
Yeah. And did they hate each other?

904
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,600
Right. If Alf saw Hasselhoff anywhere, would they get in a fight?

905
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,520
Was there like a bitch?

906
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,400
Was there like a Lee Roth Hagar tour they tried to go on and then they couldn't

907
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,120
get along because he didn't want to Alf, he didn't want Alf to close.

908
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,400
And then he better war.

909
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,960
Yeah, for.

910
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,560
Yeah, they were going to switch back and forth.

911
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,320
But four shows in, they killed it.

912
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,160
You know what I neglected to say?

913
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,760
David Hasselhoff's stirring Berlin Wall,

914
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,200
crumbling anthem, looking for freedom is on Alf's summer hit parade.

915
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,080
So really, maybe that indicates that like

916
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,840
West and East Germany, that they came to a historic truce.

917
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,800
I hope that's the case.

918
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,760
I hope we don't find something ugly between the two of them.

919
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,840
The drunk footage of Alf.

920
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,520
The claw in it.

921
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,080
Don't even don't even look at me, David.

922
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,800
Don't even look at me.

923
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,960
I don't have the problem. You have the problem.

924
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:20,240
So, yeah, you got a little exclusive Alf movie with mixed up with the Grimms,

925
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,240
which is what I kind of we wanted from the Beetlejuice version.

926
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,800
If it was like Beetlejuice just going nuts and then he like he's

927
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,560
met his match with the gremlins in a little scene.

928
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,880
Sure, you think that would have gone a long way.

929
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,120
That would have been fun.

930
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:36,280
So it's easier to get else than to get Michael Keaton.

931
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,080
For some reason, Michael Keaton didn't want to suit up again

932
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,600
for clear for not much money.

933
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,280
What a quitter.

934
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,000
I think they could have gotten

935
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
they could have gotten like whoever was playing Beetlejuice at Universal Florida.

936
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,040
They could have gotten something like that.

937
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,520
Because Beetlejuice is an animatronic in it, right?

938
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,440
Yes. So, yeah, we haven't talked about it.

939
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,520
It seems like he's an animatronic several times.

940
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:06,240
It seems like if they had and if they could get Sandra Bullock for like the opening,

941
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,080
I guess they didn't.

942
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,720
Australia didn't have Sandra Bullock.

943
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,080
Sandra Bullock was exclusive to Germany.

944
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:14,040
Don't think so, because this was put in in 96, which was post speed.

945
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,080
So she's at her height.

946
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:18,720
But the other one was 91 where we didn't we hadn't really met Sandra yet.

947
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,120
So, right. I guess that's what's going on again.

948
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:26,320
Now that we know we're adding the plot, the Gremlins have interrupted the Alf show.

949
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,640
Why the bloopers?

950
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,800
Why did any of that happen?

951
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,680
Yeah, why wasn't it just like you're seeing Alf and like we're seeing an episode of Alf

952
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,320
and like it's playing out normally the same jokes and then he goes into the kitchen

953
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,440
and then it's Gremlins terror.

954
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,720
Like that would make a lot more sense.

955
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,280
Like, hey, we're going to show you a new episode of Alf.

956
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,720
Remember Alf, the top character in Germany?

957
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,880
We're going to see an episode.

958
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,240
That would be the good that would be an easy conduit.

959
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,320
And you still get a fake out.

960
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,960
You still get the fun fake out.

961
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:57,560
I mean, I can kind of understand like you're getting into the vibe of like,

962
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,480
it's like, oh, we're seeing some bloopers.

963
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,760
There's this blooper and that like, oh, like Michael J.

964
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,640
Fox got pulled away by a pig and now like, but the ultimate blooper is Gremlins

965
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,080
attack your set. But like, it's still like like,

966
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,720
it's like I can understand the the like the thought,

967
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,000
but it doesn't quite like play out.

968
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,080
Here's my punch up to what I just said.

969
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,160
It's Alf hosts the history of the movies.

970
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,400
Alf is in his house. He's going, he says, well, here we're going to look at it.

971
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,760
You know, it doesn't always go right on.

972
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,680
He doesn't always go right on set.

973
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,040
And then we see a few bloopers and then he cuts back to Alf.

974
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,200
He's in the kitchen and then the Gremlins explode.

975
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,680
So now we've already set up.

976
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,680
It's about the magic of filmmaking.

977
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,720
Alf is there and now the Gremlins are a surprise.

978
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:43,840
So so basically your punch up is eliminate Sandra Bullock.

979
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,400
Just give it all to 100 percent gone.

980
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,760
Bullock gone. Michael J. Fox gone. Mathau gone.

981
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,040
Unfortunately, yeah, he had to kick her out.

982
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,680
But you know, yeah, she offers nothing to the story.

983
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,440
Yeah, I feel no remorse about this. Yeah. Yeah.

984
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,960
Not that I don't. I mean, yeah.

985
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:05,880
And you know, I want to I want an Alf Sandra Bullock team up someday.

986
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,880
But this wasn't the place or time.

987
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,520
Doesn't seem that crazy that in some bizarre post

988
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,880
Deadpool that somehow the hottest property would become the

989
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:22,240
or I should say post Detective Pikachu, really, that somehow

990
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,880
there's a really cutting edge Alf Sandra Bullock film.

991
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,040
And it is the it saves the movie industry.

992
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:32,240
It played in three years and puts people back in the AMC seats.

993
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,600
Like what? Yeah, that's it brings people back to theater.

994
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:42,320
The the just like on fire combination of Sandra Bullock and Alf.

995
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,800
That'd be great. I mean, I think we all actually like that idea.

996
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,160
Yeah. Oh, genuinely. Yes.

997
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,280
I'm looking at smiles. This is all very sincere. Yeah.

998
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,600
Oh, take some time.

999
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,640
It's just it's just here.

1000
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,880
Take a deep breath and imagine it.

1001
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,600
And then it's such a man.

1002
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,600
Let's all select the split screen option on Max.

1003
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,280
And we're all pulling up final draft to take a crack at it.

1004
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,240
What are all splitting up scenes?

1005
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,240
Yes. Oh, wait.

1006
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,120
The gremlins are in our computer.

1007
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:14,520
They're messing with her final draft files. Get out of here.

1008
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,320
Well, now that you know, that is something that that gives me the

1009
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,440
they could have done a parody of theme park rides

1010
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:28,600
going like theme, the setup of theme park rides being X thing goes wrong.

1011
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,160
As it stands, it's just movie studio.

1012
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,080
History goes wrong.

1013
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:36,920
Escape through fake movie studio.

1014
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,360
But if they were like, it's the movie studio, right?

1015
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,400
Or like, well, the I think I know you're saying it.

1016
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,440
I think it's probably a good idea.

1017
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,760
I think the whole focus, much like Universal Studios for this park

1018
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:52,840
with when it was rethought, was we're going to show everyone how to make movies.

1019
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,280
So I think they were like, everything has to sort of correspond to this

1020
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:00,800
park narrative in the same way that Universal early on was very focused on

1021
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,000
making movies.

1022
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,680
And it's another one of those weird

1023
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:11,120
where the the the German one was kind of copying the branding of the Australian one.

1024
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,320
But the German one was never a movie studio,

1025
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,840
whereas Australia was and maybe still is.

1026
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:19,640
I know that strangely the 2002 Scooby

1027
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:24,560
Doo, either that one or the sequel or both were shot.

1028
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,200
Now I have an there's an attraction at the park based on Scooby Doo, but

1029
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,200
they were also shot right there.

1030
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:35,320
I I believe the Australian, literally the Australian Scooby Doo.

1031
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:39,560
It's like they shot it in the studio, like right next to the the Australian

1032
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,800
the Australian park.

1033
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,240
And I believe that's the ride that to this day.

1034
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:47,520
Occupies the space that was Gremlins is I think it's called like Scooby

1035
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,320
Doo's like spooky coaster or whatever.

1036
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:55,640
And it's still very steeped in the 2002 Scooby Doo movie, where

1037
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:59,880
like I think like you still like the coaster faces off against like monster

1038
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,200
Scrappy Doo. Oh, great.

1039
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,480
Wow. I love that.

1040
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,680
I forgot that's what happens in those movies.

1041
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:10,040
The German replacement is along the lines of this ride.

1042
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,280
The German replacement is much funnier.

1043
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:16,240
I don't remember what it is in the wider cultural spectrum.

1044
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,720
Oh, it's a Van Helsing.

1045
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,720
He's right. Yeah.

1046
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,680
Have you ever seen the the intro video for that ride is great.

1047
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,440
No, no. Mm hmm.

1048
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,920
It's it's like it's like a news.

1049
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,960
It's like a German newscaster being like, oh, yeah, I saw that.

1050
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:35,440
It's like vampires are going to attack Germany in a couple of months.

1051
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,600
Like if that our only hope is Van Helsing.

1052
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:39,920
But I just I felt like imminent.

1053
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,520
It's like a couple of months in a couple of months, vampires might attack.

1054
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,960
Where's Van Helsing?

1055
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,160
There's a lack of urgency in that setup.

1056
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,120
Yeah. Oh, it's cool.

1057
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:53,440
They're preparing early, though, unlike the coronavirus preparation and

1058
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,440
snuffing it out.

1059
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,800
Yeah. I mean, you'd rather they get to it three months ahead of time.

1060
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:00,720
It is efficient, famously efficient Germans.

1061
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Very efficient.

1062
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,280
But like, you know, I like Plan A.

1063
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,120
Yes, like Van Helsing. Great.

1064
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,240
But like, like if you have this much time, we work it on some back

1065
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,320
work on some backup.

1066
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,960
I guess. Yeah. Yeah.

1067
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,080
I have a couple. Yeah.

1068
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,400
Like it's like we're, you know, we're developing several vaccines right now

1069
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,120
for covid. So I have multiple vampire hunters.

1070
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,760
Abraham Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln,

1071
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,400
Al.

1072
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,400
Al.

1073
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,520
And a vampire hunter.

1074
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,680
Yeah, I'm now a proponent of Al's being.

1075
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:35,680
Let's just just copy and paste our plus up for any ride in the future

1076
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,280
to be more out.

1077
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,040
Mm hmm. I mean, that's a good I mean, we should say what ride would be better

1078
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,000
with Alph on it and is the answer all of them.

1079
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,280
I can't think of one where it would

1080
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,240
bother me like I'm trying to think of rides that I love.

1081
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,440
Star tours.

1082
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,960
If suddenly like star tours, what are you doing?

1083
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,080
That'd be great.

1084
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,720
I'm the greatest. He was alien.

1085
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,000
It makes so much sense.

1086
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,200
Is any ride too sacred for Alph?

1087
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,720
Alph and the country bear Jamboree would kill.

1088
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,000
It would be awesome.

1089
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:07,920
Oh, yeah.

1090
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:13,200
Alph is Alph is your skipper for the 10 times better than the regular skippers.

1091
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,680
Yeah. No offense to them.

1092
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,680
They're great. It's just Alph would be the best.

1093
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,000
Those leopards are making me hungry.

1094
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,920
Wow. This is great.

1095
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:26,000
They should just have a whole year where Alph's on every ride at Disneyland.

1096
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:30,280
Oh, yeah. Well, you know, suspense for the Sandra Bullock movie.

1097
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:31,760
Yeah.

1098
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:35,880
Alph should really when when Halloween Horror Nights come back,

1099
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:39,280
like Alph hosting a terror tram would be amazing.

1100
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,640
Oh, yeah. That's that is legitimately very good.

1101
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:47,880
Yeah. I, I, Alph, even Alph just popping up in the mazes.

1102
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,840
Like you could have a connecting narrative where Alph's just is in all the mazes

1103
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,720
in little spots.

1104
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,360
Yeah. The character.

1105
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,440
Which I mean, all together this year is Alph.

1106
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:01,000
Yeah, there's no bad idea here.

1107
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,320
And there's like, I love the idea of there being like a wider narrative to all.

1108
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:07,080
Like, you know, if you go to the mazes in the right order,

1109
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,920
there's a wider Alph narrative that you get.

1110
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,080
This is great. Talk to John Murty.

1111
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,560
Let's email him the head of Horror Nights.

1112
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,480
Yeah, we know how to save it next year.

1113
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,800
There's going to be trepidation about people going back.

1114
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,360
But we've got just the thing.

1115
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,800
And Jason has interviewed the man in person.

1116
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,840
I have met him. Yes.

1117
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:29,440
Look, John, there's this Sandy Bullock Alph movie coming

1118
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,760
and you're going to want to be on the look.

1119
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,480
Every studio is co-producing this.

1120
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,280
So you're going to be want to be on the ground floor.

1121
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:42,920
Capitalizing on come pussy pussy, the hottest song of summer 2020.

1122
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,480
It's going to be Al fever and everyone's going to want a piece.

1123
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,160
So Alph mayhem happens.

1124
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,640
Then some footage is repeated from government's to government's too.

1125
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,320
But I'm not complaining because I like that a lot.

1126
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:02,720
Then if you guys watched both the Australian version and the German version,

1127
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,040
there's a big difference here.

1128
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:08,720
So the the Grimmons are in the projection booth and in the Australian one,

1129
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,600
it's like, oh, my God, everyone, gremlins here.

1130
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,080
Hurry, you got to come in here.

1131
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,000
We got to escape in the German one.

1132
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,240
The lights come on and everyone quietly exits the room.

1133
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:24,440
A door silently opens and everyone just gets up and walks through it.

1134
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,640
I hear people sigh.

1135
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,840
Is there an announcement to walk through the door or they just go,

1136
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,280
oh, the door's open, let's go.

1137
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,840
Probably. We know what this meant.

1138
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,400
We're efficient. We know what to do.

1139
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:37,080
It felt like it felt like when Gio and I were at Six Flags on the Justice League

1140
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:41,480
ride and doors would just open and you go, I think we're supposed to go in that door

1141
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,880
because there's no one here to tell us that.

1142
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:45,640
And it felt yeah.

1143
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:49,160
So it was like, I wonder if somebody was on this, maybe another side of the room.

1144
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:52,560
And you couldn't see and they were like, just like they did like an aggressive point like.

1145
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,800
There, everyone's like, OK, all right, we'll go.

1146
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,680
Mark's through the door.

1147
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,480
You walk through a room that has just a bunch of posters on the wall,

1148
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,840
like really quick, you see a flash of a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers poster.

1149
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,800
I'm not sure why.

1150
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,080
It's just a bunch of random posters.

1151
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,080
But then really, really cool.

1152
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,880
You don't even have to wait for the ride.

1153
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:17,040
There is a gremlin swinging on a light fixture.

1154
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:21,520
And when you get up close to it, the light bulb that's actually on

1155
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,360
and powered is in his hand. Really cool.

1156
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,200
Very cool. Yeah.

1157
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,160
So it does feel like that's the spirit.

1158
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:31,440
Immediately they got the spirit.

1159
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,160
You want to see. Yeah, you want to feel like because if I was a kid,

1160
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:35,880
that would scare the shit out of me immediately.

1161
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,480
I would be like, oh, God, here we go.

1162
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,440
Walk forward. I'd be kind of like, does it?

1163
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:43,480
It's like the alien on great movie ride.

1164
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:46,120
Come to the ceiling. I have to go under this.

1165
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,080
This is too much, too much for me.

1166
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,520
Yeah. So cool.

1167
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,840
Do that classic like haunted house

1168
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:55,120
move of like staying really close behind somebody else.

1169
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,000
Oh, I know it well. So if there's a scare, they take it.

1170
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,040
And then you can like run and then like and then hurry them along.

1171
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,080
Yeah, I still employ this tactic to this day.

1172
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,360
Yeah. It's a good tactic.

1173
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:10,760
The Valencia teens shielded me last year at Frightfest from all the scares.

1174
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,560
I would I would be hiding behind the teens in Valencia.

1175
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,720
It's a good strategy.

1176
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:21,360
Yeah. But now with social distancing, you're going to have to wait.

1177
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:26,680
But the least distant you are is ever is hiding behind teens to get through.

1178
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,560
That's a good question.

1179
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,840
Well, I still feel comfortable hiding behind the Valencia teens.

1180
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,480
I don't. Well, at least anything that's good that might scare you,

1181
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,120
you know, will be six feet away for a while.

1182
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,640
Hopefully. Yeah. Yeah.

1183
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,440
The next year's mazes alpha will have to be six feet away

1184
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,840
in the mazes when he's tying it all together.

1185
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,320
Many, many. Yeah.

1186
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,920
So now you're at least in the video we're watching.

1187
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:54,320
There's a cut. Now you're in the ride vehicle and you're and suddenly Gizmo.

1188
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,880
Here we go. I don't know where. Yes.

1189
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,320
Yeah. He got in the ride up until this point.

1190
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:04,080
Yeah. So Gizmo's here and Alf is in a cool chair,

1191
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,160
a rotating chair with a little joystick.

1192
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,360
And they're hanging together.

1193
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,800
I guess Gizmo reasons he is fluffy like me.

1194
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:20,120
So I should cling to Alf for safety.

1195
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:25,120
Although Gizmo resembles a cat much more than the other gremlins.

1196
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:28,280
So watch out Gizmo. Yes. Yes.

1197
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,680
This is this is great.

1198
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:34,040
Alf in the big chair is this chair is sticking out to me as well

1199
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,680
when I'm watching this video for whatever reason.

1200
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:39,280
This is I like the rest of the ride.

1201
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,000
I like what what follows.

1202
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,280
But this is really the image.

1203
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:47,240
This is when I think whenever I first saw an article about it,

1204
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:51,520
which might have been Peter at Slashfilm, who I think listens to the show, the

1205
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:56,280
that that just like what it's mind boggling seeing those two next.

1206
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,760
And a cool chair is the best.

1207
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,720
One of the best chairs in a ride, I think.

1208
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:03,800
I think so. Yeah.

1209
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,040
Can we think of a better chair?

1210
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,040
Mm hmm.

1211
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,680
Are there thrones or thrones in rides, I assume?

1212
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,600
Yeah. The fact that we can't think of one immediately means this one

1213
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:18,400
is this one of the chair final four by default.

1214
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,400
I guess like I would think like there's like the pirate

1215
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:27,720
it doesn't the pirate king have a throne in Pirates of the Caribbean.

1216
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,320
The first part that that.

1217
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,200
Yeah, but it's not like that's it.

1218
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,000
Like that's a fine chair, but it doesn't like stick out.

1219
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,480
It doesn't even like it took me a minute to think about it.

1220
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,840
Whatever the chair. Yeah.

1221
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,720
Is it I think it's the same chair that Captain Jack Sparrow

1222
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,800
is sitting in at the end of the ride.

1223
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,360
Yeah. Going back up the lift hill.

1224
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,200
Yeah. So I guess that's in contention.

1225
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:53,120
Again, solution to it, should we be arriving at a point

1226
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,560
where Johnny Depp should not be in that attraction?

1227
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,640
All elf, all of them are.

1228
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,960
Oh, perfect. Oh, God.

1229
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,480
I read pirate elf.

1230
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:05,320
That'd be great. Elf with an eyepatch.

1231
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,600
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1232
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:07,920
That's a plus.

1233
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,800
I just as long as we're like eliminating like problematic people

1234
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:18,840
and things from from theme parks, let's just give all of of Hogwarts to.

1235
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,680
So wait, how about how about we just say elf created Harry Potter?

1236
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,560
So you reimagine it as if it's from the mind of elf.

1237
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:32,880
Yeah, I like but like I want all of like all the rides to be redone with like

1238
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,680
no matter how right Mackey and Harry Potter.

1239
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,280
Yeah, but perfect.

1240
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,360
Yeah. So you just change all the human characters

1241
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:44,080
to or the wizard characters to elf Malmacians.

1242
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,720
Escape from Gringotts is now Rhonda's revenge.

1243
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,280
Fantastic.

1244
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,840
I think this would get the industry moving again, I think.

1245
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:00,680
There's probably a warehouse of old elf masks in America or in Germany

1246
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,480
that we can just you don't even have to spend a lot of money to upgrade these.

1247
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,120
You put the masks.

1248
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,920
Jason, that's smart thinking.

1249
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,320
Do it cheaply. That's good.

1250
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,720
You know, do it.

1251
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:16,440
We got to have you got to reopen with some new attractions when you reopen.

1252
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:21,800
OK, so it's just it's Jack Sparrow, but with an elf mask

1253
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:29,320
and then like some brown baseball gloves to quickly simulate out of the sands.

1254
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,120
Yeah, there's no yeah, we should specify all the elf plus ups.

1255
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,920
There's no money to do them.

1256
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:39,400
So they have to be an elf mask found in a warehouse in Germany that already exists.

1257
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,480
And then some brown like winter gloves

1258
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,800
or some like burlap burlap or leather gloves.

1259
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,720
An elf has a human proportion.

1260
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:51,080
Alf is six foot one.

1261
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:54,280
He's like a weird, weird Halloween, like cheap Halloween store

1262
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,640
costume version of it.

1263
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,160
Yeah, just like Alf.

1264
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,720
Yeah, it's like what I would like.

1265
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,120
Six, three, six, three, elf.

1266
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,280
That weirds me out to a big elf.

1267
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:08,720
Oh, you'll get the writing light, the lighting right.

1268
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,240
And you'll be it'll be great.

1269
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,160
You'll ever know.

1270
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,320
The Imagineers will figure that out.

1271
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:15,040
How to yeah. Yeah.

1272
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:20,000
So I think at this point is where this is where it's all been.

1273
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,120
I think we can say this is one of the strangest rides that we've ever talked about.

1274
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:28,040
And it gets extra strange when you start heading through this facility,

1275
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,080
which is sort of a film vault.

1276
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,960
And then the first room, I just when you see the all caps, German word

1277
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:38,160
film archive, which is, you know, spell like our archive is spelled without an E

1278
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,280
and it's all one word.

1279
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:43,600
This is just this is where it feels like an art film of a ride.

1280
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:50,640
Now it's just so abstract and strange and sometimes spare for a little bit.

1281
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,920
They you're going through a room that's so dark that the guy filming it

1282
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,080
is to turn the night vision on. Yeah.

1283
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:59,400
Yeah, I think also maybe they were they kind of like this idea

1284
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,240
because they were like, well, it's a warehouse, so it doesn't have to look

1285
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,240
that good.

1286
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:07,640
It doesn't have to have so much production value to it.

1287
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:08,720
There's just the.

1288
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:12,800
Yeah, we got we got low ceilings and it makes sense.

1289
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,160
So it does feel yeah, there might have been some.

1290
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,680
Yeah, because you would obviously want the ride to take place in that.

1291
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,520
What did you call an atrium?

1292
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,520
What did you do from the movie?

1293
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,720
So, yes. Yeah, yeah.

1294
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,560
The clamp tower.

1295
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:28,240
But yeah, they're not going to build that.

1296
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:31,920
This is, you know, actually, when you bring up the stuff from the movie,

1297
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:36,640
I realized something, maybe why Beetlejuice and Alf

1298
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:41,720
and anyone, you know, go ahead and call me a heretic about this.

1299
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,840
But it seems like of all the things that we could say that we love about

1300
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:48,400
the Gremlins movies, it does not feel like the main actor

1301
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,040
really sticks with anybody.

1302
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,800
I don't want to just trash this guy.

1303
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,680
Human character that Gallagher and Gallagher.

1304
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:57,520
Yeah.

1305
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,360
Um, well, like he's fine.

1306
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,920
It's just not, you know, like he didn't become some big films.

1307
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,320
It's not exactly like a charismatic Michael J.

1308
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,920
Fox at the center of the movie.

1309
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:11,200
And in a way, is that why we got to bring in Beetlejuice and Alf?

1310
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:15,520
Because we can't like nobody's going to get excited that Zach.

1311
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,160
Yeah, Billy's here.

1312
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,400
Yeah. Am I wrong?

1313
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,120
Do people love Billy and I'm I'm?

1314
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,960
No, he's fine.

1315
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,680
I'm not saying he's fine. Yeah.

1316
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,520
Phoebe Cates was the star.

1317
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,600
I didn't realize her whole career is that like

1318
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:34,600
people were nervous about her doing gremlins because she had done so many

1319
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:40,480
like scandalous roles, which look pretty tame in our current

1320
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,520
like the current culture.

1321
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,480
Those Phoebe Cates like scandalous roles.

1322
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:48,040
Well, yeah, she takes off her top once.

1323
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:50,200
And that's so appalling.

1324
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,400
Well, yeah.

1325
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,800
And there were some some other movie like that, too.

1326
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,400
And she did a lot of magazines.

1327
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,840
Like she was a big star.

1328
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:02,720
And I think it was one of them, either Dante or Spielberg went to bat

1329
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,720
for her to get her in gremlins.

1330
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,600
And I like her in this.

1331
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,440
I think she I wish they gave in the movies.

1332
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:14,440
I think they should have given her more stuff to do.

1333
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:19,280
Yeah. Well, the second movie especially kind of turns into an ensemble movie.

1334
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,720
Yeah, that's really like, yeah, got so many different characters.

1335
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,480
Like you see, there's certain characters that are like have like three scenes.

1336
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,400
I feel like. Yeah, yeah.

1337
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,400
Kind of them among.

1338
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:33,160
So I guess, yeah, it wouldn't really make sense to anchor it in these folks.

1339
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:33,640
Yeah.

1340
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:37,080
And animatronics of them might not work so great.

1341
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,880
They might not be identifiable because there's at some point

1342
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,880
like a human security guard in this ride.

1343
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,960
And it's very much of the quality of like the E.T.

1344
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:48,600
police officers.

1345
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,960
It's not exactly fully articulated.

1346
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:51,840
Yeah.

1347
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:53,840
Mannequins that have slight movement.

1348
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,920
A glorified mannequin. Yes.

1349
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:56,920
Yeah.

1350
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,080
So, yeah, that's interesting.

1351
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:01,520
Like, I guess, yeah, you would want like some that.

1352
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,760
Yeah, was we were saying someone to explain it.

1353
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,840
And it's not like.

1354
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:10,280
Yeah, there's such a strong character that everyone immediately goes,

1355
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:12,400
oh, I know who that is.

1356
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,200
It would be nice to see the the count, the

1357
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,680
L. Lewis.

1358
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,040
Yeah, that's you could do that.

1359
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,120
That's like broad enough to do as an animatronic.

1360
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,200
Can I ask a question?

1361
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,520
Why didn't they just get Al Lewis?

1362
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,200
I love that. That actor is great.

1363
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,120
They talk about that.

1364
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:31,480
I saw Joe Dante interviews where they he has been posed that question.

1365
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,560
And he said he just thought it'd be more interesting if a real

1366
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,600
more esteemed actor did it.

1367
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,480
Fair.

1368
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,840
I mean, Al Lewis is a maniac.

1369
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,840
And I think it would be interesting also to see him in this movie.

1370
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:47,200
Just like, yeah, like just play it be like as Al Lewis.

1371
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,000
Yes. Yeah.

1372
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,200
I mean, you could have worn out anything, really,

1373
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:54,040
because obviously he has very grandpa Munster outfit and hair in this.

1374
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:58,640
But Al Lewis is another, I assume, future second gate episode waiting to happen.

1375
01:19:58,880 --> 01:19:59,800
Oh, yeah.

1376
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:04,080
Because he had a restaurant called Grandpa's that he did not own,

1377
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,720
but he would just sit there all day

1378
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,400
and like greet people, essentially.

1379
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,200
I'm game. I'll do that one.

1380
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,080
Yeah. He could have been in this just as well as Alf.

1381
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,360
So anyway, now you end up.

1382
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,440
So now you're in the film vaults.

1383
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,320
You're watching a vault get destroyed.

1384
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,880
It's a little bit more comical than the massive universal fire,

1385
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,400
which destroyed the masters of many of our favorite artists

1386
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:36,240
and millions of hours of historic music, a modern burning of Alexandria,

1387
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:39,320
if you will, that happened on universal property.

1388
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:43,040
And they lied about anyway, it's more it's more fun to see the gremlins

1389
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:48,240
tearing apart, you know, what the the Maltese Falcon or something.

1390
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,440
I mean, that is fun.

1391
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,120
I mean, it would yes, it would be.

1392
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,320
It would have been more fun if whenever that was 10 years ago,

1393
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,480
if it was like gremlins have invaded Universal Studios

1394
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,480
and they ripping up Jimmy Buffett's masters.

1395
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:02,120
You know, you would enjoy that too of the most important masters.

1396
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,760
Well, yeah, you said like our most important artists.

1397
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,240
So I just I went to one of the, you know, the top recording artists.

1398
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:09,080
There were layers in there were instruments we didn't even know

1399
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:12,080
were layered into the 16 track mix of.

1400
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,920
Yeah, did you?

1401
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,840
There's three different kinds of steel drums he uses on

1402
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,680
License to Chill, the album License to Chill.

1403
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:20,840
So he built his own.

1404
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:25,280
He engineered his own last room, burnt them because he wasn't happy.

1405
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,200
Do you know how much reverb was on the steel drums on the album?

1406
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,920
Last Mango in Paris?

1407
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,760
I don't think you do. And you'll be able to.

1408
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,560
It's gone forever. We won't know.

1409
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:39,080
We won't have that like Giles Martin, George Martin's clip

1410
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:43,800
where they're in the studio raising the levels to hear exactly the lost parts

1411
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,520
of these great songs.

1412
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,320
We won't find the part in the notes where Jimmy said,

1413
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:51,000
Ed, this is fine and went on vacation.

1414
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:53,440
Put it out.

1415
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:54,960
Next two months off.

1416
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:55,680
Sounds good to me.

1417
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,600
And then there's the car speeding away.

1418
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,720
Or I guess the plane or the boat speeding away.

1419
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,360
Have fun mixing by.

1420
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:07,680
Uh, OK, so, uh, let's see.

1421
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,160
We're in the film vault.

1422
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,680
What scenes stick out to be?

1423
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:14,360
I mean, this is again, it's not the most the best documented thing.

1424
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,880
We sort of go through like an editing facility.

1425
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:20,000
Are there moments that jump out to people?

1426
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:24,480
I think there isn't there like an editor who's like tied up or something.

1427
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:27,360
Yeah, you see a lot of like you kind of go by the different rooms

1428
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,760
and then there's the editing room, which looks like an editing room

1429
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:33,360
in from 1960 or something.

1430
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,400
And there's just so much tape everywhere spun around.

1431
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,880
And that's that's pretty fun.

1432
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:43,040
Yeah, yeah, it's very like reminiscent of like the the Gremlins

1433
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:47,120
messing with the reels at the movie theater and Gremlins in the first Gremlins.

1434
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,960
Yeah, yeah, it's all.

1435
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:54,120
You get some real core Gremlins action in this, right?

1436
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:57,200
And that I think the it's like what they want.

1437
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:03,480
What the Gremlins do is they immediately absorb what a human job is,

1438
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,880
kind of get the fundamentals of it and do it.

1439
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:11,360
But in a in an edgy way, an edgy destroy.

1440
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:16,000
Yeah. And like they like get enough of the thing to be like,

1441
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:20,120
I know how to turn this into like a bit like I can make it like I can do

1442
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,920
like the funny bit version of whatever this is.

1443
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,800
And Gremlins do they're pretty quickly on the phone saying, bye, sell.

1444
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:33,000
And like they're like trying to edit the movie and kind of pulling it off.

1445
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,200
But in a chaos way.

1446
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,080
Yeah, I like that scene.

1447
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,640
I like, oh, I got to get to the end of the ride already.

1448
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,320
The one that sticks out to me is the end where the Gremlin

1449
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:46,880
goes down the box and the lights go down because I just I'm having my little kid

1450
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:51,120
brain of like, oh, no, but it is a very memorable scene.

1451
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,680
And everything else bleeds together a little bit for me.

1452
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,720
It doesn't have these big like tentpole moments like some other rides.

1453
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:59,520
Do I feel like? Yeah.

1454
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,720
Well, though, though. Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

1455
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:04,320
Well, I was just going to say they lean a lot on the Gremlins

1456
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,720
getting into the costume department.

1457
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:09,520
Yeah. And then they get it like there's a marching band.

1458
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,360
There's I think it's a scene from Robin Hood.

1459
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,240
Prince of the OK.

1460
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,880
Yeah, there's a Robin Hood.

1461
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:19,160
The Robin Hood jousting like Robin Hood.

1462
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:22,840
Is it Little John that he that he is jousting?

1463
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:26,120
Is there there's like a Gremlin Robin Hood and Gremlin Little John.

1464
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,000
Yeah. With the Bo staffs on the law.

1465
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,720
Yeah. Yeah, that is good.

1466
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:33,600
I was I mean, this is very similar to great movie ride in the sense

1467
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:37,680
that you're in a very similar vehicle and you're going through little show scenes.

1468
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:40,560
But great movie ride, I think, is was as helped by the fact

1469
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,880
that you would stop for a second and you get everything to play out.

1470
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:46,200
And this one, you kind of just growl through it.

1471
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,280
So maybe stuff like that would pop a little bit better

1472
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:52,440
if they were like kind of more like this is this scene.

1473
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,120
And now this is this scene.

1474
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,720
It's kind of it's a pretty basic ride mechanism.

1475
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:00,520
And I feel like the only maybe that's the genuine plus up is, I think,

1476
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:05,000
if this if the ride could suddenly spin around by surprise

1477
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:09,800
in a cartoon spin sort of way or, you know, not that it's going to have a drop

1478
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,160
or anything, but or some, you know, weird jolts.

1479
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,280
I think any little effect like that would bump this over into

1480
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,240
a shockingly great ride.

1481
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,840
Because that's what I was going to say.

1482
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,760
If there's like I like we've said, like this,

1483
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:28,800
I think this ride really captures the spirit of like Gremlin's mayhem really well.

1484
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,280
I think the only thing that would do so even better and take it

1485
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:38,560
even like a more like Gremlin meta level is if it was like the Gremlins

1486
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,560
were also like fucking with the ride.

1487
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,720
Yes. Yeah. Oh, big time.

1488
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,720
You want the ride vehicle.

1489
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:49,440
I don't know if I'm sure Tony Baxter or somebody has said something like this.

1490
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:53,080
You do want the ride vehicle and what it does to sort of

1491
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:58,080
be the spirit of whatever the property is or whatever the idea behind the ride is.

1492
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:02,680
So it's like it's just going very slowly like it's a normal tram.

1493
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,440
It does defeat the purpose.

1494
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:07,360
You don't get the like crazy manic energy.

1495
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,440
Yeah. You saw it would be great if you saw a Gremlin

1496
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:14,080
with wires that were sparking.

1497
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:17,000
And clearly that is your your ride mechanism.

1498
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,640
Or yeah, I was just or I was even even like in the Jurassic Park ride

1499
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:24,000
where you're it looks like you're supposed to be going one way.

1500
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,640
But like the like the dinosaurs fuck with it and then you go the other way.

1501
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,200
Like that would be a fun mechanic where like, oh, this is the escape.

1502
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,160
Like no, but no, no, no.

1503
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:34,320
Like Gremlin's flip the switch and now you're going like deeper in.

1504
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,280
That would be great.

1505
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:39,560
Or the Gremlin is like controlling the like it's like on Rise of the Resistance.

1506
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,440
There's a droid controlling your vehicle.

1507
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:45,680
A Gremlin pops up from front of the ground and he's controlling the vehicle.

1508
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:48,000
Yes. Something like that.

1509
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,200
Or even like a tram full of Gremlins dressed like tourists.

1510
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:55,080
Like they are. Yeah, that's yes.

1511
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,360
That needs to happen.

1512
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:59,160
Oh, Gremlin tour guide would be so great.

1513
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,440
Yeah, yeah.

1514
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:03,880
I was going to say, I'd love it if like you could like you got like in

1515
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:08,880
like there were like maybe like I think all of the core Gremlins

1516
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,720
to Gremlins should like have their own like you either get like a Lenny,

1517
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,000
a Daffy or a George

1518
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:21,960
tram and it like yeah, like it even affects the way that the the the tram moves,

1519
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:26,040
depending on which Gremlin is navigating with like mumbly like

1520
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:28,760
as you can see on the left.

1521
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:29,600
Yeah.

1522
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,960
What's your turn of vehicle?

1523
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:34,440
What's the smart Gremlins name who's voiced by Tony Randall,

1524
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:36,960
the great Tony Randall from the odd couple?

1525
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,120
That is just brain.

1526
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:42,720
OK, I'm I would love to get brain Gremlins car to be the best tour.

1527
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,280
That'd be the most important.

1528
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,040
Yeah, he should be narrating this.

1529
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:48,520
He should be like, yeah, yes.

1530
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:52,600
Yeah, no, the guide or some sort of centerpiece of this.

1531
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,680
Honestly, he's so good.

1532
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:57,120
He's he could have he needed the money at the time, I believe,

1533
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:01,160
like around the time that like 82 year old Tony Randall

1534
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,440
like was actually having a having a kid.

1535
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:05,880
I think it might be years.

1536
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,680
I think it actually might be like five years before or something.

1537
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:10,400
He had kids.

1538
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,040
He had kids so late.

1539
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,720
He had like in his mid 70s and he dies five years later.

1540
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,640
It's insane. Yeah.

1541
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,040
Real wild. Anyway, yeah, you should.

1542
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,280
He should have done it.

1543
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,560
I think this is all you know.

1544
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:23,720
I don't even mean to like criticize this ride that much or say

1545
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:26,560
it's not the ultimate Gremlins experience.

1546
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:30,320
I'm almost just more excited about these plus ups and wish

1547
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:34,320
they could be done because I think they did get part of the way there.

1548
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:37,760
Like when you round a corner and see a room with, you know,

1549
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,840
over a dozen gremlins, which happens a couple of times, it's it's legit.

1550
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,240
And they pull it off great.

1551
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:44,000
You just wish they could.

1552
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,440
I wish you could go back in time and just give this ride,

1553
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,920
you know, tens of millions more of more dollars.

1554
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,000
I've got from now we've said a lot of different

1555
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,040
we've thrown a lot of different ideas out.

1556
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,120
Oh, and you mentioned 40 X early.

1557
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:01,920
I feel like maybe the ultimate gremlins would be essentially a Tiki room

1558
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,160
for the X gremlins show.

1559
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,720
A 360 gremlin show.

1560
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,400
The seats move.

1561
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,480
The whole thing can rotate gremlins popping out.

1562
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:16,400
You get to have all the fun with all the different characters.

1563
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,680
And it's a lot more like they're putting on a show for you like the birds are.

1564
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:26,440
Also, like attached to a like in park bar like like that.

1565
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:31,560
We were like, yeah, like where they're like gremlins on a seat next to you.

1566
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:35,840
Like, yeah, this would be yes, that would be a huge hit.

1567
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,120
I don't know.

1568
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:40,840
Warner Brothers is in a weird spot with theme parks still to this day.

1569
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:44,080
It feels like with some of these parks, they were like flirting

1570
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:48,520
a little bit more with getting like more involved, but then they've pulled back

1571
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,920
and then they sold six flags.

1572
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,680
I don't know if it's even possible.

1573
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:56,680
It's because it seems like I mean, I've done a lot of letters like they have.

1574
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,720
There's the Warner's Park in Dubai, right?

1575
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:00,720
Yeah. Yes. Yes.

1576
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:04,040
But that that means almost entirely on like Looney Tunes,

1577
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:06,360
DC and Scooby Doo, it feels like. Right.

1578
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,600
And even though I think that's not I think that's there's some cool stuff there.

1579
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,800
It doesn't feel like the biggest budget for everything.

1580
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:18,480
Yeah. So it's still like when will Warner Brothers

1581
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:23,480
other than obviously Harry Potter get a major budget for a lot of it?

1582
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:27,640
So like we don't have a definitive Batman ride, which is insane.

1583
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,080
Yeah, there's great coasters.

1584
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:34,360
But the idea that it's like so easy, like we want a good Batman ride.

1585
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:36,240
And it's like never going to happen.

1586
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:41,840
It's almost I would say behind the perennial issues with Tomorrowland.

1587
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:46,040
It's it's all I might call it the number two most persisting

1588
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,640
may never get solved.

1589
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:50,680
Big theme park problem that all of these properties

1590
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:54,600
that would make great attractions never get to imagineering level

1591
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:58,440
or universal level, you know, fully done versions.

1592
01:30:58,760 --> 01:30:59,720
Like just a man.

1593
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:03,120
Put the put the Gremlins thing we just described or any of our Gremlins ideas

1594
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:07,400
with the bar, a full Gotham City, an amazing ticket.

1595
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:10,240
Just make five of these things and it'll be so popular.

1596
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:13,960
Like it's such a slam dunk with how much people like all these Warner Brothers

1597
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:19,560
properties that if they just put the money into it, it would be so popular.

1598
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:23,440
Like a real Looney Tunes ride, like a ticket.

1599
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,040
Everyone is in it. Like, right.

1600
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,640
I don't. Yeah, right.

1601
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:29,760
And you take a Looney Tunes, you take a Batman.

1602
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,760
Also, you take a Gremlins.

1603
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:34,840
But we did the thing to make this happen.

1604
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:39,480
We have to change the structure of corporate America.

1605
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:43,280
This is a huge different things have to own different things.

1606
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,920
HBO Max world.

1607
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,880
Now that the restructuring.

1608
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,680
Yeah. I mean, why not?

1609
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:53,600
I mean, like, I mean, that makes it like, right.

1610
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:57,840
A game of a game like Game of Thrones ride makes total sense.

1611
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,440
They have so many things.

1612
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:03,000
They have so many properties that are like have stood the test of time

1613
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,360
that would really lend themselves to rides.

1614
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,760
And they just can't get their shit together.

1615
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:12,440
And now, especially I want to get a babe taking this.

1616
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,520
Babe, picking the city walk through kids, kids.

1617
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:19,560
It's a kids area is the big big in the city area. Yeah. Yes. Yes.

1618
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:24,120
The cartoons you have were the DC Superhero Girls, ThunderCats.

1619
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,200
Those are great rides. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1620
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:31,320
They agreed. They especially like thunder.

1621
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:35,480
I like any generation of thundercats would make a fantastic ride.

1622
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:37,720
Like you're in the fun, like in the thunder tank.

1623
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:41,600
I'll go like going through thunder, thunder, thunder.

1624
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,720
Yeah. Yeah.

1625
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:45,080
Multiple generations now of different thunder.

1626
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:46,680
ThunderCats cartoon.

1627
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:49,560
And we also been denied.

1628
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:53,920
You know, we got this version of Gremlins as early 90s Gremlins,

1629
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:58,920
but we've been denied weird time capsule rides from Warner Brothers as well.

1630
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:02,520
I mean, we have stuff that's Batman Forever influenced

1631
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,840
at the roller coasters at the various parks.

1632
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,160
But we should have a stuck in time

1633
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:11,240
Batman Forever Dark Ride that opened in 1996.

1634
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:12,080
Absolutely.

1635
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,120
Yeah, we've been deprived of that.

1636
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:18,240
That's something we were owed and we did not get and we never will get.

1637
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:19,760
But yeah, like those.

1638
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:23,800
Yeah, I want that like those weird curiosity attractions that are like,

1639
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,360
like, I don't know the kids know what like have any idea of what our world is.

1640
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:30,680
But it's that makes it all the more fascinating. Yes.

1641
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:35,200
Yeah, we need a kiss from a rose playing on a loop, annoying

1642
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:39,320
people working at the gift shop for decades upon decades. Yeah.

1643
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:42,800
Like, yeah, the like attendees like still in like

1644
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,760
like a now very faded like Riddler question marks band.

1645
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:49,600
Yes, this is this has been denied.

1646
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:50,600
We've been denied.

1647
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:53,040
We're we've we really missed out.

1648
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,240
And it's upsetting to me to think about all we could have had

1649
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:01,560
a roller coaster based on the George Clooney vehicle, the American.

1650
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:05,880
Yes. I'm just looking at my HBO Max Q now.

1651
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:10,920
HBO Max, surprisingly deep library, surprisingly good.

1652
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:12,520
Yeah, yeah, there's good.

1653
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:16,840
Very good. Can't use it on my TV yet because I got a Roku, but pretty good.

1654
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:19,480
Good on the laptop. You know, what are you going to do?

1655
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:21,080
I've been going through all the Miyazaki movie.

1656
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:23,920
Oh, yeah. I don't know what they actually have the rights to.

1657
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:29,360
But oh, my gosh, like, and they like riding the cat riding the the cat bus.

1658
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:30,520
Oh, my God.

1659
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:33,160
Chiki, all good. All perfect rides.

1660
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:34,160
That's incredible.

1661
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:36,080
Aren't they opening up a world?

1662
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:39,480
They are. They're opening in Japan, in Japan, a Ghibli park.

1663
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:40,560
I did not know that.

1664
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,840
That's amazing. I don't know if it's full like rides,

1665
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:45,560
but I think it's a very themed immersive world.

1666
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:48,400
Well, but I thought you had much of the status on that.

1667
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,840
And, you know, you've got to have

1668
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:55,240
if not an attraction, then at least a walk around Bazinga.

1669
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,760
Oh, oh, well, yeah, that's his name, right?

1670
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:00,480
His name was Bazinga.

1671
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,040
He is Bazinga.

1672
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:03,840
Oh, look, Bazinga.

1673
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,160
Mommy, it's Bazinga.

1674
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:11,320
A whole land starring Bazinga based on the location of the show Pasadena.

1675
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,320
Young Bazinga.

1676
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:18,280
It's all your favorites. Yeah.

1677
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:20,840
And then it started then when it's Halloween,

1678
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:23,040
it's like Bazinga dresses up like the Flash.

1679
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:25,560
Of course, of course, of course.

1680
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:28,240
And then the Flash dresses up like Bazinga.

1681
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:31,040
Yeah. Oh, that's nice little time.

1682
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,480
Very fun. Masks on top of all of them.

1683
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:38,120
Well, so to close out, unless we have other.

1684
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:41,720
I was going to say the ride ends with like Alf electrocuting all the gremlins.

1685
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,160
Yes. Yeah, he saves the day.

1686
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:46,640
It's the solution from gremlins to the new batch.

1687
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:52,120
And great sequence of all the so many gremlins with firehoses

1688
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:55,600
shooting them over the ride vehicles. That's really cool.

1689
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,600
Again, the video isn't great.

1690
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,960
I wish I could see this in full fidelity or, of course, in person.

1691
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,840
But that seems like a legit amazing scene. Yeah.

1692
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:07,880
Well, and it's missing because at the very end, you pull up next to a big red car

1693
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:09,200
that Alf is driving.

1694
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:12,960
And in pictures, I found Gizmo is standing on the hood, which, of course,

1695
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:14,360
that's what you want to see.

1696
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:18,760
But the video, it looks like Gizmo has been removed or was like not put in yet.

1697
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:21,760
They finally got him. They killed him in the right.

1698
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,320
That's see. That was the implication.

1699
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,480
I was like, did Gizmo live?

1700
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:27,560
Where is he?

1701
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:29,160
They're good. They're good.

1702
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:31,360
It was that it had multiple endings.

1703
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:34,640
You can see the good ending where Gizmo lives and the bad ending where Gizmo dies.

1704
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:36,560
Oh, no. Like Radiator Springs.

1705
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:40,720
Yeah. Australia Beetlejuice in a police car.

1706
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:42,360
Mm hmm. Yes.

1707
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:44,240
Alf is in a fire truck.

1708
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,680
Fire truck. Is that what it is?

1709
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:47,760
It's not just a red car. It's a fire truck.

1710
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,560
Yeah. I thought it was just like Archie's jalopy.

1711
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,000
I thought it was a big red jalopy.

1712
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,040
It's not look.

1713
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:56,000
You know what a fire truck looks like in your mind, but it's

1714
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:01,080
Alf has got like a sleeker version of that that he drives around here.

1715
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:04,400
So, yeah, I mean, that's great.

1716
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,800
I would have loved if the ride was like 10 minutes long

1717
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:10,040
and you really got a bunch of different Alf Gizmo things

1718
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:13,240
and they were trying to fix whatever is going wrong.

1719
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,400
They were following you through the ride.

1720
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:19,440
You should have seen what that when those two put their heads together,

1721
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:24,280
what happens, it's mainly that they are standing next to each other, which

1722
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:26,640
for me, as I said, is plenty.

1723
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:29,640
That that visual is my favorite thing about this attraction.

1724
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,840
But yeah, I don't know.

1725
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:36,240
You want to see Gizmo dance or do his Rambo business?

1726
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:41,240
I wouldn't I wouldn't have my like, you know, I feel like Gizmo is in both movies

1727
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:43,520
is given a little bit of a hero's moment at the end.

1728
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:47,560
You know, whether it's the Rambo moment from Gremlins 2

1729
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:50,800
or him driving that little pink convertible from Gremlins 1.

1730
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,000
I wouldn't mind if like a little more of a maybe we got it.

1731
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
It was just lost in translation the video, but I would not have minded a like

1732
01:37:57,160 --> 01:38:01,560
little Gremlins, a little, you know, Gizmo hero moment.

1733
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:02,920
Yes, for sure.

1734
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:05,400
That feels like a real missed opportunity.

1735
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:07,160
Be up other Gremlins.

1736
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:09,520
I mean, I guess he's kind of like is a little afraid of him.

1737
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,160
He keeps his distance.

1738
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:14,880
But, you know, like Shondu in Sinbad ride in Disney

1739
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:19,240
see if he's like bopping one of them on the head or, you know, is blind,

1740
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:20,880
blinding them or bonking them.

1741
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,400
I don't know. Something fun.

1742
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,800
Bonking or blinding either way.

1743
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,080
Good with all of that easily.

1744
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:30,200
One of the cutest, at least cutest IP animatronics that the.

1745
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:31,840
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1746
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,400
Yeah. They pull it off really well.

1747
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,400
It does. It does look good.

1748
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:39,880
You know, well, since we're talking about, you know, the the Gremlins

1749
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:43,160
and theme parks, I kind of have made this connection my head

1750
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,400
and I keep thinking about it.

1751
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:47,760
And I'm sure I'm not the first person to say this, but

1752
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:52,280
are the minions just Gremlins, but they're all cute like Gizmo?

1753
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:55,600
Hmm. Interesting.

1754
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:59,040
Because the minions kind of do Gremlin stuff, I guess they're less

1755
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,560
and they're a little insidious.

1756
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:05,040
But like, yeah, do we like do people like the minions?

1757
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,720
Because for the same reason, they like the Gremlins.

1758
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:09,880
They might have I see.

1759
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:13,280
I see, you know, they sharing some of the same like energy.

1760
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:17,200
But I would say the big difference is I feel like the minions are like

1761
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:20,640
very like needy and like like codependent.

1762
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:26,360
And like Gremlins are just like, you know, they are like agents of chaos

1763
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:30,680
who are, you know, bound by like bound to like no no person

1764
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:31,880
or even like each other.

1765
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:35,080
They don't even like the great like a one Gremlin will throw acid

1766
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:39,360
in another Gremlin's face like they don't even they barely even care about each other.

1767
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:42,640
Yeah, they're a leaderless collective that can instantly

1768
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:45,160
devolve into antagonists.

1769
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:46,760
Yes, yes.

1770
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:47,760
But there are unless I guess.

1771
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:48,800
Sorry, John, go ahead.

1772
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,560
Oh, unless you have like brain Gremlin to kind of kind of like straddles

1773
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:56,120
both worlds of like, you know, he can be a leader, but also knows

1774
01:39:56,120 --> 01:40:00,320
like how to like, you know, tap into that Gremlin vibe.

1775
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:03,120
Yeah, there's no Tony Randall minion.

1776
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:05,280
And that's the biggest difference.

1777
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:09,280
So it's really hurt the franchise over the years.

1778
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,400
They really should. They try.

1779
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:14,840
They should. I was going to compile Tony's voice from Odd Couple

1780
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:17,400
and then add it into one of the movies. Yeah, sure.

1781
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:20,600
They tried it in Despicable Me 3.

1782
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:24,680
They tried to like have a leader like Minion, but I'm I we all

1783
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,920
I can't remember that minions name, so it didn't really work out great. Right.

1784
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:30,760
I was thinking last week because we talked about a

1785
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:34,240
potato mascot for a while named Mr.

1786
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:37,280
Tato, and I was thinking he kind of looked like a king minion.

1787
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:39,160
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1788
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:40,320
He's kind of a guy.

1789
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,520
Taller. Yeah, the taller taller minion.

1790
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,560
Yeah, they should have put him in the movie.

1791
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:47,440
Well, yeah, I don't know.

1792
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:49,080
Anything we miss closing thoughts?

1793
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:52,320
We obviously wish there could be some other Gremlins attraction,

1794
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:57,720
but we're damned by the corporate malfeasance that stops it from happening.

1795
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:00,040
But we I don't know.

1796
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:02,440
I mean, I think this is this is so much fun.

1797
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:03,520
I'm so glad it exists.

1798
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,200
And I think it does. Yeah.

1799
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:06,920
For a lot of the spirit.

1800
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:08,920
Yeah, I agree. Absolutely.

1801
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:10,960
I think, yeah, we wish there would be another.

1802
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,480
I mean, maybe the full Gremlins resurgence,

1803
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:17,520
maybe they'll license it out to some some park again.

1804
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:20,400
So we'll see. Maybe.

1805
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:23,880
Who knows if the cartoons have hit and then there's another movie, maybe.

1806
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:26,640
Yeah. Fingers crossed.

1807
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:28,720
Or, you know,

1808
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:31,600
do we give this over?

1809
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:36,240
Is it just like I mean, Gremlins could be taking over the Harry Potter.

1810
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,720
Could be taking over Hogwarts.

1811
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:41,040
Yeah, you could just be.

1812
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:45,400
Maybe there's some version like that where you could be watching video of J.K.

1813
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:50,080
Rowling and then the Gremlin Saul pounce on her.

1814
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:54,840
And because, yeah, if we know any like Gremlins are like,

1815
01:41:54,840 --> 01:42:00,520
and Gremlins are very gender fluid, like if they even have a like,

1816
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:03,560
which is even assume they have a gender to begin with.

1817
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:07,280
So, yeah, I think, yeah, they would definitely, you know, yeah,

1818
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:09,600
they attack target number one.

1819
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,960
Sir, is an enemy.

1820
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:13,080
Yeah, they definitely are.

1821
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:15,560
She is. J.K. Rowling, I'm going to say, is as a Gremlins expert,

1822
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:18,840
I can say J.K. Rowling is definitely an enemy of the Gremlins.

1823
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:22,440
Like specifically, like every human is to some extent,

1824
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:26,880
unlike special ones, but like they would like target her specifically.

1825
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,040
Yeah, I think so.

1826
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:30,200
Amen. The official ruling.

1827
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:34,640
I agree. And on that note, Joan Ford, you survived podcast, The Ride, The Second Gate.

01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:39,840
Thank you so much for having me.

1830
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,840
So far, let's exit through the gift shop.

1831
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:44,600

1832
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:47,800
Oh, sure. You can just follow me on Twitch at

1834
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:55,760
And that's all my handles, Joan Haley Ford on Instagram and Twitter.

1835
01:42:56,680 --> 01:43:00,720
And you can see my stuff on Cartoon Network every now and then,

1836
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:04,720
whether it's on Thundercats or DC Superhero Girls

1837
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:08,400
and a show called Yabba Dabba Dinosaur is coming to HBO Max.

1838
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:09,400
So look out for all that.

1839
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:13,640
There you go. Great HBO Max family, just like just like Gremlins and Gremlins too.

1840
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:16,840
Talk also on one episode of a Quibi show.

1841
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:19,000
So get Quibi just for that. Oh, yes.

1842
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,160
Hell, yeah. Do the free trial and then undo it.

1843
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:26,800
If Quibi comes out with a big, cool e-ticket theme park before HBO Max

1844
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:29,040
and Warner Brothers, I'm going to be very upset.

1845
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:31,040
Me too. Yeah, it's possible.

1846
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:33,880
About Quibi. I'm in this dangerous game.

1847
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:37,000
I take it back. I'd be I'd be I'd be thrilled if they did it.

1848
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,080
I'd be so excited.

1849
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:41,680
Oh, no, they spent 10 billion on that.

1850
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:44,440
Yeah. Coronavirus took so much from us,

1851
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:47,880
including whatever Quibi had planned for Comic Con.

1852
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:52,240
Oh, no. Activations. Activations.

1853
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:57,600
Taking it. You get your picture taken with with Anna Kendrick's dummy.

1854
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:59,640
The dummy. Yeah.

1855
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:02,040
They wanted it.

1856
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:06,760
So, hey, wait, as for us.

1857
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:09,480
Oh, we got to get the passport stamped, clunk.

1858
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:14,880
And unless you guys see it differently than I do, I think.

1859
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:17,280
No, you know, I think it's exactly how you see it.

1860
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:19,240
I think, you know what it is.

1861
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:21,760
I think that it is

1862
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:26,240
Alf clearly ready to have the song of the summer

1863
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:28,760
because he's got Cardi B's whap hair.

1864
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:31,760
Oh, yeah. I think that's right.

1865
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,120
That's exactly what I see.

1866
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:38,920
That's a that's a wonderful official stamp for the nation of Germany to put out.

1867
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:44,040
And we're heading to our last destination, which may not be far.

1868
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,520
There's the there's the hint there.

1869
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:50,200
So one more of these little things to go and podcast the rides.

1870
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:54,120
European vacation that'll be on the main feed in a couple of days.

1871
01:44:54,960 --> 01:45:00,280
So go check that out and follow our progress and whatever on Twitter,

1872
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,720
on Facebook and on Instagram.

1873
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:06,240
Closing words, fellas.

1874
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:07,240
Hum.

1875
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:10,920
Just more elf, I guess.

1876
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,840
And more gremlins, but more. Yeah.

1877
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:14,120
More elf.

1878
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:17,360
Be like Germany theme park world and give us more elf.

1879
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:20,440
Make the whole world a project elf. All right.

1880
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:23,280
It's very interesting to talk to you in a couple of days.
