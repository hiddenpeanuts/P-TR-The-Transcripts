1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
May the road rise to meet you, may the wind be at your back.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Here on Podcast the Rides European Vacation.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm Jason Chariton, here as always with Michael Carlson.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh, hello there, right?

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Faith and Bogor, yes, that's correct.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay, great. I'm here.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And Scott Caradner, of course.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh, I have to say, uh, uh, one love, one life, uh, elevation tour now.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's, Bono counts as Irish, right?

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Sure. Like they say at Ben against Slantja.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Uh...

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Are you gonna do the voice the whole episode?

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not gonna do the voice the whole episode.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm already well past the end point of the voice.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You know what I should have said?

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I should have been like, oh, my name is Chief O'Hara.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Because that's all I know about that, is that he was the, uh, side, what was he?

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He was the cop in Gotham on the 60s Batman show.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
On 60s Batman, yeah.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He was always in full dress blues.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's right. And he and Commissioner Gordon were incompetent.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
They couldn't get anything done.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And they were just at the mercy of Batman.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Uh...

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The only Irish representation in film or TV you were aware of for some time.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Up until right now, I think.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Until today, until the place we're going in, and the character, which I imagine will be a lot of the source of the episode.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Look, I'll be honest. It's crazy that the theme park exists.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Uh, that's fine.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't almost give a shit now that I've found this certain character that we're all gonna talk about today.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm completely with you, yes.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But before that character, our guest character for today.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Uh, Jason, you wanna do the accent?

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah, Jason. Do the voice. Do the accent.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah, yeah.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You gotta give everyone.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, she's a bonny lass, all right.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's Marissa Strickland, one of our first guests, finally returning home to podcast the ride.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hoi hoi hoi hoi hoi!

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And there it is, the national motto of the country.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's hoi hoi hoi.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hoi hoi hoi.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Of my ancestral homeland.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hi, guys.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm thrilled to be here. This is a true delight.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah, thanks for doing this.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Thanks for being interested in this park and this certain character that we're about to get to.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Ah, delightful.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Jason, do you have a whole plan here or should we just, should we say it?

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Do we reveal what we're doing and why, if there's a why?

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, I think the only thing, cause Marissa, I asked you to be on this episode,

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
cause when Scott, you told us about this park, I was like, we should have Marissa on for this one.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And you guys said, oh, has she been there?

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And I went, no, this character just has the most Marissa energy I have ever encountered.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Well, it's a European spokes character, which I believe Marissa introduced me to another character many years ago who I was unaware of, Mafalda.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, yeah.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh, Mafalda is my childhood.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Right. If you wanted to speak a little bit about Mafalda before we get to our topic.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, she's a Spanish language little girl who's kind of a, you know, the world isn't treating her so well.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
She's kind of a Cathy.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But I think she's in fact like Argentine or something.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But, you know, she's known throughout the Spanish world.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And she, you know, she's just kind of like a hrump.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You know, things aren't going well for her.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And that's that's what I read during my childhood.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And she was your favorite character in fiction.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I really liked her. Yeah, she was great.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I also I also was fond of a fairy tale called The Little Lame Prince.

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It was a prince that couldn't walk.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
My parents made me weird.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Well, sure. You lived in Europe for a little while, right?

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I did. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I lived in Spain for almost two years at two different times during my childhood.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
OK. Yeah. And then in college, you were in Prague.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Right. Right nearby. I was in Hungary.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So just south. Yeah. In Budapest.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And did you ever encounter the character we're talking?

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I know that you weren't in the specific spots, but no, I haven't encountered this character.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I think this character is very delightful.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I would say previous iterations of this character are cuter to me than the current iteration.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:15,000
OK, that's fair. You guys can you know, I you know, let's just say his name, you know, we all want to say it together.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We all want to say, yeah, sure. That sounds nice. All right. All right.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Three, two, one. Mr. Tato.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We're so excited to talk about Mr. Tato.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And I guess incidentally, Tato Park, the theme park that bears his name and the name of the the chip brand that he endorses, rather crisp brand.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is a theme park built around the factory of an Irish potato crisp brand.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And I think, you know, I think we were aware of it. I think we knew about it.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I think it was on my little short list, but I wrote down almost nothing about it.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And then we did throw it out to the audience.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hey, where should we go if we do this European thing?

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And this is the most biggest audience influence, I think, on this series.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And I want to give credit to to Sean P. O'Brien, perhaps Irish himself, or at least sounds as such, who said we should go to Tato Park in Ireland for everybody's favorite theme park based on a cheese and onion potato crisp.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And there was a photo of Mr. Tato with it.

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And I just, boy, I started staring and I just had a feeling.

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Sometimes you just have a nice feeling in your heart.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And I sent it to you guys and we all agreed.

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And parks were bumped apart.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Parks were bumped because of this.

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah.

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Thrown into the end of the shitter, you know, the dustbin of history.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It seems odd at first.

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But then you remember we have Hershey Park in America, which has anthropomorphic candy bars running around and they have giant weird googly eyes and they have Santa hats on and they have like ascots at Halloween.

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Like, this isn't as strange as it first appears.

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So I think it's in the family of stuff already that with the curiosities that we all have in common.

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Sorry, really quick.

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
They have ascots at Halloween.

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Well, they have costumes at Halloween.

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And in my mind, they have kind of like one of the maybe the Hershey bar itself has like out of a Dracula type kind of ascot and cape situation going on.

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't quote me on that.

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I know the listeners are going to be very upset if there is not a photo of Hershey bar wearing an ascot.

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But if there's not, if somebody wouldn't mind mocking one up on Photoshop, I'd appreciate it.

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah.

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't forget to a lot of Bush Gardens have a brewery next to them, or at least the one in Virginia where they brew beer because it's Bush.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So like they brew beer.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Right. So when my family when I was like in middle school and we went to Bush Gardens in Virginia, we took a tour of the brewery and then my parents got free beer at the end of it.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And the monorail that took us there broke down for a while.

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So we were just sitting in the cafeteria waiting and it's it's stunk.

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This this place is factory tour scenes much more pleasant.

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Right. Flavored crisps of the Tato Company, which include cheese and onion, salt and vinegar, smoky bacon, prawn cocktail and the limited edition Tex-Mex.

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Why do we what do we think of these?

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't think we've gotten to try this particular brand.

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I don't know if it's available in America.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm not sure I like the sound of prawn cocktail, but I could be wrong.

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't mean that's. Yeah.

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What was the name? No, I just don't think it's like to me, prawn cocktail sounds like a flavor that exists in other parts of the world and would be scrumptious.

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But maybe isn't for American tastes.

132
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But I don't know. It's possible stuff for American taste.

133
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Prawn itself sounds so unappetizing.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Prawn, I don't it's prawn sounds like it's like alive when you eat it and it's going to latch onto your tongue while you're trying to chew it.

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Like, that's what I think of when I think of prawn.

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But I'm willing to try it. I'm willing to do.

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I think we maybe there was a version of this podcast where we like spent a lot of money and had it imported and we would have all tried it.

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And also there's a version where I ordered a thing I just found existed today.

139
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Mr. Tato's autobiography.

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh, that exists.

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We got to postpone. Can we postpone?

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We should postpone.

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But I think we'll just do it.

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And then maybe there'll be an addendum later once I finally figured out.

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I was so desperate to find an ebook of Mr. Tato's autobiography.

146
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I put my credit card in a website that I'm very sure is fraudulent.

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Like I was like I was like, oh, my God, I found this.

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's an hour to go before the pockets. I need to read some of this at least.

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, this site seems to have an ebook of it.

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Credit card, credit card error message.

151
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Then I like Google what the website was.

152
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And it's like, oh, yeah, this is a scam.

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I am for sure getting my identity stolen because of Mr. Tato and my quest for information about him.

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And it was like four thousand dollars to the IRS.

155
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The IRA keeps a few irons in the fire just in case this shit hits the fan in Belfast again, you know, just to get a little, you know, slush fund.

156
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And part of that is stealing credit cards from Tato book purveyors, browsers.

157
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Well, look, if it helps them, I don't mind if they want to take a couple grand from my credit card account.

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I can tell you this. Mr. Tato ran for office in 2014.

159
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh, I know all. Yes, I know all about it.

160
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You know all about that. I found one seemingly one guy's blog where he was very mad that they, I guess, polls.

161
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Some polls are for political advertising in Ireland and they thought it was very uncouth that they put the like Tato for office posters on them.

162
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's describe before there's a couple of other things I like to talk about, obviously.

163
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But let's describe Mr. Tato before we get rolling here.

164
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Marissa, do you have a description? You always very good with descriptors.

165
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Um, OK.

166
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Well, I see yellow.

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He's yellow. I think he looks a little lumpy.

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You know, there's some lumps and bumps.

169
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He's a potato. He's got a darling little hat like a short little black straw hat is what I'm imagining.

170
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But it could be made of felt or something.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It might be silk. It's possible.

172
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes, it's a little like a Heisenberg hat.

173
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It is.

174
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Thank you, Scottish.

175
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's a pork pie. Yes.

176
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And he so which maybe his real name isn't Mr. Tato.

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Maybe he adopted that his real names just like Mcduff or something.

178
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And he adopted this whole persona.

179
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Very possible.

180
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah, he seems to like a bold red and white colors.

181
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah, simple kind of a simple basic.

182
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You call him basic, I think, in his color choices.

183
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, I like it. It feels like fast food.

184
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm enjoying it.

185
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I will say the current Tato seems a little too much CGI for me.

186
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I would prefer a more 2D kind of older animation looking guy.

187
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And we've talked about this before on the show, especially in regards to the Keebler elves.

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You know, Ernie Keebler now is CGI and he looks like he's had a lot of work done.

189
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And it's not the Ernie Keebler we grew up with.

190
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You know, I mean, yeah, they say nothing is constant but change.

191
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So I guess we have to live with it.

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I mean, we're already going through hell with this whole Mr.

193
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Peanut Baby Nut Nut Jr.

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
debacle.

195
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Like it's a bad, bad vibe.

196
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I can't keep track of it.

197
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah.

198
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What is the difference between Baby Nut and Nut Jr.?

199
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh, Baby Nut is aging up now.

200
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Baby Nut stuck around for a few months, was not well received.

201
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And now I believe he's as of a few days ago, he's Nut Jr.

202
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He's 21.

203
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What?

204
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It seems like they're trying to quickly speed him up to get him back to Mr.

205
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Peanut.

206
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Okay.

207
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Can we delay the episode so I can do more research on Nut Jr.?

208
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Because I do really want to know about him.

209
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We're not ready at all.

210
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
We're going to have to put this back in the can.

211
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is going to come out in three years.

212
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah, this is going to be a whole project.

213
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So, yeah, so I think we all.

214
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You know what's related to this maybe or what might help us here?

215
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
First of all, I should say to the audience, it's probably in our show art, I'm sure that it is.

216
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:59,000
But if you haven't already seen Mr. Tato, I think it's important that you Google him, you know, just so you know what we're talking about for the next, you know, for the 90% of the episode.

217
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So you should be looking at him.

218
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Maybe just like listen to the don't like drive or work out or something while you're listening to this particular episode.

219
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Just like find a photo and stare straight into his eyes.

220
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Just like really give him your attention as I'm doing as we record it.

221
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But maybe a sub link within that is I'll share my screen with you guys.

222
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I found him on a great wiki, which I should we should all pursue more that the ad mascot wiki and they kind of break down the different eras.

223
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And maybe we could all like an out loud Twitter thing.

224
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
We could all tag ourselves in what is our preferred Mr. Tato.

225
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And I'm most curious about Marissa's opinions here.

226
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So we have a couple.

227
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
We have the current, which is very CGI.

228
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
We go back to the 2000s, the 90s and all the way back to the 1960s.

229
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Do we do we what do we think is peak Tato?

230
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I mean, all the 60s Tato is very much like he was a member of the Avengers, the British secret agent group.

231
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
He's got like kind of that like he's like kind of posing on a little umbrella.

232
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Same color palette as now, but it's more of a bowler hat.

233
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's more of like a classic.

234
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah, the hat got smaller.

235
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I think that 60s Tato looks like the ink hat, like the pen had a little bit too much ink in it when they drew it.

236
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
The black lines are too bold, a little thick.

237
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Too bold. Sorry.

238
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Sorry.

239
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
We're all entitled to our opinion.

240
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I think that, yeah, the 90s and the 2000s Tato very similar.

241
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
They're very close together.

242
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Like they except for the color of the hat, essentially, they appear to be the same.

243
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
One is yellow.

244
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
In one, the hat is yellow, the same yellow of his skin.

245
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Right.

246
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And then, yeah, that other Tato, they're all kind of similar.

247
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I think it's really kind of there's really only three versions as far as what we're looking at here that are very different.

248
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
There's not a lot of I was mainly just curious if 60s did it for anybody and it does not.

249
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
No, he does it for me.

250
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Mr. Tato from the 60s for sure does it for me.

251
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
He can get it.

252
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

253
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I do not like that Tato.

254
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Do you like the new Tato better?

255
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,000
My favorite Tato just looking at these is Mr. Tato as he appeared in the 2000s because his hands are jaunty.

256
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That gives me a lot.

257
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That suggests.

258
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I was going to ask if you felt like he something was suspicious was going on with him in the 60s, but because the hidden hand is a tad unnerving.

259
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I mean, what's back there?

260
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's symbolic.

261
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's a gun.

262
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah.

263
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
No, Mr. Tato is holding a gun behind him in this picture.

264
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Oh, no, he's MI6.

265
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes, that's right.

266
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Mr. Tato is MI6 in the 60s.

267
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And I look I like that.

268
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You know, it's a fun romanticized version of spying and you know, the classic James Bond.

269
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I don't know.

270
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't know what he was doing in the 60s.

271
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Maybe it doesn't hold up.

272
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Maybe it's problematic now, but I can enjoy the romanticized version of a gentleman spy.

273
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's also a potato from the 1960s.

274
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
He was in the I was going to say he's in it's a 60s.

275
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
He's a gentleman spy in Ireland.

276
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What he was doing was not good.

277
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yet.

278
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yes, Jason, I said I made a qualification that I'm romanticizing the idea that if the reality of it is, yes, of course he's killed.

279
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
He's overthrown governments, but we want to we want the fun.

280
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
We want the short.

281
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Sure.

282
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Kiss, kiss, bang, bang.

283
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
That's what we want.

284
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The 90s, 90s and 2000s adds the striped pants.

285
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And I think the striped pants, that's that's a pretty good upgrade.

286
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Right.

287
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Yeah, I like them.

288
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah.

289
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So, yeah, I'm saying 60s.

290
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What do you so you, Marissa, you and Jason both 2000s?

291
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I don't know.

292
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The thing is, is like this feels very not me to like something not from the 60s.

293
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I find that very hard to believe that this is my choice right now.

294
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But I think 2000s Tato is for me.

295
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Wow.

296
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That is shocking because if I know anything about you is that your brain, I do think forces you to like something that's 50 years old.

297
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yeah.

298
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
There's something about it that just like that feels more authentic.

299
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yeah, it feels it feels like where I come from.

300
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Sure.

301
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I wonder if there's a 70s that splits the difference.

302
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I wonder, is there I don't want to say that ad mascots dot fandom dot com isn't doing its job.

303
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I just wonder if there's this whole era is I think where we might be missing here.

304
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yeah, there was more of it like a disco, a disco Tato.

305
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
90s Tato.

306
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I like you know what I like about 90s Tato.

307
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
He's holding the bag.

308
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
He's holding a bag of crisps as if to say, look, here's my work.

309
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm proud of it.

310
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah, I have a question.

311
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I have a question.

312
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
There's a big leap from umbrella to crisp bag.

313
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Was Mr. Tato an umbrella mascot in the 60s?

314
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Was he selling Mr. Tato umbrellas?

315
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The potato based umbrella.

316
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
He was just a poorly drawn person.

317
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
He was never intended to be a potato originally.

318
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Somebody drew far too big of a head.

319
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That's what people look like, right?

320
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
They hadn't invented skin tones for crayons yet in the 60s.

321
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So it was just that was the color they would they would paint skin.

322
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yeah, there is no spectrum.

323
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yes, it was the closest to what human skin is like.

324
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah.

325
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So, yes, I can see I can see how you would see this character and like base a theme park around it.

326
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm not 100 percent on this because I came across in a couple of places.

327
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But supposedly the Tato was they were the ones who figured out how to season crisps like seasoned chips.

328
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But then I saw somewhere else saying there is a second Tato company in Ireland.

329
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yes.

330
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But I think it is this one.

331
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I think it's Joe Murphy, the founder.

332
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You know, when he was in charge of it, they figured out how to get seasoning on it.

333
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And it was an immediate hit.

334
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And all the American chip people came over and licensed the technology so they could start selling seasoned chips.

335
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Is this Jason, is this one of your heroes, this man for developing this seasoning?

336
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Hero and also like the scourge of my child, the scourge of just putting on weight in my childhood,

337
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:14,000
because I would just immediately come home from school, put my backpack down and just fill a bowl of potato chips and get to watching Power Rangers, Batman, whatever.

338
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That was going to be my next question. Were you a potato chip kid? And the answer was yes.

339
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yes, I may have loved them more than some extended family members.

340
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What? What? I was I was a lunch chip kid, but I wasn't I would eat them at home, but I wasn't eating them.

341
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I wasn't into them as much as sweets, but I definitely would have a laser, a Cheetos in my lunch.

342
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:46,000
We've talked about this before. It was you had you couldn't not have lunch without eating some empty calories with salt.

343
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Yeah, it was part of it. Sure. And that was the problem, Michael, because I had lunch chips and then I had afternoon chips.

344
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Were they different chips with the lunch chips different from the afternoon chips?

345
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You know, we always had at least three or four flavors in the pantry. So lay, lay, very possibly.

346
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Lays hurts. Pennsylvania is sort of the potato basket of the country where you can get lays, hers, but wise like it.

347
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And a lot of them have factories in Pennsylvania. So we had a bounty of chip options.

348
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
They were delivered to your door like a milkman.

349
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You got to have a fresh, got to have a fresh in the glass chip bottle by like a man that kind of looked like a potato.

350
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
He resembled a potato. Marissa chips in your house growing up.

351
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Honestly, I had the worst house for snacks. I think my parents were influenced by some type of healthy foods, 1970s movement, but then like didn't go all the way to like actually do it.

352
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So like I would have just like rice in the cupboards. You know what I mean?

353
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I think it was I was not a snack house. I feel like I ate a lot of quesadillas though.

354
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I would like just microwave quesadillas, not like a nicely grilled one.

355
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So you would come home and watch TV and just eat a bowl of rice?

356
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:27,000
No, no, that was just to illustrate that like the pantry in my house was like to me deeply depressing because it was all things that in three steps could become something good, but weren't anywhere close to being something good right now.

357
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So it was not easily accessible snack. Like the snacks weren't readily available. You would have had to put a pot of boiling water on to mix something.

358
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yeah. And what 10 year old is going to do that?

359
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You had like you had all the ingredients to make chips, but you didn't have chips.

360
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Honestly, they're in my kitchen growing up. There was like a mortal and mortar and pestle or whatever those, you know, I could grind something down.

361
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Can we have chips, mom? And it's like, well, if you make them, if you create them yourself.

362
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Well, get the mortar and pestle out.

363
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Mortar and pestle, you know, the thing you use to make chips.

364
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Mortar and pestle snacks and then like books about what was her name? Morvola?

365
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Morvola.

366
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Mofalda.

367
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Mofalda.

368
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Mofalda brand chips. And then it's just like a bag of flour and salt and with like a 20 item list of instructions.

369
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Marissa, from what I know, your family was like really pushing back.

370
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Like I think Jason Scott and I all had a very American of its era upbringing with the exact snacks that were popular with a lot of the same like TV shows.

371
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And I feel like I envy you.

372
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Complete opposite from what I understand.

373
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

374
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Well, I think the hard part about being an only child is you don't know how weird your life is until you encounter other people and they tell you how cool their life is.

375
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So like you would have met like a Jason type and he's like, yeah, I go home every day.

376
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I eat a bag of Lay's and I watch the Power Rangers and you were like, oh my God.

377
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah, I would like heaven. Yeah, I would have been amazed.

378
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Do I have to have another kid? I think you just made me think that was the best argument I've heard so far.

379
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Well, I could I could expand out that argument and say any family is unusual until you you know what I mean? You realize that when you encounter other families.

380
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So Scott, Scott, you want you want both of your kids then to be able to be like, Dad is so into this theme park stuff.

381
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And he's like, he's obsessed with like Steve Lukather demos.

382
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
All he talks about is this one guitar player.

383
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I know what he played. I know he played the solo on physical ever this every day.

384
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And didn't you think like every dad knew that and cares about that? Yeah, I thought that.

385
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But apparently that's rare. Oh, God.

386
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
These little bastards are going to conspire against me. Yeah.

387
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You know what? Only one. I think only one is the correct way to do it.

388
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yeah, I'm keeping him solo. I'm going to Brigsby Bear this kid and he's just going to have his own little universe and I hope he never breaks out of it.

389
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I think that's a good idea. So, yeah, I said as far as us chips, we'd have the lays and whatever.

390
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And we had bugles. There's a lot of that in the house.

391
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But, you know, it was and I wasn't crazy for chips.

392
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Scott, were you crazy for chips real quick before we continue?

393
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yeah, I remember I specifically remember going to the pediatrician's office and getting a pretty bad cholesterol test.

394
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
But from the era where I was eating so many Ruffles and what's what is it?

395
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Ruffles cheddar and sour cream. Oh, yeah.

396
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Because then I looked up and they have MSG and I devoured Ruffles cheddar and sour cream.

397
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
How old were you?

398
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I remember it. So old enough to 10 or 11.

399
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Yeah, yeah. And it's the same office where I go with with my my new son now.

400
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And I every time I walk in, I'm like that that Ruffles diagnosis.

401
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I think about it every time. Did they diagnose you with Ruffles?

402
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
They can tell immediately like what what's rising the cholesterol.

403
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's the Ruffles. Yeah. Look at his stomach. I noticed like what's this bendy shape?

404
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I see ridges in there. Yeah.

405
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Wow. Well, we all have made it ridged the lining of my stomach.

406
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,000
That's how much I was eating that those might have been the most addictive chip because I eat those for a lot in a short amount of time.

407
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And then they make me I cannot eat them now.

408
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
The sight of them makes me I don't know.

409
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I don't also like sour cream and how often do you encounter I guess on nachos or baked potatoes?

410
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But it's just like, hmm, what a delicious combo.

411
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Dairy and dairy. I know I'm not a sour cream eater at all now.

412
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I and you know, I think now I can't be like a little kid in my my chip taste.

413
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I'm an adult. I have to step it up.

414
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:29,000
We all do, which is why I think we need to address the more adult elevated version of Tato crisps, which is, of course, occasions.

415
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Stumble upon occasions. Yes, I saw occasions.

416
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
The classier chip. It's much it's so much classier.

417
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It is for occasions. It was a bad time for occasions.

418
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
None of us are having occasions of any kind right now.

419
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Can you describe them? Yeah, because I didn't I didn't look at them.

420
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I should bring I don't have photos in front of me.

421
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
If you Google it, it's it's like very you know, it's it's classy font.

422
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It's classy presentation.

423
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Mainly, I just copy and pasted the varieties, which are very mature, you know, like bistro Caribbean chutney.

424
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Oh, I didn't even notice the word mature occasions, mature cheddar cheese and red onion.

425
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
That's not not no little kid ruffles here.

426
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Party occasions, party mix for cheese and Mediterranean herbs.

427
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
These are some of the longest product names I've ever encountered.

428
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
But then and then it's all like presented a little hoity toity.

429
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
But then you get to tortilla original cool.

430
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
The end is cool. It's the last word.

431
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yes. Look at this serifed fonts.

432
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
This is class. You could hardly tell it's a Tato.

433
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
You know that Tato is so small in the corner.

434
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Yeah, they have Mr. Tato in there with a cartoon.

435
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
But yes, if you looked at the chip, you'd be like, well, this is a very sophisticated chip.

436
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
This is not for children after school.

437
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
This is for cocktail parties.

438
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
This is for this is for yacht yacht.

439
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
This is this is what they would eat on David Geffen's yacht.

440
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You know, this is not something that this must be a five fifty dollars a chip.

441
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
That must be how expensive this is.

442
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
That's right. And, you know, if you've ever been if you've been to as many Irish wakes as I have,

443
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
it's important to have some salty snacks around to soak up the Jameson, you know,

444
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
because the bars are open.

445
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
No, wait, so you are Irish, Jason, is Irish descent?

446
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Yeah, not not like a few generations back.

447
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Oh, this isn't going to turn into an Elizabeth Warren thing, is it?

448
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
No, no.

449
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,000
No, I the I the child of a Sheridan and a Murphy, I can assure you there's some Irish there.

450
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
OK, sounds like it.

451
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I am getting to the age of like where I you know, I I would like to travel more internationally.

452
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Of course, can't do that right now.

453
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
That's why we're doing this series.

454
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,000
But I always think about that American Express commercial where the guy uses his American Express card

455
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
to take his father back, take his family back to Ireland to buy uncomfortable sweaters

456
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
and stand on hills and look at old books and go like, yeah, that's where they were.

457
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:32,000
All right. I like that you would, Elizabeth Warren, that you'd you'd kind of like fudge some details

458
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
in order to seem like you're you have closer lineage to Mr. Tate.

459
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Who knows? Maybe we're related.

460
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
He's like a third cousin.

461
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I did a DNA test and turns out, yeah, I'm related to him.

462
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It's kind of a little farther away.

463
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It's not a direct first cousin or anything, but for sure.

464
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah, I'm definitely part potato.

465
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
There's this I found a couple of things about Tate before we actually get into the theme park.

466
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And I'm going to share a little bit of the story that I found.

467
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm going to get into the theme park and I'm going to share the screen here.

468
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Conan O'Brien.

469
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Did you see this clip, Scott?

470
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I did see this clip. Yes.

471
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
He went to visit the Tate.

472
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Oh, he went. I don't know.

473
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
He's in a store somewhere and he he found the actual pronunciation, I believe.

474
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
That's sort of what he's leaning into.

475
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And I found this fun for a second.

476
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
We are entering the Irish gift shop now here at the Irish American Heritage Center.

477
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
These are potatoes. Look at that.

478
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yeah. Potatoes.

479
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Just in case you mistakenly pronounce it potato, they correct you.

480
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Not a tato.

481
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Say a tato.

482
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Oh, a tato.

483
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
As we go down here, we have the dancing shoes here.

484
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
These are the shoes.

485
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
That's fun. That's a fun pronunciation.

486
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I do remember seeing this, but I didn't know he doesn't mention Mr. Tato, which is a big mistake.

487
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Obviously, the segment would have been much better.

488
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It perfectly lends itself to that super exaggerated pronunciation, to tato.

489
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And now, Mike, I'm now I'm looking at you clicking through other tabs and you have tabs of things that I have also.

490
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Okay.

491
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Please, I think, go ahead.

492
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I'm so excited for you to share.

493
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I love seeing these tabs here.

494
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Okay, good.

495
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I assumed you would probably have them.

496
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
But yeah, let's just get a couple of these more Mr. Tato stuff out of the way before we get to the rides.

497
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You know, this is a theme park podcast.

498
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
That's what we say, at least.

499
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Sometimes.

500
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So there was an ad campaign about Mr. Tato looking for love.

501
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And Marissa's face just lit up.

502
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I'm in.

503
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I'll fast forward some of this because basically, it's a couple very romantic.

504
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
They're looking into each other's eyes.

505
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And then they hug.

506
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Obviously, they're going to get married.

507
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
That's a plan.

508
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And then the camera pans over to Mr. Tato sitting alone at a table and he just exhales sadly.

509
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
No!

510
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And he's like a practical Mr. Tato.

511
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And it says Mr. Tato is looking for a Mrs. Tato.

512
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Is he still looking?

513
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Well, there was a whole...

514
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I do think he is still looking.

515
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Okay, because I mean, I like Tato of 20 years ago, so maybe there's still a little bit of that Tato left.

516
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Are you saying you could be Mrs. Tato?

517
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I'm not saying I could be. I'm saying I should be Mrs. Tato.

518
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
If only you knew 20 years ago, you could have gotten peak Tato.

519
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I know.

520
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:50,000
They had a whole promotion where the women would go on the radio and explain why they were a good match for Mr. Tato.

521
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Did you want to do that now? Did you want to make a case to him?

522
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah, I'll make a case. Hopefully Tato hasn't found love.

523
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Hopefully he's been sad.

524
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Hopefully he's been sitting at that table for 20 years with a really weird nose.

525
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
That nose, I didn't think it translated.

526
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It's a live action.

527
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I did not like the nose.

528
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Okay, so if I were to appeal to Mr. Tato to become Mrs. Tato, I would say...

529
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I think beauty is more than skin deep, and I can tell that you're beautiful.

530
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I want to explore flavors with you.

531
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And I want to be shielded by your umbrella.

532
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I want to be eaten your crisps.

533
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I want to throw crisps at each other in a satin filled bed, but tastefully dressed.

534
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You know, I could be Mrs. Tato.

535
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Wow.

536
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I'm wearing yellow currently, so I feel like that feels like Kismet.

537
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Could you resist taking a bite out of him?

538
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Only if he allowed me to.

539
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Great answer. Perfect answer.

540
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Well, look, he's obviously going to hear this, so hopefully we get a response.

541
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
That was glorious. That was so beautiful.

542
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And if you got with him, you could ask to borrow his hat too.

543
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
That'd be a little residual benefit.

544
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Now, I'm just wondering what's under that hat.

545
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
You know what I mean? Because you want to know who you're marrying,

546
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
and I'm wondering if it's like a pointy little head or like he's got a couple little sprouts up there,

547
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
like little eyeballs coming out. You know, what's going on on a potato's head?

548
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It's a ring.

549
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I'm engaged.

550
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's all happening.

551
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,000
It's wedged into uncooked potatoes, so you really got to rock it back and forth to get it out.

552
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
So I have to like dig in like a bad potato?

553
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
No, it's still good. So it's hard. It hasn't been boiled yet.

554
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
The one method of cooking in Ireland.

555
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I hope we can go to this wedding and then we enter the church and half of it is people and we go sit over there and the other half is all potatoes.

556
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Oh, my God.

557
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Hey, Scott, I think it's rude that you don't think I have potato friends.

558
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm really sorry. That's a big judgment.

559
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And vice versa. Of course, Mr. Tato is friends with many humans.

560
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'd like to count myself among them. So I'll sit on whatever side you guys want.

561
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I won't make you put me in a box.

562
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
All retired spies on Mr. Tato's side.

563
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Oh, sure.

564
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I'll get him talking at the reception. I'll get him liquor up.

565
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
All those secrets.

566
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So, OK, let's go to this 2015 Mr. Tato commercial.

567
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And look, I, as we've said, I'm going through character development on podcasts to ride.

568
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I'm getting a little body or I'm getting a little more used to a rubalds humor.

569
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It's just like you said, a very offensive.

570
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
You said a very offensive song title over on the second gate.

571
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
If you got on the second gate, I said the name of Cardi B and Megan, the Stallion's new song.

572
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I will not say it on the front main gate. I'm not. I haven't developed that much as a character.

573
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You got to pay for that.

574
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
We got only fans that you want to hear Mike say those words.

575
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
If you want to hear me say those words, you have to pay us five dollars.

576
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
That's how it works.

577
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,000
But so so when I watch this commercial, you know, I know Europe has, you know, commercials that have a little bit more suggestive stuff.

578
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I was very surprised, though, by this.

579
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Can we see this commercial here? Yeah. OK, here we go.

580
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So there's like a young a young lad, you would say, is that his computer and he sees like a lady in a bathing suit.

581
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And he's about to type, I wish I was the blanket that she's laying on.

582
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And Mr. Tato unplugged the computer and just shakes his head at the kid.

583
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Like, don't post that.

584
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
He's like he's suddenly in the room of basically like a bout to masturbate teen or something.

585
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Yeah, Tato shows up out of nowhere to stop him.

586
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Sorry, you want to backtrack to this?

587
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah, so I'll backtrack.

588
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
There's like three vignettes in this. It's very fast.

589
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It comes very fast.

590
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And by the way, Mr. Tato in this looks jacked like he has like a very like upper like a bigger upper body is a little more built than normal.

591
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
OK, so this shot. This is a really lewd commercial.

592
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I can just tell you one thing, and I'm falling for him even harder.

593
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
He's helping people.

594
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I'll explain this scenario because he's a gentleman here.

595
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Yeah. OK, yeah.

596
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
How would you describe this?

597
00:39:48,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Well, I would say a lot of women we know we know some leggings are not made for bending over because you see your underwear through it.

598
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And Mr. Tato is spotting the bum of a woman with some floral underwear peeking through her leggings.

599
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And he is alerting her.

600
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
But he's being a gentleman about it.

601
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Whispering, doing it discreetly so that the other people at this bus stop don't notice.

602
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So yeah, he really did her a favor here.

603
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And that's a great lesson for all the men out there.

604
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
If a woman's underwear is showing, just whisper in their ear at a bus stop.

605
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Let them know.

606
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And of course, they'll thank you and they won't call the police on you.

607
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Yeah. Follow them to a bus stop first.

608
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Notice, then follow.

609
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Right.

610
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Whisper what Mr. Tato said in her ear, which was a cover up.

611
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Jesus can see your sin.

612
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Oh my God.

613
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I don't know about this, Tato.

614
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I assumed it was the same thing that Bill Murray whispered in Scarlett Johansson's ear at the end of Lost in Translation.

615
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
All right. So, so OK, that's the end of that.

616
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
One more little scene.

617
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Vignette. Yeah, the woman covers it up with a jacket.

618
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And now there's a man who's leaving. He's going to go play sporting.

619
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
He's going to go play like football.

620
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And Mr. Tato looks down at him as he's leaving his flat.

621
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Those eyebrows.

622
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And he sees that the man is wearing shorts that are very tight that expose his bulge.

623
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It's a very prominent bulge.

624
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And the man looks down at his own bulge and Mr. Tato has shorts for him or no pants.

625
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Excuse me.

626
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Has pants for him already.

627
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And the man puts the pants on and thanks Mr. Tato for it.

628
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
So is he like the indecency police?

629
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
What is he doing?

630
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I think he's trying to keep the world as proper as he is.

631
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
You know, he's a man of virtue.

632
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Because he believes and he dresses nicely.

633
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
He's in a suit and tie.

634
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It's not about he's, you know, he's down with casual clothes, but not at the expense of decency.

635
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
You wouldn't see his bulge.

636
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Maybe it's implicit that like you wouldn't want to be seen with a bulge.

637
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Maybe that's what he's trying to prove.

638
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Maybe that's embarrassing.

639
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I don't know.

640
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
He's anti-bulge.

641
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:27,000
He just he wants the bulge in other places because he's a potato.

642
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I imagine potatoes being bulgy and lumpy.

643
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Of course, of course.

644
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
It's all over everywhere.

645
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It's not genitals.

646
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
It's just lots of different.

647
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Right.

648
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
The edible bulges.

649
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
At the very least, the underwear was a very sharp Kelly Green.

650
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Very, very like a classic four leaf clover.

651
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So yeah, and then the commercial lens and Mr. Tato is in this like young lad's room with an arm around him as the young lad is like sad and like eating.

652
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
The crisps like aggressively.

653
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
It's very odd.

654
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And then the tagline comes up and it says more than just the crisp.

655
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And I guess that means like he's also judging you for like indecency.

656
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I guess like you should think of the potatoes when you're eating them like to make sure that you're not putting sex out into the world or the disgusting human body.

657
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
No, I'm going to defend my future husband here.

658
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Just by saying we're all complex.

659
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
We're all complex.

660
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You know what I mean?

661
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Like you can want to live in a black and white world where like there's good and evil.

662
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
There's right and wrong.

663
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
But the fact is the world's gray.

664
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Tato's living in a gray world and I love him for it.

665
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
OK, well, that's a pretty that's a pretty big defense for him, which I can get behind the philosophy.

666
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Obviously, I, too, at one point would have been like Mr. Tato, where I was offended by a man's bulge coming out of a flat in England.

667
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,000
But I've gone through, again, aggressive character development these last couple podcast episodes, so I'm a little bit more comfortable with it.

668
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Are you willing to just put that that guy's bulge up and leave the screen shared for the rest of the episode?

669
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Scott, I would love to.

670
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I would love to leave the bulge up.

671
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Just look at that close up.

672
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Great.

673
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Where is it?

674
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Yeah, that's very.

675
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Randy, European Mike is really firing off.

676
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I just love that Tato's eyebrows change when he sees the bulge.

677
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
They get so sad like they flip and like you can see he's he's really distressed.

678
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Disappointed.

679
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
He's sad.

680
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
He's upset.

681
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I would like to bring up one more thing about this.

682
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:42,000
A practical concern from from a person who's done a few commercials in his life as a few of us have.

683
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Can you imagine getting the casting notice and having them like also explain like your bulge will be on display in this commercial?

684
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And then like you'll have to do this.

685
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
That's prosthetic.

686
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
That's that's a fake.

687
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I don't think that's a fake.

688
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I think that could be real.

689
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
We don't know.

690
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Look at those thighs.

691
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
They look like Rusev's.

692
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
They do look like WWE wrestler or former WWE wrestler Rusev's thighs.

693
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I agree.

694
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Marissa has been a big fan of of his thighs for years.

695
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
That is not a joke.

696
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I love when you would have his thighs.

697
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
This is coming before.

698
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Oh yeah.

699
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Like seven or eight years ago when she would come and watch wrestling pay-per-views.

700
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:29,000
She loved Rusev and she specifically would say she likes his thighs because they were very thick.

701
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
They're very big.

702
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Yeah.

703
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
They look like Thanksgiving turkeys.

704
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Very glazed.

705
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Yes.

706
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Yes.

707
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
He's been he's been on Twitch lately.

708
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
He's been playing video games on Twitch and his name is his real name is Miro.

709
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It's a cool name.

710
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So give him a give him a follow on Twitch and check out those thighs.

711
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I'm not trying to objectify people but I guess that is what I'm doing.

712
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
You're a fan.

713
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I'm a fan.

714
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Rusev Tato Rusev's thighs and Tato's non genital bulges just as potato we bulges.

715
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
There should have been a WrestleMania entrance where Rusev came out and Mr.

716
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Tato appeared and like shook his finger at him and then like gave him like a sweater to cover up his legs.

717
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Like a like a V-neck college style like 1950s sweater.

718
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yes.

719
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
For sure.

720
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So yeah.

721
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So Tato look Tato is a layered character.

722
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
He's got a lot of yeah a lot of different things going on.

723
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Right.

724
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
He might he might be encouraging body shame.

725
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
We just don't know.

726
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I think we actually we do probably know.

727
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
That's sort of what's happening.

728
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Yes.

729
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
This is completely.

730
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
And it's but at least he's he's all over the it's men and women.

731
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
He's shaming any anyone for showing their body.

732
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I would like a full 90 minute feature made by the same guy who made Paddington with Mr.

733
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Tato going around shaming people further dress.

734
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I'm yes I'm I'll buy a ticket.

735
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:20,000
So if you go to Tato Park very strict dress code be aware no shorts no showing of dirty thighs.

736
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Certainly no bulges.

737
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Thick thick thick leggings please.

738
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Like five of them just load them up.

739
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Don't stop at the one pair.

740
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I think that's good.

741
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Yeah that's really I mean those are the two big ones.

742
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I mean Mr. Tato went to the Euros and like what's the Euros.

743
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Yeah I wasn't.

744
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It's a soccer tournament.

745
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Is that right.

746
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I believe so.

747
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yeah he's got a soccer ball there.

748
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And then it was like will he make it to France.

749
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
But that's not as fun as him being alone at a table looking for love.

750
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
But you know what.

751
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
So there's clearly levels of Tato.

752
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
There's there's ones with articulated eyebrows and who can who can you know smile and frown and sadly sigh.

753
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And then you've got you know more of the mascot style.

754
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,000
And that's really the I think Tato is is like an Irish version of the wonderful Japanese mascots.

755
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
This is great account Mondo mascots.

756
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I feel like he he fits right in with those guys.

757
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And and then you've got the version of the park which is probably the most limited version.

758
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
But but still wonderful.

759
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
He's just it's just a great design.

760
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Marissa you're right that not every part of his face works in Ria.

761
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
His nose can be odd sometimes.

762
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
But I now I'm like low to see this guy in person.

763
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
If this could be one of the first things I do when the lockdown is over.

764
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Fly to Ireland.

765
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Go give him a hug and then leave immediately.

766
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
That's my plan.

767
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
That would be a great thing.

768
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
It would.

769
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I want to go to every restaurant in Ireland and just wait and hopefully one day I'll find the one he's sitting at.

770
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
That empty that table for one and you can make it a table for two.

771
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I thought I was out of stuff but I have found a quick thing and it's a very small graphic but I will share it.

772
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I found something called the love bus that Mr. Tato is on and it's like a double decker bus that you would see in Europe.

773
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
And he's like seductively like posed on and he's wearing his normal outfit.

774
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
But it's it's that's a much more suggestive Tato Marissa has been like she's been hit in the head with something.

775
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
She's so taken aback.

776
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I mean this is a very suggestive Tato.

777
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
This Tato is like a come hither Tato.

778
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It is a come hither Tato for sure.

779
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:50,000
It's it's and it's kind of again it's like in contrast with the commercial we just watched too where it's like this is this is suggestive.

780
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Yeah.

781
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
What is he doing here?

782
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Maybe he only believes he himself could be suggestive.

783
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Yeah.

784
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Oh if he thinks if people are showing off their underpants and bulges that it'll distract from him and then he'll never find his Mrs. Tato.

785
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
That's got to be what it is.

786
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Cover up.

787
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I'm putting on a show every day of my life.

788
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
The love bus.

789
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
We don't know what he sounds like as far in all of this.

790
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Aside from that one sigh does he does he not talk.

791
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Is that the thing is he one of those characters or what's the vibe of the voice.

792
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Jason do you got a voice for him.

793
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I think Jason's voice you did at the start of the show was the voice.

794
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I think I don't I think he doesn't I think he's like a teller.

795
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
He doesn't talk.

796
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Yeah I mean like power of him is the not talk.

797
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
So some people flap their mouths forever but not Tato.

798
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
He does it all his face in his presence.

799
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:54,000
He saw too much during World War Two or the Troubles and he's just you know very pensive very pensive every now and then he'll open up and it'll be crazy.

800
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:02,000
He'll come out with something like like your underwear is showing your underwear is showing.

801
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I blew up a fiat once.

802
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Jason could you give us the line your underwear showing in the voice real quick.

803
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Whisper to like a real whisper.

804
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Yeah he Tato only whispers.

805
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I know you have to warm up I get that.

806
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Take your time.

807
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:32,000
The underwear is showing the armor light is hidden in the flower bed.

808
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I think Jason for Tato should get trending here and we could actually get you this job.

809
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Sure.

810
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Yeah let's go we'll go backwards and read all of the ads so that they have full vocal presence there.

811
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I mean we're definitely going to take that thing that Jason just said and add it into that commercial.

812
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Certainly that shall be done.

813
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
That's easy.

814
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
We can do that no problem.

815
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
So yeah.

816
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Cover that bulge up.

817
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
The ladies are mine.

818
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
All of them.

819
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Yeah so Tato I mean that's that's all I have for Tato right now before I guess we have to talk about rides.

820
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Well I did.

821
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Before we get to the one thing we haven't talked about and Marissa you brought we both immediately jumped to this when we first talked about this park.

822
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Yeah.

823
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And that is Ireland very much a place associated with potatoes from the famine of the 1800s.

824
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
So then to have a potato based theme park is is kind of wild.

825
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
It feels that way but maybe it's like you know you got to get over the stigma right.

826
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
So you go real hard.

827
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Yeah.

828
00:52:45,000 --> 00:53:02,000
But it is important not to forget about it and that's why I have some famine fun fact during the famine one million people died and one million people emigrated causing a population decrease in Ireland between 20 and 25 percent.

829
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Oh.

830
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
That's how about that.

831
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Did you call that a fun fact.

832
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Yeah.

833
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Why was that fun.

834
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
That's a famine fun fact.

835
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Just going back to a thing I did I used to do more on the show where I would just drop some knowledge in the middle of stuff.

836
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
You know.

837
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Did you.

838
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I don't remember that.

839
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Oh yeah.

840
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
The tortilla.

841
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
But I know that crap about tortillas.

842
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Okay.

843
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Was that when the before times.

844
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Yeah.

845
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Yeah.

846
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It was in the before times.

847
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Because I have a very fuzzy memory of ever actually seeing all of you in person so I might just have forgotten.

848
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
That's true.

849
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Did we ever was the show ever in person.

850
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
But I don't bring fun Jason bring the fun facts back.

851
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Yeah.

852
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
What we need during the pandemic is famine death statistics.

853
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Yeah.

854
00:53:51,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Oh you mean like how the famine was caused by what is known as late blight a disease of the potato plant caused by water mold.

855
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Oh my God.

856
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Anyway.

857
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Can you.

858
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
All right.

859
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I have one more request.

860
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
We just keep giving you assignments here.

861
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,000
But can you read one of these facts in what we've determined is the Mr. Tato voice.

862
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:20,000
And when you get to the word potato in any of them make it me or if you have to pluralize it me's you know.

863
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Like instead of where there were no potatoes there were no me's and you can pick your whatever facts lends itself best to that.

864
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Oh OK.

865
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:42,000
The the Irish me family the Irish me famine was caused by late blight which is a disease of the me plant caused by water mold.

866
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
All right.

867
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
We got to do we got to mock that up too I guess.

868
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
The me plant.

869
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I think this is I don't want to talk about another type of crisp or chip but this is like Pringles I can't pop just one.

870
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Do we have any more facts you can.

871
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
This is delightful.

872
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah.

873
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Do you have any other me facts.

874
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
It can be one you already said.

875
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Well I'm out of famine fact but I do have some Irish freedom fun facts if you have any interest in that.

876
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
But there's no potato in there.

877
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
No we don't care about that.

878
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Find a way to make it come from his you know like if it was a very sad fact and then like you know that's not as fun as eating one of me.

879
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,000
OK.

880
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
OK.

881
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:46,000
The drink called in America known as the black and tan is one part stout or porter and one part ale or lager.

882
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Unfortunately it is named after a part of the Royal Irish Constabulary that was used by the British to repress the Irish Republican Army.

883
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:03,000
They were known for acts of police brutality and were eventually run out of Ireland or killed.

884
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:12,000
But take your mind off that with limited edition Tex-Mex brand of me's.

885
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
That was great great scenes ever performed.

886
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Yeah that was like a monologue.

887
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Yeah.

888
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Boy boy.

889
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Wow.

890
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
You got to do one too.

891
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
You gave your your marital plea.

892
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I this is this is like like there's a lot of great Irish playwrights.

893
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
We're all like doing little little one acts here.

894
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Yes.

895
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Jason did you really only have two famine fun facts.

896
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I had two famine fun facts so I could switch over to the Irish freedom facts.

897
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:53,000
For example the Good Friday Agreement was signed in spring of 1998 bringing an end to decades of violence colloquially known as the Troubles.

898
00:56:53,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Of course Northern Ireland is still part of the United Kingdom but I believe we will see a united Ireland in my lifetime.

899
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Until then tide yourself over with a delicious bag of prawn cocktail me's.

900
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Wow. This is so this would be such a good ad campaign for them.

901
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Oh sure.

902
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
This is such a good idea and I'm sure they'll listen to this.

903
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Michael you me Marissa Scott we've all spent a little time in the ad game we know what that the Madison Avenue or whatever the street is in Derry.

904
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
We all know what they want.

905
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Yeah I mean look let's let's let's list the credits OK.

906
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
All state insurance for me.

907
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Dunkin Donuts for Jason Dunkin Donuts.

908
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Marissa.

909
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Scott.

910
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I directed some Nissan Juke commercials that were did a lot of body shaming of Mike Mitchell.

911
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Yeah we've all got great credits.

912
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
All of great credits.

913
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It's the meanest.

914
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
He's talked about it on Dope Boys.

915
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:16,000
There's I didn't write them but he ended I might have been said yeah sure he could be in them but boy it's so like I it's all like all right.

916
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Then he gets on the scale then he gets on the scale again and then it turns out he never lost any weight it didn't work.

917
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Oh well I assume these exist somewhere.

918
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Can I ask you can I ask you a question if Mr. Potato were to come I mean excuse me Mr. Tato.

919
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Oh my God.

920
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Oh my God I'm sorry.

921
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
If Mr. Tato.

922
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:43,000
He said his first name his first name is Poe.

923
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:59,000
If if if our friend Tato was to show up in one of those commercials what do you think he would have said to Mike Mitchell or how do you think he would have influenced the character that Mike Mitchell was playing.

924
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Who was a guy really struggling with his weight.

925
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,000
It's like to like to no avail and being made fun of by everyone around him in a cruel script that I did not write.

926
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
So let me make that very clear.

927
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Is this a is this for Jason because he's been doing the voice.

928
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I mean you can set the scene and maybe Jason will add the dialogue.

929
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I have I have it I have it here.

930
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,000
He would come into the scene he would come into he would break into Mitch's house.

931
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,000
He would see that Mitch was wearing shorts that were very tight and he would like shake his head at Mitch's bulge.

932
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:43,000
And then he would say he would say that your bulge is showing so your bulge is showing Mitch.

933
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
So Jason go ahead.

934
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Breathy please make it please make it breath.

935
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
OK. Yeah.

936
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
We've got to wait.

937
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Wait one more thing. Let's reset.

938
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
OK.

939
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Mitchie my boy your bulge is showing.

940
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
You can't kiss the Blarney Stone with that.

941
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
So much better than the ad nightmares that I was that I was a part of.

942
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Wow. We all rewrote them on the.

943
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Yeah.

944
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
We just we just all moved our Madison Avenue prowess right now.

945
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Yeah. Yeah.

946
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And we learned that some people kiss the Blarney Stone with their bulges.

947
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
That's good.

948
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Well you can't you can't.

949
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Then you get the bad luck.

950
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:43,000
But it seems like something people want to do and have at least tried previously to be to be forewarning someone.

951
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Yeah.

952
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,000
You want to lose weights cut back on me's very good.

953
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I like that.

954
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I feel like that's the end of the commercial.

955
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
We feel satisfied.

956
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Yeah that's good.

957
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Yeah.

958
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Yeah. Yeah.

959
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Even though it's an ad it was an ad for a car we've now commandeered it to be an ad for a potato crisp company.

960
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
It's like how McGruff is in like insurance ads now.

961
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:15,000
It's like he has his own National Crime Prevention Council but now he's appearing in insurance but he's also promoting himself.

962
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
He's appearing so you know you can have crossovers is what I'm saying.

963
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Yeah that's very confusing.

964
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Yeah very confusing.

965
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Do we have to talk about this theme park right.

966
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
This is some of the latest we've ever gotten to theme park.

967
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
This is an hour in content.

968
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
It's an hour in.

969
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Well because look the park seems very nice and lovely.

970
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:42,000
There are some nice cute rides and I have no shit to talk about it.

971
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:50,000
You know this isn't like the fake Universal Studios that we covered where I have many pages of complaints.

972
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I just this this place seems really nice.

973
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
That's that's what I will say.

974
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Yeah.

975
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
You guys agree.

976
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:07,000
I mean there's yeah there's not there's no like unlicensed 80s NBC hour long drama based rides.

977
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:17,000
There's fun basic rides like they they have a picture of their vortex tunnel which just is like a cool colorful circle which I love.

978
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I mean I can't what could I say other than I'd love to walk down this vortex tunnel.

979
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Yeah me too.

980
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
It reminded me of that that part of Universal Studios tram ride right.

981
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Isn't there.

982
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
It's been like an avalanche sometimes it's been something else right.

983
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,000
It's in a mummy's tomb and now it is nothing now it's the Fast and the Furious finale.

984
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
OK.

985
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:49,000
It's very it's it's very similar to that old Epcot hallway with the car like it's very circular and there's colors and the greatest.

986
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
That's an episode right there.

987
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
We should do an episode about the tunnel.

988
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
That's probably right.

989
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,000
The Epcot tunnel that's now closed.

990
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
What's just sitting there with nothing happening.

991
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
That's the idea to replace it is just not opening it ever.

992
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
It's insane.

993
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:09,000
When we were there we saw it and we're like we just can't walk down the tunnel with the colors like it's cruel.

994
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
That just seems cruel.

995
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:17,000
We're talking about the journey into your imagination tunnel now that so much better than the ride.

996
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
So this tunnel is far better than the right.

997
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Yes.

998
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
So yeah I mean it's got you know it's got a train.

999
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
The Tato Park has a train.

1000
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Jason were you excited about this.

1001
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I was because I watched a couple like vloggers go through this park.

1002
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:41,000
The one this guy theme park worldwide has gone to most of the European parks we've covered and pretty thorough.

1003
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:48,000
The train goes fast like I would say it goes like twice as fast as like the Disney train.

1004
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Sweet.

1005
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Interesting.

1006
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Do you think that's good.

1007
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I think you would think that might be bad.

1008
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I think you like the slow plot of the Disney.

1009
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Slow plotting nature of a train.

1010
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Well things are a little they do things differently in Europe.

1011
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:07,000
So you know I could you know change it up switch it up just like you're switching it up with the body.

1012
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Yes.

1013
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Scott I thought you were setting us up earlier talking about rides for the very adorable looking Nissan driving school at Tito Park.

1014
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Oh my old pals at Nissan who paid for Nissan who paid for it.

1015
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Paid Mike Mitchell very little to be body shamed on camera.

1016
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
My old my good friends.

1017
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Now I do like this Nissan driving school.

1018
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
This is adorable.

1019
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
It's like I just wrote down it's a little town you drive in exclamation point.

1020
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
It's not like an utopia where you have a set track.

1021
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:49,000
It's like a couple little city blocks like miniature city blocks and kids drive tiny cars around and then go wherever they want.

1022
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
It's so cute.

1023
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Yeah I mean it gives the kids a lot more freedom which is what I desired from those type that type of utopia ride as a child.

1024
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Marissa is agreeing with me.

1025
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Yeah.

1026
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Because because when you're very little you might not even realize the I like the physics of it.

1027
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
You're still on a little track and you can't go far.

1028
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
But then once you get to like six years old or seven years old you're like this is kind of bullshit.

1029
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
You're onto it.

1030
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
You're onto it.

1031
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,000
And that's why I always wanted like a power wheels car.

1032
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,000
But I would I never received one and it still haunts me to this day.

1033
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Do you feel like power wheels were the kind of thing where like you went over to your friend's house and they had one and you'd want to use it because you didn't have one but they were like it's old hat.

1034
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
We don't.

1035
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
It's like not even fun.

1036
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Oh yeah.

1037
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Yeah for sure.

1038
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Yeah like we don't even take that out of the garage anymore.

1039
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Yeah. And you're just like how can you be sitting on this gold.

1040
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Yeah.

1041
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Yeah it's like a kid's like I'm driving my parents car at this point.

1042
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Yeah no I I'm trying to think I didn't have a close friend that had one.

1043
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:06,000
But yeah anyone any kid that had it I was either like they would just monopolize it and wouldn't let me drive.

1044
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And it was never something negotiating wise that my parents took care of because I think that's the way sometimes you have to do that because when we're little like.

1045
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Kids get very territorial over their stuff which I get but sometimes the parents have to be like well let's little Michael do this like a guy I was friends with in elementary school who wouldn't let me play Sega Genesis.

1046
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I sat and watched him play.

1047
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I have a question.

1048
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I have a question.

1049
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Did your parents come on all your play dates and mediate for you.

1050
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
No.

1051
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
My mom came on all my field trips though.

1052
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Oh wow.

1053
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Well you know you would go to like you know the nature museum or you would go you know to what yeah like the science museum whatever that was.

1054
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
My mother volunteered and was just looming.

1055
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:56,000
She was a presence anytime we were out of the school and that was unfun you didn't like it.

1056
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:03,000
It just I felt there was a press there's always a pressure when you like your mom is there.

1057
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Yeah it's kind of a freedom to go to school.

1058
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Yeah.

1059
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Yeah.

1060
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:13,000
And if kids are all like daring each other to say dirty words or something and then you feel the shadow.

1061
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Yeah I was glancing I'm glancing over my mom's like my mom did the same thing with it Mr. Tato did where she was like mm hmm.

1062
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
You don't say those words.

1063
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
But see I liked it.

1064
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:33,000
My mom would also shop at the museum and she would be like oh my gosh I'm going to go to the museum and I'm going to go to the museum and I'm going to go to the museum and I'm going to go to the museum.

1065
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I liked it.

1066
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,000
My mom would also shop for it a lot too because I was not a kid with expensive taste.

1067
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I did not ask for powering power wheels that sort of thing.

1068
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
I never wanted the really expensive stuff.

1069
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
But when I went on trips I was a big souvenir guy.

1070
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:57,000
So it's nice if I ran out of the money I brought if I need I was like you know I want one more you know mom this is nice right.

1071
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
This is pretty good I get that.

1072
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:06,000
So it was nice having you know the community bank around.

1073
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:12,000
So you were you were just you were you were fine with her being there but you were especially happy because she could bankroll any souvenirs you needed.

1074
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Yeah I feel like we also like I remember we went to the inner harbor a lot which is like the tourists area of Baltimore.

1075
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:29,000
It's like an aquarium and a science center with like three city walk kind of mally things in between.

1076
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:37,000
So like those trips the parents always liked going on because they would just like let the kids like all right be back in an hour.

1077
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
We're going to go eat crab cakes and drink wine or drink beer.

1078
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
All right.

1079
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
So the Baltimore Inner Harbor debacle coming.

1080
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:55,000
It's 24 part daily series in 2024 Jason's mom's going to be on that one.

1081
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
And one of the running.

1082
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Yeah she'll be she's the sector keeper of that saga.

1083
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Oh no.

1084
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
She's a smart.

1085
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Hey well she has to do it.

1086
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
She I should be able to give you money if you need it during the show.

1087
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Oh that's good.

1088
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:21,000
A full daily series where if we start to go towards a dirty word somebody's mother is like.

1089
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Hi folks I just want to prepare you that Scott's audio quality is about to dip and it's just because something happened with the recording and I wanted to prepare you for that and didn't want you to be shocked when you heard it because you know you might have dropped your bag of crisps all over your phone or your computer and I didn't want that anyway.

1090
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Back to the show.

1091
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:45,000
She does not know she she has listened a bunch now and she does not like it.

1092
01:09:45,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Those kinds of words that said when I came down the stairs like when I was visiting for Christmas last year she was wearing a big oversized haunt cast the fright shirt so and there was a bunch of magnets there was a bunch of our logo magnets on the fridge.

1093
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
So that was very sweet.

1094
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
That's very nice.

1095
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:11,000
But if we put one out if it's you know if we had a profane one she would be happy podcast the book.

1096
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Yeah, in that merchandise by that.

1097
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Hey, the inner harbor is owned to a building that when I was there I knew it was like a Barnes and Noble a harder out cafe and ESPN zoned, but many years before was the infamous six flags power plant.

1098
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
The.

1099
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Yes, they crazy designed indoor theme park with no rides just a lot of optical illusions and shows and yeah.

1100
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
That sounds like an Instagram museum.

1101
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Like, just where there's not really anything to do there.

1102
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Yeah, yeah, I'm not a big fan of those.

1103
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Baltimore, Baltimore power plant. I've had a sticky note on a laptop for like years that has said, we should do Baltimore.

1104
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
That's that's a good way.

1105
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Yeah, that's a long one. Yeah, that's a good today. A lot of technological innovation was tested out there that showed up in other places I feel like.

1106
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Sure, but the thing itself was weird and bad, although I kind of a disaster. Yeah. Yeah.

1107
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Yeah. Okay. We're all right. All right.

1108
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Theme parks, theme parks, current theme park.

1109
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Marissa, is there one rider experience when you were looking at the website that you felt like that was like right up your alley.

1110
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Yes.

1111
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I honestly thought that that big wooden coaster is probably very cool. So I think that that would be like a delight. It looked like very fun classic kind of roller coaster.

1112
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:50,000
And certainly the YouTube vlog that Jason referenced, that guy was over the moon about it.

1113
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
And what's the name of this?

1114
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I looked up so many pronunciations and all of I swear I saw like eight different ones. It's great.

1115
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Because it's very Gaelic and yeah, I have seen it as like Coo Coo Lane or I'm only going to try that.

1116
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:12,000
It's probably wrong, but it's one of the ones that Ireland's only wooden roller coaster.

1117
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:27,000
And it is named after an Irish Denny God, like the the Odysseus kind of of Ireland, which I skimmed through some of the facts about that tale.

1118
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Spoiler for the end of this Coo Coo Lane didn't live for very long. His legends did not last long. Died young like a like a rock star like a Jim Morrison or a Janis Joplin.

1119
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:50,000
He got into a seemingly got into a fight with a bunch of teenagers, like teenage kids of a guy he killed who cut him open at the chest.

1120
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:57,000
And then all of his intestines fell out of his chest. But he shoved him back in and said, let's let's go. Let's fight more.

1121
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:03,000
So they did fight more and decapitated him. And that was the tale of Coo Coo Lane.

1122
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Fighting Irish baby! Fighting Irish!

1123
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
He put the intestines back in.

1124
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Yeah, for like five seconds, seemingly.

1125
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Like triumphant, no, I'm fighting on. All right.

1126
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
This immediate headshot.

1127
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Wow. I saw him described as like an Irish Incredible Hulk because he could like change.

1128
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:31,000
He would get very big and muscley and stuff like a tall tale like a Paul Bunyan or a John Henry.

1129
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:41,000
One of his parts of his legend is that he at some point kills a very vicious dog, which basically makes him the first Irish cop.

1130
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:47,000
So there's that. Yeah, he I was not familiar with this character.

1131
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Yeah, I wasn't either. It's so complicated Celtic lore. It's so the pronunciations and all the variations and stuff.

1132
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
But Marissa, of course, grew up with this was one of her favorite childhood.

1133
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Yeah, it was actually my first language. So

1134
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
You were butchering it. Oh my God.

1135
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:12,000
You were you were not allowed to know the story of Blossom, but you were allowed to know the story of Coo Coo Lane.

1136
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Yeah. No, I didn't really grow up with these myths, but I was like obsessed with Greek myths as like a kid.

1137
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Like I had that big yellow book. I don't know if you guys had that book.

1138
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
It was a big yellow book. It's another one of these.

1139
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I don't know the yellow book. If you saw it, you'd be like, oh, it was like this oversized yellow book.

1140
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,000
You know what I mean with like the entire, you know, pantheon of gods.

1141
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
You know, there was a sun and maybe some blue.

1142
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
It was.

1143
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Dailor is I'm saying this name wrong.

1144
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Do you lower? I'm butchering this.

1145
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
It's a book of Greek myths. I don't know.

1146
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I don't know. I don't remember, but like I was obsessed with that book and would like read it and read it and read it like as like a 10 year old.

1147
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Would you would you go and like talk to kids and assume they had that yellow book as well and they were very into those gods?

1148
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1149
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Equally as embarrassing or unusual.

1150
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:27,000
My mom took me to a lecture and musical presentation on Gullah, which is a Creole language and culture with African influences that developed in the American South as a result of the slave trade.

1151
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:38,000
And as like a six year old, I went to that fell in love with the music, bought a cassette tape, brought a cassette player to school, played that tape at recess.

1152
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,000
And didn't understand why nobody else liked this music or knew it.

1153
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
That's very sad.

1154
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I mean, beautiful music. But you're sitting there as sad as Mr. Tato alone in his booth.

1155
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Truly. Yeah. But I just think that like you just don't know what other kids are doing until you show up and do something totally different.

1156
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Were there any other moments you remember as a kid where you were like coming in and like, I got something that's going to really impress all the other kids?

1157
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Or is that the biggest one?

1158
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:25,000
That's like the biggest one because like it was like one of those moments where like we're at the park at recess because we went to recess at this like park across the street.

1159
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:30,000
And I just remember playing it and thinking I was going to be such hot shit.

1160
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Like I thought I was going to be so cool.

1161
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:39,000
And then, you know, I realized no one's interested.

1162
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And I sit on a park bench alone.

1163
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
That's that Gullah girl.

1164
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
That Gullah girl's cool. You talked to her yet?

1165
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:56,000
You think that's what they were saying?

1166
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I think it went well. You only asked.

1167
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
They were intimidated. Yeah.

1168
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:10,000
That's something my mom always said to me. It wasn't that kids weren't talking to me. It's that they were intimidated.

1169
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:16,000
They probably are just afraid to talk to you because you seem so smart and cool.

1170
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Or it's like they're jealous of you is a lot. You'd hear that too as a kid.

1171
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,000
And then like after a couple of years, you'd be like, I don't think they're jealous of me.

1172
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
I don't think they're jealous of my weirdness.

1173
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:36,000
They have problems of their own for certain, but I don't think that's right.

1174
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Marissa, what you are describing is how I felt as a kid when I would start going on about the backstories of theme park attractions.

1175
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Here's how this works.

1176
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,000
The dream finder is Figment's friend.

1177
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:03,000
At a certain point, I was just like, this is a private thing for me and for my family.

1178
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:10,000
And yeah, it honestly kind of wasn't until college that I was like other people.

1179
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I was like, hey, yeah, this thing. Right. Yeah.

1180
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Yeah. You found your tribe. That's right.

1181
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:24,000
I talked about the Beach Boys so much as a nine year old boy.

1182
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:32,000
And I would like wear like a bright orange, like a neon, the brightest hat you've ever seen with their logo.

1183
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I would wear it to school and think that was cool to do.

1184
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Were you at all?

1185
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Anyway, then Jardine was, you know, Jardine was less of a presence for a minute.

1186
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:50,000
And some David Marks came in and said, anyway, want to go out with me?

1187
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Okay, so they might be giants used to have a dial-up song that you could call.

1188
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
And like this is before you could get every song.

1189
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,000
So it was a nine hundred. You'd have to pay a little, but you would hear their songs.

1190
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,000
And I was just going to ask Scott, were you like maybe this is the wrong timing.

1191
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,000
But like when the Beach Boys appeared on Full House, how did you feel?

1192
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Well, that, you know, that made them more relevant among seven, eight year olds, which which helped.

1193
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Definitely. At least you like people finally had a signifier.

1194
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:28,000
But I might have been a person who was like if if even I started connecting and like,

1195
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
oh, like so they oh yeah, they did Kokomo.

1196
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Yeah, Kokomo is, you know, like you have to go back into the 70s, you know, like, you know,

1197
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
it's kind of a pop it. But like Sunflower is really where things are at.

1198
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:45,000
And we're very lush, wonderful, smart, smart music.

1199
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
They're like pushing people away even with the connection.

1200
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Trying to trying to make a connection.

1201
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
No, I don't care. No, go away.

1202
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
You know, I get the same way as I do.

1203
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
What is that? Is there a word for that kind of feeling?

1204
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Because I've certainly encountered it in myself and seen it in others where like someone's trying to connect

1205
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:12,000
and then you have to showcase your depth of knowledge or that you're not a part of that.

1206
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Elitism.

1207
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Feature, a superior feeling, superiority, feeling ownership over something.

1208
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Cry for help reaching out.

1209
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
No self sabotage.

1210
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Not to nowhere.

1211
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Please, I'm so lonely.

1212
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,000
All I have are my crisps to go home to.

1213
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Boy in the ad resting on his shoulder.

1214
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Mr. Tato is the answer.

1215
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
He can take anyone away from all these symptoms.

1216
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:52,000
They have at Tato Park, they have a 5D cinema.

1217
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Did we come across this, which is doesn't have like a specific movie?

1218
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
It appears it is closed right now due to social distancing.

1219
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Yeah, the factory tour, too, is closed.

1220
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Yeah. Oh, that's a bummer.

1221
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Yeah, you feel like why would you even go?

1222
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:14,000
But it says featuring air gusts, water jets, leg ticklers, flashing lights and bubbles.

1223
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Sure to get pulses racing from start to finish, but it doesn't say what it is.

1224
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,000
And it looks like it's a 4DX theater and it's got about 25 seats from this photo.

1225
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:28,000
And they're all children and they're all like pretending they're excited about whatever they're seeing.

1226
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I really feel like Tato wouldn't approve of something called like leg ticklers or whatever, you know,

1227
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
but wouldn't love bus Tato like a leg tick.

1228
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
He has a leg tickler at home for private use.

1229
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Definitely. But children are not involved and children should be shielded from that.

1230
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Right. That's fair.

1231
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:53,000
He probably has just two of the chairs from the 5D cinema and he puts his lover in it

1232
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,000
and he just has like a little remote control that says leg tickler on it.

1233
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
And he like controls the speed at which the tickles happen.

1234
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I mean, I'll know one day.

1235
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Hopefully soon.

1236
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:14,000
When you're married under the eyes of the church and God and your family and friends,

1237
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:19,000
let's also say the wedding party for Marissa and Tato.

1238
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
We got Mafalda's there.

1239
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,000
A movement, a bunch of the movements, the rounded.

1240
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Yes. Creatures.

1241
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Cartoon creatures.

1242
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Hot Stuff, the Little Devil from Harvey comics.

1243
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Little Devil.

1244
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I think a lot of Harvey comics characters would be there.

1245
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
There were a lot of Harvey comics.

1246
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:44,000
There were two little guys that I like this comic book I read when I lived in Spain called Sipi y Sapa.

1247
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
And they would be there.

1248
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,000
They're like little mischievous twins, one with blonde hair, one with black hair.

1249
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Great.

1250
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
We've ever come across a mythology called Beano land.

1251
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
I guess it wasn't called Beano land.

1252
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
What's the thing?

1253
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Beano is the thing.

1254
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
We went to the steam park last week.

1255
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
This whole Beano world.

1256
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
That's a weird British thing.

1257
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
You ever run into Beano?

1258
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Are you talking about the pill you take for flatulence?

1259
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
No, no, no.

1260
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
That's a very common mix up.

1261
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:22,000
In this case, even though Mr. Tato is a big walking potato, Beano is not a big Beano pill with a face.

1262
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Yeah, they're just a series of older characters, like cartoon strip style characters.

1263
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,000
I think you would be interested in them because they're very old.

1264
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Yeah.

1265
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Which is really, that's like number one.

1266
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Yeah, it's got to be old.

1267
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
It's got to be off brand.

1268
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Do you know what I mean?

1269
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Like it can't look too mainstream for me.

1270
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Right.

1271
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
It can't look like something people would like.

1272
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Exactly.

1273
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Well, then you're going to love the British version of Dennis the Menace, which is unrelated to our Dennis the Menace, even though they debuted on the very same day.

1274
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
It's a different guy.

1275
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
He wears a striped shirt.

1276
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
He's got an ugly dog.

1277
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
It's a whole thing.

1278
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
And you're saying guy.

1279
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Is it a man?

1280
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
It's just a little dude.

1281
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,000
He's like it's like Sid from Toy Story, which I have you seen Toy Story.

1282
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Is that too mainstream?

1283
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I'm sorry.

1284
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
You were there's a French Toy Story.

1285
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Marissa likes a lot better.

1286
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
It was made in 1975.

1287
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Le Petit Jouguet.

1288
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I don't know if that's right.

1289
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
The real Toy Story.

1290
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
The Red Balloon, the series.

1291
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Marissa doing a Quibi version of the Red Balloon.

1292
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
It's just me with a cassette tape in a park.

1293
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Lil Bicycle Thieves.

1294
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I think these are good ideas.

1295
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Yeah.

1296
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Band of Lil' Outsiders.

1297
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
They still do the dance.

1298
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
They're just a lot less graceful.

1299
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
What haven't we done?

1300
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Oh, yes.

1301
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Like Chessington, Tato Park has a zoo next to it.

1302
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,000
And I just wanted to showcase.

1303
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I'm going to try to screen share.

1304
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I never know how to do this.

1305
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
But here we go.

1306
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
OK, I am going to share.

1307
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
These are the residents of Lemur Woods.

1308
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
They're Lemurs at Tato Park.

1309
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,000
And they look like they want to come out and do a dance.

1310
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
They look like they want to kick my ass.

1311
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:47,000
And then one other thing that you can see at Tato Park.

1312
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Let me try and get back to my notes.

1313
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Make these scary Lemurs go away.

1314
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I guess we've been looking at them the whole time.

1315
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
They're your Zoom background too.

1316
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Boy, yeah, they're growing into my soul.

1317
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
They are my Zoom background as well.

1318
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Far from what I've been having.

1319
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Yeah. Is it because you want to kick our ass, Jason?

1320
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
No, I don't.

1321
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
I'm having a great time.

1322
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:17,000
But not as good as a time as I had when I rode the horse ride here at Chessington.

1323
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
As a child.

1324
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
You mean Tato?

1325
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Oh, yes. Here at Tato.

1326
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Excuse me. The pony rail.

1327
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
The ride is called Pony Rail.

1328
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
And there is a child that looks very much like.

1329
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Not dissimilar from a child me.

1330
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Yeah. I think that pony ride is very darling.

1331
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
It was one of the ones I clocked as like a cute little idea.

1332
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,000
That child looks both like a child and a very old man.

1333
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Yeah.

1334
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Yeah.

1335
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
The two ends of Jason, I guess.

1336
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
The two ends of Jason.

1337
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Guys, guys, come back.

1338
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
I got more to tell you.

1339
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I haven't even started on Fred and Ethel Mertz.

1340
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Now they live downstairs.

1341
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
They own the building.

1342
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
They own the building.

1343
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
And there are friends.

1344
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Eventually they move to the country when they sell the building.

1345
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Fred became Ricky's manager.

1346
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Fred became Ricky's manager.

1347
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
He had no experience.

1348
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Well, he managed the building.

1349
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I guess it's kind of similar.

1350
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,000
I'm the only one in the school who knows this.

1351
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
The janitor is even walking away.

1352
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
The ancient janitor hates it too.

1353
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Get with the times, kid.

1354
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
I know what it is.

1355
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I just don't care.

1356
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Watch it. Watch.

1357
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Turn on empty nest.

1358
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Watch a new show.

1359
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I love them.

1360
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Evening shade.

1361
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I let's see.

1362
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
There's a little, there's a Viking ride.

1363
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
And this is very charming where you, you go, it's, this is fake rocks.

1364
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
As very recently they have fake rocks at this part,

1365
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
which makes it a real theme park in our eyes.

1366
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
You take little Viking ships.

1367
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Up into a mountain that has like a big Viking.

1368
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Helmet.

1369
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
That is really cool.

1370
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Look. And so they're getting into theme.

1371
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
That's the toughest part.

1372
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
It's like,

1373
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
it's like a big,

1374
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
it's like a big,

1375
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
it's like a big,

1376
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
it's like a big,

1377
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
it's like a big,

1378
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
it's like a big,

1379
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
it's like a big,

1380
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
I think that,

1381
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
that's the stupidest thing.

1382
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
I think with any little theme park.

1383
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I think the actual seeming is tough to do,

1384
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
it's expensive.

1385
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
They have to get on their feet before they can do it.

1386
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
And Viking voyage seems like,

1387
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
a great step in that direction.

1388
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Seems like really fun.

1389
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Yeah, I thought that one looked really cool.

1390
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:18,000
It reminded me.

1391
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
And I don't know if it is that similar, but it reminded me of,

1392
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
there's a ride at Efteling.

1393
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
And I'm going to butcher the name of it.

1394
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
It's a very,

1395
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:30,000
kind of a voyage Viking style ride also.

1396
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
I think you're a merchant.

1397
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Technically in that, but you know,

1398
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
or part of a.

1399
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I was going to ask you this.

1400
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
We specifically are not doing Efteling on this European vacation

1401
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
month because we feel like we have to actually go to do it proper

1402
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
homage, but to represent Efteling.

1403
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Is there, is there any odd Efteling detail you can,

1404
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
you know,

1405
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,000
you can give us so that we can say that Efteling had a little presence

1406
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
within this month.

1407
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I would say one of the most magical moments of my life.

1408
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Was turning around.

1409
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
To see a majorette.

1410
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Being followed by 20 ducks.

1411
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
And all of them.

1412
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Dancing. You know what I mean?

1413
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
The ducks are like marching along and the majorette is like blowing a

1414
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
whistle into like a rhythmic beat little song. She has like a,

1415
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
you know, a bee feeder style hat.

1416
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I don't know what majorettes call their hats, but so darling.

1417
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:29,000
And like, they're just going through the streets, like the, you know,

1418
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Walkways of Efteling.

1419
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Performing and like.

1420
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I love ducks.

1421
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Like ducks are one of my favorite animals.

1422
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,000
So like turning around to see a bunch of.

1423
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Choreographed ducks was so magical.

1424
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Choreographed ducks. So they all were in.

1425
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
They were in a line. They knew how to stop and they knew how to start.

1426
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
They weren't dancing or anything.

1427
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Okay.

1428
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,000
So the number one thing you can do at Efteling is see a majorette with

1429
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
ducks.

1430
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I mean, it's the highest on my list.

1431
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,000
And there's a lot like truly Efteling. I think, you know, whenever you guys.

1432
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:15,000
I think it's my favorite theme park in the world.

1433
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
So.

1434
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
It might have to be a star studded episode too, cause it's so.

1435
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
A lot of past guests have been on other friends have been on and,

1436
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
and just everyone, if you get people started talking about it,

1437
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,000
they'll just go like for hours.

1438
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
I think one of the things that I like about it,

1439
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
and I'm not going to go into it is that.

1440
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I think very few times in life do you get to be immersed.

1441
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
In kind of like.

1442
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:47,000
A world that feels very created.

1443
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Intentionally and specifically, and by mostly like one point of view.

1444
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,000
And a lot of Efteling was created by like one, you know,

1445
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
a director or whatever. I know you guys probably know the words better than I

1446
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
do, but like a creative director that.

1447
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
That implemented so much of it. You know what I mean? So it's,

1448
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
it's very special in that way.

1449
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
And I think it's very, very special.

1450
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
And I think it's very, very special.

1451
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
And I think it's very, very special.

1452
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
And I think it's very, very special.

1453
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
And I think it's very, very special.

1454
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Wow.

1455
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Wow.

1456
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
That sounds so up our alley.

1457
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,000
And also I'm excited to say, I found a video of this.

1458
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Look at that. That's it.

1459
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
That's the Efteling Gansun parade.

1460
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
I mean, it's, it's insane.

1461
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Truly. Yes.

1462
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
One.

1463
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
These are like mighty.

1464
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
I was going to say mighty ducks.

1465
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:34,000
I was organically going to say.

1466
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Like a bird, like a Mary Poppins bird with a,

1467
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
like a big drum contraption. Oh my God.

1468
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Wow.

1469
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
You're right on the money.

1470
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
It's magic.

1471
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Wow.

1472
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I had no idea there was that.

1473
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
So well, we'll have to break it up.

1474
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
We'll do the full Gansun parade episode.

1475
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Yeah.

1476
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,000
We didn't, it wasn't a best angle, but I mean, if the ducks are thick,

1477
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
you know, their seats.

1478
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Have to be thick.

1479
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Out of this world.

1480
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Have to be thick as well.

1481
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Now, now you got to, you've got to,

1482
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
you've got to Mr. Tato behind you.

1483
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
He doesn't want to see no seats.

1484
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
That's fair.

1485
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:13,000
They're, they're, they're behind.

1486
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Would he be okay with that?

1487
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
He's okay with the word.

1488
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
He just doesn't want to see them.

1489
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
He just doesn't want to say a duck, but even though duck,

1490
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
even the duck seats are not, unless you're married to those ducks.

1491
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Okay. That's fair.

1492
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Well, I will respect his wishes in this moment.

1493
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I hope one day Mr. Tato gets to see my duck, but

1494
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
you, you brought some things to the table before we wrap it up.

1495
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,000
There, there, there were some things you wanted to accomplish.

1496
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I created.

1497
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Yeah.

1498
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
So I created a little quiz for you guys, cause I was like,

1499
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
you guys are always doing the interviewing.

1500
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Maybe you need a little bit of newness in your life.

1501
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
You know what I mean?

1502
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
You get to be, Ooh, how can I answer these questions?

1503
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
So like, I love trivia.

1504
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
I love game shows.

1505
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:09,000
So I put together a little quiz kind of in the vein of like true or

1506
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
false. You know what I mean?

1507
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,000
You have a 50% choice either way.

1508
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:19,000
And because it's not about Tato park specifically,

1509
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
but it is about potatoes.

1510
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
So,

1511
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
you've got my attention.

1512
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:28,000
The name of this quiz is potato or Jason.

1513
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:33,000
So you're going to have to choose is the fact about a potato or is the

1514
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
fact about Jason.

1515
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
All right.

1516
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
And I'll just go round Robin style.

1517
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
So it'll go like Mike, Scott, Jason, Mike, Scott, Jason, Jason.

1518
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
You might have an unfair advantage, but you get to play.

1519
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
You would think though, you never know.

1520
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
You never know.

1521
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
You never know.

1522
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
You might not.

1523
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
You might not know.

1524
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Okay.

1525
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
So Mike, this one is for you.

1526
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Okay.

1527
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Go ahead.

1528
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Is a potato or Jason 80% water?

1529
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Good question.

1530
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Uh, I'm going to say,

1531
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
see it's how specific is this going to be?

1532
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
That's the question here.

1533
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I think it's a potato.

1534
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
It is a potato.

1535
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
That's a potato.

1536
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
That's a potato.

1537
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
That's a potato.

1538
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
That's a potato.

1539
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
That's a potato.

1540
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
That's a potato.

1541
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
That's a potato.

1542
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
That's a potato.

1543
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
It is a potato.

1544
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Jason is in fact 80% ice cream.

1545
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Well, yeah, that's accurate.

1546
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Of course.

1547
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Yes, of course.

1548
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Um, so this one's for you, Scott.

1549
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Did a potato or Jason fish for pond eels using little pieces of hot dog as bait?

1550
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Well, as much as I'd like to see Mr. Kato do that someday, I'm going to have to say that's Jason.

1551
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,000
That is Jason because potatoes know better.

1552
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Right.

1553
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,000
The pond eels like sharp cheddar cheese instead.

1554
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Jason, this one is for you.

1555
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:04,000
The largest one of these weighs in at seven point one pounds.

1556
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Is it a potato or is it a Jason?

1557
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:13,000
I'm going to have to go with potato on this one.

1558
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
That is that is correct.

1559
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
It is potato.

1560
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:23,000
But interestingly enough, Jason is in fact seven point one pounds potato.

1561
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Wow, I didn't know that.

1562
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Well, you know, we can take a look.

1563
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Yeah, makes sense.

1564
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:37,000
OK, Mike, as a child, did potatoes or Jason relish thumbing through used books down the shore?

1565
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
See, I think that's Jason.

1566
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I'd love to see a potato do the thumbing, but I believe Jason thought that is correct.

1567
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
It is Jason.

1568
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Potatoes cannot read.

1569
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Scott, this one is for you.

1570
01:35:50,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Did the United Nations dub the year 2008 the year of the potato or the year of the Jason?

1571
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Oh, I mean, as much as I want to give credit to whatever Jason was doing at the time, which I think was being a P.A.

1572
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:13,000
on American gladiators, I don't I don't think that would have been enough to get the UN's attention.

1573
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
So I will say potato.

1574
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
It is potato.

1575
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:28,000
But Jason declared 2008 the year of relaxing after doing all that laundry.

1576
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,000
OK, this is the best thing that's happened on the show.

1577
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Jason, this one is for you.

1578
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:44,000
My therapist calls laundry a non-preferred task.

1579
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:51,000
You just like said a Ziggy out loud.

1580
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Jason Sheridan is a real life Ziggy.

1581
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
That's another one that we never gotten to know.

1582
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:04,000
It's a way to help me keep things in perspective and not magnify little problems.

1583
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:11,000
It sounds like you got a good therapist and one that is, I don't know, on your rhythm or whatever.

1584
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Long suffering, I believe, is the term he uses.

1585
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Sounds great.

1586
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
OK, Jason, Jason, this one's for you.

1587
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Do potatoes or Jason's historically suffer from crippling hat headaches?

1588
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,000
I OK. OK. It was me.

1589
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Eventually, I just found out I had to drink more water.

1590
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I'm kind of a hat guy.

1591
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,000
I like my baseball caps now because I am sitting on top.

1592
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
So you got to do your best.

1593
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
You are correct. It was Jason.

1594
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Good job.

1595
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Yes, I hope those pork pies don't give you a potato headache.

1596
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Potatoes do know how to buy hats that fit them properly, though.

1597
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Mike, this one I have one more for each of you.

1598
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
This one's for you, Mike.

1599
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Were potatoes or Jason first domesticated eight thousand years ago in South America?

1600
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Huh? Domesticated is an interesting word I've never heard used for a vegetable or a fruit.

1601
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I'm going to say it's a potato, though.

1602
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
That is correct. It is a potato.

1603
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
As we all know, Jason is feral.

1604
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Would a domestic off the leash, baby?

1605
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:44,000
I mean, a domesticated man would not have the nickname The Carouser.

1606
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I want to just give a little context here.

1607
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Marissa is digging deep here for some old-school Jason Sheridan lore.

1608
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,000
We were calling him The Carouser about 10 years ago.

1609
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:07,000
And when he would get really hyped up about something, I would say like Wolverine, he was going feral.

1610
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I mean, the audience has to be eating this up, getting extra Jason lore, getting the Cuckoo Lane myth making one of the great, our modern day myth.

1611
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Jason.

1612
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
This one is for you, Scott.

1613
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Will keeping potatoes or Jason's in the dark too long cause them to become poisonous?

1614
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
I don't. Hmm.

1615
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:44,000
You have any Jason have dark preferences and does good poisonous mean like mentally?

1616
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Like will he become a very sharp tongue?

1617
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I don't know. I'm going to say it is potatoes.

1618
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Keeping Jason in the dark too long will just make him rammy, which is what his mother used to call him when he was too rambunctious.

1619
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Now that was that was one that everyone in my family said, like everyone uses this term.

1620
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:16,000
And that was one where like, I'm pretty sure kids would look at me sideways if I said like, oh, he seems a rammy.

1621
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I mean, it's crazy. It's great.

1622
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,000
That's I didn't I did not remember that one.

1623
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
That was a very good one.

1624
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
That's I didn't I did not remember that one.

1625
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
That was a really obscure one.

1626
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
That one just always stuck with me because it blew me away.

1627
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I think it's it's both adorable and confusing.

1628
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Sure.

1629
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
We've got to pull that into the oh my God.

1630
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Like like we might just just file that away because we'll be able to call it Jason is being ramby.

1631
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

1632
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
That counterpoint you were wrong.

1633
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I think we're in the wrong episode.

1634
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
That was a big ramby.

1635
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,000
If only we had the term.

1636
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Okay, Jason, this is the last one.

1637
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Okay.

1638
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Did a potato or Jason inspire the mascot at Tato Park?

1639
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Oh, I think it is going to have to be a delicious potato.

1640
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Oh, Jason, it's actually Jason.

1641
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:28,000
That little potato in a hat definitely has a hat headache.

1642
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Is that why he's like getting in other people's business?

1643
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
He's like he's ramby, baby.

1644
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
He's ramby. He's ramby.

1645
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
He's wound up.

1646
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
He's not addressing the actual problem.

1647
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
He's just projecting so much laundry.

1648
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Tato's got so much laundry.

1649
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Well, he has the clothes to hand out to those underdressed people.

1650
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,000
It's just got laundry hanging out everywhere.

1651
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Out of sight, out of mind is what I say.

1652
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:59,000
You should start giving your laundry away like Tato.

1653
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
That was so delightful.

1654
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
That was fantastic.

1655
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,000
I have thought we should eventually do a full roast of Jason Sheridan,

1656
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
but I don't think we need to do it now.

1657
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
I'll come back for it if you do it.

1658
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
I think.

1659
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Tato Park, aka the roast of Jason Sheridan.

1660
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:24,000
And you know, not only that, but it's like if the listener is thinking now,

1661
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Marissa has brought more to the table than many, many guests do.

1662
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Not only that, we have items in front of us.

1663
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,000
We have physical items in front of us.

1664
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:40,000
And keep in mind, listener, that this is still quarantine time,

1665
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
so physical items are harder to do.

1666
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Marissa, you drove around town leaving.

1667
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
You were a real Santa.

1668
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
You were a three-stop Santa.

1669
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Thank you.

1670
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Tell us what's going on here.

1671
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,000
So these are gifts for you guys kind of to celebrate this quiz.

1672
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
I don't know.

1673
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I bought them for you guys a year ago and figured I'd give them to you

1674
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
guys.

1675
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I'm not sure I came back on the podcast, so, um,

1676
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,000
there's just a little gift. You guys can open them now.

1677
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Oh, not only that, but you drew, there's a little, there's a Mr. Tato.

1678
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:21,000
On the don't know that it's recent. I knew what I was doing.

1679
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Take a picture before I open it.

1680
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Please don't open the recording.

1681
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
It's a mini Christmas.

1682
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Oh, wow.

1683
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Did we all do we all get the same thing?

1684
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Yeah.

1685
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Whoa.

1686
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Cool.

1687
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Do not disturb from Disneyland Paris.

1688
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Yeah.

1689
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,000
That's the Hollywood Tower Hotel in Disneyland Paris.

1690
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Wow.

1691
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Wow.

1692
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Wow.

1693
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Um,

1694
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
anyone feel confident enough to say the French version and the do not disturb

1695
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
and then on the other side,

1696
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Nippa deranger.

1697
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Maybe pretty good French in high school.

1698
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:04,000
This is great because this is obvious.

1699
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
This is a gift.

1700
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,000
This you didn't steal this from because obviously it's Hollywood Tower on it.

1701
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
You didn't stay.

1702
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000
That's the ride.

1703
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
That's not the hotel.

1704
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
I'm not telling.

1705
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
No, I bought them.

1706
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
I bought them.

1707
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Oh, okay.

1708
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Oh my gosh.

1709
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Thank you.

1710
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
This is good.

1711
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:23,000
You put this on your door when you're either sleeping or what I've understood

1712
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
in the last couple of weeks, making love.

1713
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,000
It's a new thing I've learned about.

1714
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Are you talking about like a song in a dorm room?

1715
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:33,000
I mean, yes, I was reading about that version of it as well.

1716
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
But wait, Mike, you had sex for the first time due to this European.

1717
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
I didn't say that.

1718
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
I just said I'm learning about it.

1719
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
I'm just saying,

1720
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:44,000
understanding how it all works now because of the,

1721
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
the character development I'm having on the saga.

1722
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
You know that it's a thing that people do.

1723
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
That's what made you exist on this earth.

1724
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Exactly.

1725
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
I'm figuring you out.

1726
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:59,000
But you're saying that you learned that people put this on before you at a

1727
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
hotel, you're saying.

1728
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Yes, sure.

1729
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Oh, I thought you met in your regular life.

1730
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
I see.

1731
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Well, I may use it in my regular life.

1732
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Tell the dead.

1733
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Deadbolt too, for good measure folks.

1734
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
You know, better safe than sorry.

1735
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Can the dog, can the dog read this?

1736
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
I know.

1737
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I know.

1738
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
I know.

1739
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I know.

1740
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
I know.

1741
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,000
I know.

1742
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,000
I know.

1743
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Can the dog read this?

1744
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
I don't know how smart is your dog.

1745
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
You have average dog intelligence.

1746
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:31,000
All the dogs, no dogs, no English, but all dogs, no French.

1747
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
That's true.

1748
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
This is incredible.

1749
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
And then you bought this a while back,

1750
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:43,000
but that you've given it to us during a European vacation episode.

1751
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
You've brought, you brought gifts from Europe.

1752
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:48,000
This is so appreciated and so appropriate.

1753
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Yeah.

1754
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Thank you.

1755
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Thank you.

1756
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:55,000
That's, that's just kind of a, you know, amazing coincidence, but yeah,

1757
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
I just saw them and they were,

1758
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:02,000
it was like right after our Hollywood tower of terror changed.

1759
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,000
So,

1760
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Oh yeah.

1761
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
So it was more, it's a, it's a rarity now.

1762
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Yeah.

1763
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
They, they still got it.

1764
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Yeah.

1765
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Geez.

1766
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Well, this is wonderful.

1767
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
I, I,

1768
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:17,000
is it any, any parting words we want to say here in an episode that was

1769
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
slightly about a potato theme park?

1770
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Anyway,

1771
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,000
I got their final,

1772
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
the last of our things to fit in.

1773
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Jason seems to have a iPad out.

1774
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,000
He's got facts maybe at the ready.

1775
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Just rest in peace, Bobby Sands and God save Jerry Adams.

1776
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,000
All right.

1777
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,000
All right.

1778
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Here's, here's maybe like a nice transcendent note to go out on.

1779
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
When we were on topic in this episode,

1780
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:51,000
we mostly talked about the man, not the partners.

1781
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,000
And if that seems like an odd amount of weight to put on a character,

1782
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
you know, just some silly mascot.

1783
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:01,000
It seems like in Ireland, he's very well regarded.

1784
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,000
As I said, you know, they ran him for office and people actually voted for

1785
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
him.

1786
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
They did this.

1787
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Can we say the end of the, of the,

1788
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
the campaign of the Mrs. Tato campaign?

1789
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I think what happened is somebody said,

1790
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,000
They couldn't figure out a satisfying here's, here's what would the end,

1791
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
the end of this would be.

1792
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
They just said, he's not ready to settle down yet.

1793
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,000
That's good for me.

1794
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Yes.

1795
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Great news.

1796
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
You're still in the game.

1797
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:29,000
I got really scared for a second.

1798
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Nope. They didn't.

1799
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:35,000
The official company say that is cannon that use, you can still have.

1800
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
He is a, so he is very beloved.

1801
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Not only that, this was a quote that I saw in an article about him on

1802
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Prospect magazine.

1803
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Okay.

1804
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,000
If you want to portray Irishness in pop culture in 2020,

1805
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Tato and Mr.

1806
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Tato in 2020,

1807
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
you can still have him.

1808
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
And then you can still have him.

1809
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,000
And then you can still have him.

1810
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
And then you can still have him.

1811
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
And then you can still have him.

1812
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
And then you can still have him.

1813
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
And then you can still have him.

1814
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Yeah.

1815
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,320
You're not going to stayGenius,

1816
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:02,000
no.

1817
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
I think Choi is pretty curious.

1818
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
That is important because something that is happening.

1819
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Almost曝

1820
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
so this is a journalist saying that they want to do away with the

1821
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
data.

1822
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Wow.

1823
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Hell yes.

1824
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,000
This is

1825
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,000
coming from us.

1826
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:35,000
I'm just, I'm reading a quote, but I can't help it, but agree.

1827
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
This.

1828
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Yeah.

1829
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:42,000
That seems like something we would say a little bit joking, but this was

1830
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:46,000
the kind of point we would end an episode on, but they kind of, they did it

1831
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,000
for it.

1832
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
This is vetted.

1833
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,000
This is a professional writer who see what actually is from there.

1834
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:58,000
I'm guessing that's the entire country of Ireland is really seeing you guys

1835
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,000
and me by association as heroes right now.

1836
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:05,000
So I think, you know, congratulations.

1837
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:11,000
We're freeing them of they've, they've been shackled to this, like this

1838
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
stereotypical imagery for so long.

1839
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:18,000
And then this, this article from 2020, us doing this, it's going to be that

1840
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
article first.

1841
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:23,000
And then this podcast episode are really the things that just open it up for

1842
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Ireland and really be themselves.

1843
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
And here's what I think.

1844
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
I think we need to expand Tato.

1845
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Let's get Tato out here and let's have an American version of the mascot.

1846
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Obviously we're talking about Jason doing Tato's voice, but maybe, maybe that's

1847
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
sacrilegious cause he's an American.

1848
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Let's have Tato Jr.

1849
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Much like nut junior is in America.

1850
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:47,000
We're all having, we're having junior fever as far as mascots are concerned.

1851
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Jason Sheridan is Tato Jr.

1852
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,000
The American version of this character.

1853
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:57,000
And let's bring Tato crisps into America so we can all enjoy this nice snack.

1854
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:01,000
I just speaking of Tato Jr.

1855
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
I love this idea.

1856
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:08,000
I wanted to bring this up to there's a Japanese potato mascot that I think Tato

1857
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
would be friends with.

1858
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
And now to me looks like Tato Jr.

1859
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,000
So, cause it feels like baby new year a little bit to me.

1860
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:19,000
If you guys would look up Kalbi potato chips, you'll see a delightful little

1861
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
mascot that I think Tato would approve of.

1862
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Kalbi.

1863
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Kalbi up here.

1864
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Oh boy.

1865
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
He's in a sash.

1866
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:31,000
He's in a sash and the same proportion of hat.

1867
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:35,000
And he's, he's like, he's running for office.

1868
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
He's like a little mayor.

1869
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
He's like a little mayor.

1870
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
He's like a little mayor.

1871
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
He's running for office.

1872
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
He's like a little mayor.

1873
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:47,000
This is so Jason S.

1874
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Great.

1875
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Wow.

1876
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Kalbi.

1877
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,000
You know what?

1878
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:56,000
I don't even shit about Tato anymore.

1879
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Kalbi is my new man.

1880
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Yeah.

1881
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Hey, delete this episode.

1882
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:07,000
You have to go spend money for Kalbi's PDF.

1883
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Yeah.

1884
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
I want to see if Kalbi's autobiography exists.

1885
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I will, I don't care what it takes.

1886
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
I will.

1887
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
All my credit cards can be stolen.

1888
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:21,000
You'll give money to Ugandan princes in order to read the story of this potato mayor.

1889
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Kalbi is my man.

1890
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,000
I think it's president vice president situate.

1891
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:29,000
It's just figuring out which is which, you know, Kalbi Tato.

1892
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
There we go.

1893
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
How about.

1894
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:35,000
And well, then let me ask if that's the case, I don't want to throw too much of a wrench

1895
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:41,000
into this, but I feel like we have to find at least a cabinet position for the mascot

1896
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:48,000
of Americana and brand mainstay potato corner.

1897
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:54,000
This guy, if we've seen him before, his name is spudster.

1898
01:51:54,000 --> 01:52:02,000
So spudster is makes great use of the airbrush tool and Photoshop, as well as the stroke

1899
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
tool.

1900
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
I've seen many of them.

1901
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:08,000
He's got inner layers, outer layers.

1902
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,000
He looks like a turd.

1903
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Let's be honest.

1904
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Oh, he does.

1905
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
He looks like a pellet.

1906
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
He's nice to spudster.

1907
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Yeah, he's like a.

1908
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
I'm a whole I'm into Kalbi now.

1909
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
I don't care about any of these other potatoes.

1910
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
I like spudster.

1911
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Spudster is a threat.

1912
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
I'm into spudster.

1913
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
I think his name could use some work.

1914
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,000
But other than that.

1915
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Full first thought.

1916
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Yeah.

1917
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I think I could stand for him to get a little gra.

1918
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Actually, he has a graphic redo because this is very airbrushy.

1919
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:43,000
But if I go down here, you'll see that in some recent art in which he's promoting social

1920
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:49,000
distancing and there are two spudsters who are six feet apart, though also in the middle

1921
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,000
of a street.

1922
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:56,000
And while they are practicing social distancing, they also may both get plowed down by a car.

1923
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
And there are two people behind them that are very close.

1924
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:03,000
No man.

1925
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Yeah.

1926
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Hang on.

1927
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
All right.

1928
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,000
You know what, Kalbi?

1929
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,000
All right.

1930
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Fucks buster.

1931
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
This guy's morally in the wrong.

1932
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Kalbi's great.

1933
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Mr. Tato is great.

1934
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Marissa Strickland is great.

1935
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,000
You survived.

1936
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I guess the ride.

1937
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Thanks for being here and bringing so much to the table.

1938
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Yeah, thank you.

1939
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
This is delightful.

1940
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,000
It's actually through the gift shop.

1941
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Is there anything else you want to say?

1942
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,000
I'm going to go to the end of the video.

1943
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,000
I'm going to go to the end of the video.

1944
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
I'm going to go to the end of the video.

1945
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,000
I'm going to go to the end of the video.

1946
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
I'm going to go to the end of the video.

1947
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I'm going to go to the end of the video.

1948
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
So would you like to do a giveaway?

1949
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Yeah, I would be happy to.

1950
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,000
We could do one for you if you want to.

1951
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Yeah, yes, we could.

1952
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Oh, so on the first one is you can buy something.

1953
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
I can buy something.

1954
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
We could do it.

1955
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Yeah.

1956
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Let's do it.

1957
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
So where would you like it to go?

1958
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,000
The gift shop, is there anything you'd like to plug?

1959
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
No, but I'd encourage everybody to vote.

1960
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Sure,

1961
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Sure,

1962
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Yes, indeed.

1963
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
If there's a Tato campaign specifically.

1964
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Right.

1965
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,000
You're saying,

1966
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Right at Tato.

1967
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Right in Tato in November, please.

1968
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
And right into

1969
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Mr.

1970
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Tato finds love.

1971
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
My name Marissa Strickland,

1972
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Hopefully I'll fucking become a married Tato one day.

1973
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Wait a minute.

1974
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Look at this.

1975
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:03,000
We're getting our passport stamped as we have at every step of our European vacation,

1976
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,000
kaklunk.

1977
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,000
And look at that.

1978
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
It's Mr.

1979
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Tato himself,

1980
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:10,000
his beautiful eyes staring right at you.

1981
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,000
And he's holding out a wedding ring.

1982
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
It's for you.

1983
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
For you, Marissa.

1984
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
That's our passport stamp.

1985
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:19,000
What do you say?

1986
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
I do.

1987
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Yay.

1988
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:32,000
With rice being thrown at you from your childhood cabinet.

1989
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,000
I'm not there.

1990
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
I'm hanging out with Kelby.

1991
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:39,000
I'm upset about the wedding.

1992
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Kelby would have been better for you, I think.

1993
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,000
So anyone tracking continuity in this episode?

1994
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Well,

1995
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
I got a couple of things to say.

1996
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,000
I'm going to start off by saying that I am not a married Tato.

1997
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
I'm married to Mr.

1998
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Tato.

1999
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,000
And I,

2000
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
I am married to Mr.

2001
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Tato.

2002
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
And I know the concept of intercourse.

2003
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
I understand what it is.

2004
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Intellectually,

2005
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,000
just intellectually.

2006
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
I'm saying, I'm saying,

2007
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,000
I'm discussing.

2008
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Kelby's telling you what it's like because he's not approved.

2009
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Like Mr.

2010
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Tato.

2011
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
It's not like I'm going to be doing it.

2012
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,000
It's like,

2013
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
I'm not going to be doing it.

2014
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
I'm going to be doing it.

2015
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
And he's got a couple of different things to do.

2016
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
And he's got his brother's VCR.

2017
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
And he's showing me some stuff.

2018
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,000
It's got the two spots for two tapes.

2019
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:33,000
So we can make you a coffee.

2020
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Wow.

2021
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:37,000
An episode.

2022
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Full of mythology.

2023
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
And a whole lot of fun.

2024
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
So.

2025
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
So,

2026
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
we're going to have a little bit of a break.

2027
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
And then we'll get back to you.

2028
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
As for us, we will continue.

2029
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
The pockets Reds, European vacation.

2030
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
We're heading back over.

2031
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
What's between Ireland and.

2032
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Europe.

2033
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
What's the.

2034
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,000
English channel.

2035
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Great.

2036
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
I know.

2037
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Smart guy.

2038
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
And yeah, we're heading back over.

2039
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
I don't want to give any.

2040
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Clues.

2041
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
I guess.

2042
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
You know,

2043
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
I think it's going to be a little bit of a break.

2044
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
We're going to have a little bit of a break.

2045
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
So we're going to have a little bit of a break.

2046
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Where we will be doing our,

2047
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
the last of our little day trips.

2048
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
And I'll say.

2049
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
What's, what's a good clue.

2050
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
We're going to deal with some.

2051
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Some IP.

2052
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,000
That's all that I'll say.

2053
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:24,000
It's a, my, some IP will be discussed.

2054
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
And then we'll, we'll wrap up the main show on Friday.

2055
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,000
It's been.

2056
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,000
It's been a lot of fun.

2057
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Fun vacation.

2058
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
And as always check us out on Twitter, Instagram.

2059
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Facebook.

2060
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
And Twitter.

2061
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,000
It's a great place.

2062
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
I think we're going to have a little bit of a break.

2063
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,000
We're going to have a little bit of a break.

2064
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,000
So we'll read the last two.

2065
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Three.

2066
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,000
The last three.

2067
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Are the last four.

2068
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Let's see.

2069
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Does Mr.

2070
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Tato have a way to say goodbye?

2071
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Say goodbye.

2072
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Mr.

2073
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Or Tato Jr.

2074
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Oh.

2075
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Here.

2076
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
I'll just do, I'll just find the whole.

2077
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,000
The whole of the rest of the old Irish.

2078
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
What the old parable.

2079
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
No, no.

2080
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
W H.

2081
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
W H.

2082
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
So does Mr.

2083
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Tato.

2084
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,000
And Mr.

2085
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Tato.

2086
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,000
You shine warm upon your face and rains fall soft upon your fields.

2087
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,600
And may we, until we meet again.

2088
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:14,840
May God hold you in the palm of his hand, like he could hold one in the

2089
01:57:14,840 --> 01:57:17,400
poem, like he could hold a recommendation.

2090
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:18,400
Yeah.

2091
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:21,760
Of classic salt and vinegar Tato crisps.

2092
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:22,760
Me.

2093
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:23,760
Tato crisps.

2094
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:24,760
Yay.

2095
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:25,760
Beautiful.

2096
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:26,760
Everyone give Mr.

2097
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:31,760
Tato a round of applause at home or wherever you're doing this.

2098
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:32,760
Thanks for listening everybody.

2099
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:35,760
Talk to you next week.

2100
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:36,760
Bye.

2101
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:41,480
Well, before we go, I just want to give a quick shout out and plug to the show Infinity

2102
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:43,400
Train, which is on HBO Max.

2103
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:47,480
It is a very cool cartoon about a weird train.

2104
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:49,840
It's got a bunch of weird, cool cars.

2105
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:50,960
There's adventures.

2106
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:52,200
There's fun.

2107
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:57,760
There's colors and there's sadness, but it's like good sadness, heartstring tugging

2108
01:57:57,760 --> 01:57:58,760
sadness.

2109
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:01,000
I mean, this is why we watch TV folks.

2110
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:05,000
You will like it if you like this show and you like all the same nonsense that we like

2111
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,420
this show.

2112
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:10,480
One of the writers, of course, is Lindsay Katai, who is a friend of the show.

2113
01:58:10,480 --> 01:58:12,960
He's a friend of my heart.

2114
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:19,120
We would appreciate it if you checked it out, stream it on HBO Max, you know, whenever you

2115
01:58:19,120 --> 01:58:20,400
have time.

2116
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:21,640
Do it at night, do it in the morning.

2117
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:22,640
It doesn't matter.

2118
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:23,640
See you next week.

2119
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:24,640
Forever.

2120
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:25,640
