1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,080
Warning, the following podcast contains puffy buildings, safety concerns, lady animals, and

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,000
Walt Disney's cartoon double life.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,400
All that plus we're talking Toontown on today's podcast.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,800
It's a ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,040
Welcome to podcast the ride hosted by three guys who would typically spend any amount of

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,800
money at a Disneyland prop auction but might skip out on bidding on a bunch of peed on acorns.

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,160
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Jason Sheridan.

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,160
Hi.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,400
I am after we introduce our third host going to ask for clarification on what you're talking

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
about.

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,320
You know what I'm talking, wait a minute.

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,160
You probably know, Mike Carlson, hi.

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,600
Peed on acorns, yes.

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,480
I think I know what you're talking about.

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,880
I'm saying that there will, we're going to today talk about a bunch of stuff that used

18
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,200
to be at Mickey's Toontown.

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
Okay.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,240
Which is closed, has just closed this very week.

21
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,800
And we're reminiscing about the things that aren't there and haven't been there for a

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
very long time.

23
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,480
And among those things, there was a thing called Chip and Dale's Acorn Crawl.

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
Oh, right.

25
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,680
And it was a ball pit where you had a bunch of, you went in a bunch of acorns and presumably,

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,280
I don't know what became of the acorns, where they all left this precious Disney memorabilia.

27
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,120
But you can only imagine that the acorns, a lot of them at some point were peed on.

28
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,200
Now I was just looking for clarification.

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,120
Context clues kind of led me to that.

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,200
That was probably what you were talking about.

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,160
But I was just making sure that wasn't a famous like, and this is the spot they painted yellow

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,240
because it's next to Pluto's dog house or something.

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,600
Oh, was there a pee?

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,760
Yeah, maybe there was a pee joke.

35
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,800
Maybe there like, there's a Laugh-O-Gram Walt's first movie studio.

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,120
Like, like maybe there was a pee Easter egg, like a Laugh-O-Gram logo.

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,400
One of the early shorts was pee crazy and it was just a bunch of barnyard animals all

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,800
bobbing up and down with music.

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,800
As they all like sprayed wobbly 20s cartoon lines of urine.

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,080
The innovations from that, he was able to do that horrifying Alice in Wonderland live action,

42
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,960
live action animated series.

43
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,040
Was it legal in the 20s to animate piss?

44
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,200
Was that, was there a law on the books back then that you could actually show urine?

45
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,720
I don't know.

46
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,720
I maybe wasn't.

47
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,320
Is it maybe there?

48
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,440
Well, the rules have to have been different for the animal.

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,240
I think.

50
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,760
That's true.

51
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,640
Yeah, fair enough.

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,080
Human urine, probably.

53
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,400
But even just sitting in the bowl.

54
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,480
Maybe, maybe that's why.

55
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,160
Oh man.

56
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,600
Were all the animals and the cars and the buildings bouncing up and down to distract

57
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,160
all the like stationary piss drawings you're saying?

58
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,000
I am saying that, yeah.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,400
Well, now we've alienated any new listener.

60
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,200
It's not usually about cartoons of bowls of piss from the 1920s.

61
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,800
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:27,800
It's where we got to quickly hear as we talk about this children's play area and land.

63
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:35,520
That is, has closed down this very week several days ago, I believe, for a big refurbishment

64
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:42,600
all in preparation for the new Disneyland ride, Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway.

65
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,880
That's going to put some new life into Mickey's Toon Town and they're building a whole new

66
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,880
facade for that.

67
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,840
That's already been under construction, but also in preparation, they're revamp the whole

68
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,560
land and take over some kind of dormant areas and refresh them, make them nicer.

69
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,680
So we're losing Mickey's Toon Town for about a year or so.

70
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,320
And today we wanted to talk about what we're losing, what we have just lost this week.

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,360
Has it been a mournful week for all of us?

72
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Oh yeah.

73
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,160
Although my discovery was that I must have missed the fine print in some of the posts

74
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,680
about the new Toon Town that's coming.

75
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,560
A lot of it coming back.

76
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

77
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,280
With fresh coats of paints and little...

78
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
Oh, I think so.

79
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,080
No, I think it's ultimately pretty minor, I would say.

80
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
Yeah.

81
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:37,360
But yeah, well, if you look at the art that exists, the kind of vague art of what is coming,

82
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,760
what they're changing, not a lot is gone entirely.

83
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,800
And I don't know that they've even clarified every little thing and what the fate of it

84
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,360
is, but most things are staying, I would say.

85
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah, this feels like one of those where they're going to hype up something as a real fresh

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,160
coat of...

87
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,600
Not fresh coat of paint, that's actually even minimizing, but they're hyping something up

88
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,120
as a re-imagining of the area.

89
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,480
And you're like, hey, this is the same place.

90
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,920
This is just a little bit less decaying.

91
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,160
It looks a little bit better than it did.

92
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,080
Yeah, a little more green space and a couple more play areas.

93
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,880
I think that's come up a few times.

94
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:24,960
Like, yeah, little kids love play areas and they keep bulldozing it to build like e-tickets,

95
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,600
but little kids, regardless of technological innovation, still like to climb and run through

96
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
things.

97
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,800
Yes, yeah.

98
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,520
Which is odd that they're having to make this adjustment now because it feels like Toontown,

99
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:49,800
as built and opened in 1993, was kind of a kid run around, jump around play area and

100
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,480
sort of a thriving one, I feel, for a little bit.

101
00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:00,120
But then very quickly, every single landmark in it got lawyered out, right?

102
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,080
And got like legalized out of existence to where it became a progressively less and

103
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,560
less fun land.

104
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:14,240
Yes, as you were talking about ball pits, tree house, tree house only for children.

105
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,280
An adult couldn't fit in that tree house, right?

106
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,200
I think I may have gone up into that tree house.

107
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
As an adult?

108
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
I believe so.

109
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Oh, okay.

110
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,600
Yeah, for no reason and with nothing to do because it was a tree house that was supposed

111
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,040
a slide once and that was it and now that hasn't been there in a long time so it's just

112
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,400
a flight of stairs.

113
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:39,120
Right, so okay, so you did go, because obviously this is closed for a few years now, this Chip

114
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,400
and Dale, we're talking about the, what is it, Chip and Dale's, what is it called?

115
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Chip and Dale Tree House.

116
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,040
Thank you, yes.

117
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,240
So that's been closed for a while, I believe.

118
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
Yes.

119
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,560
But then what was the slide part of it called?

120
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,960
It was the Chip and Dale Tree slide before it just became generic even though if you

121
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:05,800
look closely on the sign it's still Chip going down a slide and Dale crawling with some acorns

122
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,080
so they still, they're doing things that you yourself could not do.

123
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:18,480
Right, so yeah, that's one of those things where you see an old artifact of Disneyland

124
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,880
that's still kind of standing, that is still standing and then you can't do it, like they

125
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,640
have, they still for many years while we were going had the Skyway station kind of in the

126
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,680
back, you would have to know where it was but it's still kind of like taunting me so

127
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,840
I do feel when I would go to Toontown I go well I can't go in this anymore but it's right

128
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,920
here, this is an experience I didn't get to have.

129
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:45,080
Well yeah and the, I mean even, maybe even bigger than the tree house was the Jolly Trolley

130
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,360
which is now just parked and it's like oh it's a mode of transit, it just goes around

131
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
the land.

132
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,440
Yeah, was it the, okay so yeah if you don't know what we're talking about the Jolly Trolley,

133
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,520
is it from Roger Rabbit is the design?

134
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,360
I don't know if it's ever been in anything necessarily but it's Roger Rabbit-esque.

135
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:09,520
Yeah right, but it's just basically just a big, it's not, I guess it's a trolley.

136
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,200
It's a trolley, I think in the early days it would kind of bounce up and down like we're

137
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,400
talking about the old Fleischer cartoons and old Mickey cartoons.

138
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Yeah it kind of wobbled back and forth so it was not just, it was like the streetcars

139
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,560
on Main Street but more cartoonified with its wobble and it's back and forth, it was

140
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:35,520
a silly little ride that you would take but then there were two conjoined trolleys and

141
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,680
the second one would sometimes derail or get disconnected from the other so they stopped

142
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,120
doing that so it just became the one but then that was just for anybody driving it, it was

143
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:52,560
just a constant honk honk, I don't know if it was a cartoon honk to get people out of

144
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,200
the way, more of a auga but it only takes you through places where pedestrians already

145
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,600
are which is a common thing in Disneyland by the way, rides that just go over where

146
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,120
pedestrians, those must all be so frustrating for the, you know Main Street or the trolley

147
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,360
that's now in California Adventure, you got to just, your whole job is just yelling at people

148
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,000
to get out of the way. For like 60 years they've just been like okay we're gonna take a horse and

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,040
we're gonna walk it through a bunch of people, like we're gonna make this horse walk through

150
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,440
a crowd and they've been doing that every day since the park has been open basically or?

151
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,720
Psychologically I think the Main Street trolley and the California Adventure trolley, the size

152
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,520
is much bigger and certainly when you have one of those massive horses pulling it, people I think

153
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,720
more naturally get out of the way, the Jolly Trolley a little compact to convince people to

154
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:50,000
move you know? That's interesting, can I ask you as a man who likes a slow mode of transportation,

155
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,720
trolley versus train, is it just that a train takes can go a very far length at far distance?

156
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:05,680
Oh I think, I think trolley's tend to be more like open air, although I tend to be above ground.

157
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:13,040
Isn't it about how they're powered in a way? Yeah the lines above. Yes or below potentially.

158
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,480
Because there are, I think Philadelphia, the the SEPTA transit system has like a subway,

159
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,680
but there are above ground trolley cars that are enclosed. The trolley at the Americana? Yes,

160
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,960
yeah that's a trolley. Correct, yeah and nothing is pulling it, like it's its own, it's either

161
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,360
getting its power I don't know where it actually is. Is it a little, how is the Americana trolley

162
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,680
powered? Small nuclear engine in the base of the car. Yeah that could blow any day, you gotta be

163
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,600
careful. Yeah so interesting, well I look, we'll do some research into this and we'll come back

164
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,240
to trolley versus train. But do you have a, I mean you like, you like trolleys and trains and

165
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,840
twains as in riverboating. That's true, I like all of them. I think I like trains because like

166
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:08,160
they're nice, nice and long. It's a long, I like to get comfortable. I love the train from the

167
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,680
surf, the Pacific surf liner that runs the coast of California. Yes. Santa Barbara down to San Diego

168
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,640
and many stops in between. Terrific. Yeah. So you, it is really, you're, you really subscribe to the,

169
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,800
it's the journey not the destination sort of philosophy of life. Like literally, you more,

170
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:35,120
you like the journey itself. Oh yeah I love a long train trip. I love a, I like a long flight if

171
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,680
everything's going well. If like you know. You like a long flight? That's crazy. I like, I like,

172
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,600
I hate to flight shame you here but that's insane. If no one is kicking my seat and children aren't

173
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:54,000
screaming and adults aren't being children. Yeah it's, you can just sit and read a book,

174
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,960
you know, you can kind of watch, you can watch movies. You aren't really connected unless you

175
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,320
pay for the internet. You're not really like. Yeah I know what you mean. I've gotten like good

176
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:11,520
little stretches of writing or reading and you know if the alcohol situation isn't crazy expensive

177
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,960
you can like, it can be kind of a good like, all right, you tune everything out and

178
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,400
unplug a little bit. Yeah there's been plane rides around, I was like I think I specifically

179
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:29,200
enjoyed that ride. Not often but. I'm trying to, I'm struggling. Maybe the flight to Japan was,

180
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,520
on Japan Airlines was. Not back. We know back was not good. No we've heard, we've heard from me

181
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:43,200
before back was not good. But still no I am not a big fan of flying. You're also a taller man.

182
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,560
I am yeah. So this is a rougher situation for you. I just fit in the overhead compartment so it's

183
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,760
kind of a different, if I roll up in them all. You've stowed away on planes before. I've stowed away.

184
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,480
Put me in a crate. It's a whole con when we took, when we went to Del Close Marathon we

185
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,880
got a big suitcase and we did a whole con. Yes well yeah. I just rolled you onto the runway and

186
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,680
a guy threw you onto the plane. Yeah well because that was a you know a fix because I was on your

187
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,720
shoulders and we were wearing very long trench coat. That's true. I don't know. They found that out.

188
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,960
It didn't make sense because we were a nine and a half foot tall, 10 and a half foot tall man.

189
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,120
Yeah. It's believable I would think. That's usually for two children. I don't know why we

190
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,760
tried that. That didn't make any sense. Yeah. You're lucky those basketball players were also on the

191
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,400
plane. Yeah. It assumed you were on the team. We had a big trench coat but then a big basketball

192
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,360
jersey over the trench coat and they went ah basketball player. Yeah but we picked the

193
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:46,000
Clippers were on the team and we had the 76ers jersey on. So that gave us away. That was a big

194
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,840
mistake too. So yeah so there was a Jolly Trolley which is honestly a name I don't even, I'm sure

195
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,120
I've heard it before but then I was looking through this and I was like oh Jolly Trolley

196
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,720
okay. I guess that is a good name I think. You know it's one of those that looked really good

197
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,960
in the opening promotional footage seeing this trolley wobbling around instead of crazy eyes

198
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,800
and was bright and colorful and then it just sort of slowly stopped. That's a weird, it's such a

199
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:22,400
cursed land in a way. Yeah. Where I feel lucky because I did get to go in the first year of it

200
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:31,200
so I did get to see pristine, perfect, out of the box Toontown and then just bit by bit it all kind

201
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:38,320
of went away. It's not without its charms now but it does need this refresh pretty badly I'd say.

202
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,880
Yeah. Yeah. When it first opened I remembered it being featured in like Disney Channel specials

203
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:52,240
or parades or what have you and it was one of those feelings as a kid like the Indiana Jones

204
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,360
ride where I was like well I'm very jealous because I'll never get to go there. Wow. You know.

205
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,400
That was one of those. That was with me. That was my thing. Yeah. Yeah I said never ever. I've said

206
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,880
this many times on this show. Yeah Toontown was one where I went oh my goodness this is the coolest

207
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,000
thing. I'll never go. Why would we ever go to California? Yeah and that was the real Toontown.

208
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,200
I mean there was Toontown Fair. Right in which we talked about. Which had a million meets.

209
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,480
Mickey's birthday land. We did that. Yeah. Before. I saw that show. I loved that. I loved smelling the

210
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,520
burnt cake at the end of the show when the cake got screwed up. I mean I didn't like that. I didn't

211
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,680
like that there was an error. I didn't like there was a problem but I would prefer that it's the

212
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,680
cake got baked. I have a question. Did we do Mickey's birthday land? Here's okay Scott. I also. It's

213
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,720
getting real. I also had the exact same thought. I go wait a minute. Wait a minute. We did. We did

214
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,120
Mini Moo. Yes. And that's where. Oh that's why. We broke off just the cow that had a Mickey

215
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:54,080
Mariah shape on the side. We clearly haven't done the land. I had the same thought. But we broke off the cow so you don't have to

216
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,840
cover the cow for 45 minutes. Just to clarify Michael it went Mickey's birthday land became Mickey's star

217
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:05,360
land. Mickey's star land. Did we do Mickey's star land? No. No. We didn't. We have so much more of the shit to go.

218
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,160
And then it briefly became Mickey's toy land and then eventually became. Mickey's toilet land?

219
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,960
Toy land. Oh I wish it was Mickey's toilet land. More pee content. And then finally Mickey's Toontown

220
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:23,360
Fair before you know closed. I could see Bob Jay back tomorrow. I'm announcing Mickey's toilet land.

221
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,440
An exciting new endeavor with the American Standard Company of Toilet Makers.

222
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,920
Would not be out of character for him. Okay so we have not done. Okay because I had the exact same. I

223
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,080
went man we really I thought we did it. But okay. No we got a lot more Mickey diving to do. We quietly just did.

224
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:46,080
We hit what 250 episodes or something. Yeah. Yeah. But it's does it feel meaningless with the second

225
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:52,720
gate and like where do you even. Yes. Yeah. I don't know if that counts.

226
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,840
I'm saying it yes. Oh life. Everything yeah. Somebody tell us if it's 500 and you're sure it's 500.

227
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,120
We'll try to or tell us when it's 497 and then we'll try to. We'll try to do a thing when.

228
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,760
Acknowledge it. Yeah. In some way besides that. Okay. I can't keep track of that. I can't keep

229
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,560
track of what we've covered. Here's a confusing thing also about birthday land is that it has

230
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,480
come up before because here's what we have done. We've done Roger Rabbit. We did an episode.

231
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,840
I know we did it. For sure. We did an episode a little over a year ago I think about Mickey's

232
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,720
house in Toontown. Yes. Which also kind of covers. Of course. There was a Mickey's house in birthday land.

233
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,280
Now something that has come up many many times and that I make a point of bringing up as much

234
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,280
as possible is a special where they take you around Mickey's birthday land and you see some

235
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,440
of Mickey's house and my favorite quote ever. When I have to make a telephone call I use the tan.

236
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,480
Never get tired of it. This weird mundane. Weird voice. Thing with a weird voice.

237
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,800
Yes. Which right after there's a really aggressive one right after. Anybody for a cheese sandwich.

238
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,040
So here is a thread that nobody has thought about since but I've been meaning to bring up

239
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,480
for a while and I don't think I have right. That I discovered. It was left as a question when we

240
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,000
covered Mickey's house. Who is the fake Mickey voice. Oh right right right. And I figured out

241
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,680
who is the fake Mickey voice. OK. And that is a name that has come up before and that name is

242
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:25,040
Jack Wagner. Jack Wagner known as the voice of Disneyland. Yeah. Who in his regular speaking

243
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,160
voice does a lot of like opening and closing announcements and is well known for Please

244
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,960
Stand Clear of the Doors. Bear with me. I didn't think that was worth a fort. So and he was very

245
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,680
responsible for the Main Street Electrical Parade. Very esteemed Disneyland personality.

246
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,480
And through some weird IMDB or something I don't know how I got there but I was looking up weird

247
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:51,920
specials and trying to figure out something else that had the wrong aggressive Mickey voice. And I

248
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:58,000
found a special where he was credited and I finally can say that Jack Wagner is the weird wrong

249
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,480
den Mickey. Which brings me to just before we dive into maybe the history of Toontown.

250
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,880
I wanted to play this great clip from the special where I figured it all out. I don't know when this

251
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:18,320
is from probably like mid to early 80s. It's called Magic Kingdom Yuletide special. And this is

252
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,120
you look this up on YouTube but this is a weird I think Jack Wagner is all the characters in this

253
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:32,640
and how really because everybody's a little they're not allowing this off of voices anymore.

254
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,400
I don't think. And I'm playing this partially for that and to hear den Mickey but then also

255
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,480
every actor you're about to hear every voice you're about to hear this whatever this production is is

256
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:53,040
so delightfully waiting for Guffman Red White and Blaine like every performer in this is just

257
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:59,760
so wonderfully overdone. So this is just a little bit of Christmas magic I've been wanting to play

258
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,920
for a while. So the setup is that Scrooge doesn't like Christmas. Oh of course. And then Mickey and

259
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,400
some you know human friends we've never met before are all trying to help the situation.

260
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:17,520
Enough of this Christmas nonsense. I don't believe in it. But Mr. Scrooge Christmas time is the most

261
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,360
magical time of the year. A time when the most wonderful and unexpected things can happen.

262
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:29,520
That's right Mr. Scrooge and all you have to do is let yourself go. Be swept up in the excitement.

263
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:38,400
Oh yeah. You can have it. Oh dear. I wish we could change Scrooge's mind about Christmas.

264
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:45,040
So do I Wendy but things are very hard to change. Don't underestimate the power of the magic of

265
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:51,840
Christmas. Hey let's not let Scrooge ruin a great day. I've got it. Let's go for a sleigh ride. A

266
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,360
sleigh ride. That would be great. But where are we going to get the sleigh and the horses. Yeah. It

267
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,240
seems we need a little of that Christmas magic ourselves. You asked for it.

268
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,120
Then he like waves his hands around and creates a video toaster effect.

269
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,240
You asked for it. You asked for it. But some things are very hard to change.

270
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,240
Every performance feels like they were in a different room in like a different like with

271
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,480
a different like camera crew and director and they edited all them all of them together. They're all

272
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,280
like talking to no one. Maybe this was done during a previous pandemic that we've forgotten.

273
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh yeah maybe. Or everything was separated by zoom. This was a 1974 pandemic we've

274
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:46,720
erased from history. Okay you asked for it. Hands in the air Bosner. You could probably I think

275
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,080
memeify or whatever you would call it. Memefying that you asked for it can be the next I use the

276
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:58,880
den. Okay you want to you want a weird statement about what's going on in Florida. You asked for

277
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:07,200
it. The official Mickey Bob Chapek like mouthpiece. That is that we finally found a Mickey that

278
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:14,320
matches the Bob Chapek era. Yeah right. Chapek really should bring back this mean Mickey. You

279
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:21,600
want fast passes to cost twenty dollars a pop. You asked for it. Yeah asshole Mickey.

280
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,320
He's just the fixer. He's the Josh Brolin character from Hail Caesar.

281
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,360
And that's what I was telling you guys beforehand that my new character I'm interested in the

282
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,320
current CFO of Disney who just keeps saying insane things. Oh yeah yeah yeah well you want to share

283
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,680
one of those. Yeah yeah what because we again to bring back something from Celebriory the guys

284
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:49,040
we got we got another guy. Yeah. Female guy but yes and and I mean the most egregious was she said

285
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:54,320
like yes portion sizes have shrunk at Disney restaurants but that may be beneficial to some

286
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:02,560
guests waistlines like oh what lady what did you say what did you say to me. Lord we're helping

287
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,840
you. We're helping you. We're actually helping you Toby. And then like the ticket price is going up

288
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,680
and said like you know some people have more money than time you know. That's just the way it is.

289
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:23,040
Deal with it. Do it you fucks. You asked for it. The official Mickey of the Chapek era is here.

290
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,880
We made modern family eat shit. We don't have to do anything else.

291
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,000
Went to the Elon Musk School of Public Relations. Yeah.

292
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,800
Oh right. That's David Chapek.

293
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,320
Shut up. Damn it. Do I have to do everything. Screw yourself Cal Hansen.

294
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,320
It's a lawsuit. Want more money.

295
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:58,400
I'm calling the scientists. We're going drinking again. Take off the mask. You don't need to have

296
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,120
been ridiculous. This is a prop.

297
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:12,640
Oh God. The best was when DeSantis said that and then the two dunces behind the kids like they're

298
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,960
not kids they're college students they're adults like the two who listened to him and were like

299
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,760
took their mask off like oh the governor said I could. The man is yelling I better. Bob Chapek

300
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:31,520
announces Ron DeSantis is the new voice of Mickey. Well and then the oh man the marketing guy I

301
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,480
forgot like a less I mean I don't know his statement less egregious but his history much

302
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,400
more egregious the guy they hired who worked for BP who was in charge of communication. He just

303
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,240
leaked the Deepwater Horizon. He leaked the release date of Guardians accidentally online.

304
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,600
Yes well and he called it Epcot Center and leaked to the Epcot Center parody account.

305
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,360
Yeah that was just funny. That was just funny. That was just a funny thing. But some sinister

306
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,240
shit he's worked for some sinister. Yeah yeah yeah. Former BP person that makes him like way

307
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,040
down in the current sinister Disney. As far as the terrible shit.

308
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:17,920
It really sucks right now doesn't it guys. Yeah we're all trying to like we're trying to get

309
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:24,320
around. Yeah yeah you know but Jesus I mean you know. Celebrities back. Yeah I think it might have

310
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:31,360
to be a little while. We really do we want to celebrate this company right now. This great this

311
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,840
company that's all about it's you know they're a great purveyor of Rancho Mirage housing tracks

312
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:46,160
and yeah and rides costing twenty dollars a pop and homophobic legislation. Which later I realized

313
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:53,680
after we did that episode what the story Living reminded me of and it's the Christian timeshare

314
00:25:53,680 --> 00:26:00,480
destination Zion's Landing from Righteous Gemstone season two. There's a massive timeshare storyline

315
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,600
that is very important so check it out folks. Everybody's pretty gem stony right now.

316
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:18,640
Yeah. Did Disney get taken over by the fictional characters? I think so. I'm not all the way to

317
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,640
the end of the last season but I am watching it unlike Yellowstone which I have not started yet

318
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:33,680
and I am going to get to. I promise. You asked for it. You're continuing to know what Yellowstone.

319
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:41,600
I don't know what Mickey fires BBs at you. Yeah. I'm gonna buy it. You better watch it or I'll buy it.

320
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,680
Watch it then won't you. Taylor Sheridan I'm gonna buy you out.

321
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:54,080
I'm gonna get you and your characters. All of them. It's all mine. It's all mine damn it.

322
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:02,320
We bought Modern Family. That means we're pro inclusion. I hope none of this makes sense

323
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,040
in a why. This all might be relevant this week but maybe it won't be relevant in a couple months

324
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:13,520
if JPEG gets fucking fired as it should be and could be. I mean all our brains have been destroyed

325
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,440
in one way or another so it will all probably just be mush. It'll all just be a distant memory.

326
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,800
Yeah. Yeah. You know like there was a Buzzfeed list of like stuff that happened right before

327
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:31,040
like the 2020 shutdown and they're like remember this meme and it's like no I don't. Sorry.

328
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,200
I do remember Parasite wedding best picture. That was cool but then it was just like and then of

329
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:44,720
course Love is Blind season one debuted and I'm like uh-huh yes yep. Can I take us back to the

330
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:51,360
pre-opening Toontown? No let's stay. Let's do a lot more JPEG. No please let's go to the topical

331
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,600
JPEG. More topical JPEG. Dear God let's go to the past. And thankfully that's usually. When things

332
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:04,560
were less openly evil. Yes. No. So this is the groundbreaking ceremony for Toontown. This was

333
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:12,160
from a special. Someone clipped a special and it had Disney afternoon avenue like promotional

334
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,240
footage before this and then after it it had a song that went I'm going to Disneyland. I'm going

335
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,800
to Disneyland. Oh yeah I remember that song. Which I know is I'm going to Disney World. I'm going to

336
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,320
Disney World. So they just recorded the song twice and changed the destination. So I think it's a

337
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:35,760
vacation planning. You asked for it. You're reusing the song. Okay this is. I'm only paying those singers once.

338
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:46,160
This is the then head of Disneyland. Jack Lindquist. It's Jack Lindquist. That's right he's very old.

339
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,200
Now if he was evil he never showed it. This guy seems like the most roly poly grandpa man. I always

340
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,920
got a good vibe. He's not zaddy. He's not zaddy but he's uh uh great. Is he grand zaddy? I'm gonna say

341
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:06,000
he's grampy. Grandpa. Grandpa. I guess praise we could give. This is a wonder. I liked this guy. He

342
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,680
invented Disney dollars. Another topic we haven't done. I don't know if they still do Disney dollars.

343
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:17,360
The with the money that they don't. They don't. Okay. Although I feel like crypto Disney dollar

344
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,720
could come out pretty soon. A digital Disney dollar. They get Disney. Disneyetherium. Yeah.

345
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,960
Yeah exactly. To set the stage there was a bunch of construction people on stage and one guy

346
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,800
introduces him and then he does some very big broom work. Like he's really you know fake pushing

347
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:42,640
the broom across the stage. People in the back. Yeah. Quite a coup for us. Having the characters

348
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:50,000
allow us many tunes into their city. You see Mickey's Toontown really exists.

349
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,600
It was just another suburb when Mickey Mouse moved here and he moved in decades ago and over

350
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:04,720
the years it's also become home to many others including Minnie, Goofy, Chippendale and Roger

351
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:14,000
Rabbit. Ladies and gentlemen Mickey Mouse. You could drive a jolly trolley through those pauses

352
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,560
that he was taking in that.

353
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:25,280
Hiya folks. It's really swell to be here. Well you must be pretty excited about all this Mickey.

354
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:36,160
You bet. Well I think we're ready then. Hey Benny slow down. I can't stop.

355
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:56,960
Okay so Roger Rabbit drove the taxi cab through the wall at the end. Right. Uh huh. And what

356
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:04,640
sounded like is that just a generic fanfare or is that the Looney Tunes? That's how Looney Tunes

357
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,960
would end. That's all folks. Oh right. Yeah that's weird. Yeah why would they play that?

358
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,960
I mean that would have been cool if they tried to do like, I mean the licensing would have been

359
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,800
impossible but like Toontown in the Roger Rabbit movie is like, it's all of them. It's everyone.

360
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,720
Well they could have everyone. They could have the Looney Tunes. They could have the characters

361
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,880
from the King Features Syndicate. They could have had anyone. Dagwood could have been in Toontown.

362
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,160
The Charles Fleischer. That's what I kept coming across. Tribune Company publishing characters.

363
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,800
Yeah. There's a new one. Who owns Popeye? Is it King Features?

364
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:49,440
I forget who owns them. Well I would like to... Max Fleischer. Max Fleischer made the cartoons

365
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,840
and made Betty Boop and those early Superman. There's a... oh right right right. There's a

366
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,040
company that called Boss Fight that makes action figures and finally they did a first line of Popeye

367
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:05,200
toys but now the second line has been unveiled and Wimpy is in. Jason immediately pre-ordered.

368
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,240
Pre-ordered baby. He's thinking about getting the poop deck pappy toy they're also producing.

369
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,760
What is the population of people who for the second line of Popeye products said out loud,

370
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:23,680
finally? How many people on this earth? I think a person text... multiple people know Jason is

371
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:29,680
the guy for like multiple people texted me about this toy. Forward this to Jason please. I've never

372
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:36,880
asked him for his number having not wished to text about Popeye before. I don't know. I'm not sure

373
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,840
how... I don't know what the audience is for these. These are smaller companies but Wimpy is finally

374
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,480
being produced. Very exciting. Yeah this is the same company that made Bucky O'Hare toy... new Bucky

375
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:53,440
O'Hare toys which I own and are very excited about. Maybe even more narrow than Popeye. I would think

376
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,520
less known a much smaller amount of time. But they never you know they finally made a Mimi LaFlew

377
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,120
toy. Is that her name? Mimi LaFlew which was... Don't look at me pal.

378
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:11,600
You asked for it Mimi LaFlew. Talking bits of Mimi LaFlew tangent. What is what world is Mimi

379
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,280
LaFlew in? In the Bucky O'Hare-iverse. She was in the crew. Yeah Mimi LaFlew. She sounds so annoyed.

380
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,600
Like I didn't know. You should know there she was. I don't know. She's kind of a she's got like a... She's

381
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:31,440
a paw patrol. She's a fox. She's not a paw patrol. She's a... You ticked that pick. No paw patrol.

382
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,840
Damn it it's way cooler. But she liked Bucky. Mimi LaFlew. She was definitely like a I guess like a...

383
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,400
She was the love interest. She was the romantic lead. Well but no Jenny was the romantic lead

384
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:49,200
but she was not. Mimi LaFlew was different. Jenny was where the romance laid in Bucky O'Hare. But Mimi

385
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,280
LaFlew. I'm trying to think of a good parallel. She was like... I guess she was like a Lola Bunny

386
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:01,120
in the original Space Jam maybe. She was a little too like sexed up. I don't know what you would say.

387
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,560
Like they were... There was too much of like a male animator was drawing like his ideal fox woman.

388
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:12,080
I gotta say though it feels like Mimi LaFlew. They hit on a name and then like oh we got a clock

389
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:18,080
out at five. Just call the other one Jenny. You're saying me test situation. Yeah exactly.

390
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,320
But anyway Boss Fight shout out to them for doing great work. They were doing.

391
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,640
There is an Instagram account just called Max Fleischer Cartoons and they were doing some sort

392
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:36,720
of cartoon screening at the Boss Fight like store studios in LA. By the way check that Instagram

393
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,920
account. It's the best use of Instagram live I've ever seen. A few times a day they'll just go live

394
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:49,520
and show old cartoons. Like just show Betty Boop or Popeye or I think Bimbo. Is that a

395
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:56,240
Betty Boop friend? Yeah. And those Betty Boop cartoons are much weirder than like you know

396
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,960
the tin lunchbox oversized t-shirt industry will lead you to believe. Well then the notion... The

397
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,560
way she's presented now which is just the idea... She just represents the idea of sexiness.

398
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,840
Right. Somehow despite being a giant eyed. Like what is she? That's like why is that the point

399
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:20,960
of Betty Boop now? Yeah. The aesthetic has jumped to the Cuphead games and cartoon show. Like that is

400
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,520
that style. Right. So it would be great if all if everyone was in Toontown is really the point of

401
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:33,280
this whole tangent here. Mimi Laflew, Betty Boop, Bimbo, Bimbo. Every character could be in Toontown

402
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,360
but they did not... They did not work out thousands and thousands of licensing agreements. Exactly.

403
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,560
Well the big thing that had to be worked out to get this land off the ground was they... So it

404
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:53,920
came out of the need for a place where you'd be guaranteed to meet Mickey Mouse. And so it was all

405
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,640
structured around that. So there and there have been different plans for such a thing in the parks.

406
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,600
I found out that on via the channel review time that there was a thing planned called Mickeyville

407
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,360
Tokyo. But that was still kind of in fantasy land aesthetic. That was like a little European town

408
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:16,560
where they'd all set up shop and like Minnie had a candy shop and stuff like that. So that was not...

409
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:24,160
That's where they work in Europe. Right. Not in Japan. Not where they live. Then some Imagineers.

410
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,120
I think included there's a guy named Joe Lancezero who seems very nice and cool. Who is it seems to

411
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:36,240
be like a vocal... The person who led Mickey's Toontown. He did plans for something called Mickey

412
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:44,240
Land that might have had not just... It definitely had the characters houses component but it might

413
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,760
have also been a catch all of other stuff. Like the other half of it may have ended up being

414
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,960
100 acre wood and they were going to get Winnie the Pooh in that way. Right. So that was a

415
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,480
possibility. But by the time this was pitched it was Eisner era. He's trying to get recent

416
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,520
blockbusters into the park. He already was saying as much Roger Rabbit as possible. There's a lot

417
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:13,600
of Roger... Tons of Roger Rabbit odds and ends in the then new Disney MGM studios. So he said,

418
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:20,000
why don't we... It's not Mickey Land. You can do your Mickey Land concept but can it also be Toontown?

419
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:25,120
So it's kind of you divide it in half. So we've got a Roger Rabbit section and a Mickey and Friends

420
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:30,400
section and that's what you see today. Yeah. It's interesting all those ideas that you always find

421
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,720
have been bouncing around, Imagineering Forever and that's like they obviously wanted a spot for

422
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:40,720
Mickey forever. Yeah. And then just because of Roger Rabbit this all came together. Finally was

423
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:48,480
current and relevant for that time before they bailed on this character harder than they bailed

424
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,400
on any character in their history. Yes. Well I think the Hollywood land stuff that was always

425
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,880
talked about like it'll go behind Main Street and it'll have the Roger Rabbit rides we're going to

426
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:06,560
put at Disney MGM studios and just... I kept coming across like that Euro Disneyland financial hit

427
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,280
like killed a lot of projects or scaled back a lot of projects. It killed everything. Well now like

428
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,880
because you know in the defunct lands and the review times and the different videos of the world

429
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,800
catalog these things like now the thing you'll always hear it's usually other stuff right it's

430
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,000
well due to September 11th or now due to the pandemic Euro Disney is the only mega meltdown

431
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:36,160
disaster that Disney themselves caused. Yes it's the only themed entertainment like financial

432
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:43,360
catastrophe. Yeah you're right. It's not well until it's like but then the day that Bob Chapek took a

433
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:50,640
flamethrower to the Magic Kingdom. Yeah. He burnt the place down. Specifically. Before cops shot him.

434
00:38:52,880 --> 00:39:00,240
All right. Oh cops would never shoot the rich. Are you kidding? Well I guess California Adventure

435
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:07,520
then came along too. That was another one and some people say Hong Kong Disneyland but I don't

436
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,480
think that really made as much of an impact. Yeah but Euro Disney's this like meltdown like it's the

437
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,240
they couldn't ignore it really is what it is because obviously they don't companies don't

438
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,280
want to take blame for something like that but it was just too big to ignore. Yeah. So they had to

439
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:27,520
use it to explain why. Thus hurting the Disney the Disney decade was essentially over in two three

440
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:34,160
years. Yeah. Yeah. Over almost before it started. The Disney yeah few years not decades. Disney

441
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:40,720
couple years. Fifth of a decade yeah. I mean the juxtaposition I think with like how big all the

442
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:48,320
movies were and then how Euro Disneyland just didn't did it just had a bad open a bad start out

443
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:54,560
the gate but then by the time California Adventure opens like fortunes across the company were not

444
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,160
doing well so it's like well this isn't great. Yeah. But neither is TV and neither is movies so

445
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,840
you know. Yeah every the hubris that look we in some ways you can admire the Eisner hubris

446
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,480
but the hubris to build I think as Tony Baxter other people have talked about like

447
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,000
you know it makes sense in Tokyo because that's sort of adults don't like turn up their noses at

448
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,640
animated things versus Europe. We're going to build a big fun cartoon thing in the middle of Europe

449
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,680
maybe is a little bit. A place where they weave like we've all we've done is announced it and now

450
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,200
they are they're specific they're throwing vegetables at us. Yeah yeah maybe that was not

451
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:38,800
it took like a generation of like people it had to be there for a generation for people to go yeah

452
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:45,120
I guess it's okay. Like people had to grow up with it and not like yeah not have known that stigma

453
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:50,880
because they were one year old when the stigma existed. So yeah the Eisner you know worked to

454
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:57,120
look the it worked sometimes it didn't work other places. Yeah yeah yeah the folly and now they do

455
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:01,840
have that now they do like they put out that big commemorative book there's like social media

456
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,880
accounts of like remember the early days of Euro Disney and it's like oh I went first year to open

457
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,720
you know same as any park people remembered fondly after enough time. Yeah yeah they knew it would

458
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,040
happen. There was something else contained in that that clip that you played Jason because the you

459
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,920
know the real story of this is what I just said they want to play Mickey and Bob Ross. Yes.

460
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:30,880
Lots to unpack though. The real the narrative story and this is yeah well let's get to this. I send you

461
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,880
guys a little email also if you I don't know I don't know what you're about to share. I think

462
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:44,480
it's what you want to. But the yeah so the fictional backstory of Toontown is that Mickey's Toontown

463
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:55,840
predated the theme park that Mickey's celebrity is popping off in the early 30s and he wants just a

464
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:01,520
little middle America suburb to call his own. I think according to the story at one point he was

465
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:07,120
there by himself and then eventually got lonely. He wanted to keep. What are you taking? I'm curious

466
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:12,560
what you have. Do you have the comic strip? I don't have the comic strip but I have it's the actual

467
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,280
like somewhere this was written down as far as the narrative and I found it in that review time

468
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:24,320
video. Okay yeah yeah. Toontown was a hidden Toon suburb that Mickey Mouse had moved to in 1930

469
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:31,120
to keep in touch with his humble midwestern roots. Now okay now in canon here Mickey is from the

470
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:36,640
midwest because Walt was from the midwest I guess. Yeah. But even though Mickey was created when Walt

471
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,240
lived out in California. Yes. So I don't know why. No Mickey's from Nebraska. Mickey is from Nebraska

472
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:50,960
with his friends following soon after. Okay so there are three paragraphs here let's unpack this

473
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:58,800
one first. Mickey okay he moved out so if we think about the narrative in the California Adventure

474
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,920
Suitcase in a Dream pop-up show which is a show that happens on the street of California Adventure

475
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,960
with some newsies and then Mickey pops up and it's sort of talking about how Mickey came out

476
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,800
to California to make it big. Yeah. So that's also canon is that Mickey I guess here it's the same

477
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:21,680
thing Mickey lived in the midwest and came out here. With Walt? Well they meet in Hollywood. So

478
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,520
this but this canon is saying that Walt it feels like they met in Hollywood it's not canon that

479
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,920
Mickey and Walt like lived together in a like a studio apartment in the midwest and then there

480
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,280
were like two buddies that moved out. I don't think that's what the narrative is. What's the okay the

481
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,400
little scene right in the where that show happens that you're describing there's the statue that's

482
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,440
Walt and Mickey and they both kind of got their suitcases. Yeah. Presumably a dream. Of course. You

483
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,280
can see it in their eyes. Is that have they is that them meeting? Do they bump into each other both

484
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,440
carrying suitcases? Oh sorry I'll clean that up for you. What's up? What's up? I'm Mickey. We have to you know we have

485
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,640
Walt if we can look up Jason do you have can we look up the lyrics to Suitcase in a Dream

486
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:12,240
because I think that'll really let us know exactly what the narrative is. Mike acts like that as a

487
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,400
chore. I'm pretending yeah yeah I'm pretending for the podcast. If we had to listen to Suitcase in a Dream

488
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:26,720
if somebody made us. And Scott where do you know where that background is from like where did they publish

489
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:33,760
that that well if you also if we're giving you too many tasks here but both of you have in your email

490
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:41,040
now a comic strip that I found that explains a one pager that explains all of this backstory. Okay but

491
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,280
we have a couple more things Scott to get to before. Okay so here are the lyrics of Suitcase in a Dream

492
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,640
and here is I guess the newer canon. So do you want me to sing should I sing it or should I just

493
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,640
maybe I'll just recite it. Should I do all of it including the choruses or. It's like Mr. Disney

494
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:02,240
traveled west like that's the type of singing in the song. It's but Mr. Disney traveled west just a few

495
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:09,920
bucks to his name along the way he met Mickey Mouse. On the train. And the world will never be the same. Is it an analog for that he

496
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:16,320
drew Mickey on the train in this world. Yeah maybe. Where he that he that Mickey just they like bumped

497
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:22,400
into each other on their way in and out of the bathroom car. Right. Sorry don't get up in there. So Jason is

498
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,600
correct about a long train ride because magical things can happen when you're relaxing on a long

499
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:34,000
mode of train a long trip. That's right yeah the narrative that he came up with Mickey. Right but he actually.

500
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:42,160
Don't call him Mortimer idiot. What are you doing. So so he met Mickey on maybe a train doesn't say that in the

501
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:49,040
song but that's probably what they're implying. I want that slice of banana green pie. Yeah they both reached for it or something or

502
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:56,080
can I borrow a cigarette. This is an insane amount of lore of canon to dump in a comic strip at an old

503
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:00,400
man giving a press conference. So okay there's two more paragraphs of this thing. So when Walt Disney was

504
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,360
looking for a location to build Disneyland Mickey pointed him toward a large orange grove nearby for

505
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:10,720
him to build his park. Yeah so Mickey told him where to build Disneyland which was nearby the

506
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:17,040
suburbs. So Mickey went to Anaheim. Yeah Mickey had a private housing development the original

507
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:24,800
Cotino in a way. Yes. In Anaheim he chose and he he develops just a sliver of it but left most of it

508
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,480
just didn't bother the farmers or whatever who owned it already. Hey you want some cheap land.

509
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:39,520
I know where to build. Yeah and this in this world he like Walt's his landlord. Essentially yes.

510
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:45,040
Or I'm sorry no he's Walt's landlord. Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he sold him cheap farmland. So after

511
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:50,320
the park opened Mickey and his friends would travel between their Toontown homes and Disneyland to meet

512
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:55,200
the countless guests that visited the park before eventually deciding to open their hometown to the

513
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:03,440
public digging a tunnel through the berm. Important Mickey Goofy and Donald and Minnie all dug a tunnel

514
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:10,320
together. Through the berm. Through the berm. Walt built a berm to keep the Toons out. He didn't want them.

515
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:16,080
We're running a professional fun organization here we don't want. But as soon as Walt was dead. People

516
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,360
aren't going to take it seriously if there's a mouse walking around. Right as soon as Walt was dead

517
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:24,960
they were like we're building a tunnel here. Well they when they close that big picnic area where

518
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:31,040
companies would do company picnics and get hammered. Close that down opens up room to build a tunnel

519
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:36,080
for cartoon characters to go through. I don't think I know about this picnic this drunk picnic

520
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:42,080
place. Oh didn't we. We haven't done an episode about the drunk about the picnic. I must have

521
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:47,520
heard about on on Disney Dish. I think it is what is now the downtown Disney parking lot. Okay.

522
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,640
Yeah they they you know the corporate companies were like look we want somewhere to have company

523
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:01,200
picnics and our executives like to drink beer. And so people would get hammered and then go into the

524
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:08,000
park. You're saying on adult libations. Adult libations. They said. It essentially predicted downtown Disney.

525
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:15,840
Can I just say. Wait wait are you still. I'm done I'm done with my portion of that explanation.

526
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:23,360
Well I gotta say this is 1940 ish Rogers gang makes downtown a happen in place.

527
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,240
Usually in history. That's something from the comics. Yeah we should talk now we have to go

528
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:34,880
through the comic strip. Oh yeah. Panel by panel. Sorry. People have been going to Toontown without

529
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,680
knowing any of this back story. And that's why. That's why this place needs to be closed down and

530
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:45,200
we need to stop down and reflect on why you're going there and what the you know it's you can

531
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:50,000
live your Toontown story. There should be. There should be a roadie style pre-show before you go

532
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,760
into Toontown with like three pre-show rooms that explain this narrative before you even step foot

533
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,040
in the land. Yeah you're right. So now so at that at that point in this in this comic yeah Mickey is

534
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:07,840
already Mickey lives in Anaheim. He suggested this land. No no we hasn't just the land. Roger and his

535
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:13,520
gang invade in the 40s. Well yeah which is confusing because usually the suburbs don't come before the

536
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:21,920
city. That has not historically been the case. So can I go do you want to walk through these

537
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,440
panels. What do you want to do here. This is just like if anything struck you. Oh everything strikes

538
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,880
me. So so basically the first panel just says a star is born and like there's two like old timey

539
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,200
folks. They've just seen Steamboat Willie and they're very excited about Mickey and then the

540
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:41,600
next panel I would like to point out it says 1930 something and Mickey is at his desk and he writes

541
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,320
or he says there's no place like home if only I had one. Which is really like. You have a house.

542
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:54,480
Mickey never right got to Hollywood got discovered really on the train by Walt and just hit the ground

543
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,600
running and never he he doesn't have a place to live. This is a mistreatment on a Judy Garland

544
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:04,640
level. 100% criminal what Walt has done. Right he has just been sleeping as obvious he looks

545
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:10,720
exhausted already. He's like eyes are closing he's at his desk and with a full itinerary

546
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:17,440
meet and greet. Meet with Walt see new merch on the set. Right. Calls he always calls to Donald.

547
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,200
This is this is crazy he's been worked to the bone. I know it's real cruel it's so yeah early

548
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:29,280
early show business. And then yeah it says soon after and then it says Toontown West in the back

549
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:37,600
and Mickey is shaking hands with a like an unseen a faceless suited human man. He's with Pluto.

550
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,960
Mickey it's Daniel Plainview he's buying the land. Daniel Plainview.

551
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,280
Oh I look at people and I don't find much I like either Daniel.

552
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:54,240
You drank my milkshake. I can't dig for oil into this place then why'd I buy it.

553
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:02,080
The only thing is if Mickey gets beat up by a bowling apparatus it's just a big

554
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:06,720
big bump comes out of his head and he sees birds around his head so that might have gone smoother.

555
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,320
Not so for Daniel. No. He's seen the end of the movie. Yeah.

556
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:21,600
So yeah then Mickey moves in his friends eventually join and I like or says in no time.

557
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,360
And then why is this fact so odd to us that I don't know why they took the time to say Mickey

558
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:33,280
lived alone not with Minnie for not with his long-term girlfriend. Mickey was able to sew

559
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,800
his oats for a little while in Anaheim if that's what they're getting at. And outside of this

560
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:46,880
mythology by the way it's also explained elsewhere that the reason that Donald is on a boat and not

561
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:53,840
a house in Toontown is because he lives in Duckburg. We know this. So he's only docking

562
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:00,240
sometimes in Toontown. Well Mickey's birthday land I believe took place in Duckburg like when

563
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,360
you get off of the train in Florida the version their version of one of the versions of the

564
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:10,640
Toontown in Florida you'd get off the train to take you there and it would say you were actually in

565
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:16,320
Duckburg initially. But wasn't it wasn't the canon at one point that that Mickey's house was his like

566
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:22,640
vacation house. Yes which we've talked about on an episode. I don't know which one but on an episode

567
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:28,560
we've talked we have talked about that at least one episode. Yeah I don't think Jack Lindquist is

568
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:34,240
still alive the man I heard in the clip earlier. But I feel like if he heard any of what we're

569
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:40,000
saying today he'd say what's wrong with you damn kids. I made you a place to run around and play.

570
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:46,960
Why are you getting caught up on this. It's been decades. You're wasting your time today.

571
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:53,760
Even the three sentences they had him say I was like what what. Yes they called yeah you

572
00:52:54,080 --> 00:53:00,160
asked for it. You asked for it Jack. What are they supposed to do but pick this apart on a podcast

573
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:05,840
years later. I didn't think it was even more convoluted than his introduction.

574
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,880
Oh I would love to be yelled at by Jack Lindquist especially if it was in that slow way he was

575
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,840
talking in that video. Well to take some nice pauses yes take a break kind of get back up from

576
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:22,800
the yelling. Yeah yeah. And help you absorb it. I hope to be yelled at at least by one CEO

577
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:29,760
of Disney or otherwise. Well there's one who's pretty likely to yell at all of us before he's

578
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:35,520
done. A lot less endearing than old Jack Lindquist too. Hopefully after the after he's done being CEO

579
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:42,400
he'll be on Cameo and you can pay him like a grand to yell at you. Michael Eisner started his specials

580
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,920
by saying hello. He's good. Shavex is going to start his specials by saying hello you fucks.

581
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:57,520
You fucks. Unappreciative fucks. I'm finished. The heel we were really right about that heel

582
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:04,400
him turning heel. Yeah we were joking about the heel turn. That was a couple weeks prior. He really did it and it was much less funny than we described.

583
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,040
Oh it was not yeah it was not funny. I know. If only he'd taken if it had been we wouldn't be mad if he was just

584
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:14,000
wearing like leopard colored spandex and the. Yeah that's true. Yelling cartoonish threats. Yeah

585
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:19,520
and it's certainly much less than some wrestling heel turns where everyone just glowers more and

586
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,800
like seemingly twirls like a snidely whiplash mustache. Sure he should have all snidely should

587
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,920
have been in Toontown too. Oh yeah the Jay Ward character should have been all over that. Yeah

588
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,520
because you could have two Dudley Do-Right rides. It is surprising that Disney has not acquired like

589
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:41,280
Rocky and Bowling Goal as such. Give them time. Yeah it'll happen. Okay we have a lot more panels

590
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,160
to go through here. I don't know you guys are with all these jokes and stuff I don't know.

591
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:52,240
We have more. Back to reading. So panel seven. I don't know where are you? I don't know.

592
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:59,200
We're talking Roger. Okay so 1940ish. Roger's gang makes downtown a happening place. Okay so Roger now

593
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:06,400
makes downtown I don't know what that means downtown it makes whatever Anaheim we're talking here.

594
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:14,160
No he means Toontown downtown Toontown. Okay yeah where Mickey was living. No no he lives in suburbia

595
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,960
he doesn't like the he probably didn't like that Roger moved in he probably wanted to like screw

596
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:25,600
Roger on the property so he had Disneyland open on the side nearest to him to cause a bunch of

597
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:30,960
noise for his rates to go up. Yeah Mickey still lives on the quiet side of town out in the barn.

598
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,160
I see. So left Toontown is suburbs right Toontown is downtown. And that's where Roger and his

599
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:44,240
gang were making things happen in basically. Jazz music and dueling pianos. Okay I got you.

600
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:49,840
Or dueling pianos but only one of the pianos is being played and the other is empty due to

601
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:54,880
copyright rules. You mean because they would get sued by Hall of the Moon. They can't do the gang.

602
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:01,280
I thought you meant because Hall of the Moon copyright. Yeah they definitely the

603
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,720
cowl at the moon definitely seems like a company that has their legal issues in order.

604
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:15,120
The next one's really I feel like this is where like it's all contained in here and it's 1953

605
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:24,880
and Walt is describing his plans for Disneyland to Mickey and right here I'd put a beautiful castle.

606
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:30,800
Sounds great Walt I know of the perfect property nearby. And the thing under that is Walt a frequent

607
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:36,880
and the only human visitor to Toontown. Yes. This is great. This is a great detail of it. They never

608
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:43,120
had no humans were allowed to visit. Right so how did they get mail? Mickey I guess had to go to the

609
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:50,320
mail. Just toss it over the burn. Or yeah there was yeah exactly. So yeah Walt was the only cool guy.

610
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:57,600
How did they get like hookups for water and power? Uh-huh yeah so Walt was the only cool one.

611
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:03,360
Everybody else can't trust those no toons. I guess they had their I guess they had like a toon

612
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,840
everything. I guess there was a toon post-op. They have like a toon they have a toon mailbox.

613
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:12,640
It's toon water I guess. They can't drink our water. So it's like a self-service. USPS won't do the last

614
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:20,720
mile delivery. It costs way more expensive way more expensive. It's like sending mail to China.

615
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,240
Even though it's right next door. He I guess yeah so every like Mickey didn't meet many

616
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:32,560
humans on trains I guess. So that kind of bonded him to Walt forever. So Walt could go into the

617
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:37,920
toon town. And I guess I'm still they kind of talk about like humans as far as the physics are

618
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:43,040
concerned. But I do wonder like did Walt ever get an anvil dropped on him or his hand or anything

619
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:48,960
like what what happened there? Like was he in danger constant danger? We haven't looked into

620
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:55,200
the polo injury yet. That might have been with like a cartoon ostrich. Oh yeah. We don't know

621
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:00,560
the ins and outs yet. Yeah that that is uh yeah that time where Walt was in toon town when toon

622
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:05,760
town was hidden is surprisingly not documented. And I feel like a lot of weird stuff went down.

623
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:12,880
A lot of weird stuff went down. You think toon affairs? 100% toon affairs. Who do we think he

624
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:19,120
was who who was Walt? Do we dare say Minnie? Clarabel? Minnie yeah yeah who are the single ones?

625
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,960
Clarabel. Is Clarabel with Horace? Yeah she is but they were um yeah name only. They were Polly.

626
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:30,480
They were Clarabel and oh you think they were you think they were pretty pretty chilled for the time.

627
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,120
I think so yeah. I think you can kind of get that vibe from them if you watch those early cartoons.

628
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:39,760
Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe I'm well in the way that there is like throughout the 20th century there's

629
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:45,200
like oh yeah there's a polyamorous community or a commune or like you know nudist colony you know.

630
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,120
Always. There was a nudist part of toon so there was a nude town in toon town.

631
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:56,880
There was yeah. To join up. Some of yeah some of it was just nudist some of it was just no pants

632
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:03,360
some of it was just you know. Yes a lot of characters yeah it is largely a no pants

633
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,960
community already. Right. Be it Donald or Winnie the Pooh. So Walt would just

634
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:15,120
join in. Leave his pants at the at the city hall. What if Walt is Rue's father?

635
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:22,880
Walt and Kanga. Never met Kanga's husband. Anything is possible.

636
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:30,480
Walt had a secret family in toon town. We recently were talking about secret families.

637
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,440
Please Walt it would help Rue socially if she could take the last name Disney. No no no I don't

638
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,520
it'll be a blight on the empire. Yeah that's right. This is my secret shame.

639
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,920
There should be a that's not a panel in the comic we're reading. No no it's not.

640
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:53,520
Walt conceiving Rue. Don't take a picture I don't want anyone to see it.

641
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,640
The only human allowed in toon town for many years.

642
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:08,880
That's. Walt is essentially Walt open toon town to humans just as Nixon

643
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:15,680
softened relations and opened China to trade to diplomatic relations with America. You're saying

644
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:20,320
these parallel. There's a parallel. There's a parallel here. Nixon and Walt very good friends.

645
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:24,880
So make say. Why didn't you invite him then? I was gonna say did Walt ever like come on would you

646
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,280
would you let Mickey would you let Dick come in all right yeah I just want to show him around. He

647
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:34,480
loves the animated features. The cover of night like yeah an unmarked car pulled up the cover of

648
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:41,520
night but the way this this worked out Nixon was likely inspired by Walt opening up toon town.

649
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:47,840
Because he would have known because this was all secret until the night like to the 90s this was

650
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,040
all secret. We didn't know this was happening at the time. Nixon might have known this might have

651
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:56,400
been an area of 51 situation. Yeah right yes. Maybe there was a phone on the desk

652
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:02,000
on the resolute desk. Maybe there was a red line. This one this one gives me Khrushchev.

653
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,880
This one gives me Mickey Mouse. It was the house the phone that Mickey has in toon town.

654
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:12,960
It was the silly phone. The only person who could call it was Richard Nixon. Nixon had one of Mickey's

655
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:19,120
silly phone on his desk as well. Listen Dick I agree with your politics but Walt and I have an

656
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:22,880
arrangement before you know it this whole place is overrun with people.

657
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:30,400
I'd love to make an exception for you but I can't. My balls are in a vice here man.

658
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:36,720
What about a phone? I'll give you a phone. Dick do not listen to Billy Graham. Do not bomb the

659
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:44,400
dykes in Vietnam. You will flood so much. It was sick of being an unpaid advisor. You're gonna kick

660
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,680
me some money for this foreign policy. Haldeman's out of his mind.

661
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,080
Yeah it was like uh like every time you hear Robert Evans an old Robert Evans interview he was

662
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,600
talking about how he needed Henry Kissinger at like a movie premiere or something. There was a

663
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:03,600
similar situation with Mickey and Nixon. Kissinger and Eeyore got along very well. Yeah yeah similar

664
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:11,440
energies. Yeah yeah vibes vibes are the same. But then look they did invite people into the town.

665
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,920
Of course eventually. After many after almost 40 years of being in the town.

666
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,920
Many after almost 40 years of the theme park being open next door.

667
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:26,400
Yes so finally a decision was made that look it's too close. We may as well just do it.

668
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:31,840
It's a long commute. You know what it'll make our commute easier if we build a tunnel

669
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,840
you know through the burnt whatever it is. Which also suggests to me that we are supposed to

670
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:43,440
believe actually we're traveling a farther distance in Disneyland than what it is. So like when we

671
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,760
walk through the gates of Toontown I think the narrative is that we're walk like maybe we're

672
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,720
walking like a couple miles even. I don't think it's actually supposed to be immediate. In the

673
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:58,080
fantasy of it we're walking through a secret tunnel to get to this suburb. Right because you

674
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:03,520
go under the railroad tracks and honestly it is kind of a pain to walk to Toontown sometimes.

675
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:08,240
Toontown does feel the most inconvenient place to go in Disneyland. Yeah years pass and I've never

676
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:13,760
been back there. So losing it for a little bit where it's not because it's not a conduit to

677
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:19,200
anything else. Right. It's a dead end in the park. Right. So yeah you skip it sometimes. People were

678
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:25,360
speculating though that concept art does look like it would have a second in and out like we connect

679
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:32,560
to Galaxy's Edge. Possibly Chip and Dale treehouse knocks down it not having anything fun in it anymore.

680
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:38,080
And so yeah maybe that but I was looking at that on an overhead. You got a long way to go.

681
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:42,800
They got to build a big old bridge. It's not you think maybe it's right next door but it's not.

682
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:47,280
It's like this hypothetical tunnel that Mike is describing. It's a long way. So they got to build

683
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,880
some weird bridge to Galaxy's Edge I think. Feels like they're not going to do that. But I could be

684
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:56,960
really weird too. It is the last dead end in the park and Runaway Railway is going to like really

685
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:02,480
amp up the people. That's true. I guess you yeah yeah that I guess yeah when this opens again

686
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:08,560
like having a big exciting ride will certainly make more people go I guess we got to go walk

687
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:15,280
back to Toontown like that. So it would make sense as far as traffic flow but. The other thing is

688
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:20,640
that they're not going to be able to do that thing where Toontown closes like before the rest of the

689
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:26,720
park because it's adjacent to where they fire the fireworks off of. Oh that's right. Yeah. They're

690
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:31,680
there. They can't get away with there's a big new ride. They can't close that ride at five every day.

691
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:39,040
Right. So I'm not what will they do. I don't know. What will their time closure policy.

692
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:44,080
We can only sit here and like you know we should just sit here silently for a couple minutes so the

693
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:49,520
listeners at home can contemplate it like we are. So we build in a space here. They keep 30 they'll

694
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:54,480
close it. I don't know. They keep doing that where it's just like they keep moving where the fireworks

695
01:04:54,480 --> 01:05:00,640
are shot off from and where the like like to build Runaway Railway there was like a big backstage

696
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:05,920
area for like maintenance and costuming and stuff that they had to like sacrifice.

697
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:12,240
Sacrifice. Sacrifice. They had to give up. Sacrifice does sound a little extreme.

698
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:17,280
No I think so. They had to do some sort of ritual. They had to just give it up. Burn it for my god.

699
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:24,240
Burn it for the ink. Chaypek lit a fire. He's gonna he's gonna start firing the fireworks

700
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,400
straight at the employees cars. Those are the new shows.

701
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:34,560
Shoot shoot one of the employees cars into the air and hit it with a firework for the show. Launch

702
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:42,720
it. I believe there is a parking garage near where the fireworks are shot off where if you are parked

703
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:47,440
on the top of the garage at least for a little while there was a thing where it's like if you

704
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:52,240
go to get your car if you stayed really late and they shot off fireworks you have a fine layer of

705
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,880
ash on your car. I think it was a thing with neighbors for a long time. Yeah. You get you

706
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:01,680
get ash in your yard. Yeah so. Chaypek's gonna start charging for the ash.

707
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:09,040
It's gonna go door to door. Scrape up the ash. You could this is a this is valuable Disney property.

708
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:14,480
There'll be a $150 please. They'll build a car wash at the end of when you're exiting the parking

709
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:19,840
garage and you'll have to pay $20 to clean your car off of the ash and you'll pocket another 20.

710
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:26,400
There wasn't any ash on. I don't know that. You got hey you gotta you gotta you want to leave the

711
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:33,120
parking garage right? Pay the 20 to get your car cleaned. The audience the park attendees spoke

712
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:38,880
loud and clear the ability to leave the park is an ability that they value above any other

713
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:44,400
and that's why we're gonna finally put a spotlight. The story of the story of leaving.

714
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:51,680
The story of exiting. The story of exiting began with the first chapter of entering the garage.

715
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:59,680
We're so excited to see our guests complete the story of exiting. To give them the privilege of

716
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:08,400
the $40 exit fee. What's like what have we not talked about in terms of like panels?

717
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:14,320
Maybe the last few panels. No I think we covered the comic. Oh sorry. Didn't we? Yeah.

718
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:22,080
No let's uh I mean maybe the things to focus on here like what we know is is uh is changing at least

719
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:30,160
a little bit. The the the big one I think is um well okay the the trolley's gone the trolley's

720
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:36,000
already been gone for a long time they're ripping the tracks out. So there's gonna be no even visible

721
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:41,440
awareness that there was once this jolly trolley at any point in time. There's also a thing called

722
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:46,240
Toon Park which is an odd little area. Did you guys ever see that when it was open?

723
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:53,840
It was like five uh plastic shrubs. It was very it was very strange and depressing

724
01:07:53,840 --> 01:08:01,120
I feel and uh like a real park might be better. Weird it was weird. Okay. Um so that's gonna be

725
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:09,280
a big open space. A lot of this also seemingly is about getting the current the the new shorts

726
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:14,960
version of Mickey and Minnie places as best as they can because it seems like Disney is committing

727
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,040
to this is how we're representing Mickey and Minnie it's how they're represented in the ride.

728
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:25,120
It's not the 90s version of Mickey it's this new those these manic shorts that I think are really

729
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:29,600
great. Um so I think there's a statue getting torn out that's more of a 90s Mickey. I think you're

730
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:35,600
gonna start seeing like other just iterations of those current Minnie Mickey and the other characters

731
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:41,200
around. Yeah there was um oh is it still up because I didn't go last is the there was a sign

732
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:45,440
with using the new versions of Mickey and Minnie that was kind of funny that was basically like

733
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:50,480
this like there's nothing to see here essentially. Yeah like what giant building on the construction

734
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:55,040
walls on the construction wall. Yeah which was funny and then that yeah um which I think that

735
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:59,680
was after there was all those videos just out of like destruction happening in Toon Town.

736
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:05,360
We're like which I hate look there's a lot to blame Bob. I know it was a Bob Chapek's fault that he

737
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:10,640
was just like demolish Toon Town in front of the children. Gather more children make them watch.

738
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:15,840
Which also downtown Disney I was I I had walked down there not long ago and you can just there's

739
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:23,360
a really crazy looking piece of construction by where um Sugar Boo was in the Starbucks where

740
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:28,800
you're like oh that's it looks like a missile hit that like it's it's really like visible like in the

741
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:34,960
Chapek era he doesn't not not mind you seeing like building destruction um. Yeah I mean the

742
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:40,400
elements were kind of destroying Toon Town for a long time already like I I first saw it when I

743
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:46,240
first went to the park in 2006 and like you know that doesn't rain that often in southern California

744
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:53,360
but the sun is kind of merciless like and and they I think they ran into the same problem similar to

745
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:57,600
what the problem they ran into at Islands of Adventure with Seuss Landing where it's like trying

746
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:05,440
to transport a color scheme from uh children's books or uh animated you know shorts and stuff

747
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:13,440
and painting buildings that like either a flat color or a very bright color it just fades almost

748
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:19,440
immediately it seems like you know. Yeah in my memory Toon Town was only looked super colorful

749
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:25,280
and vibrant for a couple years and then they sort of stopped trying to keep up. That's like yeah

750
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,960
that's the that's the thing you really have to keep up when you're doing a cartoon

751
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:36,160
environment thing like the only part of Disney Sea like that looked a little bit weird was the

752
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:42,400
Little Mermaid area which is very like cartoon colors and I'm wondering like I'm wondering how

753
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:50,160
like um Nintendo Land in Japan has stood like like is it still is it already yeah fading a little bit

754
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:55,040
or are they I assume they they're keeping they have to keep that up pretty hard at least initially

755
01:10:56,240 --> 01:11:02,160
so yeah that that stuff feels like it doesn't I guess it's because everything else if it looks

756
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:07,120
like it's kind of rooted in the real world it can fade a little bit and it's okay. You don't notice

757
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:12,320
but yeah when it's the brightest when it has to look as yeah bright as a cartoon you're always

758
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:18,320
going to notice when the sun is taking that shine away. Yeah and I think um I'm sure the agreement

759
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:23,440
is even stricter with like the Nickelodeon lands but I think the agreement with like the Seuss

760
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:32,160
uh family or the Seuss estate is like every every few years they have to paint like every five years

761
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:38,080
or something because they do do upkeep there I think they honestly do it more than Toontown.

762
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:45,280
Yeah yeah because the the guys all uh the widow I think was pretty strict about like if I'm gonna

763
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:51,040
let you do this you have to do it correctly. She said no more live action movies and keep that

764
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:57,440
paint fresh. Yeah keep it yeah. What are the two things she wanted? The Mike Myers cat scared me.

765
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:07,600
So uh other stuff that is I think we're not losing but it is changing uh Goofy's Bounce House. Goofy's

766
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:13,040
Bounce House which we've never talked about that length in general I don't think um this is one

767
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:18,880
of these things if I if I didn't say this at the top when this when Toontown was about to open

768
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:26,000
I was so abuzz about I was thinking about it night and day I was so excited to get to go to

769
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,120
Toontown. It's one of the first times I remember having dreams about Disneyland. Wow. I had dreams

770
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:36,240
about what Toontown was going to be like I don't remember the specifics of the dream but I remember

771
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:41,040
an extremely long tunnel oddly like the one you were describing. Oh yeah yeah. I don't remember

772
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:45,760
what was in the two it was just a there's a weird claustrophobic tunnel and then I think Mickey's

773
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:52,000
full face filled it like it was actually terrifying. It entered to Chris Angel's Las Vegas show.

774
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
You entered through a giant Mickey head. Wow. It was real and you went into his body.

775
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,840
I thought about Toontown so much there was even this mall tour by the way do you know about the

776
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:10,400
Toontown mall tour? No. There was a tour that went from city to city and covered like 40 malls. Wow.

777
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:16,320
That brought up like huge Toontown sets and a little show with the characters that ran five

778
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:21,840
times a day. There's I don't have a there's not a clip of this that is good and funny enough to play

779
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:28,560
on this podcast but if you want to watch just the most like mundane sizzle reel showing the investors

780
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:36,160
at Kodak how successful the mall tour was this is on YouTube. I think it's called Mickey's Toontown

781
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:41,280
tour presented by Kodak at the channel JPL productions. So Monday you get to see like and

782
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:50,160
then the the builders got to work. We built this city and then like boy and the audience

783
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:55,440
you know in all the markets found that this event was simply irresistible.

784
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:04,000
Really great mundane. It was in Chicago by the way at the Stratford Square mall. Do you have any

785
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,160
fond memories of Stratford Square? Very fond memories of Stratford Square yeah. Oh boy.

786
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:14,320
That was I know Woodfield has your heart it has all of our hearts. Stratford Square was actually

787
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:19,680
a little bit shoot maybe I'm mixing it up with Spring Hill. Stratford Square I believe was the

788
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:25,920
mall though that had the waterfall movie theater. Wow. Which was a you would walk through like a

789
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:31,280
waterfall to get to your theater and look out into the mall and there was water and it was like the

790
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:37,760
coolest thing. That sounds like the best place that's ever been built. That's incredible. And I

791
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:43,520
was I was there I saw actually you know what funny enough I saw Uncut Gems there like three years

792
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:49,200
ago. Wow. Still got the waterfall? No gone. No water. Damn. That's that's all gone and the theater's

793
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:54,000
like up on the third level and it's less. That's more depressing than the events of the film

794
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:01,680
Uncut Gems. Yes. Anyways but I this tour I remember like I didn't I never got my act together to

795
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:05,840
convince my mom to take me to the tour and I thought about it I still think about it sometimes I'm

796
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:10,800
still like really should have gone to that mall tour. I don't want to go to the mall tour. So

797
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:16,160
so badly did I want Tastes of Toontown and all any all of that to say Goofy's Bounce House was the

798
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:20,160
thing I was looking forward to the most because if you never got to experience this you go into

799
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:26,800
Goofy's living room in his crazy topsy turvy house and everything in there is inflatable. His

800
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:35,760
chairs and his credenza and his lamp everything so you can literally bounce off of the walls and I

801
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:43,840
remember thinking imagining what this was going to be like for me when I get in there and you imagine

802
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:50,640
the version where you have where you have flubber and you are just like soaring around you are

803
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:55,600
bounding effortlessly. I feel like I imagine that I would be better at the bouncing than all the

804
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:01,040
other kids and they would be looking up at me like whoa did he practice how is this guy so I was

805
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:06,880
gonna be the employees would applaud when I was done instead I got in there and was just winded

806
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:13,680
within four seconds. Oh no. It was so much more like a bit painful and annoying and the possibility

807
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:18,880
of elbows flying from every which way you had like a limited amount of time like a buzzer goes

808
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:22,880
and then you got two minutes to bounce as much as you can I don't remember the actual amount of time

809
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:28,880
but I just remember it being like so sweaty and dark and disappointing and my parents like so and

810
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:34,160
I'm like yeah yeah good it was fine. How old so how old yeah five what are you five-ish? No older

811
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:38,320
than that probably seven eight or nine or something oh eight or nine yeah yeah I mean I'm about I love

812
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:44,880
a bounce house uh you I assumed before that too if you have a kid had a birthday we never had one for

813
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:50,640
my birthday but like if sometimes kids would rent one which was like how is that possible um and I'm

814
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:57,680
trying to think where else they would be. Well um uh like vacation towns they're very popular at the

815
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:02,000
amusement parks at the Jersey Shore. Oh yeah right right right we would do that yeah because those

816
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,480
were obviously did those have more surface area than Goofy's because it looks small when I look

817
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:10,720
at this a little small yeah which is like yeah you would think it would be big because it would need

818
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:16,640
to accommodate a lot of kids yeah um now these bounce plays these trampoline zones that fill up

819
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:21,360
all the dead malls uh these are massive spaces. I guess that's the innovation I was just thinking

820
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:27,040
like I feel like there's not a lot of bounce house innovation for kids but there has certainly

821
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:33,280
been a trend of like how do we make these bounce houses for these older millennial or these

822
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:39,040
millennials with disposable income. There are some yeah crazy ones you can rent or buy yeah I think

823
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:42,960
we looked there's like a Millennium Falcon one that might have been like two stories you can get

824
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:48,720
which is pretty wild and then yeah they sometimes they look almost like um what's the show Wipe Out

825
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:55,360
or something there's like a crazy kind of obstacle course that's inflatable but oof I still uh we

826
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,520
a friend of ours had a bounce house at a party a couple years ago and Anthony Gio and I just

827
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:06,320
did wrestling moves the whole time on it it's still good still so good yeah I was in some bounce house

828
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:13,280
scenario with my son uh for a lay was like a it was like a 10-15 minutes might be the best moment

829
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:19,360
of having a child oh yeah just laugh at euphoria yeah all the pictures are like wow I don't think

830
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:25,120
I've seen myself that's happy yeah ever bounce house truly can be special places although even

831
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:30,960
in that uh I like came very close to hurting myself very badly oh yeah guys when you did it

832
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:36,880
no not in that instance I'm not actually like cool like difficult though in the way am I crazy

833
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:41,120
to find the bounce houses to be very exhausting they would be tired I remember being a kid and

834
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:47,040
they would be tiring yeah I don't remember ever like hurting myself me isn't it look as an adult

835
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:52,400
I'm sure it's very possible you've heard me talk about the Achilles tendons I am having issues with

836
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:57,280
although that's doing better now that I got better shoes so I'm not I'm sure I'm sure something

837
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:01,360
could happen but when we were in that bounce house a couple maybe we were just so good at

838
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:05,360
doing professional wrestling moves that there was no problem we were so safe with each other

839
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:11,600
good enough so if you're good in a bounce house you're a safe worker yeah I'm very safe yeah I'm

840
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:19,360
like Brett Hart I never hurt anybody in the ring in the bounce house um you know what's maybe you

841
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:23,840
know if I have some slightly anti-bounce house feelings at all maybe as well maybe I had some

842
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:28,640
trouble when I was a goofy bounce house kind of winded me and then years later uh in a relationship

843
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:37,280
that that uh ended long ago I was cheated on in a bounce house oh wow like there was a party that

844
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:43,680
I left and then I came back to it unexpectedly oh no there was a lot of like oh you scots oh uh huh

845
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,760
well here why don't you uh wait here for a month and at that moment oh my god there was a hookup

846
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:57,440
occurring in a bounce house wow holy crap now defiling now it's all clear now it's pretty clear

847
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:02,080
that maybe it's like a psychosomatic thing when you get in a bounce house these days even

848
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:07,200
like you just start to feel pain it's like a deep pain you're feeling because of this like memory

849
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:13,680
it's much more like a betrayal house than a bounce house well they literally they look like surreal

850
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:19,040
dream versions of a house in the way the dreams it's always like it was my house but not my house

851
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:25,680
that's why what is in my head like it's this like bulbous yeah unsettling right tim burton-esque

852
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:30,480
environment where they're evil to me were they both jumping up and down and kissing on the top

853
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:37,600
of their jumps i hope that's all it was uh-huh seems like more than that would be tough to line

854
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:44,880
up yeah seems pretty tough uh dangerous too depending on what position we're thinking uh

855
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,480
do you think this is what happened with walt and clare bell in goofy's house

856
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:55,440
where like horace was out so oh gosh are just a second horse you don't want to go in there

857
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:02,400
oh you don't want to see that you you'd want to take a look at my garden for a sec

858
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:10,080
oh that noise oh i don't know probably just does crows in the chimney let me get you a drink

859
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:17,200
scotch and soda i've ever said you're a handsome feller i don't compliment you enough for us that's

860
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:20,800
not walt's cup whereas my goofies are really turning into like slim pickings

861
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,160
is

862
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:28,160
mind you i had it for about two words i think my first the first thing i said i was like this is a

863
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:32,720
pretty good goofy you're doing and then i completely lost it as soon as we both thought yeah well this

864
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:37,120
is to see whether it be goofy voices or wrestling moves just don't ever question it that's a good

865
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:44,800
point yeah and listen and don't no uh hookups and bounce houses okay no i can speak to on the other

866
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:50,160
end yeah how it feels and i bet that's how it felt for horace whenever he found out too i bet it yeah

867
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:54,160
i bet it is walton is cow mistress

868
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,880
anyway uh so good tear it down i don't want any i don't want to do goofy's bouncer

869
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,960
it's being reimagined is what it says and i don't know how i don't know what it's

870
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,800
because it's just been a regular house for some yeah normal i don't know what they're doing with

871
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:14,960
it i think the gag factory seems like it's on the chopping block if it hasn't been oh that's gone

872
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:19,680
all right that's been gone for a while because of the thing um do you guys know what goofy's

873
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:24,400
bounce house is in japan this is a sort of recent thing that they know the only thing i know about

874
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:30,880
japan is that there was a massive entrance to tootown like a giant like hanger right or like a giant

875
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:35,360
overhang kind of thing no you're thinking of main street is where there's like there's like a big

876
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:41,680
like do you just walk into i believe oh i just mean i think i mean the sign's like a lot bigger

877
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:48,400
oh maybe i'm not sure um it's all well one one weird thing is it's reversed it's the exact same

878
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:54,320
physical layout of disneyland toontown but just flipped so if you go one way you think you're

879
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:57,840
going to roger rabbit but you're actually going to mickey's house you kind of enter towards the

880
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:04,480
middle too but otherwise it's so it's like a full mirror version right but also a long time ago

881
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:09,600
they got rid of they've gotten rid of all of the weird stuff that was hurting people right too and

882
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:15,600
it's it's i wonder if this is what they're going to do in disneyland it has been what is it called

883
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:22,880
it's called goofy's paint and play house and what it is is a kind of a stationary midway mania

884
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:28,480
it's the same devices it's a it's a string that you're pulling back and forth and you're with

885
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:34,240
projection mapping your live painting is house and causing a bunch of chain reactions and

886
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:39,440
cartoon violence and stuff stuff's falling over and flipping over and it looks pretty good so

887
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:44,160
maybe that is what they're going to do that's a good idea and i would say that that might be a

888
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:51,200
fun idea that seems fun seems like a plus up um did you guys come across toontown morning badness

889
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:57,760
a show that they did well this was it was it was two parts there does seem to be a show that would

890
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:03,280
kind of open toontown for the morning where the deputy mayor of toontown there's always a deputy

891
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:11,280
mayor introduces the mayor of toontown which is mickey mouse i didn't realize he had been given

892
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:18,080
mayor yeah he's a mayor okay uh lives there yeah yeah yeah mayor uh so this was uh you you would

893
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:23,840
get uh like let's say the park open at nine you would get an extra hour so from eight to nine

894
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:31,440
if you had booked through the disney travel company or triple a you would get this extra

895
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:39,440
hour the only thing is like you would have to enter you didn't you still entered the park like

896
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:44,960
touring plans that are run down on this where it's like if the park opens at eight a.m but toontown

897
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:50,640
would open at nine you you would be led into the park with everyone else so by the time you trekked

898
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:56,080
back to toontown your hour was not a full hour it doesn't start from the time you get there it's

899
01:24:56,080 --> 01:25:01,440
start you have to walk over well it starts with like whenever they open the gates so you still

900
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:08,880
have to like get through the line and then walk all the way back yeah yeah and this in fear as a

901
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:15,840
noted opponent of long walks as soon as you get to disneyland sure from my recent ailments but uh

902
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,840
yeah no i just think it's funny that it's just like you're having to explain it's like look i

903
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:24,000
booked a vacation package through the walt disney travel agency like that's probably why they

904
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:30,480
got rid in 2013 they just started doing those extra magic hours for like all resort guests

905
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:35,360
like on-site resort guests right so they got rid of it donald's boat i don't know what they're

906
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:41,520
doing to that exactly but it's um they you know that had a slide that they don't do anymore

907
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:48,320
so that's already that's been kind of scaled back yeah time so i don't know what that means to say

908
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:52,960
hopefully something neat happens there or it's going to be just a different color and the slide

909
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:59,120
still doesn't work very very possibly yeah um gadgets go coaster i believe is turning into

910
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:05,280
something else i saw that deep in an article probably a retheme right um but he's staying

911
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:11,680
a coaster like it's it's the form yeah i think it'll still be that track we rode that with griffin

912
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:16,720
right when he visited and i i don't think i had done it before and i was like oh it's pretty

913
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:22,400
pleasant little family coaster like if i was less for 15 seconds it's the shortest thing but it's

914
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:26,880
a really as soon as it's over like yeah that was it i get it for like a little kid is like their

915
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:33,120
first coaster like oh get a little taste of it but yeah yeah but um yeah they're not going to do

916
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:37,200
they're just going to call i mean there is this chip and dale movie coming out and i assume

917
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:42,880
gadgets because monterey jack is in the movie have they revealed the plan with gadget but i don't

918
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:47,280
know what the plan with gadget is do you know the plan i don't know i don't know but i have been

919
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:52,720
thinking this is if if the idea here is we're getting rid of gadget because people don't know

920
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:57,520
gadget anymore right from rescue rangers you're right it's odd to do that right before there's a

921
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:01,840
move maybe it isn't maybe they aren't taking her out i think i would be disappointed because

922
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:10,720
i would i i could admit that gadget is probably or was let's say was probably uh-oh primary cartoon

923
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:17,200
oh wow wow so many late episode revelations here this must have come

924
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:21,600
talking about real dating history wow gadget never would have cheated on me in that bounce

925
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:29,120
i was interested interesting gadget was very cool i like gadget yeah i like all the rest of her mind

926
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:34,480
you see sure i'm not accusing you of anything i'm just saying gadget had a cool vibe from the show

927
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:41,040
i could see that yeah um i feel like it was the vibe that i was attracted not the the mouse

928
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:48,800
test not that she was a man i'm not otherwise attracted to mice i swear and i know that i just

929
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:53,040
said that sentence and that makes it seem like that's not the case does seem like we're not

930
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:56,480
putting any pressure on you to like force you to say something like that but that just came out i

931
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:02,000
just want to put that out there that you offer that up on your own yeah because that's what you do

932
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:09,600
when you don't yeah you know it's the look and the you know she's got cool hair i don't think

933
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:17,120
this is that unheard i think this is within the realm of uh you know fox robin hood or um is it

934
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:23,760
roxanne from the goofy movie oh yes yeah sure yeah right yeah well they're anthropomorphic they have

935
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:30,480
human voices you know it's uh i look i don't think the attraction to roxanne is based on a

936
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:37,920
big wet nose i don't think that's why well i can't speak for everyone yeah i was not i didn't i was

937
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:43,760
not interested interested in me me little flu when i was younger uh she was only in the oh no she was

938
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,520
i think in the cartoon too yeah she was in the cartoon and the comic um i'm trying to think

939
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:52,240
jason are there any king features into the kit or pop by characters you would like to clear the air

940
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:57,520
and say that you're not you weren't into them oh i wasn't into okay i was gonna say like you

941
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:03,280
absolutely were i had a crush on blondie but of course she's take and that i don't think she'd

942
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:08,880
ever leave dagwood so um that's why nobody is giving these rights to disney because walt was

943
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:14,640
dagwood was all right afraid walt wouldn't right he knows walt's reputation and tune time yeah he

944
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:21,280
heard uh i'm trying to i'm really trying to think of all the disney afternoon characters who was i

945
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:30,800
most attracted to uh let's think here um magica dispel maybe from duck tail no no maybe pete's

946
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:37,760
wife on goof troop what was pete's wife wasn't her name peg peg from goof troop what was her

947
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:42,960
vibe she was just kind of like a like a mom like a cool mom peg from when i hear that i think of

948
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:47,920
like don't you know but that's bobby's mom on bobby yeah yeah i don't know i don't have such a yeah

949
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:54,880
you remember peg come on scott peg's wife yeah i don't know i this isn't such a strong memory of

950
01:29:54,880 --> 01:30:01,840
anything i'm just trying to figure out um she's you know she's very much mom it's a mom style

951
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:08,000
because she's like an old saloon dress in this photo yeah i mean one or two channels over i mean

952
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:14,480
you had um the batman animated series with catwoman every catwoman i think has been someone's crush

953
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:19,120
well yeah when you get to when yeah when you get to like i'm trying to think of like pre sort of

954
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:24,000
like puberty things like because like i really like when i'm 12 and 13 like you love every ex

955
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:29,280
woman on the x-men that's not weird yeah but i'm trying to think of that weird thing where

956
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:34,560
your like brain is starting to like get confused it's like seeing a half human half animal and

957
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:42,080
it's like why do i feel yeah yeah by the way in google imaging for peg from goof troop this is

958
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:48,000
a tweet from 2018 from the user jacksblade fitness and the tweet is you ever realize peg from goof

959
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:53,680
troop pete's wife openly cheated on her husband with goofy numerous times and there are a bunch

960
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:59,120
of photos what of her kissing and this is the one because here she's a little more revealing

961
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:06,560
right like this is like a cocktail dress and she is laying it on uh goofy in glasses are these real

962
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:13,760
yeah i think so i mean or else they were expertly vhs aged wow what is that i mean i really just

963
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:18,800
threw that out i don't have such a strong memory of all the storylines i go through moments

964
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:25,040
technically that he pulled but maybe there were more um jeez we're finding out who all the all

965
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:32,320
the cheaters are in the disney world i pete seems like he checked out a long time he was a bad guy

966
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:37,760
oh he's yeah he doesn't seem available emotionally for weeks at a time yep right that's a perfect

967
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:44,240
comparison where are you going none of your business i i thought of the the older uh a crush

968
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:52,160
because i i mean so so many of like the the women on disney afternoon it's like we're like very

969
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:58,880
young yes but yeah yeah the the age that i would have been like pre-nick to i mean because i feel

970
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:05,280
like the characters on doug were more like human like but penny from inspector gadget she had a

971
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:11,040
lot of gumption yeah but that's a human child that's a child you're looking for more answer

972
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:17,440
from more of it i'm just trying for animals so it's not weird jason yeah yeah yeah right i'm

973
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:23,040
just trying to the animals yeah the only acceptable answers are animals yeah because robin yeah fox

974
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:29,680
robin hood that's what really fucks with us as little kids is is that type of thing was the

975
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:36,800
good was the girl one yeah was marrying attractive yeah she was cute oh there you go you're pretty

976

01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:51,760
half women oh what's her face uh from the rescue ranger or not the rescue ranger the rescuers

1006
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:45,840

1007
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:49,360
there if we missed anything you want to hear us talk about it we could break off into its own

1013
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:31,840
have also that's me that i think is like an epilogue probably but it's also and i think it's

1014
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:36,720
applicable because it's in the realm of you know you're talking attraction between cartoon

1015
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:46,000
characters this was expressed uh beautifully uh in a song in a song from 1929 okay uh the song is

1016
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,280
called minis you who uh the reason i'm bringing it up is there was there was some uh toon town

1017
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:57,440
video i was watching that said oh the song that's playing right now is minis you and that was a hit

1018
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:04,400
song for the disney company in 1929 it was the first uh song that disney released sheet music

1019
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:10,160
for which was of course the way that you bought music before music was available to actually

1020
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:19,440
listen to um uh so anyway minis you who um i'd heard of this song definitely it's like oh like

1040
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:38,320
