1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Warning, today's episode features the ominous rise of a powerful political regime, terrifying

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,860
Vietnam-esque flashbacks involving Ernest P. Worrell, and four white guys nervously

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,120
tiptoeing around a weird old racist movie.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,920
Anthony Gio takes the plunge on Splash Mountain.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,920
How do you do?

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:38,240
It's Podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,920
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the amusement park podcast hosted by three men who've been

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,880
collectively soaked in at least 100 gallons of dirty theme park water.

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,600
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,600
Hello.

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,600
And Scott Gairdner.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,720
Hey, I got splashed the other day at Universal very unpleasantly at The Simpsons ride.

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,400
It felt like just a literal slap in the face made out of water.

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
It was gross.

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,120
Still reeling and I hope there's no boils on my cheek that you can see and I haven't

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
noticed.

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,640
There's enough chlorine in that, I'm sure.

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
It doesn't matter.

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,320
It's dirty, but it's free of germs, I think.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,760
It's a specified kind of dirty they created.

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,880
Yes, and today we're joined by a very special guest.

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,040
You know him from Pop TV's Return of the Mac and as a writer on People of Earth, it's Anthony

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,560
Gio, ladies and gentlemen.

25
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,560
Hey, guys.

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,600
I gotta say, before we even get started, I am so honored to be here.

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,760
I'm a big fan of the podcast.

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
I think it's great.

29
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
Thank you.

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,080
It's the only, I have a short commute right now and it's the only one I make time.

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,560
Oh, thank you so much.

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,880
So just like in, at, our typical episodes have been like two and a half hours lately,

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,320
so you're getting through them in like five weeks since.

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,800
Yeah, I've listened to the preview so far.

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Sure.

36
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,480
Well, hey, eat shit this American life.

37
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,040
Get down.

38
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,360
Get down in one car at least.

39
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,560
Well, we're very happy to have you.

40
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,840
We're excited because this is a great topic.

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,240
It's a weird topic.

42
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,840
We're talking Splash Mountain.

43
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
Yeah.

44
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,640
So, yeah, there's a ton to talk about there.

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,920
Before though, before we start, I do want to get your sort of viewpoint on this and

46
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,080
I have a few ideas.

47
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,520
It starts sort of with a sad story and the mayor of Main Street in Orlando, there is

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:24,360
a position basically for cast members where someone is actually the mayor of Disney World

49
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,400
or Disneyland.

50
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Right, right.

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,920
My girlfriend, Lindsay, and I found this out a couple of years ago.

52
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,480
We went to, I think it was like the 59th anniversary and they have all the characters come out.

53
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,860
It's a big celebration.

54
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,040
And then all of a sudden this man in a top hat comes out and they go, introducing the

55
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
mayor of Disneyland.

56
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,120
And we were like, the mayor of Disneyland?

57
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
Right.

58
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,200
Like we were very surprised to see that this is a position.

59
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,880
Is he the guy that, I was there in 2012 at Disney World, is he the guy that welcomes

60
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,640
Casey Jr. and opens the park or is that a different position?

61
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
That might be right.

62
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,700
I actually don't know all of his duties as mayor.

63
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,420
But it seems like that would be a position.

64
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,280
But the sad news is that the man who played the mayor, who was the mayor, Christopher

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,720
George Weaver, passed away in December.

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,720
Of Disney World?

67
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,720
Of Disney World.

68
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,240
So I had not seen this gentleman.

69
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,680
I saw a different gentleman and I'm not sure his name.

70
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
The Disneyland mayor.

71
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
Yeah.

72
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,800
But the thing that I thought, Lindsay and I thought when we saw the Disneyland mayor

73
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:30,040
was, wouldn't it be perfect in a few years time if our very own Jason Sheridan could

74
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,040
become a Disneyland mayor?

75
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
The Disneyland mayor.

76
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,240
I mean, I'm open to Orlando as well, but since he lives in Los Angeles, I, yeah, I can't

77
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,480
think of someone better.

78
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,160
As long as he can stay awake, he can have the job.

79
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,240
Like, hey, look, there's multiple apartments in the park.

80
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,840
So if I cannot stay awake, take a little power nap, have a cup of coffee.

81
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,080
I'm right back in it.

82
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
Oh yeah.

83
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,240
You'd probably live up in Walt's old apartment above the fire station.

84
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,480
Yeah, the old apartment and a nice summer in the dream suite.

85
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,860
Which is now just the dining room.

86
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,640
So I guess I just put a pillow on a long dining room table.

87
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,800
Wouldn't be the first time you did that.

88
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,080
Hey, all right.

89
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:13,240
Jason, you would have this like astronomical, uh, ascension into this amazing position and

90
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,080
then you would be embroiled in some sort of, you'd be like indicted for like stealing churros

91
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:24,180
or something like something would happen where like you, yeah, yeah, like they would just

92
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,540
like come down to this like huge controversy.

93
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:33,520
I've slowly been making a chef's Oscars, a famous famous potatoes with peppers and onions

94
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,840
have less and less peppers selling them off to another party.

95
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,040
And a massive pepper smuggling scandal.

96
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,560
Laundering peppers.

97
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
Laundering breakfast peppers.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,120
What would you say, Jason, what would you do?

99
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,680
Like, I'm guessing there are like a list of like type of things that the mayor does do.

100
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,040
It sounds like there's some ceremonial type duties.

101
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,000
I think that's what I probably, that was right.

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,160
I mean, I think it's a position where he's in the park a lot.

103
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
Probably an opening.

104
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
Yeah.

105
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
Every morning I think.

106
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
Uh huh.

107
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,840
And Casey jr comes at least on big day, especially important days.

108
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
Yeah.

109
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,840
So what would you know?

110
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
Casey jr is a fantasy land.

111
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
Yeah.

112
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
Casey railroad.

113
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,840
Oh, I'm thinking Casey jr too.

114
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,680
I bet he like, oh, I'll be checking.

115
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,880
Well, that'll be Jason's thing.

116
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,800
Cause that's Jason's favorite train at Disney.

117
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,000
So no, probably hitting like the Casey jr each morning with a bottle of champagne.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh yeah.

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,120
That's the only alcohol in the park outside club 33 is when I just am constantly dedicating,

120
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,520
rededicating stuff by my own volition.

121
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Why isn't he throwing a bottle of champagne and get some work towing in the middle of

122
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
the afternoon.

123
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Yeah.

124
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Hey, who's up for a dedication?

125
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,120
You kid, you look like you could smash a bottle or two.

126
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,040
You know, I have to say, I think my, uh, well first off I would wear a sash at all times

127
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,300
like mayor Quimby.

128
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,120
That's a given, right?

129
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,320
Just one at least one.

130
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Let's up the gaze.

131
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,440
Sashes just on your arms, wrists, legs, sashes, top hat with its own sash.

132
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,220
Uh, you know, I think I want to be a mayor of the people, you know, I think I'd be inspired

133
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,240
by the, the Jeremy Corbyn campaign for the many, not the field.

134
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
Okay.

135
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Wait a minute here.

136
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,720
So I would like to make some socialist mayor of the first democratic socialist of America,

137
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
mayor of Disneyland.

138
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,160
Uh, you know, the millennial voters I think will get behind me and I would like to make

139
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
radical changes.

140
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,480
One, the Mark Twain runs at night so everyone could enjoy riverboat ride after fantastic

141
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,520
to the vehicles of main street.

142
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,200
Never stop running.

143
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,140
They stop, they stop when it gets as the crowds get more in the day, no more.

144
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,880
We got to figure out a crowd solution so we can keep the Omni bus going.

145
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,880
And today 1130 at night, everybody's leaving from fireworks and the, that thing's got a

146
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,760
thicker bus through still going.

147
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,800
They go during the fireworks.

148
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,160
We figure we need to find a new place to send off fireworks from so that we can keep attractions

149
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,440
open during fireworks so we can experience them from a new viewpoint.

150
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,320
These are the sorts of radical positions that will be in my platform.

151
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,620
I mean, this is, I mean, I, I ambush Jason with this, but he has all this stuff ready

152
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,620
to go.

153
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,620
This is so serious.

154
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,280
He is, he has all of these viewpoints already.

155
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,040
He'll be the first socialist mayor of Disneyland.

156
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
I'll go one more.

157
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
I got more.

158
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Okay.

159
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,000
Uh, the Gibson girl ice cream parlor.

160
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,880
Either we need to up the quality of that ice grids, delicious ice cream, but I think we

161
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,880
could do better.

162
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,440
It's the happiest place on earth or if not more varieties of Edie's dryers ice cream

163
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
available for purchase.

164
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,040
You know, that kind of, uh, I'll say I, you have my vote if we can get dryers.

165
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,080
I feel like I can, it takes me out of it sometimes.

166
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,560
I almost want them just to lie to me and be like, this is made here.

167
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,360
I, there are certain parts of the park where I see like, Oh, dryers.

168
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,880
Like, you know, that's the, the, the frostiest one at Albertson that like no one picks your

169
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,640
outsourcing instead of using a Disneyland local.

170
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Yeah.

171
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,240
Want more jobs on site, more jobs on site, more flavors in mouth.

172
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,040
I will taste as many flare.

173
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,440
I will say I will not rest until I tasted all of the treats.

174
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,000
Uh, universal students, Hollywood just up their game.

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,320
They have all these crazy saucer flavors now, expensive milkshakes with like, you know,

176
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,760
sauce and donuts.

177
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,880
Voodoo don't need to strike back.

178
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,880
We need to strike back.

179
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,600
Also ballast point brewery.

180
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
You're on notice.

181
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:42,880
You're opening soon, but you're, you're very expensive at grocery stores.

182
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,240
I better not see that sort of thing in downtown Disney.

183
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,640
And it better be flavors like pina colada beer and cotton candy beer.

184
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,120
I want sweet treats.

185
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm okay with that.

186
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,680
They're actually one of the brewers that do fruit beers reasonably well.

187
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,920
All right, so we're off to a good start, but we're on you ballast point.

188
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,560
This is the most awake I've seen him.

189
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,800
You're literally reclined on a couch next to a puppy.

190
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,400
With a dog at my feet.

191
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,840
It's like the carousel of progress.

192
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,340
This is like John and the carousel of progress.

193
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,760
But if I had a day bed.

194
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,560
Well you're in dry uncle Orville mode is what you're in.

195
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Yeah.

196
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,280
Shout out to recent animatronic of the month winner, uncle Orville.

197
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,800
Uncle Orville won.

198
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,840
We had lovely fan art of me.

199
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,000
Kat to make the Mark Twain.

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh boy.

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah, you're riding high.

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,040
You're kicking back, enjoying the fruits of your success.

203
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Yeah.

204
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,140
So what you want to do as mayor.

205
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:42,160
So when the scandal goes down, Jason, well I'll assume churros, but you know, it could

206
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,320
be maybe the bell peppers.

207
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,120
And special counsel Tony Baxter indicts you.

208
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:58,520
What is that going to maybe do to your feelings towards your great land?

209
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,280
Would you be willing to talk to him though?

210
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
You'd be willing to sit down with him?

211
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,480
Have a conversation?

212
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:10,480
You know, I would, well first off I'll default to my team of attorneys.

213
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
And then I would probably.

214
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,480
Goofy and Clarabelle.

215
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:26,320
Jason's in better shape than any mayor of Disneyland has been, says Dr. Cogsworth.

216
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,520
The fittest mayor of all time.

217
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,240
And that is just in.

218
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:38,240
Jason Demine Spinlock is nothing but an aide that had nothing to do with his counsel.

219
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:46,120
And then yeah, I would much like in the Iran Contra, other people took the fall to shield

220
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
Reagan.

221
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,120
I would, yes, Spinlock is going down.

222
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,680
The timekeeper, unfortunately though he's been enjoying his retirement.

223
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
Sorry timekeeper.

224
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,200
You're doing some time.

225
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,420
The Disneyland marching band refused to perform at your inauguration ceremony.

226
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,280
You got three doors down.

227
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,760
Joy Villa is there plenty though.

228
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,520
She is there constantly in a different Main Street USA garish dress.

229
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,520
You can call me Sheridan.

230
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:25,400
Customized song for you.

231
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,160
This is a very exciting idea.

232
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,440
So we're just, maybe we'll throw it to the listeners.

233
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,100
Like Jason for maybe we do a hashtag.

234
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,720
Is it Jason for mayor or Jason for Disneyland?

235
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,400
What Mr. Mayor, what would you think?

236
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,400
You have a preference?

237
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,200
Yeah.

238
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,000
I mean I like, I think Jason for Disneyland.

239
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah.

240
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,040
Jason for with a number four.

241
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Yeah.

242
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
Jason for Disneyland.

243
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,040
Okay.

244
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,520
Is probably pretty distinctive.

245
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
Yeah.

246
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Yeah.

247
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
Mayor need to factor in?

248
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
Mayor Jason for, I don't know.

249
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
It's gotta be simple.

250
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
Well, yeah.

251
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,120
Well, I mean Jason for Disneyland mayor, I guess.

252
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,600
Well it be because it goes beyond just being mayor.

253
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,160
It's Jason for all of Disneyland.

254
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Oh yeah.

255
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
I give to all.

256
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
That's you representing.

257
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Yeah.

258
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,920
Jason for mayor DLR, Disneyland Resort.

259
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Okay.

260
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
Yeah.

261
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,920
Yeah.

262
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,920
Jason for DLR.

263
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,000
Jason, because you're Disneyland first.

264
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,680
You're going to be the one to put Disneyland first.

265
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,040
Just to be clear, whatever we land on, people are just tweeting this?

266
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,040
That's it.

267
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,440
And that's the exact, that's how it's going to have to happen.

268
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Yeah.

269
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
No one is tagged.

270
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,440
In another way, like if you went to Disneyland and put a letter into the box, if there's

271
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,760
a box at city hall, maybe we need to go and step.

272
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,000
Maybe there's needs to be an in-person campaign.

273
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And this doesn't have to be tomorrow.

274
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,360
This doesn't have to be in five years.

275
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,760
I'm talking in 20 years.

276
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
Oh yeah.

277
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
Right.

278
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,640
When you look like a mayor for sure.

279
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,560
Like you'll look like a mayor.

280
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Yeah.

281
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,480
Movements don't happen overnight.

282
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,560
This is a long game, you know?

283
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,920
So I would like a written agreement from Disneyland that you will be installed as mayor or at

284
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,520
least a fair election will happen.

285
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,520
Yeah.

286
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
Yeah.

287
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,420
In a Conan J. Tonight Show-esque situation in five years when the current mayor steps

288
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,420
down as number one mayor.

289
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,420
He's agreed to it.

290
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,420
He's agreed to it.

291
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,420
Yeah, yeah.

292
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,420
And he'll do the handover, no problem.

293
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,120
There'll be no funny business.

294
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,760
Nine months, it'll still be Jason.

295
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Don't worry.

296
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
Yeah.

297
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,160
And I want same day registration.

298
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,200
I want open elections, same day party change.

299
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,680
You know?

300
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
Sure.

301
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,680
I also, another agenda I want to put on your radar, I think you should try to bring the

302
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
Olympics to Disneyland.

303
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,920
Disneyland Olympics 2036.

304
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,400
That's an excellent, and it's, we know from Olympics coming to any city, it's great for

305
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
the economy.

306
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,160
It's great for quality of life.

307
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Right.

308
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
And long-term wellbeing.

309
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
Breathing.

310
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,920
It helps the air pollution.

311
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,880
And Disneyland could use a new swimming arena and ropes.

312
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
Absolutely.

313
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,400
And if there's one thing Disneyland could use more of, it's money.

314
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,200
And we've seen already with the Disneyland, when they had the circus early nineties that

315
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,320
they're able to put in different acts.

316
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,320
There was a promotion, what do you like 91 or 92, somewhere around there, right?

317
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,560
Where they had circus performers doing circus acts just in the middle of Disneyland.

318
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,040
Did you go Scott during that time?

319
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
No, I missed that.

320
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
Okay.

321
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:27,600
I think there was like, there was a state fair theme for a little while, like one summer.

322
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,080
And then I think there was also a more extreme circus, like with the motorcycles in the cage

323
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
on Main Street.

324
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,080
Oh yeah, I think so.

325
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,160
And then some of the older Imagineers were like, we can't do this.

326
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,080
So you're telling me a real nitro circus.

327
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,680
Yes, something along a nitro circus X game sort of line.

328
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,560
Weirdest hour, you were reminding us via Twitter about the Disneyland Pogs promotion.

329
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,680
Maybe this is your chance to start in another Pogs too.

330
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,840
Oh, this is the time to bring back a Pog Wild and Rollerblade Crazy.

331
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,560
That's the spring break promotion at Disney World in the mid 90s.

332
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,880
This is a perfect thing for you to campaign on.

333
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,600
When Jason is mayor, there will be, we will go Pog Crazy again.

334
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,640
We have forgotten, we have forgotten our past.

335
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,400
We have forgotten just how wild Pogs are and how crazy Rollerblades are.

336
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:23,920
So much so that Scott, Disneyland expert, thought it was Pog Crazy, not Pog Wild.

337
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
We all don't remember our heritage.

338
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,040
Yeah, it's time to change that.

339
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,240
There's so much, and I think we can build up a lot of platforms.

340
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Sure.

341
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,040
A new, new deal for Main Street.

342
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
Great.

343
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,280
How do we, can we all sort of pick a role within, I think you as the first, I think

344
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:50,120
you're the Bannon of, oh yeah, you're the, you're the, I'm going to be, you're my buddy,

345
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,640
Steve Bannon.

346
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,000
He's the smartest man and I'm the smartest man too.

347
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,760
Masterminded his way out of Breitbart, just like he wanted, just like the plan was.

348
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,200
He's a Machiavellian genius.

349
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,840
I will be much the same.

350
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,680
Five dimensional chess for Mike.

351
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,880
And maybe when Jason gets installed, people will be like, oh my God, it's a coup.

352
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,440
These guys know what they're doing.

353
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Oh wow.

354
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,440
Yeah.

355
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,280
So Mike's chief of staff slash body man.

356
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
What else do we need?

357
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,920
I mean, I can be a Kellyanne Conway.

358
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,280
I can be out there sort of, you know, on the, on the morning shows on, I'll be on the hotel

359
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,720
TVs reminding everyone what a great job you're doing.

360
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Sure.

361
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,600
In press guy, communications guy, right?

362
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,240
Telling people to buy your clothing brands to buy your, your varieties of wine, polos,

363
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,760
the shirt and Tommy Bahama.

364
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,560
That's too expensive.

365
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,400
No outlet Tommy Bahama.

366
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,160
Tommy Bahama at the Nordstrom.

367
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,440
Jason Bahama.

368
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
They're beautiful shirts.

369
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,320
Tommy's younger brother.

370
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,000
Perfect quality for half the price.

371
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And then that voice is that sort of a Conway.

372
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,120
I'm trying to do a little bit of a generic smarmy woman, but kind of Conway.

373
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,800
I thought you were trying to do the Coke boy, the son of one of the Coke boy.

374
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Do you know that guy?

375
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:20,160
One of the brothers adult son has like a very garish clothing line.

376
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,360
It's like Hawaiian to say these kinds of things.

377
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,920
But like I, this is what I think.

378
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,280
He looks insane.

379
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,640
Like his, yeah, his, he looks like a fake person.

380
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,280
Like he's like a cabbage man and the shirt and every shirt has like three or at least

381
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,760
different patterns on it.

382
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:44,160
It'll be like a Hawaiian shirt, but then a Helm's tooth collar and the cuffs are a different

383
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
color.

384
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,240
It's what like rich people think fun attire is.

385
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
It's at all.

386
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,520
It's not tasteful like normal Hawaiian shirts.

387
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,520
No.

388
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,000
Or like my many mayoral sashes will be.

389
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah.

390
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You'll have the palm tree or two on this.

391
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Are you kidding?

392
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah.

393
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,360
It'll still, it's so not tasteful.

394
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,240
It'll be the new taste.

395
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,720
I don't know if it's too early to call for more fan art, but.

396
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Oh yeah.

397
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
No, no, no.

398
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,800
Where are the podcasts that demands it?

399
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:16,400
I think that if we're asking for more fan art, I think it's Jason in a mayoral outfit, which

400
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:23,520
I picture like, like a big like top hat, like, like, I guess like was wall double cobble

401
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:32,920
pot from the Batman Returns, a Turkey leg at the podium in front of the train.

402
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,060
Instead of, it's a press conference with many microphones, but instead they're all Turkey

403
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,120
legs that you fit in, you take with you and eat when conferences over.

404
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,160
Maybe a chimichanga.

405
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,720
I really legitimately liked the chimichangas.

406
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
That's a great snack.

407
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,520
You can get to walk around with.

408
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,520
Uh, Anthony, where do you want to factor into this campaign or if you had to say a Trump

409
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,880
equivalent, Trump equivalent, cause I'm just a guest from any master for many Kevin.

410
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:03,680
No, but I think you're, you were here for the Rob Lowe kind of liaison sort of like

411
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,160
you are my voice on the Hill.

412
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,800
Rob Lowe is a part of the Trump administration.

413
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
No, no.

414
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,040
I mean it West Wing turns West Wing.

415
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,080
You get caught having sex at the DNC.

416
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,880
I was going to say, cause I'm a guest, like I was like maybe just fitting.

417
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,280
I'd be like a Michael Flynn.

418
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,280
I'm in and I'm out.

419
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,400
I'm like, a scared mooch.

420
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Papadopoulos maybe?

421
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
A Papadopoulos.

422
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,760
If Ursula had done a 10th of the things, if I'd done a 10th of the things Ursula has done,

423
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,920
I'd be in some sea jail today.

424
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
So let's see.

425
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,080
Uh, man, well since I'm here just from the inception, I feel like, oh yeah, maybe I could

426
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,480
take a role of, um, uh, you know what I'd love to be?

427
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,800
I love to be when Jason's got to take his frequent naps.

428
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,120
I want to be the Stephen Miller that steps out and just maybe, maybe speaks on his behalf.

429
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,240
I think you are, I think you are my, the guy I send and when they, when you walk into the

430
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,400
California adventure city, they're like, oh shit.

431
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
Like, right.

432
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,040
When you show up at the Disneyland hotel, like, oh, business is going down.

433
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,680
Business is going down.

434
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:16,120
A fitted suit, a giant ass forehead and I'm walking in and I'm coming in and all of my

435
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,120
decisions are clearly, uh, catalyzed by grudges I held in high school.

436
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
Oh yeah.

437
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:29,160
No more, Walt's policy of Disney executives picking up their own trash.

438
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,200
Why should we do that?

439
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,600
When there's janitors to pick up the trash floor.

440
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,720
You're not picking up trash like Walt, Jason.

441
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,720
You're uh, no, you're above the peons.

442
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:47,800
So maybe if we bring it back to the hashtag, uh, I'd love for people to, I would love to

443
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,760
see as a fan, the drawings that come in, but I love maybe if we could check in on the hashtag

444
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:58,440
at some point, see like what do people want to see from Jason as an ideal candidate?

445
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,360
Well, yeah, transparency is important.

446
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,360
I mean, they are the people I work for them.

447
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
Yes.

448
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,160
You know, now Jason, will you open up your Wells Fargo account for all of us to see all

449
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,080
of your statements and whatnot?

450
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,080
Yeah.

451
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,400
Your credit cards, your, your bank account, your checking and your savings.

452
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
Uh, my domestic accounts.

453
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Sure.

454
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,320
Fortunately, most of my money's overseas or at the Caymans.

455
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,240
I just can't get access to that.

456
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:38,840
Disney's private Cay as part of the, they're buried in a castaway Cay private Island.

457
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,640
It's a little bit buried at Aulani, but mostly it's in castaway Cay.

458
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,640
Yeah.

459
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,440
There is some gold, uh, there's some bullion buried.

460
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,400
Just in case things start to go south.

461
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,080
This all ends with you living on a cruise in international waters, a Disney cruise where

462
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,120
you can't be touched.

463
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,160
Weird how like the Disney magic docs like once a week, but the Disney dream never comes

464
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,360
into a domestic waters.

465
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,040
That's all about here.

466
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,040
I am a, and there's, it's maritime law.

467
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:15,400
I can do what I want and you have two dinners at the buffet and you have experience piloting

468
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,280
the Mark Twain so you can easily drive the dream.

469
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
Yeah.

470
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,840
If something, if there is a mutiny, I can take control.

471
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,480
I can lock myself in the break and take control of the ship.

472
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,400
Uh, all right, well there's a lot of plans.

473
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:38,720
There's a hidden Mickey Mickey at the cyanide capsule in my hollowed out molar.

474
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,400
He's gone catatonic.

475
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,160
Um, well look, if you're going to, if you are going to be successfully elected, you

476
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,040
need to start playing to all the districts.

477
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:53,080
And one of the areas that you will have jurisdiction over of course is critter country.

478
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,080
Absolutely.

479
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
So let's turn that.

480
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Are you blue or you red?

481
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,600
I don't know what color, if you want to represent a color, what, what color do you want to,

482
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,760
uh, critter country to light up on your electoral map?

483
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,760
Oh, uh, well you're a socialist, so you're left leaning.

484
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
So I guess red.

485
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,760
Yeah.

486
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Yeah.

487
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,760
See if you can get a small rose somewhere in those drawings too to represent our people

488
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
power.

489
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,680
Traditionally though, critter country is gone red.

490
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,480
So it shouldn't be a problem.

491
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,960
So that's the American definition of red in politics.

492
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:30,360
But to be honest, it's red, it red with the rose and it's, it's, it's my hand shaking

493
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,600
a bear paw to show, but if you guys, I don't want to cooperation, I don't want to get into

494
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,840
it, but if you've actually in like I'm saying actually looked at a map of critter country,

495
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,600
the gerrymandering of this place, it is insanity.

496
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,200
The hungry bear is like, like sides of the hungry bear top floor and bottom floor, separate

497
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,080
parts of district districts and the star Wars land is just going to keep, keep ruining it

498
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,440
further because there's a whole now trail.

499
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,560
That's where the money is.

500
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,920
They're going to start lobbying as soon as possible.

501
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,640
Well sounds like I've got a lot of work on my hands cleaning up this mess.

502
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,280
Hashtag Jason for DLR.

503
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,840
It just rolls off the tongue, Michael.

504
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
Great, great.

505
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,320
We'll see how it goes.

506
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,040
But hey, let's, well let's, let's start playing into your critter country constituents and

507
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,280
talk about splash mountain a little bit.

508
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,280
Here we go.

509
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,840
Uh, yeah.

510
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
So geo, you picked splash mountain.

511
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,240
Uh, what were you thinking?

512
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,760
Well, uh, I mean I might be wrong.

513
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:38,560
I'll be happy to hear from you guys, but like splash mountain to me, it feels like, and

514
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,400
this could be like me having been tainted from my childhood experience.

515
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,520
I feel it's like one of the big biggest rides.

516
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,440
Like I feel like it's like when you think of amusement parks, like splash mountain is,

517
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,400
is one of the, one of the big ones.

518
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:57,760
Um, but so I, uh, not to like weigh this down too much with a personal story.

519
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:05,520
When I first went to Disney world in 1994, uh, the geo family packed up their arrow star.

520
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,240
Uh, I think it did not have air conditioning.

521
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,440
Uh, and we made our way down to Florida.

522
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:20,440
Um, I was so excited, preemptively aware of and excited for a splash mountain because

523
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,720
I think they did a big TV special opening for it.

524
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:31,140
I would imagine like there was so much coverage, so much coverage cause they had spent so much

525
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,760
money on it.

526
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
I've come to learn.

527
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,920
And this was when they had like the ABC relationship big to like, like they like, I feel like Disney

528
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,000
around this way in our childhoods did like 12 specials a year.

529
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yes.

530
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Burning through special money.

531
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,960
Every sitcom family on, on TGIF went to yes.

532
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,080
Without exception, without exception.

533
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,480
Pretty much dinosaurs, but right.

534
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
But excuse.

535
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,320
I mean they should have some equivalents.

536
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
Yeah.

537
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,600
I remember, uh, so just getting very excited for it.

538
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,160
I remember the special was about, uh, like the water wasn't running and they had a figure,

539
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,560
find some sort of magic to get the water run and I fucking ate it up.

540
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
I loved it.

541
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,520
I was like, I want to go to this magical place.

542
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:23,520
So we ended up getting down there and um, I had like voiced this to my fan, my dad.

543
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,080
He was like, all right, yeah, we'll head right to it.

544
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,960
Uh, and so we go to it.

545
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,560
And it was the type of vacation where we had one day in the magic kingdom.

546
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,320
Um, and then, you know, maybe at the time obviously Epcot was there, animal kingdom

547
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,320
was not there yet.

548
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,460
So like it was established like we have one day and we get to the ride and it's broken

549
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,120
down and it's out of order.

550
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
And I took it hard.

551
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Like I was, I was just like a little kid and I, I just remember being like, well, like

552
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,840
I think I was just in denial.

553
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,280
I like went through the states of it.

554
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,720
I was like, well, no, it's not.

555
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,040
Uh, that signs temporary.

556
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,920
You know, like, well I'll wait around.

557
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:05,000
And like clearly my sister who's a little older than me, like she was still a kid.

558
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,400
She was like, what the fuck are we doing?

559
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Let's move.

560
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
Let's move.

561
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,400
Like I want to go see stuff as well.

562
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,360
And I was like, oh no, no, this isn't happening.

563
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:18,480
And so I didn't ride it and I ha I didn't go back to Disney world until 2012.

564
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
Whoa.

565
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,600
So six, what, six plus?

566
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Yeah.

567
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,480
So eight, you know, we're like 18 years later.

568
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:31,920
Uh, my family did our next Disney world trip cause my sister has children now and it, uh,

569
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:39,260
it was like a really big moment where like I got in line and like I took it in and there,

570
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:46,560
I will say like for a lot of great Disney rides do this, but, uh, the, uh, splash mountain

571
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,940
feels like it's a long ride.

572
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,880
Like it feels like an experience.

573
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,520
And like, I, I, this, I mean this doesn't like quite make sense, but like it feels like

574
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,440
you're getting your money's worth.

575
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:02,720
Like you don't pay obviously, but like you feel like you're really, uh, you're like settling

576
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,520
into this weird little story.

577
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:10,160
And I loved it and I love the smell of like the summer, like in like the outdoor air hitting

578
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:15,400
like that sweet chlorinated water that like may be the end of Scott as we've heard from

579
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,360
the couple of days from now.

580
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,900
And so it was oddly like obviously excited, but oddly, uh, it kind of snuck up on me emotionally

581
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,040
when I rode a splash mountain.

582
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,040
Well, interesting.

583
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,040
When I finally wrote it.

584
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,680
Were you wet by the end?

585
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,800
Were the, was, were you wet from tears?

586
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,920
I, you know, I, I, you know, honestly there was, you come out of the place sucks, so no

587
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
one can really say.

588
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,920
But you know, I surely probably did.

589
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,560
Had you not ridden at Disneyland?

590
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,560
No.

591
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:48,880
I've only been to Disneyland once and um, there, this was, so this is like kind of the

592
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,560
selfish part of the story.

593
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,160
I uh, I think I had the opportunity to maybe ride it at Disneyland.

594
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,360
I was like, no, it's gotta be, cause I knew there was a Disney world trip on the horizon.

595
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,360
Oh yeah.

596
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,360
You had to be that one.

597
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,360
Yeah.

598
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,360
Yeah.

599
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,820
So man, when you were little, did you like, cause you said the ride was closed in hindsight.

600
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,240
Was the ride for sure closed the whole day or was it just cause like the family wanted

601
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,520
to keep moving and you never returned?

602
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,600
Like do you remember if there was a full confirmation of this is shut down today or perhaps it was

603
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,340
shut down for half the day, you guys didn't return and you could have maybe ridden it.

604
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,600
That sounds totally possible.

605
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,820
I think we had, we had to keep moving and I think I was the kind of kid, uh, it sounds

606
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:37,480
like a, like my current company, a real wiener of a kid who uh, like wouldn't have spoken

607
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
up.

608
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,320
I don't know if he did feel like he wanted to like maybe go and check on it like, ah,

609
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,640
no, my fate is sealed.

610
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,200
Uh, this is the equivalent of it.

611
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Like watching it like be demolished in slow motion.

612
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,480
Uh, you're watching it get blown up.

613
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
Big wrecking balls.

614
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
Right.

615
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
It's done.

616
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,560
It was really all hands on deck in terms of promoting splash mountain.

617
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,040
Splash mountain was so ubiquitous.

618
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,640
If you grew up in the nineties to the point where I feel like splash mountain in the same

619
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,700
way space mountain is in pop culture is almost used as a standard for the term theme parks

620
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,500
or like like in a monologue joke, they might just go like splash mountain.

621
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,480
Like when they mean like theme park.

622
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,480
Right.

623
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
Right.

624
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,860
It's become like, and it is a great, it's like an e-ticket attraction.

625
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,860
It is like a big attract.

626
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,080
That's like a premium, right?

627
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,080
Yeah.

628
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
That's like a high, high level.

629
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,360
They really sealed that mountain thing.

630
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:36,040
Like it may, I think it wasn't as much of a, you didn't talk about the Disneyland mountains

631
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,560
because the third always seals or that would be the third in Florida space mountain, big

632
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,920
thunder and then Disneyland with Matterhorn.

633
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,920
Yeah.

634
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
And Matterhorn.

635
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
Right.

636
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,840
But yeah, there's been other mountains that have not come to fruition.

637
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,560
They decided not to call Everest like Everest mountain.

638
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,320
Oh, it's not though.

639
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,080
It's just called expedition.

640
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,480
Not star Wars man.

641
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,600
But there's been a high low mountain, the Kylo Mon will be coming soon.

642
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,600
Buzzing Woody's toy mountains.

643
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,760
We're clamoring for it.

644
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
Yeah.

645
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,280
I mean mountains are cool.

646
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:15,080
Mountains are universally recognized as cool.

647
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,240
I like like the rides that feel very escapists.

648
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,520
Like I think you get that with pirate, like the immersive darker ride, I guess.

649
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,520
Right.

650
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:29,360
Like there's something also in that I would, I mean this is probably easily accessible,

651
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,280
but like it is such a like there's, where are you when you're up in that little fiber

652
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
last mountain?

653
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,360
Like it is like a pretty winding, interesting path.

654
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,360
Is it behind it's base?

655
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,360
It's sort of, I know Disneyland better than Disney world, but it's like the Disney world

656
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,000
one kind of the, the train runs through the mountain.

657
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,880
So some of the ride has to be like, like it straddles both sides of the, of the berm quote

658
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,360
unquote the big like Disneyland.

659
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Disneyland.

660
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
Yeah.

661
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,360
Yeah.

662
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,360
Yeah.

663
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,480
So you get a little bit of a peak of what's going on or like on the other side.

664
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,120
No, no, you don't have the train or no, the train you do.

665
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,440
Oh, in the, oh, inside the train.

666
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,180
You're saying you can see the last show, the scene, the riverboat, you can see the animals

667
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:14,040
on the riverboat, which is a great way to, if the lines too long, it's splash mountain.

668
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,160
You can see a little of that big end show scene and you got to ride the train.

669
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,040
What could be better?

670
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,760
Or if you don't go on flume attractions, this is one way.

671
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,760
Oh, here we go.

672
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,800
Scott does not go on splash mountain.

673
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
Yeah.

674
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,280
This is the third one of these.

675
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
Uh, what do you mean?

676
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,600
Have you been ever?

677
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
I did one time.

678
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,680
So there was like, I had a little run in like a middle school, high school where a friend

679
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:47,000
or girl peer pressure would make me inspired by band Margera and his boys.

680
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,520
You got, you got that.

681
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,800
I'm Scott Garner and this is the splash mountain.

682
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,360
You're crazy.

683
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,720
How are you even going to do that?

684
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,240
I can make sure I'm seated in the ride vehicle.

685
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,680
I keep my arms and legs inside all.

686
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:11,640
Yeah, I, uh, yeah, I don't know.

687
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,360
I probably could, you know, in looking at it, I was realizing it probably doesn't make

688
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,080
sense that I don't do it because I have done the knots Berry farm.

689
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,080
Yes.

690
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,080
Uh, the, uh, what does that, uh, recall?

691
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,720
Am I not coming up with that?

692
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
It's another flume.

693
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Yeah.

694
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
Is it called, it's not Calico mountains.

695
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,320
That's the mine cart.

696
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,520
Um, the knots flume ride, but the, but I think it's a, it's a similar amount of drop.

697
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:40,420
I think the, uh, splash mountain might be steeper, more angled and it's also visually

698
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,720
much more impressive looking than the one at knots.

699
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,200
So it looks taller, scarier.

700
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,400
And like when I was a kid, I felt like from looking at it, even though it's clearly not

701
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,320
a 90 degree drive, it looked, it felt like that to me from looking at it and I was like,

702
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,840
Oh my God, you fall straight down.

703
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,800
But really when you're on it, even though it's fast, like it's, you can, well, and they

704
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,520
sell the splash with like, um, water jets to like water up.

705
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,440
And when you're a kid, your brain isn't fused.

706
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,520
Like everything's just two dots and a mouth.

707
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:13,280
Like you can't, you still have like baby brain.

708
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,520
This is now that I'm about to say it, it's going to sound like I'm trying to really insult

709
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,160
Scott, but it's not what I'm trying to do.

710
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:24,760
The only ride that's of like an e-ticket that my mom will go on still is splash mountain.

711
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,160
She won't go on Indy cause she says jostles are too much.

712
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,620
She won't go on space mountain for the same reason.

713
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,080
But she's like, I'll do splash mountain.

714
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,080
No problem.

715
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,080
Well, I think it's different.

716
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,680
It's a different because I don't like, I don't like the flume dress and I don't like the,

717
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,160
I don't like the quick launches.

718
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,600
So I don't go on a mummy.

719
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,400
I don't go on California screaming soon where the credit coast credit coast.

720
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:52,640
Did you, uh, is it like a, um, a feeling thing or just like a, like a, those give me the

721
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,320
most sort of like a little, uh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

722
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,200
Just like that kind of like a little like adrenaline or dropping your heart or whatever.

723
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Yeah.

724
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
Um, yeah, I dunno.

725
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,640
It's a feeling in my heart.

726
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,280
I don't like, I've proposed according to evolution though.

727
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
You're right.

728
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,280
And we're wrong.

729
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,280
We should be seeking out like the feeling of a lion eating our ears in the night or

730
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
whatever.

731
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,280
You shouldn't be doing the thing everybody finds fun that millions of people line up

732
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,600
every day to do.

733
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
No, I'm right.

734
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
I'm trying to say it.

735
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
I appreciate it.

736
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,600
I know I'm wrong.

737
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,800
I also probably could do it.

738
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,240
I proposed to you at this, with the wedding, you were, if you recall this, that perhaps

739
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:38,560
we do a series, maybe we check in every week building up to your return to splash mountain.

740
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
Yeah.

741
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,560
Yeah.

742
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,760
We check in, how are you feeling about it?

743
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,200
And then we bring a recorder into the park, get a before, maybe during, depending on if

744
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
we have water.

745
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:54,800
This is Mike's a wrestling, you know, interest, uh, showing my building up a story line weeks

746
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
in advance.

747
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
You gotta build an angle.

748
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
You gotta build an angle.

749
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,140
And then you pay it all pay per view pay.

750
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,140
That's right.

751
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,080
And we'll put it behind, we'll put the episode where Scott goes on splash mountain buying

752
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,080
a paywall $10.

753
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,400
I'll make it worth your while.

754
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,000
So you're saying that I, that you want me to, uh, that there, we would do maybe like

755
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,840
a half hour special in which we find out what it's like for me to brave splash mountain.

756
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:24,760
And I try to become a, I'll use the proper term splashtranaut.

757
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,760
That's what you're proposing.

758
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,080
I think that's a great idea.

759
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:34,520
Because this, what I am describing has precedent in the way a very vivid memory from my childhood,

760
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:40,560
1989 earnest goes to splash mountains, a half hour Disney channel special.

761
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,680
Have you guys all seen it?

762
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,800
You've seen pieces of it.

763
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
I've not watched the whole thing.

764
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,840
I vaguely remember it.

765
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,120
And this could be something like that.

766
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,800
Like also part of my memories are like, Oh, I looked, I looked it up like in college or

767
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,840
stuff, but like, yeah, it was, it was just a commercial, right?

768
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,840
Yeah.

769
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:03,160
What big half hour commercial that's like definitely more odd and off brand than I've

770
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,200
seen a very, very many Disney specials.

771
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:11,760
If I haven't established that by this point and it's like, it's, it's a lot more, it's,

772
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,760
it's very odd.

773
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,080
It's focused on the one ride.

774
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:20,300
A lot of it is filmed by Jim Varney and his team because if you know that he like, he

775
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:25,200
like self produced all of that stuff, every earnest thing you've ever seen, whether it

776
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,000
was for an ad for Cerritos, auto square or the wraparounds for his show, Hey Vern, it's

777
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
earnest.

778
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,160
So I'm missing that in, I'm probably getting the state wrong, but you know, Tennessee or

779
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,600
wherever you live.

780
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,960
So, so a lot, so it doesn't, most of the specials are not filmed at Disneyland.

781
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
It's him like prepping.

782
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:46,800
So he said he, it's, they referred to Vern's daredevil Institute, which I guess is where

783
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,560
I have to go or to make, it's actually perfect to do my sequel.

784
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,560
Oh yeah.

785
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:56,760
This guy goes to splash map because not only did the, this, not only did the ride freak

786
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,360
me out and not only did the special probably contribute to me being afraid of the ride,

787
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,160
I was afraid of the special itself.

788
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,080
I watched this when I was, I probably three, four years old.

789
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:17,840
I'm not sure exactly, but it, in my memory, earnest's trip down the drop was like a terrifying

790
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,620
Lynchian nightmare.

791
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:24,360
Like I wish I could show you like distort what I had in my baby brain because it's,

792
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,880
you know, it all builds up to him doing it and he's kind of like, yeah, piece of cake.

793
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:33,240
And he puts his feet up on the log and he says, wish I brought a book, which I think

794
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,400
is actually funny.

795
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,840
And then, and then he finally goes and there's a news, there's news reporters covering all

796
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,840
of this.

797
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:46,480
And he said, and the news reporter says, squeamish viewers may want to turn away at this point.

798
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,840
And then he goes down the drop and he's super terrified.

799
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,080
Does a big old earnest scream.

800
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:58,680
And I just wish I could like transplant what's in my brain to you guys because in my mind,

801
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:05,280
the drop sequence itself was like 10 minutes long and just like the most fright, like mother

802
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,920
esque existential nightmare experience.

803
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,800
And I remember that there were strobe effects and I remember it like electrified him.

804
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,940
It like affected his hair and made his hair shoot up.

805
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,880
And if you watch this and we'll, we should post the link and we're posted the clip to

806
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,560
our Instagram or whatever.

807
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:27,320
But if you find what I finally as an adult saw this again, it's 10 seconds long.

808
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,800
He goes like, ah, his hair shoots up and that is it.

809
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:38,480
But my baby brain just like morphed it into terrifying Guillermo del Toro nightmares for

810
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,800
many, many years.

811
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,700
I just, I, you guys have to see how, especially the hair thing, it's literally like strobing

812
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,700
on and off.

813
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,920
He has a wig in one and hope not a wig in the other.

814
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,440
But to me, like what's the most terrifying horror film of all time?

815
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,600
Ernest goes to splash.

816
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,760
Um, you're saying that's in your brain still really?

817
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,520
Yeah, I think it impacts me.

818
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
Yeah.

819
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,520
Yeah.

820
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
This has become my, my therapy session.

821
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,520
Yeah.

822
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,400
I still, when I stare up at that ride, I see earnest and his strobe nightmare.

823
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,860
Uh, and I do also remember, um, the first time I went to Disneyland or any theme park,

824
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,560
I think I was like three or four years old and they were still building splash mountain

825
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,060
or they were still running tests and it wasn't open yet.

826
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:26,780
And so at that age, I am the smallest that I've ever been at Disneyland.

827
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,600
I am very small and this building is very tall.

828
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,320
And I remember staring up just like the shadowy building at night, scaring the shit out of

829
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,320
me.

830
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,240
It seems to just giant towered above me.

831
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,480
Uh, so maybe, maybe I have, maybe there's more mental tied up in here than I, then I

832
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,840
realized it sounds like stories of trauma.

833
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,560
Tied into a splash.

834
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,560
Yeah.

835
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,560
Yeah.

836
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,560
And now here's the rest.

837
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,320
I take another hour.

838
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:59,000
By the way, the knots ride is the timber mountain log, timber mountain log ride, which opened

839
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
first I believe.

840
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Yeah.

841
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,160
Opened well before splash mountain.

842
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
Okay.

843
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,160
Okay.

844
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:10,600
Um, and I think when they were like considering some sort of water ride, like some imagineers

845
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:15,740
like poo pooed a log flume like log flumes, I think we're getting popular, but people,

846
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,000
but they seem like, Oh, how will we tell a story?

847
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Right?

848
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
How would we get animatronics?

849
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
How we get carriages in there?

850
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,640
It seems too simplistic for Disneyland.

851
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,640
But timber mountain itself, if you haven't been on that ride and knots, it is, it is

852
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:33,720
full of animatronics and recently refurbished and it's sort of like a sets the precedent

853
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,240
for splash mountain for sure.

854
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:40,240
And it's a, it's similarly structured where there's many drops through it all building

855
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:46,280
up to the, uh, the final climax and the things get like spooky on the way up to the top.

856
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,680
This is the minutia we tune in.

857
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,680
Yeah.

858
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,680
Yeah.

859
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,680
Yeah.

860
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,680
So it's ever mountain.

861
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,680
It was a big influence.

862
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:57,800
So I know like the early blues records influencing rock and roll.

863
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,400
What are the animatronics at knots?

864
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:05,800
I've never been like, is it Snoopy based or no, it's a bunch of like gruff construction

865
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800
workers.

866
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,120
Like miners and like, you know, like, you know, people getting coal dust in their lungs.

867
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,880
Uh, it's a lot of like, just like working people.

868
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,840
And like, I mean the calico mine rides, that's the one that has a ton of people just working

869
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,160
in the cold shit.

870
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,160
Right?

871
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,160
Yeah.

872
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,520
I guess that's where you get coal lung here.

873
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,280
The timber bound is where you get sawdust.

874
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,280
Yeah.

875
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,200
These are all like lumberjack kind of guys that are chopping down trees and sawing things

876
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
miserably.

877
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,200
They are.

878
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,240
So just a bunch of gruff, grizzled assholes.

879
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,520
They're less in the Disney style of like kind of like pirates of the Caribbean where they're

880
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,520
big cartoonish.

881
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,960
They're more like people.

882
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,460
So when we went on these rides, it very much feels like you're just like looking at these

883
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,260
people with incredibly hard lives, especially the mine ride.

884
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,920
It's like you're going through and there's like 15 people like, and it's not a fun seven

885
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,780
dwarf style like pickaxe and hand hitting the rocks.

886
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:58,720
It's just like men who have no other option.

887
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,200
One of them slips you a note that says, please, we're real.

888
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,120
Get us out of here.

889
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,520
My campaign will not forget the hardworking animatronics.

890
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,600
They'll all have benefits.

891
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,080
I'll settle for you as mayor of knots.

892
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,320
No longer mayor of knots might be more attainable.

893
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,320
Good first step.

894
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,560
Good thing on the resume.

895
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,560
Yeah.

896
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,540
Well here, we'll call you mayor of podcast ride.

897
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,540
That's done.

898
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,840
So you have mayoral experience already.

899
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,840
There we go.

900
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,000
Uh, here's your inauguration ceremony.

901
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,480
I'll bring my glass of water on your leg.

902
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,200
It's wet and covered with glass.

903
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,200
All right.

904
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:44,240
We have inaugurated you and uh, yeah, you're, you're the experienced mayor already.

905
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:51,520
So we, we have to touch on a, the weird topic, which is where this bride comes from.

906
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,520
What is this?

907
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,000
46 movies, song of the South.

908
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Yeah.

909
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,240
So we'll, we'll touch on it as four white dudes can.

910
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,560
It's very strange.

911
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,560
First of all, I'll say this.

912
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,560
It's very strange that in the eighties they decided to build this thing.

913
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,320
There were plenty of other movies.

914
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:11,020
There were plenty of other things they could have used to make a giant flume ride.

915
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,120
Cause there's nothing about when you're inside there.

916
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,480
Like I'll be honest, the characters I don't really care too much about.

917
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,940
They're like the rabbit, very rabbit.

918
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,440
Like they're kind of ill-defined qualities.

919
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,680
That rabbit is mischievous.

920
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,320
He's like a bug, a country bugs bunny I guess.

921
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,320
A abrasive voice.

922
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
He's a trickster.

923
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,960
Uh, it's the whole thing that he's like, please don't throw me into the briar patch, but he

924
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,960
lives in the briar patch.

925
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,960
He wants to be in the briar patch.

926
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,960
Okay.

927
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,960
Okay.

928
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,960
So he's a trickster.

929
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,320
The, uh, the laughing place, the topic of the laughing place comes up.

930
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:52,560
This was interesting to learn in my research that the laughing place goes back to like

931
00:44:52,560 --> 00:45:01,040
African folklore in Africa and to like, to, uh, uh, it relates in some parts to a Nancy,

932
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,760
the trickster, the spider trickster folklore character.

933
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,480
Oh, let's see.

934
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,240
Following bare rabbits capture the hero leads his couchers Wiley, Brea, Fox, and dim way

935
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,160
to prayer, Brea to his laughing place.

936
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,120
This can be enough for me.

937
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:21,960
For my money, my laughing place is the UCB theater in Los Angeles, California.

938
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,080
The beautiful UCB theater.

939
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,720
Uh, yeah.

940
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:30,200
So similar trickster tales, I feel like exist in a lot of cultures throughout the world.

941
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,200
Right.

942
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,200
So, so I have never seen the movie.

943
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:37,280
It's not been distributed in any time lately by Disney because it's widely regarded as

944
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,280
being racist.

945
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,760
It's a racist movie, but they have used it in the recent past.

946
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,640
They would show the animated segments on the Disney channel in the nine.

947
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,640
They would take out.

948
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,640
So there's a character, uncle Remus.

949
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,820
He is basically excised from the sequences you're talking about.

950
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:55,240
They just use the cartoon characters that end up appearing on the ride.

951
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:00,280
Wait, but how do you, because like when we were kids, Disney singalong songs are still

952
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,280
using zippity doo-dah, which is him.

953
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,400
The live action kids and uncle Remus.

954
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,000
Uncle Remus is in the Disney singalong songs.

955
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,640
Cause I remember seeing those like, um, and like preschool and whatnot.

956
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:18,560
Cause that, that particular like zippity doo-dah, uh, like the bluebird is cartoon, but he,

957
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,560
yes.

958
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,560
Okay.

959
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,560
So that's from the movie.

960
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,920
And then in the parade we watched when we did the braids episode, they refer to the

961
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,400
song as a South float, uh, that bear Raman, bear rocks are on.

962
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,660
So like there's certainly, we're not doing like an incredible lead, good detail.

963
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,880
Look at like what was wrong with this.

964
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,880
No, you don't know.

965
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,880
We're not qualified.

966
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,840
But like, we're just talking about how God damn weird it is because there are so many

967
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,580
properties they did this cause so, so like this is a Tony Baxter, right?

968
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,580
It's again, a great ride.

969
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,580
He's the guy.

970
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:52,440
He's the man and he's talked about this before.

971
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,980
Like they were not sure if culturally people would like it.

972
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:58,640
So they re-released the movie in the eighties to see if there would be a big uproar about

973
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,640
it.

974
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,640
Test the waters.

975
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,980
And it was no one complained or there was no, I'm sure did fairly well in 1986.

976
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:10,580
Something that today is referred to, like I feel like now it's spoken of as like a sort

977
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,580
of urban legend.

978
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,740
Like, do you know Disney made this movie that people feels racially weird or whatever, but

979
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,580
it was in theaters in 1986.

980
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,580
Not too long ago.

981
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:26,060
And is award winning in, in it won the Oscar for best song for Zippity Doodah and the actor

982
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:32,420
who played uncle Remus, James Baskett won an honorary Academy award for playing uncle

983
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,420
Remus.

984
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,540
But, and that's reading about this movie.

985
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:41,220
There's so many instances of this where it seems like one step forward, two steps back

986
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:46,920
because like the U S government after World War II was doing like an anti racism initiative

987
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:52,260
and part of it was like trying to tie in this movie and like, yeah, and this guy eventually

988
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:57,420
he did get this honorary Academy where the first African American man to win an Oscar.

989
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:03,260
However, the movie premiered in Atlanta and he was not allowed to attend the premier due

990
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,260
to segregation.

991
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,260
Oh Jesus.

992
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,700
So there's all of this crazy stuff.

993
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:11,580
I mean, people thought, you know, some writers at the time were like, this is good.

994
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:17,180
These folklore, these oral tradition, these American folklore stories of bear rabbit,

995
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:20,980
bear Fox and Agorimas, uh, could bring people together.

996
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:28,140
But then other people were very, uh, certain that it's like, no, this is offensive.

997
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,700
The stereo is playing this old uncle stereotype.

998
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:36,620
It's just, it's just so interesting because like, what was it about the character cartoon

999
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,540
characters that they were like, we gotta get this, like, why wasn't it just a rescuers

1000
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:43,340
down like not done out there that was nineties but like rescuers move.

1001
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:48,580
Like I had this rescuers mountain or a one of the great mouse detective come out.

1002
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:53,820
Well no, but even the, um, I mean the, the newer minecart dwarves ride, it feels like

1003
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:56,140
they could have themed that as a splash mountain.

1004
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,140
Right?

1005
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,140
Yeah.

1006
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:02,060
You could have done another get people into critter country, right?

1007
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:05,660
Like people were going to be related to bear country.

1008
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,060
It was bear country before.

1009
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,300
And then when splash mountain opened, it became critter country.

1010
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:14,500
So they were trying to populate that section and it must've been, I think, uh, Tony Baxter's

1011
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:20,780
about worlds is a world, but I think he wanted that like that, uh, that, that old south vibe

1012
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:21,940
or the holler.

1013
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,380
But ironically that is the vibe.

1014
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:26,940
I think from what I could tell, didn't look into it too hard, but it seems like a big

1015
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:30,300
thing that people are upset about or ever were upset about with song in the south is

1016
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:37,100
that it like portrayed this rosy, uh, post reconstruction south that is not an accurate

1017
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:41,180
depiction of there were not singing bluebirds on people's shoulders.

1018
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,180
You'd believe it.

1019
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:47,020
But, uh, but I also understand like, uh, I don't know, I guess it's that like, uh, um,

1020
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:53,940
that that sort of folksy, uh, um, you know, homespun kind of vibe that does feel with

1021
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,440
the riverboat and everything.

1022
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,460
And it's related to the rivers of America.

1023
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:01,300
You could see how it ties into a vibe that was already in Disneyland.

1024
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,040
I mean it's because of course I love the ride itself.

1025
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,340
So of course I get that that's all a very good idea.

1026
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,460
It's just interesting surrounding all with all the controversy.

1027
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,820
It's interesting that they, even though they released it, they were just like, they did

1028
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:16,220
even try to do it, which is, it's just kind of wild.

1029
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:20,460
I would be interested to know even more right out of one of those cartoons where Donald

1030
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,460
fights Hitler.

1031
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,460
Well that I can get behind.

1032
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,020
That would be a fun ride.

1033
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,020
Yeah.

1034
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:30,760
Watch him like a launch missiles into Hitler's head.

1035
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:37,420
So it still seems split of whether people think they should release it on home video

1036
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,420
or not.

1037
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:43,140
I mean last year whoopee Goldberg at D 23 said like, yeah, release it, put it out there

1038
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,160
and start a conversation about it.

1039
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:51,900
But I mean American pop culture, American media like nuance is not our strong suit in

1040
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,900
America.

1041
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,300
Uh, so I don't know.

1042
00:50:54,300 --> 00:51:00,500
It seems like there is people who think like, yeah, release it, but just to academic institutions.

1043
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,800
But then anyone could buy it then.

1044
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,240
Like students for students to study it.

1045
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,980
I think that was Roger Ebert's thing.

1046
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,320
Like yet let film students study it.

1047
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:15,420
Also in terms of its weight as a film, I didn't know it was the first movie shot on color

1048
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:19,300
by the cinematographer Greg Toland who shot Citizen Kane.

1049
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,300
So like a major work.

1050
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:25,500
That's why in a piece of, in the giant body of work, a very talented guy.

1051
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,500
Um, yeah.

1052
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,660
So, so I mean most people that go in ride the ride.

1053
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:34,060
I have no idea really what it is, what it's connected to and like, yeah, it's just like

1054
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,220
some cartoons and it's fine.

1055
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,220
Right, right.

1056
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,220
Well, and that's the question.

1057
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:43,220
Is there anything could you could screw anything in the ride itself as being a weird or problematic?

1058
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,460
And I don't, I don't think so.

1059
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:45,900
Not that I could tell.

1060
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,620
We just watched a ride through on YouTube.

1061
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:55,860
I wasn't, I watched, they feature the bears big ass a few too many times.

1062
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:58,540
I mean they've definitely softened some of the voice.

1063
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:01,100
Like I went and found the, that's the other thing about this.

1064
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:06,940
There's a large black market for bootleg, a song of the south DVDs and you can find

1065
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,380
multiple clips of it.

1066
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,660
You can probably piece the whole movie together through YouTube.

1067
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,220
But like some of the voices, they're rough.

1068
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:18,580
The voices in the original movie have not aged well and they've definitely softened

1069
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,580
them in the ride.

1070
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:20,580
Listen, okay.

1071
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:24,420
I don't want to start talking, uh, what we would do with the ride.

1072
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,420
We still got to go through it.

1073
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:30,260
Through the ride still, but yeah, it's definitely on the docket.

1074
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,260
Mr. Bear.

1075
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,260
Yeah, sorry.

1076
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:35,180
So we'll, we'll start going through the ride.

1077
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:38,780
We'll go through it as if we didn't know anything about this other movie that existed.

1078
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,460
And that's the thing that show up in the closet.

1079
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:46,020
Tony Baxter on a recent season past podcast, they've done a long running interview series

1080
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:51,360
with him brought up that this ride is unique in that it technically it is an IP ride.

1081
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,620
It's based on something that already exists, but a lot of people don't know about it.

1082
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,620
There's no way I would have known.

1083
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:59,140
Some people think it's just an original thing.

1084
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,140
Right.

1085
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,700
They don't have the context.

1086
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:09,220
And of course, many of the animatronic characters in this are not from Song of the South because

1087
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:13,420
this isn't too deep cut of theme park nerd knowledge.

1088
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:16,420
But very doesn't know they were, this was another big thing.

1089
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,940
Tony Baxter was trying to solve two problems.

1090
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:22,500
One that Bear Country wasn't getting a lot of population.

1091
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,580
People weren't heading back to that corner of the park.

1092
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:28,740
So America Sings was closing, which was in the Circle Vision, not Circle Vision, the

1093
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,620
Carousel Theater in Tomorrowland.

1094
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:35,360
They were going to evict that show and put in something else that actually George Lucas,

1095
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,620
they were talking about some ideas with.

1096
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:42,700
But that was going to do away with hundreds of audio animatronic characters.

1097
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,700
Yes.

1098
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:48,500
So all of the characters are moved over from America Sings.

1099
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,860
That's a ton of money.

1100
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,980
They sit like all the things on the riverboat at the end.

1101
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,540
Like those are all just everything on the at a certain point.

1102
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:59,940
Like some of those characters were like voiced by Burl Ives and like sung like rockabilly

1103
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,660
songs and yeah, it's all what America Sings is kind of.

1104
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,660
Yeah, it's like I love it.

1105
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,660
Have you watched him?

1106
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:06,660
No, I actually, I never have.

1107
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:11,900
I've actually, you know, they sing like that sounds very much like showbiz pizza to the

1108
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:12,900
max.

1109
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:13,900
Yeah, it is.

1110
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:14,900
Absolutely.

1111
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:15,900
Yeah.

1112
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:16,900
Yeah.

1113
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,100
And they would, they would do more like, I guess more modern songs as well, but it'll

1114
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:22,260
be like turn of the century songs, but then they would do a little rock and roll like from.

1115
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:27,100
So if you wanted to see like a stork would say, let's crank it up a notch.

1116
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,100
Play Johnny B. Goode.

1117
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,100
Yeah.

1118
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,100
Yeah.

1119
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:35,700
They Marty McFly solo played by a stork and with reality subject matter, like grabbing

1120
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,140
your girl and sharing a milkshake.

1121
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:42,020
That was all going off the bicentennial fever, right?

1122
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,740
Like America Sings was around the time.

1123
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,940
I think it did open in 76.

1124
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:46,940
Yeah.

1125
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,980
And the bicentennial fever.

1126
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,980
America had bicentennial fever.

1127
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,340
It's accurate.

1128
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:55,300
Jason still contracts once a year.

1129
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,300
Yeah.

1130
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,300
I take a Z-Pack and then I knock it right out.

1131
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:05,140
First time I met you asked me if I got my bicentennial vaccine and I didn't know.

1132
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:09,860
It's it's from this little side note from seeing what has happened to the old America

1133
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,820
Sings and the old carousel progress.

1134
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,460
They may as well have just kept America Sings in there.

1135
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,300
They've done nothing with that space.

1136
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,860
The worst use of a major space.

1137
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,900
So what's there right now, I can't really right now is Star Wars launch launch launch

1138
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:28,300
and then upstairs it's like some couches where you can pay $50 to sit with dad and mom so

1139
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,020
they can chill out for a while.

1140
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,020
Special cookies.

1141
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,340
It was, it was interventions.

1142
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:37,920
It was the house of the future and it would like circle around and it was, it's so depressing

1143
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,920
that area.

1144
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,140
I don't even read good rumors about stuff that might happen to that.

1145
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:43,140
There's nothing coming.

1146
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:46,860
Also when I went there as a kid, I think the first time I went, America Sings had just

1147
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:47,860
closed.

1148
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:48,860
Um, yeah, that's right.

1149
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:50,260
Cause they were building splash man.

1150
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:56,220
And uh, so, and then it was not as I went for the first time in 88, uh, 98 finally,

1151
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,980
interventions open for a decade.

1152
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:58,980
That space is nothing.

1153
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,420
And it's a sign.

1154
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:06,220
Uh, Mickey's holding a sign that says we're like imagining up a grand new experience.

1155
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,860
It's been dog shit ever since they closed America Sings.

1156
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,060
My whole dog shit my whole life.

1157
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:16,220
Oh gee, well that's, that was briefly where it was interventions and you go to the HP

1158
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,220
house of the future.

1159
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,500
You could meet your old friend.

1160
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,500
Awesome.

1161
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,500
Oh, awesome.

1162
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,500
Oh, I love awesome.

1163
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,500
Awesome.

1164
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,780
Oh, is now on Autopia though.

1165
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,140
Yeah, he's awesome.

1166
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,140
Oh yeah.

1167
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,980
He's standing dead still on Autopia.

1168
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,840
He doesn't move at all.

1169
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:35,980
One thing he was built in the one thing he was supposed to do walk awesome.

1170
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:36,980
Oh, I remember when awesome.

1171
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:40,420
Oh, it's like first, I don't know how to phrase this on the scene.

1172
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:46,840
Um, but he was like, Honda, Honda was, uh, this is when I was in college.

1173
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:52,380
Honda was bringing him to different universities to kind of put on some sort of show for like

1174
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:56,900
the engine mostly for, I guess for engineering touring awesome around.

1175
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,300
And so I was like, you know, I was coming out of a class and I saw the sign for it.

1176
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:03,340
I was like, yeah, I want to see what this little guy can do.

1177
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:09,300
So I went in and I sat down and it was just like in a, like a big auditorium and they,

1178
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:14,500
uh, they showed this video, like a representative from Honda came out and said, yeah, thanks

1179
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,500
so much.

1180
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,500
We're very proud.

1181
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:21,060
We've been, you know, so many hours, really years of work.

1182
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:25,620
And they show like kind of that classic video that I'm sure you guys have seen where it's

1183
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:29,700
kind of creepy, where it's so hard to teach a robot to walk.

1184
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,620
Like it's like this kind of like weird Terminator skeletal thing.

1185
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:37,100
And they're fucking, it just looks like sad and they're tipping you over a lot.

1186
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,180
So they showed this evolution of awesome.

1187
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,060
And then it leads up to like the awesome.

1188
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:45,740
You know, so if you don't know, awesome is this kind of like robot that Honda built and

1189
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,780
it kind of looks like a little space man.

1190
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:55,140
Uh, so anyway, so it culminates with like what he can do and he's helping old people.

1191
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,340
Like he's like, I'm part of the family.

1192
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,900
He has so much utility in the video they have, they show.

1193
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:06,380
And then the video stops and the rep goes, who wants to meet awesome.

1194
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:09,660
And so they put your hands together for awesome.

1195
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:14,920
Awesome overseas to come out, wave to the crowd and without missing a beat, the rep

1196
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,740
thing goes, who wants to see awesome?

1197
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:20,900
Oh Dan.

1198
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:27,180
And they ended up playing something like UB 40 or something like that, like red wine.

1199
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:31,500
And this like this feat of engineering dancer, red, red wine.

1200
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,940
Uh, it was what it was all building to.

1201
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:39,720
It was all building to, and then like they, they pick it, like they kind of like, uh,

1202
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,260
had him like kick a little ball at one point.

1203
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:47,340
But it was so, so fucking funny to like them for them not to see the contrast and like,

1204
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,660
this will change the world.

1205
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:54,020
You want to see it Dan.

1206
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:58,700
So people with their medicine and work.

1207
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:03,700
So they were essentially doing 10 minute versions of that in interventions for, for years.

1208
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,460
And I think there was also a test to segue.

1209
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:11,220
There was a Disney infinity test out stations when that was a thing.

1210
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,180
It is a building of junk.

1211
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,180
Yeah.

1212
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,180
It was junk warehouse.

1213
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,860
I mean tomorrow land needs a multimillion dollar.

1214
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,300
This is sounds like a great platform idea.

1215
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,300
Yes.

1216
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,300
Yes.

1217
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,620
Well that's the, the tomorrow land is the thing that needs the most care.

1218
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:29,780
And would you say tomorrow land is a disaster, utter and total disaster.

1219
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:36,340
I don't want to go that far because I like to lean more towards imagining a better world,

1220
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:40,660
a better tomorrow and a better tomorrow land.

1221
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,220
You're not about Disneyland and carnage.

1222
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,980
Uh, you're about hope for the future.

1223
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:48,460
That could have been a line from the Clooney movies.

1224
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:53,620
We're out land like where it's just so clunky.

1225
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,140
That's by the way, we've talked about this before.

1226
00:59:55,140 --> 01:00:00,180
That failure of that movie is I'm mad at it because we would have gotten a new tomorrow

1227
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,780
land if that was a big hit.

1228
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:03,500
The sequel would have come out already.

1229
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,460
They would have been like, we got to put $500 million into tomorrow land and now it's not

1230
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,460
going to happen for others.

1231
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:13,180
Speaking of tomorrow land and like ASIMO type robots, uh, when I was there, so I went to

1232
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:16,260
Disney world in May, 2017.

1233
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:20,900
Um, there's an unrobot like an eye can.

1234
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:21,900
Oh yeah.

1235
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:22,900
Yeah.

1236
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:26,060
Robot who is like half human, half robot.

1237
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,060
Yeah.

1238
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,060
Who speaks with the lid.

1239
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,900
He like drives himself around.

1240
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:30,900
Yes.

1241
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:31,900
Yeah.

1242
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:32,900
Yeah.

1243
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,060
And I sent you guys the video I think when I was there, but when we were there, I met,

1244
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:38,100
I can, you were saying it's supposed to be like a

1245
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:41,100
predecessor to star Wars droids.

1246
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,100
Is that right?

1247
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,300
Well, they're, yeah, they're testing out certain things for star Wars and I maybe I forget

1248
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,420
if it's, I can specifically, but I think they're there for sure.

1249
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,540
Testing out different like autonomous robots.

1250
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:56,300
And then I think people in robots, you had told me at Mike had told me about I can and

1251
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:01,460
uh, when I saw him, uh, I got, well, you talking about this is, I can write as a picture.

1252
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,220
I thought there was somebody called push.

1253
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,220
Yeah.

1254
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,220
There's a robot garbage.

1255
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,220
I think there's a man who was retired.

1256
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:12,380
Wait, no more push, but I can, I can is this, I can is more of a man.

1257
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:13,380
He's not the garbage.

1258
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,340
Oh, I got you saying can really confused me.

1259
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,340
I don't know why.

1260
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:21,700
Cause there used to be a trash can that wandered around and I believe may have run for mayor

1261
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,700
of tomorrow land.

1262
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:23,700
Oh shit.

1263
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:27,300
A predecessor of an enemy to destroy.

1264
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:32,080
Well, like the democratic party, I'll have a lot of highly paid consultants that you're

1265
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,900
not quite sure what they do.

1266
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:41,340
So I would hire a push on to pop in one day a week and a spout off some aphorisms about

1267
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:42,340
pushes.

1268
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:48,900
I'm gonna sink your campaign pushes pushes my Robbie mook, which is why John Podesta.

1269
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,100
There's so many of these people to list.

1270
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,100
Yeah.

1271
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:53,100
There's so many.

1272
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,100
Yeah.

1273
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:58,100
I, I, 33,000 push emails.

1274
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,900
We've never seen.

1275
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:05,740
Philippe brains, he's my Philly brains, the guy who infamously got so into playing the

1276
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:08,100
Donald Trump stand in the Clinton.

1277
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,100
Oh boy.

1278
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:14,940
The hall of failed DNC consultants.

1279
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,340
One of these is literally a trash can.

1280
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:18,340
Yeah.

1281
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:19,340
Push push.

1282
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:23,140
You're going to be advised on the Clinton campaign.

1283
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:29,940
Uh, so this is kind of like my, I'm not sure, but in Disney world, it's frontier land that

1284
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,540
space or splash man.

1285
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,580
There is, they did not make a separate critter.

1286
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,140
I really love frontier land.

1287
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:41,260
I think it's like, it's an exciting, uh, area of rides, uh, in Disney world.

1288
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:45,340
And it's well, and yeah, with it having splash mountain as part of it kind of flushes out

1289
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:48,980
the area cause really the only ride here is a big thunder.

1290
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:52,380
Uh, but yes, it's a more fleshed out land there.

1291
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:58,860
Um, and they, and I believe I read that they had to, they, the score is different in Disney

1292
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,440
world and they made it sort of more frontiersy.

1293
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,140
It's kind of a more country fried music score.

1294
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,140
I think it's tweaked a little.

1295
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:07,460
I, we were talking about this a little before.

1296
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:13,580
There's little differences between, uh, Orlando and Anaheim in terms of this ride.

1297
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:16,420
Show scenes slightly slight differences.

1298
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,420
Yeah.

1299
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:19,020
The score is slightly different.

1300
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:23,580
Orlando and Tokyo, I believe are like almost identical replicas of each other.

1301
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:26,820
Scott, you pointed out the, the vultures you mentioned.

1302
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:31,860
Oh yeah, apparent from watching the Disneyland and Disney world ride through is the Disney

1303
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:36,220
worlds vultures have top hats, big difference.

1304
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:39,500
Jason Mayer esque top hats.

1305
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,460
And I think the Disneyland ones are lacking.

1306
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:46,580
There's something I would ask of you is to let's get some, let's dress up those Disneyland

1307
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:48,860
vultures, get them some hats forthwith.

1308
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:52,340
There's a Disney world.

1309
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:56,560
It's two seater cars and Disneyland at single seats.

1310
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,780
So there's more capacity in Disney world as well.

1311
01:03:58,780 --> 01:03:59,780
That's another change.

1312
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:00,780
Yeah.

1313
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:02,180
That's a very interesting change.

1314
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:03,980
A lot of people are riveted right now.

1315
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:06,580
Has anyone died at either of them?

1316
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:07,580
I don't think so.

1317
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:10,820
The most deaths, but they, they did install lap bar.

1318
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:11,820
They didn't used to have lap bars.

1319
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:14,860
I don't think there's no lap bars and bars in Disneyland.

1320
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:15,860
Oh, Disney world.

1321
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:17,980
I think they may have put them in in Florida.

1322
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:18,980
Interesting.

1323
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:19,980
Cause it's Tokyo.

1324
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:20,980
There's no seats at all.

1325
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:21,980
I, uh, standing.

1326
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,220
I, so there are doubles there.

1327
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:26,540
There was a, so what we got, we'll, we'll go through.

1328
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:27,540
The ride in one second.

1329
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,580
I just, I remembered a very amusing anecdote.

1330
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:31,540
Uh, they have a single rider line.

1331
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:36,540
So when you're a childless man in his thirties, uh, with his childless girlfriend also in

1332
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:39,660
her thirties, you guys, we don't need to sit together in the same.

1333
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:40,660
Yeah.

1334
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:41,660
Right.

1335
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:44,420
So we go to the single rider line and the single rider line in Disneyland is just the

1336
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:45,420
exit.

1337
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:46,500
You just walk through the exits.

1338
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:52,620
So what happens is they'll put you in a log flume with a family because the family, maybe

1339
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:57,740
it's just dad and the two sons and then they're like their fourth in the party is you a 30

1340
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:03,020
something man, probably the same age as this dad, but like he looks 15 years older and

1341
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:04,740
he's not wearing a Mickey shirt.

1342
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:07,200
He's like, he's like a little angry to be there.

1343
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:11,900
So I'm in the back of the flume and there's two kids and the two kids are, I've described

1344
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:13,500
this before.

1345
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,340
They are looking at me, they're trying to figure out how old I am.

1346
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:22,580
Uh, they're looking like this guy, this guy dresses like me, but he looks older than me.

1347
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,860
So that, but you can tell they're like, they want to talk.

1348
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:29,460
So like one of the kids is just like, Hey, uh, he like points to his younger brother.

1349
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:32,620
He's like, he won't go on tower of terror telling you.

1350
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:35,700
He tells me this and I go, Oh, I go, you gotta go on tower of terror.

1351
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:36,700
And he's like, I'm too scared.

1352
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,140
I'm like, no, come on.

1353
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:39,140
It's good.

1354
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:41,220
And then like we're harassing this kid the whole time.

1355
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,460
Me and this other older brother.

1356
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:46,620
And then like we get off the flume ride and the kids are like waiting for me.

1357
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:49,740
Like they're running to get their dad, but they stop and they're like, they like kid

1358
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:52,340
puts up his hands like, Hey, w w are you coming over here?

1359
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:54,060
And I was like, Oh, I got away from my girlfriend.

1360
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:55,620
He's like, Oh, okay.

1361
01:05:55,620 --> 01:06:00,140
And like you, you could tell the kid was like, Oh yeah, that old man is not part of our party.

1362
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:01,340
They're disappointed.

1363
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,220
They weren't getting a second dad that day.

1364
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,900
Maybe you were going to be top dad.

1365
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,220
I look, I could have been top dad.

1366
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:11,300
You could, I certainly could have come in there and I would have wild these kids with

1367
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,300
what I mean.

1368
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:13,300
They would have loved it.

1369
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:14,300
And how many videos?

1370
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:18,460
Meanwhile, dad is being a real pain in the ass cause he's got a real job.

1371
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:21,380
And yeah, yeah, yeah.

1372
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:26,140
I would have been a much better father to those two kids and he, what he is.

1373
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:27,140
Mike's livid.

1374
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:28,140
I'm livid.

1375
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:30,140
I could tell on a ride.

1376
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:33,500
I thought that where that was going is I did the same thing.

1377
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,100
Well, can I, I got a little tip.

1378
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:38,220
I don't know if we ever did tips.

1379
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:42,700
Yeah, but it's kind of a, it might be like frowned upon, but I'll say I took advantage

1380
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,940
of this.

1381
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:51,180
So my, when you go and you do the, like you have a fast pass, like you can also, if you

1382
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,660
have a small child, do something called a ride share.

1383
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:55,540
Have you guys heard of this child?

1384
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:56,540
Child swap.

1385
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:57,540
Are you talking about child swap?

1386
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:58,540
Yeah, that, yeah, yeah.

1387
01:06:58,540 --> 01:06:59,540
That's what it is.

1388
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:00,740
I don't know why I called it Russia, but that's what I was calling it.

1389
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:02,940
That is what Uber, Uber star.

1390
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:03,940
Yeah.

1391
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:04,940
A child swap.

1392
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:08,100
So we were, I was child swapping and like I didn't mind his uncle Anthony to like, and

1393
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,380
you had a child with you.

1394
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:10,380
Yes.

1395
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:11,380
Yeah.

1396
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,380
Yeah.

1397
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:17,540
I would just literally like hold the child in like a baby bonnet pretending to be a child.

1398
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,540
Right.

1399
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:22,260
Like a third font LeRoy looking a giant lollipop.

1400
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:23,900
It helps with the illusion.

1401
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:24,900
Okay.

1402
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:28,060
So it's not much of a tip, but I thought it really, it made me like very excited.

1403
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:29,700
I'm like, Oh, I'm really conning this thing.

1404
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:35,780
And then I would take the extra one and I would hop into like the fast pass lane.

1405
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:41,680
But when I ride, when you ride that way, you also are the one stranger with the family

1406
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,680
and their photos.

1407
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:43,680
Yes.

1408
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:44,680
That's my point.

1409
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:45,680
Yeah.

1410
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:46,680
So yeah, I should have said that too.

1411
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:47,680
Like that's, it's odd because it's odd.

1412
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:52,660
It's like all photos of just most of the ride photos I have from like, cause my sister gets

1413
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:58,260
like the magic band photo pass and I'm downloading them and there's hardly any pictures of me

1414
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,260
with my own family.

1415
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:02,500
I'm just with random families.

1416
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,940
Some alternate family.

1417
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:04,940
Right.

1418
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:09,980
Cause that has to happen for people like us who go a lot and we do single rider.

1419
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:13,460
There's probably families that that's their once every couple of year trip to Disneyland.

1420
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:14,940
They buy the photo.

1421
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:15,940
Yeah.

1422
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:23,420
And then they're mantle forever is like mom, dad, Jimmy, Sally and Michael Carlson, 33

1423
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:30,020
year old man sitting in the back, men like bored because he's been on this 150 times.

1424
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:37,180
I wonder, this is probably statistically unlikely, but listeners, you know what, you can Google

1425
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:39,980
me, Mike and Scott.

1426
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:43,500
And even Anthony, there's pictures of us out there.

1427
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,500
Where are you going with this?

1428
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:55,900
Listen, listeners might have family photos with us in the audience isn't that big yet.

1429
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:58,100
Look, it's like collapse.

1430
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:01,100
You know, there's a lot of collateral beauty in the world.

1431
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:07,300
Like there's a lot, but you never know.

1432
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:11,520
I like the idea that we'll get like 50 people with a picture of you in the back of the ride

1433
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,520
vehicle.

1434
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:17,500
Jack Nicholson, shining style, that was a day I fell asleep and they left me in the

1435
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,500
log for a while.

1436
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:21,260
So I just saw him in a ton of family photos.

1437
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:26,260
Speaking of which, I was watching the ride through, we were kind of checking it out and

1438
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:32,060
there's a little frog at the beginning of it who has a fishing line.

1439
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:36,380
He's sleeping, he's sleepy and he's got a hat over his head and the fishing line's tied

1440
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,380
to his toe.

1441
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:40,820
And I think if mayor doesn't pan out, Jason, you can have right now.

1442
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:42,620
I'd be hanging out with that.

1443
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:46,380
Hop right into that.

1444
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:47,380
Is that the same frog?

1445
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:50,340
Because there is Brer Frog, he talks at some point.

1446
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:51,340
It might be him.

1447
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:53,060
He plays the bass at the end I think.

1448
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,260
Yeah I think so.

1449
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:58,700
And there is also a porcupine playing a turtle like it's drums.

1450
01:09:58,700 --> 01:09:59,980
I really love that part.

1451
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:01,980
Which is really cute.

1452
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:07,140
But Brer Frog is voiced by James Avery, the late actor who was also Uncle Phil on The

1453
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:08,760
Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

1454
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,660
The voice actors on this are very interesting.

1455
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:16,980
Nick Stewart, Brer Bear, he's the voice in the original movie and the ride.

1456
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:22,560
He was the only actor still alive at the time and he was the only one who did both.

1457
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:32,860
And then Brer Rabbit in the movie, I forget who did it in the movie, apparently the actor

1458
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:37,380
who played Uncle Remus in the movie does the voice of Brer Rabbit in one sequence.

1459
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:43,740
In the ride it is a guy named Jess Harnell who is also a wacko, warner, and anomaniacs

1460
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,960
and Crash Bandicoot.

1461
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,260
Two extreme characters.

1462
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:49,740
Well I guess Crash is more extreme than wacko.

1463
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:54,580
And then Brer Fox is a guy named J.D. Hall who is the voice of Blade on Spider-Man the

1464
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:55,580
animated series.

1465
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:56,580
Wow.

1466
01:10:56,580 --> 01:11:01,540
And Gargenis in the ancient mythology, I don't know what that is.

1467
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:04,540
Who's the other anomaniac?

1468
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:06,460
Would you have said Yakko or was it wacko?

1469
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:07,460
Yakko is Jess Parnell.

1470
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:15,420
Wacko, the voice of Yakko, Rob Paulson plays a big part in David Copperfield's current

1471
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:16,420
show at the MGM Brands.

1472
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:17,420
Oh wow, awesome.

1473
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,700
And I don't want to say what, I don't want to give anything away.

1474
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:20,700
He is awesome.

1475
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1476
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:22,700
Rob Paulson is really fantastic.

1477
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:27,820
But please, I really, ooh I cannot even spoil it, everyone listening needs to get their

1478
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:31,220
asses to Vegas and see what Rob Paulson is up to.

1479
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,420
It is an out of this world experience.

1480
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:42,020
Okay, anyway, so let's, do you have more facts Jason or do you want to?

1481
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:43,020
No, no.

1482
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:48,660
Oh, just that former Animatronic of the Month contestant, Man-Tized Dog in a Spinning Rowboat

1483
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:49,980
is in this ride.

1484
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:53,380
I forget where to describe, he's after one of the little drops.

1485
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:54,900
Hard to spot, hard to spot.

1486
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:59,760
Hard to spot, but he's really spinning in that rowboat and because it's mostly a darkness,

1487
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:00,820
it is unsettling.

1488
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:04,060
In a domesticated animal amongst wild animals.

1489
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:07,140
Domesticated but also man-sized, like very large.

1490
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:08,780
You need to domesticate those.

1491
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:14,100
I'd like to say that many of the animatronics, the animatronics carted over from America

1492
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:21,500
Sings were designed by Mark Davis, one of the great, the original nine old men, one

1493
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:28,820
of Walt's trusted early crew people who also designed the first Animatronic of the Month

1494
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:33,500
striped shirt pirate among many of the Pirates of the Caribbean characters.

1495
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:37,160
And I'm not totally sure, but possibly the second one, Uncle Orville, because I think

1496
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,980
he did a lot of carousel of progress as well.

1497
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:45,040
I see Mark Davis was one of the guys that Walt was like, you're a great animator and

1498
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,040
guess what?

1499
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,860
Now you're building robots.

1500
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:54,080
Yeah, he really carted people over who had no experience in this area, which who did?

1501
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,080
No one had experience in this area.

1502
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:58,500
I had the thought as you were saying that, like one of the first, like where do you fucking

1503
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,500
begin?

1504
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:03,620
Where do you even, I was just drawing a mouse.

1505
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:08,340
My job Monday was drawing a mouse and my job Tuesday is building a robot pirate.

1506
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:09,340
It's like, right, right.

1507
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,580
Well, I guess robotics people are different.

1508
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:16,540
I mean, he did, when I say he designed, he did like the concept art for like, he didn't

1509
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:17,540
like go and learn robotics.

1510
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:18,540
Yeah.

1511
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:19,540
So it's way more science.

1512
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:23,540
A lot of cross-disciplinary stuff in the first few generations.

1513
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:25,100
It's a simple time.

1514
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,380
It's a simple time Jason's going to bring us back to it.

1515
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:33,740
A bunch of, as we say, usually like a bunch of short sleeve dress shirt, older men who

1516
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:39,060
like smoked ton and drank and didn't have any sort of nostalgic love for Disney because

1517
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,240
it didn't exist.

1518
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,580
Just did all of this amazing stuff.

1519
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:43,580
Yes.

1520
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:47,100
They look like all of the regular people in hidden figures.

1521
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:52,340
They're the people who the hidden figures women had to break into be included with.

1522
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:53,340
Yeah.

1523
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:54,340
They didn't treat women very well.

1524
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:56,540
Mary Blair and Alice Davis there too.

1525
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:59,780
Alice Davis, wife of Mark Davis, a long time Imagineer as well.

1526
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:00,780
All right.

1527
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:01,780
Yeah.

1528
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:02,780
Yeah.

1529
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:04,340
Well, so I, which I think is part of what, that's a great thing about all these characters

1530
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:09,380
in Splash Man is they like, they have like a classic Disney feel because they were made

1531
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:13,180
in the seventies by this like classic Imagineer.

1532
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:15,520
Yeah, I love, I do.

1533
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:19,220
So earlier I was like, Oh, the characters, like when we were talking about why this IP

1534
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:23,180
and whatnot, I do love like the look of it.

1535
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:29,260
But like the, there is something like a little abrasive up rare rabbit.

1536
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:32,100
And if they, I don't want to get into the changes.

1537
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:39,460
I don't want to get the changes I make, but there is like a little bit of like the voice

1538
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:45,220
work feels like it could use a, a little, a little update.

1539
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:50,540
And they've softened, like I said, they've softened it since the movie.

1540
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:52,660
Less abrasive than the actual film.

1541
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:53,660
Yeah.

1542
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:54,660
Yeah.

1543
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:55,660
So there's an idea.

1544
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:56,660
Right.

1545
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:57,660
Get, get your Rob Pulsons in the mix.

1546
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:58,660
Yeah.

1547
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,860
Maurice LaMarche is the cable guy.

1548
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:06,740
You Larry, the current Disney voice actor, Larry, the kid with maybe meter is just one

1549
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:07,740
of the characters.

1550
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:08,740
Maybe they just swap.

1551
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:09,740
Yeah.

1552
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:10,740
I'm in here too.

1553
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:11,740
Yeah.

1554
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:12,740
All right.

1555
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:13,740
Is asked down the Hill.

1556
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:14,740
Like put me in Mater.

1557
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:15,740
Oh, you want the car to be made?

1558
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:16,740
Man, we're plussing it up already.

1559
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:18,700
Ooh, I like that one.

1560
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:19,700
That is a great idea.

1561
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:27,340
At least a seasonal Mater change over or like, Hey, I'm an Easter egg.

1562
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:28,340
My thing with was both.

1563
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:31,020
SpongeBob is one of my favorite rides.

1564
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:34,540
It's as all the things you were saying, like it's a nice long ride.

1565
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:38,380
You get a lot of show, you get a lot of robots, which is all we'll ever talk about.

1566
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:39,800
It's like you get so many of that.

1567
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,520
It's got a nice fun thrill in it.

1568
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,820
It's got a couple minor thrills to it.

1569
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:47,600
I don't go on it as much cause sometimes we're there.

1570
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:52,340
We decided to go down at night and I don't like being soaking wet at 9 PM.

1571
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:56,460
Yes, it is a certain rides like log flume rides.

1572
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:00,700
You have to time and like there's a, there, there is a chance like maybe you'll be at

1573
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:05,140
the park and like you wanted to ride it, but just the weather's not cooperating cause you'll

1574
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:07,900
be, you'll be really a chilly.

1575
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:10,060
There is a tip.

1576
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:11,340
Here's a tip.

1577
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:16,860
If you don't want to get that wet, do single rider and ride as the creep with another family

1578
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:19,780
because that last seat is the least wet seat.

1579
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:25,460
I rode with my buddy Jeff like in September and we got a fast pass and we were, we were

1580
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:27,340
in the first two and we were drenched.

1581
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:28,340
It was crazy.

1582
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:33,380
I mean it wasn't as bad as like a universal Dudley do ride ride, which just literally

1583
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:37,020
like you should, they should have another change of clothes for you after that ride.

1584
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:42,860
But this one, this splash mountain definitely soaked my socks and shoe and like ruins you

1585
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,420
for like an hour and a half.

1586
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:51,260
And they, if it's not that crowded, they don't load the boats to capacity and then like they

1587
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:54,560
load it so that the wheat is kind of distributed.

1588
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:59,700
So then the backseat is not necessarily very dry because then there's no one to catch the

1589
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:00,700
water.

1590
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:01,700
The water light hit.

1591
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:06,800
I think we, I rode the, I think I rode the ride with you once and it drenched you and

1592
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,800
didn't touch me.

1593
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:12,920
Yeah, I love being, and I, and you are, I will say the thing about Jason, he loves being

1594
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,580
soaking wet at a theme park.

1595
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:18,380
The only person I know that is a embraces trench foot.

1596
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:19,380
Yeah.

1597
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:26,140
I mean, I will say this ride is very well suited to Orlando because you can ride it

1598
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:32,500
at midnight when it's like 75 degrees and sure I'm already soaking wet from sweat.

1599
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,500
Fine.

1600
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:38,300
But like Southern California either got a, I mean you can, if you try, if you hold your

1601
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:43,600
feet up and you, you got a hoodie on or something like you can get not that wet, but there's

1602
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:49,800
like a very small portion of the year where you're like, I want to ride this and I want

1603
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,020
to get very wet cause it doesn't get that hot here.

1604
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,020
Right.

1605
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:55,020
Yeah.

1606
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:59,380
Another thing about it is that it's like, it's got a lot of moves.

1607
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:03,900
It's got a lot of different emotional moves, which I like, like it's fun and then it's

1608
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:04,900
like psychedelic.

1609
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:10,220
There's like a weird drug trip part of it and then it turns scary when the full opossum

1610
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:13,220
is telling you don't fall into the briar patch.

1611
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:14,220
Right.

1612
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:15,220
So it's got these nice moves.

1613
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:19,860
I will say also this, the ride often is broken a little bit and a lot of show scenes are

1614
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,340
in pure darkness.

1615
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:26,300
So sometimes you ride it and it's truly a sinister feeling because it feels like you're

1616
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:30,100
riding it with the lights off and it feels like, I don't know what's lurking there.

1617
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:32,100
There's a bear, but he's not, I can't see what he's doing.

1618
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:35,820
And like a lot of randomly placed laughs like, yes, there's a lot of laughs.

1619
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:38,940
You don't know why people are laughing or animals are laughing.

1620
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:39,940
It's hard.

1621
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:43,780
It's, it's, it's, uh, historically hard to fix this ride because it's like water ride

1622
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:45,300
and you have to shut things down.

1623
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:49,740
So when stuff starts breaking, they just kind of have to go with it a lot of time.

1624
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:53,000
So like you ride it and like half the show scenes aren't lit up.

1625
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
It's truly creepy.

1626
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,500
It's a very creepy thing.

1627
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,620
For like a chunk every year essentially.

1628
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:01,860
And you can tell when it's opened back up again cause that last show scene with all

1629
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:06,420
the animatronics on the boat and it looks so great when everything's moving.

1630
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:10,100
But there were times every now and then where only half the people are moving.

1631
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:14,900
Do you think there's a like a threshold where it's like, you know, if there's 18 little

1632
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:18,060
animals on there, they're like, all right, we crossed the thread.

1633
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:19,320
Like it's 10 aren't working.

1634
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,320
We got to go up there.

1635
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,460
But like nine is like, I'm not going up.

1636
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:23,540
I think so.

1637
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:25,740
There is a clip, but we should find it and post it.

1638
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:30,680
There's a clip not long ago where someone went and saw the boat foot goes into that

1639
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:36,940
last scene on the showboat and all of the robots aren't working and it's truly creepy

1640
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:39,500
and they're just like staring at you.

1641
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,500
They're not moving.

1642
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,020
The song is still playing.

1643
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:46,640
So like someone's singing, but it's not these characters and it's, it's alarm.

1644
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:47,640
It's very alarming.

1645
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:48,640
They're ghosts.

1646
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:52,380
By the way, I think it's fun sometimes when we just call them robots.

1647
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:54,380
You can't say animatronics every time.

1648
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:55,380
It's such a low word.

1649
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:56,380
Pretty mealy mouth.

1650
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:58,100
We like to have a little sense of humor about it.

1651
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:00,820
So it's funny to say like that robot over there.

1652
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:04,540
I think I just to say robot or get it even more wrong.

1653
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,100
I think I called them people a moment.

1654
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:14,380
I guess all them people know what are those metal people doing?

1655
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:20,060
What are other details of this?

1656
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:25,740
Mike brought something up that I really like it in that, um, if there's for me, cause I

1657
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:28,900
haven't been on it a lot.

1658
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:32,180
You fall for those, those fake drops.

1659
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:35,460
Like those fake drops are like nice moments of like a surprise.

1660
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:38,700
They kind of get the anticipation level up.

1661
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:44,140
It seemed like in that one moment that you get distracted by that big old bear butt.

1662
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:48,260
That's a kind of, and then you aren't looking down and then that they, that one's in pure

1663
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:49,940
darkness so it sneaks up on you.

1664
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:50,940
Right.

1665
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:51,940
Right.

1666
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:55,340
So if I'm a kid writing that for the first time, I think that's a, that's a good fake

1667
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:56,340
drop.

1668
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:59,020
And then you got a good, I think at the top too, if you've been on it for the first time,

1669
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:02,380
you go up, it takes you up and you go around and you're outside at the first point and

1670
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:04,180
then you see there's a drop coming.

1671
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:07,620
And I think if you didn't know, you might think this is the first, this is the drop.

1672
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:11,960
So you don't even know it's, it's, it does such a good job of making you not even aware.

1673
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,700
So I bet if you're going on the first time you go, Oh, this must be that drop I saw.

1674
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:15,700
Cause you don't, yeah.

1675
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,140
As you said earlier, you're disoriented.

1676
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:18,820
You don't know where you all are already.

1677
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:19,820
So it's such a maze.

1678
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:21,460
I want to see the plans of it.

1679
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,860
I probably, I'm an idiot, so I don't really probably even know.

1680
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:29,540
I understand like if I saw blueprints, but like I would love to like know or even, I

1681
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:34,740
mean like I know from listening to the podcast, the dream is a mid ride shut down and a walk

1682
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:39,060
on and people have had it at the top of the lift Hill on splash mountain.

1683
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,060
Whoa.

1684
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:41,060
Right before.

1685
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:42,060
Yes.

1686
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:43,060
So it'd be the big, that's the dream.

1687
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:44,060
That's, that's one of the big ones.

1688
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:46,020
I mean obviously Indiana Jones, a pirate.

1689
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:50,320
So, but yes, at the top of the lift Hill on splash mountain, certainly one of the walk

1690
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,320
off dreams.

1691
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,320
Oh man.

1692
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,820
That'd be my dream if I went on it.

1693
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:56,900
Yeah, that would be the best.

1694
01:21:56,900 --> 01:22:01,740
Steven Spielberg riding the Jurassic park ride who got off right before the drop.

1695
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:02,740
Yeah.

1696
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:03,740
Yeah.

1697
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:04,740
Yeah.

1698
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:07,820
If I could, well, I don't want to, it's like, excuse me, I'm the director of song of the

1699
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:08,820
south.

1700
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:11,180
Can you let me off please?

1701
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:16,100
Maybe that'll be how the special ends is that you start having a fit on the way up and then

1702
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:21,380
you try to get out of the flume and they have to shut the whole ride down and then like

1703
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:23,340
you end up in Disney jail or something.

1704
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:27,020
I mustered into a straight jacket or shoved in my mouth.

1705
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:31,580
You put a, are you sedated or maybe we do it where like we bring two top hats and we

1706
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:33,820
try to put the top hats on the crows.

1707
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:37,180
So you can reach out little hooks.

1708
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:38,180
Yeah.

1709
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:42,780
Well, you know, a lot of people do bring props on this ride.

1710
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:48,060
It's become a real thing that the photo that they take as you drop a P that, you know,

1711
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:53,580
there's been like a group of people are playing like donkey Kong on xbox.

1712
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:56,860
They like set up an entire, one of them's holding the console.

1713
01:22:56,860 --> 01:23:02,020
The other two people have the, uh, the controllers and somebody's holding a TV.

1714
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:04,540
This is like, like I feel like someone playing chess.

1715
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:05,540
Yeah.

1716
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:06,540
Yeah.

1717
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:07,540
How did they get that stuff on?

1718
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:08,540
I have no idea.

1719
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:09,540
In your bag.

1720
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:10,540
Yeah.

1721
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:11,540
Yeah.

1722
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:13,740
It's a whole, also Dwayne Johnson, the rocks photo is very fun.

1723
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:16,180
There's a photo of him going down splash mountain.

1724
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:17,180
He's just like cheering.

1725
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:18,180
He's just super psyched.

1726
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:23,020
But there's a lot of, yeah, I think, um, as I said earlier, people who've read this, written

1727
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:27,140
this 150 times, they start getting fucking cute with this shit.

1728
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:28,900
And I'll tell you what, I don't care for it.

1729
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:29,900
I don't like it.

1730
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:33,900
Well, you know what I don't like, and I feel the same way of like, I'm seeing a live show

1731
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:36,020
or going to a premiere of a movie.

1732
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:41,300
Uh, the audience will never be the entertainment to like, like don't do that.

1733
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:43,620
Like don't talk during a comedy show.

1734
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:48,780
Yell during the trailer of a premiere of a movie, like especially don't be the second

1735
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:52,820
guy that does it who thinks he's going to get as much of a response as the first guy.

1736
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:57,300
Because I've seen that happen at every Marvel movie where someone says something and then

1737
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:01,940
a second guy tries to say something else and like he's crucified.

1738
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:09,300
Uh, some, yeah, we've seen some, uh, opening night showings at the city walk at universal

1739
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:12,100
and lot of bits during those.

1740
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:15,900
Yeah, don't know during the movie cause they're so excited.

1741
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:20,580
Yeah, but the trailers, there's some performative stuff going contain it.

1742
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:21,580
Yeah.

1743
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:22,580
You're a tating area.

1744
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:26,540
I feel like I have some blood on my hands as one of the original people involved in

1745
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:27,820
the beginnings of the room.

1746
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:29,420
Tommy Wiseau's the real right.

1747
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:33,780
Uh, like for like it became this dream for me and my friends cause I was part of the

1748
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:39,660
group that like found it first in 2003 and like, Oh my God, that there is this movie

1749
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:41,260
and we know no one else will be in it.

1750
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:45,820
It is daring to know one and we can go in there and yell and make up our stuff.

1751
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:50,720
And I remember I started throwing spoons at the screen and now it is such an, it's such

1752
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:51,720
a nightmare.

1753
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,420
It is like it's, it is pure bedlam.

1754
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:59,740
It's those room foreclothes, the room screenings I say, they're out of control.

1755
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:03,100
We'll never, uh, like just fire bomb the whole thing.

1756
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:06,700
You just see pictures and you're like, what hell half I wrong.

1757
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:07,700
Absolutely.

1758
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:10,180
Um, yeah, I couldn't do it.

1759
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:12,460
I have no desire to go to one of those.

1760
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:17,620
I had a, not to get too far off topic, but I had, I saw Joe's apartment when I was a

1761
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:18,620
kid.

1762
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:26,220
Roaches MTV's first like a foray into film on which a, uh, Owen Burke, who you see be

1763
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:31,300
mainstay was like, he was like a pa on that weird facts.

1764
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,460
First movie he worked on, I think.

1765
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:36,420
Yeah, that was very much our experience where no one else was in the theater and I don't

1766
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:37,420
know how old I was.

1767
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:42,860
I was probably 10 or so and I'm looking around and I'm like, wait, we can kind of do anything

1768
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:43,860
we want.

1769
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:47,540
And I was too much again of a weiner, but like I definitely had some friends that were

1770
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:50,660
looking gummy bears and the winging them at the screen and stuff.

1771
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:52,220
It's pretty fun.

1772
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:53,220
Yeah.

1773
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:56,380
Well it feels, it feels fun with it's you and your friends because you know them, but

1774
01:25:56,380 --> 01:26:00,380
if it's some jerks you don't know, there's 200 shut up.

1775
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:06,880
Um, anyway, well the other bit of fun obviously that people have on, have had on the, on splash

1776
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:12,940
mountain is you go down that drop, you lift up your shirt and you show them boobies.

1777
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:15,580
A phenomenon known as flash mountain.

1778
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:16,580
Flash mountain.

1779
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:20,020
And this is like, this is very much the like care for it.

1780
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:22,300
I don't, none of us care for it.

1781
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:28,460
Well there's, yes, we're good little boys and we don't approve of a R rated materials

1782
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:32,140
occurring on our beloved attraction or rated material in general.

1783
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:33,140
No, no, no.

1784
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:38,980
I see now here's the thing I heard about flash mountain whenever it was having its heyday

1785
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:41,340
and I of course stay away from that.

1786
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:42,340
Not for me.

1787
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:43,340
Good.

1788
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:47,740
Uh, but I just for pure research purposes, I thought I should see what's going on on

1789
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:49,860
flash mountain these days.

1790
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:51,020
And it's still a thing.

1791
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:52,620
It is not still a thing.

1792
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:55,380
The address, so the address was flash mountain.net.

1793
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:57,620
They didn't get the.com.

1794
01:26:57,620 --> 01:27:07,940
And it seems to have disappeared around 2006 or so, but via the wayback machine at web.archive.org,

1795
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:11,220
you can check out the remnants of, of flash mountain.

1796
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:13,500
Let me tell you what you've all been missing out on.

1797
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:24,660
A warning splash page and then 16 low res JPEGs, which all do contain nipple content,

1798
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:26,960
but some of them you have to search for.

1799
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,860
In some cases it's like, is there one?

1800
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:30,460
Oh yeah, I guess so.

1801
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:34,220
And then there's one of the 16 that is not splash mountain.

1802
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:37,500
It's a different roller coaster entirely.

1803
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:42,180
This is, and I, and I checked from like, I checked in 2003 and I checked in 2005 and

1804
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:43,700
it stayed the same 16.

1805
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:48,140
It is a wall of 16 JPEGs of blurry boobs in motion.

1806
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:54,260
I just want to point out to the listeners, Jason's glasses have fogged up.

1807
01:27:54,260 --> 01:28:03,380
My trademark bow tie will not stop spinning and my shirt, Dickie has rolled up like an

1808
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:04,500
old timey blind.

1809
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:12,340
Jason is usually just dressed like Big Bird at the symphony.

1810
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:15,340
Pupils have turned into giant breasts.

1811
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:22,020
I believe TMZ also did a segment on it, but back, back around that time.

1812
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:28,060
And it seemed like I read a writeup ballot and it seemed they, they went like, Oh, there's

1813
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:29,060
this website.

1814
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:31,420
Yeah, we'll just do the same thing.

1815
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:33,660
We'll just take these pictures down and show them ourselves.

1816
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:34,660
But blur them.

1817
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:35,660
Oh sure.

1818
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:36,660
Yeah.

1819
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:37,660
Like this thing's crazy, right?

1820
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:42,780
Harvey like, you know, I just couldn't believe that it was so thin.

1821
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:45,420
I think I'd always imagined it was this vast archive.

1822
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:49,500
When you brought it up, I thought, Oh, this must've been like a real issue that they had

1823
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:56,980
to make changes for about 16 and one of them is not, but so actually only 15.

1824
01:28:56,980 --> 01:28:59,340
Now they could just catch it and hide it immediately.

1825
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:04,420
I digitally, although I heard there's also some stories in 2009 that they do do budget

1826
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:05,420
cutbacks.

1827
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:08,220
They had to get rid of the person who was doing those checks.

1828
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:12,420
So I don't know if that remains true, but there was thought of will flash mountain return

1829
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:13,660
and it did not.

1830
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:18,020
The rumor that is, I mean, I don't, I don't know if I've ever had this confirmed, but

1831
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:21,900
the rumor also was that in Disneyland they had to get rid of captain Jack Sparrow walk

1832
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:24,540
around character because women were flashing him.

1833
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:25,540
Hmm.

1834
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:28,580
I don't know if that's ever been cause they still have him in Florida and I saw him when

1835
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:31,260
we were there, but they, I have not seen captain Jack.

1836
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:39,220
I gotta say my ex like when I'm going to Disney, my experience there is not what those people

1837
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:40,980
anticipate their vacation to be.

1838
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:45,260
Like I, I really wanted to be escapists where like there's no murder.

1839
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:48,900
Like I'm in a new world where it's safe and it's fun.

1840
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:49,900
Sure.

1841
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:54,460
Yeah, it's safe and it's fun and it's like, there's no, uh, I'm very anti only.

1842
01:29:54,460 --> 01:30:01,140
You know, like you don't even like the idea that like there's this dark, uh, secret underbelly

1843
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:02,140
of Disneyland.

1844
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:04,900
I think that all the bad characters should go.

1845
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,420
You don't know why they keep this haunted house.

1846
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:09,420
Haunted mansion is a problem.

1847
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:13,660
They just bullet these spirits in this thing and they keep it open.

1848
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:14,820
Let them rest in peace.

1849
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:19,300
A lot of them seem to have died in a silly ways.

1850
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:22,540
Look, I totally agree with you for my money.

1851
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:30,440
The only body ness I want is a couple, uh, burlesque bird dancers on a steam ship lifting

1852
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:33,060
up their dresses a little bit while they're dancing.

1853
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:34,580
That's as much body ness as I like.

1854
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:36,700
You leave it to the imagination.

1855
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:39,100
Disneyland's a land of imagination.

1856
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,300
Isn't it sexier if you don't see all the way up the skirt?

1857
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:43,300
Of course it is.

1858
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:44,300
Direct quote from parents.

1859
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:53,100
Save that funny business for your official Disney hotel rooms or the Disney dream suite

1860
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:54,640
or Walt's apartment.

1861
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:55,640
You have a key.

1862
01:30:55,640 --> 01:31:00,340
If you happen to know a mayor who happens to be lonely that evening.

1863
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:03,820
I'll still party.

1864
01:31:03,820 --> 01:31:08,340
Just in the privacy of my own home, which is Walt's apartment.

1865
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:10,820
You're like that Canadian mayor.

1866
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:14,340
Rob Ford, the late Rob Ford.

1867
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:15,340
I'm sorry.

1868
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:16,980
Rest in peace Rob.

1869
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:20,260
But instead of crack rocks, it's rock candy.

1870
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:23,020
Yeah, made on site.

1871
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:25,620
The Disney convexary.

1872
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:26,620
Do snort it.

1873
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:27,620
He's snorting rock.

1874
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:30,220
He's got a pile of rock candy like Scarface.

1875
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:34,540
Have you all done like a food based episode yet where you check it?

1876
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:35,540
Not entirely though.

1877
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:37,740
Our Harry Potter episode is very food centric.

1878
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:40,860
We covered the food more than any other element.

1879
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:44,500
The doughboys are very litigious.

1880
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,380
We don't want to do that.

1881
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:53,740
So does anybody have any other thoughts before we get to the scale we've been talking about?

1882
01:31:53,740 --> 01:32:00,580
I have one final thought which is I'd like to send some appreciation to the main.

1883
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:04,760
There's all this music in the ride that's very of the period, very 40s.

1884
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:08,580
The 40s Academy Award winning song, Zippity Doodah.

1885
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:12,940
But you know, I'm a kid of the rad 80s.

1886
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:14,900
I don't know if I can relate to this stuff.

1887
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:20,660
And I appreciate that in a lot of these specials, they updated Zippity Doodah for the hip hop

1888
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:21,980
generation.

1889
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:24,260
And there are several pieces of material.

1890
01:32:24,260 --> 01:32:29,020
There was some special in the sing along songs.

1891
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:33,420
Not only is it kind of a hip hop out Zippity Doodah that they present where there's like

1892
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:36,260
a sample of a guy.

1893
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:40,180
Zippity Doodah.

1894
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:43,180
There is a little added rap verse.

1895
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:48,420
You know what, here I'll just pre-say this is my plus it up is to get this great rap

1896
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:52,660
that only exists in promotional materials into the ride itself.

1897
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:58,300
And I could play a clip, but I think I owe it to everyone to perform it myself.

1898
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:02,020
It's very brief, but I think it's very beautiful.

1899
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:06,500
Well you know it is a thrill when you go downhill cause you're riding on a mountain of your

1900
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:07,760
own free will.

1901
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:12,300
And you're zipping in a flash on a daring dash down a waterfall so rapid that you go

1902
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,900
splish splash.

1903
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:17,620
Zip, zip, zip, zip, zip.

1904
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:27,780
Let's get that beautiful refrain into the, that's echoed in, that's my favorite rap song.

1905
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:33,940
I don't know about Kendrick Lamar, but I do know this.

1906
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:36,380
It's a good little tune.

1907
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:40,380
So kudos to the writers of Rappity Doodah.

1908
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:41,380
Is that what it goes by?

1909
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:43,380
No I'm going to call it that.

1910
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:47,900
That's a long way from Percocet, Molly Percocet.

1911
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,100
We'll put that up too.

1912
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:51,060
That's one of the old sing along songs.

1913
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:52,480
So I combined some segments.

1914
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,480
That's my plus.

1915
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:54,480
That's all right.

1916
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,480
That's great.

1917
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:56,480
That's all right.

1918
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,180
So let's plus it up for Scott.

1919
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:01,460
Jason what do you think?

1920
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:07,780
Yeah I think, well my plus it up is like let's get those show scenes always lit.

1921
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:13,300
Let's get those animatronics always moving cause that show boat scene is so fun.

1922
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:19,980
I'm wondering if you know, sometime soon, maybe a few years down the line, we reexamine

1923
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:21,260
some of those voices.

1924
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:25,700
Maybe soften those voices a little more even cause I feel like when we were watching the

1925
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:29,340
ride through I was like oh there's one or two moments where I don't know.

1926
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:33,340
I mean I still think it's more fun.

1927
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:35,360
Well again get them doing the rap.

1928
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,360
Put the rap.

1929
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:41,860
Make the dialogue with the rap.

1930
01:34:41,860 --> 01:34:51,620
Yeah but I do think it's fun and I do think I would be interested to see as we get older

1931
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:56,860
what the conversation is around the source material if something eventually does come

1932
01:34:56,860 --> 01:35:04,540
out or if consensus, I don't know if consensus will ever be reached on that movie but like

1933
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:05,540
I think it's an interesting thing.

1934
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:11,580
If a consensus is reached let's put that next to the safety instructions on the ride.

1935
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:15,340
Here is where history has landed on Song of the South, the film on which this ride is

1936
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:16,340
based.

1937
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:20,780
Yeah but I do think it is an example of a thing that was inspired by another thing that

1938
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:25,140
has transcended its original source material.

1939
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:33,340
I would say that yes the fun ride is better than the racially disputed film.

1940
01:35:33,340 --> 01:35:34,340
It's official.

1941
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:39,540
That's a mayoral decree.

1942
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:41,260
People enjoy this ride.

1943
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:43,900
Alright, G you want to go next?

1944
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:44,900
Sure.

1945
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:47,900
Well I've kind of already said a bit of what I changed.

1946
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,140
I'll reiterate a little quickly.

1947
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:52,980
I'll say that I think it's an almost perfect ride as is.

1948
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:53,980
I really love it.

1949
01:35:53,980 --> 01:35:59,180
Obviously I have a very bizarre emotional attachment to it.

1950
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:03,500
Maybe Brain was mentioned a couple times on the podcast today.

1951
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:12,860
But if I were to make some fun tweaks I always feel like there are moments and don't get

1952
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:15,220
me wrong, the animatronics are great.

1953
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:20,700
When I'm on a slower dark ride I almost want to interact a little bit more.

1954
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:25,860
I would love if you could bring a mug, maybe a souvenir mug with you and maybe one of the

1955
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:29,300
animatronics pours you a little something into it.

1956
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:31,840
You're going slow enough.

1957
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:35,020
You can tie in some sponsorships if you'd like Coca Cola products.

1958
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:44,420
Maybe you bring some of the sodas from Cool Club, from Epcot, the Coca Cola, some international

1959
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:45,420
sodas.

1960
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:46,420
I don't know how that feels.

1961
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:47,420
I'm really a bitter one.

1962
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:48,420
Yeah.

1963
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:49,420
Holds into the South, American South.

1964
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:50,420
That's the beauty of the river wine.

1965
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:52,980
That's the beauty of the rivers of America, right?

1966
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:57,020
America is a melting pot of sodas.

1967
01:36:57,020 --> 01:37:00,020
So I would say maybe it's a little interactive tinge there.

1968
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:01,420
I agree with Jason.

1969
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:02,740
Voice changes.

1970
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:04,340
Bring the Rob Pulsons of the world in.

1971
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:09,020
I don't need Selena Gomez voicing rare rabbit.

1972
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:11,860
I don't want any celebrities that usually takes me out of it.

1973
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:16,420
But those are my very minor changes where I find a very fun ride experience.

1974
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:17,420
Okay.

1975
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:18,420
That sounds good.

1976
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:22,260
I have a, okay, I'm going to say, I'm going to say plus it up, but what I'm going to say

1977
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:25,860
when I say plus, I guess it's kind of a lateral move.

1978
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:26,860
Here's what I want.

1979
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:32,500
Pull all the America Sings animatronics back out, put them back into Tomorrowland, bring

1980
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:34,220
back America Sings.

1981
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:36,780
That place has been empty for too long.

1982
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:40,180
There needs to be something in Tomorrowland that people want to go see.

1983
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:41,540
Take those characters out.

1984
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:45,740
Now the Winnie the Pooh attraction, kind of less popular.

1985
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:51,540
Take Pooh Bear, all the animatronics from that, replace all of the America Sings animatronics

1986
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:54,620
on Splash Mountain with the Pooh Bear and the Pooh characters.

1987
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:56,260
This is the honey pot slow ride?

1988
01:37:56,260 --> 01:37:57,260
Yes, the slow butt.

1989
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:01,660
Tigger, Piglet, Kanga, Little Roo, all of the characters.

1990
01:38:01,660 --> 01:38:05,980
Put them on the riverboat, put them in like fun dresses, dancing.

1991
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:06,980
I don't care.

1992
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:11,080
I'm just saying that Splash Mountain is such a good ride, it can withstand to lose some

1993
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:12,140
of these robots.

1994
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:15,580
We cannot take Tomorrowland being like this for much longer.

1995
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:17,740
I mean, the thing should be condemned.

1996
01:38:17,740 --> 01:38:18,740
It's unbelievable.

1997
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:19,740
Hold on, wait a second.

1998
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:20,740
Excuse me?

1999
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:21,740
That's madness.

2000
01:38:21,740 --> 01:38:22,740
That's madness.

2001
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:23,740
What do you mean?

2002
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:27,100
Pooh and Tigger company live in, what is the name of the wood?

2003
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:28,100
The Hundred Acre Woods.

2004
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:30,580
Isn't that in England?

2005
01:38:30,580 --> 01:38:33,220
That's in Christopher Robin's imagination, Jason.

2006
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:34,220
It can be anywhere.

2007
01:38:34,220 --> 01:38:35,220
Okay.

2008
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:39,100
He can imagine it to be in the antebellum south.

2009
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:40,100
Post antebellum.

2010
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:42,420
Wait, does antebellum mean current?

2011
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:43,420
Antebellum means pre-war.

2012
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:46,900
Oh shit, well I learn something every day.

2013
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:47,900
Post-Reconstruction era.

2014
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:48,900
Okay, you're right.

2015
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,540
So the war's been fought, things are fine.

2016
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:52,540
See, and that was the problem with the movie.

2017
01:38:52,540 --> 01:38:54,420
People weren't sure when it took place.

2018
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:55,420
Yeah, that was it.

2019
01:38:55,420 --> 01:38:57,460
But you, yeah, that was it.

2020
01:38:57,460 --> 01:39:04,300
So these swamp creatures, their friends from Britain are just visiting?

2021
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:08,180
It does not ever occur to me that Winnie the Pooh is British.

2022
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:09,180
Yeah, no.

2023
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:10,780
He's not, he's no Paddington.

2024
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:13,700
He doesn't wear his country on his sleeve.

2025
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:17,700
Christopher Robin is British, but we don't need him in the ride.

2026
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:19,580
He doesn't, he's, yeah, if anything.

2027
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:20,580
He's the boring character.

2028
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:22,020
Yeah, he's the boring, I don't really.

2029
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:24,980
Tigger's hijinks are gonna be perfect for the Laughing Place, Jason.

2030
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:26,980
He's laughing constantly.

2031
01:39:26,980 --> 01:39:27,980
I agree.

2032
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:29,260
I think Pooh could fit in.

2033
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:35,420
I also think like, Pooh is like, he is pretty malleable.

2034
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:41,740
He's just kind of like a slow, hungry character that like you can just put in.

2035
01:39:41,740 --> 01:39:44,380
But Jason, do you have a rebuttal potentially?

2036
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:45,940
I don't mean to hijack the fact.

2037
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:46,940
No, no, please.

2038
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:49,820
But like would you put a different set of characters in?

2039
01:39:49,820 --> 01:39:54,940
Wait a minute, I don't want to replace your answer, but the, what are the country bears

2040
01:39:54,940 --> 01:39:55,940
doing?

2041
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:57,660
Hey, they're sitting around somewhere?

2042
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:59,980
Now there's a plus it up to my plus it up.

2043
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:02,500
Yeah, former residents of the country.

2044
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:06,540
Let's get all these fucking characters off the ride and let's put Liverlips McGraw in

2045
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:07,540
there.

2046
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:09,700
Let's put Gomer and his, let's put Trixie in.

2047
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:11,860
These are beloved characters as far as I'm concerned.

2048
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:13,660
I've never been more passionate about any of my life.

2049
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:16,860
It's a shame that timing didn't work out that no one went like, wait, why don't we do the

2050
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:18,300
same thing with the country bear?

2051
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:20,100
Let's put, yeah, let's put the country bears in.

2052
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:24,740
The country bears is subject to some of the craziest timing in Disneyland history where

2053
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:28,740
they took the ride out as they were prepping the release of the film.

2054
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:29,740
What are you thinking?

2055
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:33,500
You're going to make a movie that looks that you know is bad.

2056
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,340
You guys know this.

2057
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:38,580
You have a bunch of bears singing with Bonnie rate and shit.

2058
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:40,140
You know, this isn't going to be good anyway.

2059
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:42,660
At least use your one tie in opportunity.

2060
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:46,620
Yet another episode we have to do is watch that goddamn country bears movie that doesn't

2061
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:49,500
even use any of the character country bears from the show.

2062
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:53,620
Yeah, just a bunch of different weird bears and they all sing with like Ernie.

2063
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:54,620
Yeah.

2064
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:58,180
They sing with the voices of Bonnie raid and Don Henley and it's not even like, where's

2065
01:40:58,180 --> 01:41:02,580
your classic big owl voice separate though from the actual country bears.

2066
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:03,580
Yes.

2067
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:04,580
There'll be many country bears episodes.

2068
01:41:04,580 --> 01:41:05,580
There'll be many.

2069
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:06,580
Okay.

2070
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:08,420
Very bear holiday in Japan anyway.

2071
01:41:08,420 --> 01:41:11,060
But I think we stumbled upon something interesting.

2072
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:13,540
Get some more animatronics in there.

2073
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:14,540
I find that.

2074
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:15,540
Yeah.

2075
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:17,300
Take all the characters out of splash mountain and put the country bears on.

2076
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:19,860
We have to put America sings back together.

2077
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:20,860
Yes.

2078
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:25,860
Boy, we have the hundred year, the 300 year centennial is right around the road.

2079
01:41:25,860 --> 01:41:28,620
We need to get ready for the next, ready for tricentennial fever.

2080
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:29,620
Yeah.

2081
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:30,620
It'll catch you.

2082
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:34,620
I mean, if there is one thing that could heal our nation right now, it might be America

2083
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:40,620
sings here in here in an Eagle with the voice of burl lives singing.

2084
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:42,700
You're a grand old flag.

2085
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:45,340
You're a high fly and flag.

2086
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:47,940
Maybe even bring back old Bonnie right to sing.

2087
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:49,540
Like, I don't know.

2088
01:41:49,540 --> 01:41:51,220
To do Ron Ron.

2089
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:52,220
Sure.

2090
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:53,220
Yep.

2091
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:54,220
Nation.

2092
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:55,220
He'll do it.

2093
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:56,220
No doubt.

2094
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:57,220
That'll do it.

2095
01:41:57,220 --> 01:41:58,220
All right.

2096
01:41:58,220 --> 01:41:59,220
Very nice.

2097
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:00,220
Well, we figured it out.

2098
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:01,220
We figured out what to do.

2099
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:02,220
Okay.

2100
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:06,380
So the last thing, geo, we've kind of constructed a little bit of a game here and I'm going

2101
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:07,420
to be the game master.

2102
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:12,500
I put this together and it's based on, Oh, and Lindsay and I went to Disney world a couple

2103
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:13,500
of years ago.

2104
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:16,280
There was some construction walls up and when they have these construction walls up, they

2105
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:18,160
put things on them to entertain you.

2106
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:20,500
So it's not just a standard wall.

2107
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:24,980
And for, I forget what was, I think it was seven dwarfs and they put up quotes from Walt

2108
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:29,380
Disney and you know, there's a couple of quotes everyone's familiar with, which is like, you

2109
01:42:29,380 --> 01:42:34,840
know, just remember it all started with the mouse and uh, let's see what another famous

2110
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:35,840
quote.

2111
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:38,740
Uh, show doesn't go on because it's ready.

2112
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:43,420
It goes on cause it's 1130.

2113
01:42:43,420 --> 01:42:45,900
Walt's not ready for prime time.

2114
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:47,460
Walt Disney started Saturday night live.

2115
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:48,460
Didn't he?

2116
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:49,460
Yeah, that's true.

2117
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:50,460
Yeah.

2118
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:53,260
I thought that was a quote about weekend.

2119
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:55,140
Or a studious, no, it was a studio 60.

2120
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:56,540
I think that's a Matt out.

2121
01:42:56,540 --> 01:43:02,420
Who would Walt's, uh, who would have, he would have had Wally Bogue in his cast.

2122
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:06,820
Who would Walter all Ravens, girl Ravens, crawl, freeze, Sterling Holloway.

2123
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:07,940
Oh my God.

2124
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:16,260
Can you imagine a net Louie Armstrong, a regular cast member, uh, Kurt Russell and then, uh,

2125
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:22,920
Joseph McCarthy, Senator Joseph McGarthy, Nixon.

2126
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:23,920
And Suzanne Plachette.

2127
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:26,700
That was a hell of a cast.

2128
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:28,700
I like the Nixon Plachette era the most.

2129
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:30,500
You like the era you grew up with.

2130
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:31,500
Yeah.

2131
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:32,500
Yeah.

2132
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:33,500
People, yeah.

2133
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:35,460
I know people say this, but great music during those seasons too.

2134
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:36,460
Great music.

2135
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:37,460
The guests.

2136
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:38,460
Yeah.

2137
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:39,940
Zippity doo da performed every single week.

2138
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:41,340
And the Sherman brothers.

2139
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:43,780
The Mormon Tabernacle choir.

2140
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:45,620
So you were saying.

2141
01:43:45,620 --> 01:43:46,620
Yeah.

2142
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:51,260
So I was saying, so, so once those quotes were out of the way, there were a lot of mundane

2143
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:56,660
quotes to put it mildly stuff that seemed very like there was no specific character

2144
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:57,660
to it.

2145
01:43:57,660 --> 01:43:58,660
Okay.

2146
01:43:58,660 --> 01:44:00,360
And then I started looking up like other walled quotes.

2147
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:06,220
So I'll give you a one of the other quotes when you're curious, you find lots of interesting

2148
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:08,780
things to do.

2149
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:10,100
And that is a Walt Disney quote.

2150
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:11,100
That is a quote.

2151
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:12,100
It's been attributed to him.

2152
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:17,480
I don't know why, but I looked it up and there are many of these quotes that are just very

2153
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:18,660
mundane seeming.

2154
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:19,860
There's no magic in them.

2155
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:23,980
You don't, you couldn't tell who said them by, if you gave them a list of famous people.

2156
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:30,340
So I found all these, I wrote, I found six of them and then I wrote six fake ones.

2157
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:31,340
Oh, okay.

2158
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:35,600
So what we're going to do is I'm going to read both of the quotes and you guys are going

2159
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:39,540
to guess what's the fake walled quote and what's the real walled quote.

2160
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:40,540
Okay.

2161
01:44:40,540 --> 01:44:44,180
So if some, well, I'll, I'll keep a score here.

2162
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:45,400
All right.

2163
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:46,500
So let's start.

2164
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:49,620
I'll give you one line and obviously I'll switch them around so you don't know what's

2165
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:50,620
first.

2166
01:44:50,620 --> 01:44:54,180
So, so one of the lines is the two things that have best aided me in my professional

2167
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:56,780
life are ideas and persistence.

2168
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:57,780
Okay.

2169
01:44:57,780 --> 01:45:05,820
Now the other line is laughter is America's most important export, which is the real vault

2170
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:06,820
quote.

2171
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:08,060
I can repeat them if you want.

2172
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:09,940
I think the first one is real.

2173
01:45:09,940 --> 01:45:10,940
Okay.

2174
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:13,940
You want me to repeat them or no, I'm going to agree.

2175
01:45:13,940 --> 01:45:18,900
I think the first one's real cause it's like has that kind of sad depression era vibe to

2176
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:19,900
it?

2177
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:20,900
The more his era.

2178
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:21,900
Yeah.

2179
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:22,900
Uh, what do you think?

2180
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:27,300
The first one, the second one is the real one.

2181
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:28,300
Wow.

2182
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:29,820
The fake wall quote.

2183
01:45:29,820 --> 01:45:33,540
The fake is the two things that have best aided me in my professional life are ideas

2184
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:34,540
and persistence.

2185
01:45:34,540 --> 01:45:35,540
That is fake.

2186
01:45:35,540 --> 01:45:36,540
I wrote that.

2187
01:45:36,540 --> 01:45:37,540
Excellent.

2188
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:38,540
Sounds real.

2189
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:41,500
Laughter is America's most important export is a real Walt Disney quote.

2190
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:42,500
All right.

2191
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:45,420
That sounds like something you'd hear it like at the NBC up fronts or something.

2192
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:46,420
Oh yeah.

2193
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:47,820
No, it's these full of these.

2194
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:48,820
Okay.

2195
01:45:48,820 --> 01:45:49,980
So, all right, here we go.

2196
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:56,500
The first line, uh, Disneyland represents the America that exists in our hearts.

2197
01:45:56,500 --> 01:46:01,620
And the second one is, uh, you may not realize it when it happens, but a kick in the teeth

2198
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:07,820
may be the best thing in the world for you.

2199
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:11,300
It seems I'm going to say second cause the first one seems so clean.

2200
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:12,740
It seems like a fake out.

2201
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:13,740
Yeah.

2202
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:16,880
It almost is too, too, uh, Disney.

2203
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:19,580
I think, I think the first one is real this time.

2204
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:23,660
I'm going to, I'll say, I think it's the second one and he said it on his deathbed.

2205
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:24,660
Final words.

2206
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:28,980
Uh, I don't know where any of these quotes came in his life, so I don't know if he was

2207
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:33,060
dying when he said these, uh, the correct is the second one.

2208
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:34,540
Jason loses that.

2209
01:46:34,540 --> 01:46:36,540
I've stopped keeping score cause who cares?

2210
01:46:36,540 --> 01:46:37,540
Uh, all right.

2211
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:38,540
Drag of your own.

2212
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:39,580
All right, here we go.

2213
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:40,580
Next one.

2214
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:47,740
Uh, I would rather entertain and hope that people learn something than educate people

2215
01:46:47,740 --> 01:46:50,460
and hope they were entertained.

2216
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:55,700
And then the other one is when you find a great collaborator, someone who you get along

2217
01:46:55,700 --> 01:47:01,100
with and who can understand and execute your vision, hang on to them.

2218
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:03,060
Okay.

2219
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:04,180
You can play at home too.

2220
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:07,820
First one feels, uh, like it could be like an Epcot.

2221
01:47:07,820 --> 01:47:13,660
I will have no, he like when you were his idea of Epcot, he wanted it to be like educational

2222
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:15,660
and utopian.

2223
01:47:15,660 --> 01:47:18,220
Uh, I'll say the first one.

2224
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:20,900
Yeah, I'll go with that too.

2225
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:21,900
I'll go first too.

2226
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:22,900
This time.

2227
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:23,900
The answer is the first one.

2228
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:24,900
All right.

2229
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:25,900
Good.

2230
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:26,900
All right.

2231
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:27,900
Now you guys are on track here.

2232
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:28,900
So I have at least two, but I don't know.

2233
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:31,860
Yeah, let's just do, we'll do one more cause I think I only have one more good one.

2234
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:33,620
Uh, all right, here we go.

2235
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:39,660
Uh, the first one is when you're in the thick of something, remember to take a moment for

2236
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:41,660
yourself.

2237
01:47:41,660 --> 01:47:47,540
Now the second one is of all the things I've done, the most vital is coordinating those

2238
01:47:47,540 --> 01:47:52,780
who work with me and aiming their efforts at a certain goal.

2239
01:47:52,780 --> 01:47:54,780
That one's Hitler.

2240
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:58,780
No, I jig is up.

2241
01:47:58,780 --> 01:47:59,780
First.

2242
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:05,700
Uh, yeah, I think it's the first one or the second one could be his deathbed quote.

2243
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:09,460
Now that I think about it, I think it might be the first one cause I can just picture

2244
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:13,980
that picture of him wandering through the castle before the park opened one day.

2245
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:17,580
Just smiling that that seems like, okay, sure.

2246
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:18,580
Yeah.

2247
01:48:18,580 --> 01:48:19,580
All right.

2248
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:21,700
So first and second to you, you're all wrong.

2249
01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:22,700
What?

2250
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:24,260
It's the second one that was Walt.

2251
01:48:24,260 --> 01:48:26,100
No quote of all the things I've done.

2252
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:30,260
The most vital is coordinating those who work with me and aiming their efforts at a certain

2253
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:31,260
goal.

2254
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:35,240
Walt Disney inspirational Walt Disney.

2255
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:39,140
So if you want to go look up Walt Disney quotes and there's so many of them and most of them

2256
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:41,980
are just the most boring Disney dry.

2257
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:42,980
Yeah.

2258
01:48:42,980 --> 01:48:46,740
There's like career counselor.

2259
01:48:46,740 --> 01:48:50,660
I swear this is probably a bit weak, but like it just felt like he was on the, on the wall

2260
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:51,660
when we were walking by.

2261
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:56,900
It was just like, make sure to always have a good executive assistant, like just like

2262
01:48:56,900 --> 01:49:01,780
very dry, like advice he'd give to a colleague who was starting an office.

2263
01:49:01,780 --> 01:49:02,780
Right.

2264
01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:03,780
Right.

2265
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:07,500
If you're building a river with a massive boat, make sure that it's simple enough to

2266
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:10,340
pilot that a teenager can do it.

2267
01:49:10,340 --> 01:49:11,340
Yeah.

2268
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:14,500
That's good advice for a theme park.

2269
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:16,300
I take a car to work.

2270
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:19,500
It's quicker.

2271
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:23,220
I think Burbank is a perfectly pleasant place to work.

2272
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:24,220
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2273
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:25,220
Say that again.

2274
01:49:25,220 --> 01:49:28,900
I'll get it down on the statue at the California adventure.

2275
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:34,740
Did you all, when you're at Disney world, did you go through the, like that kind of,

2276
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:41,180
um, they have like the museum and that one man's dream and then it ends on the theater,

2277
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:43,420
but the theater doesn't show anything about him.

2278
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:46,200
It's just like whatever new Disney movies coming out.

2279
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:47,820
So I went through Walt one man's dream.

2280
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:49,140
I was like, Oh, this is kind of nice.

2281
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:50,940
Uh, they harped a little too much in his hometown.

2282
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:57,540
Didn't care too much about it, but, uh, uh, yeah, but I, uh, I got to the end of it and

2283
01:49:57,540 --> 01:50:01,500
I was like, Oh cool, there's a movie and this guy's like, the movie starting and he didn't

2284
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:02,500
tell me what it was.

2285
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:09,220
And I walked in and it was just like 10 minutes of the new pirates of the Caribbean.

2286
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:14,220
That I think they changed cause it used to be a movie where the only dialogue was clips

2287
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:15,220
of him.

2288
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:16,220
That makes way more sense.

2289
01:50:16,220 --> 01:50:22,060
And then at some point they're like, we gotta get people aren't using chest clips in here.

2290
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:23,060
Right.

2291
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:29,260
Maybe without Walt's imagination and pension for dreaming, you don't end up with Paul McCartney

2292
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:34,620
as captain Jack's weird uncle in jail.

2293
01:50:34,620 --> 01:50:35,620
And what a scene.

2294
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:39,060
One never could have dream Paul McCartney pirate in jail.

2295
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:41,900
Uh, well on that note, yeah.

2296
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:44,860
Hey Gio, you've survived podcast.

2297
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:46,300
The ride man.

2298
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:49,820
Well, it was the splash mountain of podcasts.

2299
01:50:49,820 --> 01:50:54,060
Hey, now, uh, here, let's get a photo before you go.

2300
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:56,180
Hey, uh, lift up that sweater.

2301
01:50:56,180 --> 01:50:59,580
Hey, flash those titties.

2302
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:04,260
Well, is it, you don't want to do that.

2303
01:51:04,260 --> 01:51:07,580
Was there anything you do want to promote or alert people to?

2304
01:51:07,580 --> 01:51:11,420
Um, no, just, uh, maybe check out people of earth.

2305
01:51:11,420 --> 01:51:12,900
Season three will come back in the fall.

2306
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:15,180
Um, Twitter, you want Twitter?

2307
01:51:15,180 --> 01:51:18,820
I'm on Twitter every couple of months.

2308
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:20,300
By that you mean years.

2309
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:21,860
Um, yeah.

2310
01:51:21,860 --> 01:51:30,140

2311
01:51:30,140 --> 01:51:31,260

2312
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:34,180
So you ever want to do a Friday night thing there?

Gmail hashtag Jason for DLR.

2320
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:48,820
You know, it's catchy when the host forgets.

2321
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:49,820
Yeah.

2322
01:51:49,820 --> 01:51:50,820
Uh, yeah.

2323
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:51,820

We'll make Jason Mayer by 2031.

2325
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:54,980
Great.

2326

Thanks for listening everyone.

2328

Bye bye.
