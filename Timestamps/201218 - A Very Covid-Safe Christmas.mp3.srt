1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,160
It's a podcast the ride, very COVID safe Christmas.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,120
Coming to you from apocalyptic facsimiles of Knott's Berry Farm, Six Flags Magic Mountain

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,860
and Disneyland.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:25,040
With appearances by Mr. Six, Cyborg, a mean topical Ebenezer Scrooge, a man from the candy

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:32,360
cane realm, a pound and a half of fudge, a truly ill synced zoom sing along and due to

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,400
his breaking of current travel laws, no appearance by Santa Claus.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,040
And now here's your host, the regular host.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,760
Welcome to 2020's final podcast, the ride, a podcast about theme parks where after this

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,240
year we wish we chose a different podcast topic.

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,080
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Jason Sheridan.

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,120
I mean, you know, what are you going to do?

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,320
You know, it's just good that we love delving into the past.

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,280
I like that our hearts are in the 80s and 90s and such so much because boy, if it was all

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,960
like, new rides opening this year, that's a rough one.

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
Mike Carlson.

18
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,480
Yeah, I'm here.

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:26,080
I think that maybe we should have done a podcast about like Jeff Bezos's fortune maybe because

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,200
this year we would have been so excited to see the fortune grow as people got put out

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,760
needed his services more and he got more and more money and people got put out of work

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,400
and we would be thriving if that's all we talked about on this show.

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,960
Yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,240
Yeah, I know.

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,120
What's a good topic for the year?

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,840
If it was already a podcast about germ paranoia, this would have been a boon time.

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,680
Yeah, that would have been a good idea for a podcast.

28
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:01,920
I mean, a podcast about hand washing prior to this year might have been a dull listen.

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
I don't know.

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,000
There might be one and it might have been great for many years until now.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,240
But I think 2020 is when the Wash Wash boys really peak.

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,200
The Wash Wash boys would have, this would have been the biggest year in Wash Wash boys

33
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,720
history, for sure.

34
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah, I think probably next year people are going to be sick of the Wash Wash boys, honestly.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,760
And they're going to like, they're trying to branch out.

37
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,440
They're talking about like video games and Marvel movies and other.

38
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,640
You can hear about those things anywhere.

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,360
They try to like, they're talking about Star Wars and stuff, but they have to like tie

40
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,960
it into hand washing.

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,040
And like, do you think DJ and last Jedi washed his hands?

42
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,960
Do you think Holdo, did she just come back from the bathroom and she washed her hands?

43
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,520
Like, but it doesn't really work.

44
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,400
It's not really what the show was about.

45
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,480
And I guess you have to ask at this point, just with all this news, has Disney washed

46
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,440
their hands of Rian Johnson's announced trilogy?

47
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,560
Seems like maybe they have just scrubbed the whole thing.

48
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,080
Was it mixed in with the 50 other announcements they strung out over four hours?

49
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,560
Yeah, that's yeah, that's what people people think they didn't announce it, but it was

50
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
in there.

51
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,960
Just everyone blacked out.

52
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,480
Everyone took a nap at the exact same time.

53
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,040
So yeah, Wash Wash boys.

54
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,600
I'm glad we're not doing it, but it would have been smart.

55
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,440
It would have been at least smart to do an offshoot.

56
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,320
Well, we'll make a spin off immediately.

58
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,240
Let's hedge our bets from now on and just pick like five random things to do podcasts

59
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,680
about and see if they're they come into fruition down the road.

60
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,700
As of now, we're doing a podcast about theme parks and this is the last one of the year

61
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,720
on the main feed.

62
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,480
There are some treats waiting for you next week on podcast.

63
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,440
Patreon.com slash podcast the ride, but we're winding it down here for the year.

64
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:17,520
The sort of corny earnest thing I want to say at the top is just a big thanks to the audience

65
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,760
of this show for sticking with us.

66
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,240
You know what I liked was doing a show where we got to like go see the audience and they

67
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,400
got to come see us and how much I liked that we're starting to tour and and last year we

68
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,520
got to end the year doing this like cozy little show in a little black box theater

69
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,600
that felt like such a nice way to like hang with everybody and talk to everyone after.

70
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,120
And now that same event would be like a highly illegal super spreader.

71
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,360
I wish this wasn't the case, but the but the audience nonetheless in this virtual setting,

72
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,000
I just like thank everyone for for sticking with us even in this weird way of doing the

73
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,920
show. And we're so glad we didn't have to stop doing the show.

74
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,880
Yes, I think about this often that I did have a few times maybe in March and April when

75
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,760
oh, everyone's just going to stop listening, right?

76
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,400
Everyone's more important things to do right now than listen to us.

77
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,160
You make jokes about Admiral Holdo, but I appreciate I really very much appreciate everyone

78
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,520
sticking with us and having fun.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,320
I wish we could be together.

80
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,800
Once every podcast I listened to was doing the same thing and developing the same

81
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,960
encountering the same obstacles and overcoming the same challenges we were, I was like, oh,

82
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,960
OK, this is all right.

83
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,040
Thank God we're dealing with it.

84
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,840
I mean, it would be funny if like Doughboys was like, no, we're doing it in person still

85
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,760
forever. We defy the governor.

86
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,520
We're drop. We're going to shoot droplets into each other's mouths for these 10 months.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,560
They did it in the hospital.

88
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,600
They got it at the same time and had to do it between edit out ventilator hits.

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,760
Right. And it annoyed the other patients.

90
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,680
But the Doughboys maintained even in the ICU.

91
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,880
Of course. So, yes, I yes, God bless all of you.

92
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,680
If you don't believe in God, I'm using that in a way where I mean like,

93
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,960
you know, just a general like, you know, nice God version.

94
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,120
I'm not saying anything in a specific religious way.

95
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,160
You know, I'm spiritual.

96
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,560
Praise the nice.

97
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,320
Thank the nice feeling you have for sticking with us.

98
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,440
Yeah. Yeah.

99
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,360
No, sir. It's just been such a like sanity life raft and such a difficult.

100
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,440
Yeah. And how many people have had to drop the thing that they do?

101
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,560
And it's been great going to do the thing that we do.

102
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,520
And thanks to you guys, too.

103
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,840
It's just been I look forward to these a lot even more than before.

104
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,440
Yes, it's a or I think maybe you said it's got to forget if it's like it's

105
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,880
a it's like we have to be forced to be like having fun.

106
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,560
What's a force? Two hours of fun.

107
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,720
It's on the schedule. We set up a link.

108
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,080
And you click the link.

109
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,800
There's a link to have fun. So get on it and do it.

110
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,040
That's good. So, yes, I couldn't agree more.

111
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,040
Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Nice to have the reason.

112
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,160
And there's and to our our audience, there's one more.

113
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,600
Thing that we need to address.

114
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,160
And that is this if if you can remember

115
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,240
the first podcast, the ride of 2020.

116
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,920
And that's a big if because who can possibly who can remember

117
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,160
what life was in January 2020.

118
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,240
But something that was said, I think at the top of the very first show

119
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,560
was a sort of pimped thing from me to you,

120
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,160
Mike, especially was that 2020 will be the year that we do

121
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,720
the country bear jamboree.

122
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,840
Now, my feeling is and I think we started feeling as the year ticked on,

123
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,080
why would we take this attraction that we love so much and curse it

124
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,560
and force this attraction to like exist under the

125
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,080
the the the shadowy specter of the worst year ever?

126
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,880
And that's why we have decided to remove.

127
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,000
We were calling an audible.

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,920
Twenty twenty does not count.

129
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,120
You know, when I when I said we'll cover it this year, I meant like the,

130
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,880
you know, the regular year that was supposed to happen, not this year,

131
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,520
the one that did.

132
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,040
And and I guess with that, Mike, I turn it to you

133
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,360
for anything that you would like to say about our future handling

134
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,440
of the country bear jamboree.

135
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,680
And if I get emotional at any point during this, please just forgive me.

136
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,360
I think I'll be able to hold it together, though.

137
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,480
But first of all, I do think there.

138
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,920
Yeah, we said initially, Scott, you sprung it on me.

139
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,880
I can't help but feel maybe it was a bit of a curse,

140
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,200
you know, to swipe me with that blind side, me with that,

141
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,200
because it's such a big, important topic.

142
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,600
And I was reeling.

143
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,080
So I feel like maybe the universe got kind of knocked out of whack.

144
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,680
But I look, I shouldn't put that on you.

145
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,520
That's not fair.

146
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,960
But I think it's perfectly fair and it's all my fault.

147
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,120
But, you know, but moving forward, moving on, moving forward.

148
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,400
I will say this.

149
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,560
I I have a vision for the country bear episode of podcast, a ride,

150
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,800
and it just cannot work in Zoom.

151
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,120
OK, it's it's just I thought about it.

152
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,960
I thought, is there a way we can do it?

153
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,840
And I don't there is, but it's like I know it's going to lack

154
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,640
the in-person energy.

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,560
So we thought about doing, oh, we're going to do the we could just do the movie.

156
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,040
But that feels like we're just going to give you like a half-assed version

157
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,360
just to placate everyone.

158
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,280
And it's like, well, we'll go we'll get to the movie,

159
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,320
but we should probably do main show first.

160
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,360
And I also thought about like Christmas show, summer show.

161
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,480
Should we just do that instead and then do the main one later?

162
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,960
But no, we should start with the main one.

163
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,680
We should do it.

164
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,000
And the good news, I think, and hopefully vaccine permitting,

165
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:21,000
the first in-person recording that we do will be the country bears.

166
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,560
So I apologize for not getting it done this year.

167
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,720
But the first one we do where we get to look into each other's

168
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,440
eyes inside of a place will be the country bears.

169
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,520
And I will say the thing I will add just as a little bit of a tease,

170
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,600
is I want to have a real jamboree.

171
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,480
And my co-hosts don't quite know what I'm talking about.

172
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,080
And I 75% know what I'm talking about, but I'm still working on some logistics of it.

173
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,960
But I I want to have a jamboree for real.

174
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:00,080
So whatever that means to you, imagine it and just know that a good jamboree

175
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,240
is coming on the country bear jamboree episode.

176
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,440
So I apologize.

177
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,240
What I like about this is you are allowing yourself wiggle room.

178
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,520
Something I think we are good at when we say we'll do something.

179
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:19,480
Because it's like the first in-person episode back could be any number of upcoming

180
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,800
months based on constantly changing factors.

181
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,280
Sure.

182
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:30,880
Depending on how ambitious we get, on how further worse our state gets,

183
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,040
the one we record the podcast in.

184
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,680
There's a lot going on here.

185
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,560
Yes.

186
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,760
State of California, individual mental, psychological states, you know.

187
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,280
So I'm glad this is malleable.

188
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:49,680
And I'm also glad there's not a firm deadline because sometimes stuff is set on this show.

189
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,800
And I do not remember it.

190
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,400
When we sometimes handle logistical stuff before or right after recording, I usually have a legal

191
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,160
pad in my hand or a pocket notebook.

192
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:07,280
Because if I don't see it directly in front of me, I will just totally space on the conversation.

193
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, then let's...

194
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,440
Okay, that being said, Jason, we turn to you.

195
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,000
We assume that you have prepared your rendition of Oh Holy Night to close out the Christmas

196
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,840
season and go ahead and go.

197
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, you did.

198
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,880
You did prepare it.

199
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,400
Okay.

200
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,600
Didn't need the legal pad.

201
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,960
The church my family used to go to growing up, there was an older guy who every Christmas

202
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,040
Eve would just belt Oh Holy Night and would just kill it.

203
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:52,840
And it's hard to find a rendition of a baritone or a bass singer really belting that song.

204
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,040
That's why we gave it to you.

205
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,240
You're a deep baritone.

206
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,040
Oh, sure.

207
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,720
Yep.

208
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,880
All right.

209
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,200
Well, that's pretty big news.

210
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,520
That's big news there.

211
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:14,760
Now, just as a clue, and this completely tells you why we can't do it over Zoom.

212
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:22,400
The dictionary definition of jamboree is a large celebration or party, typically a lavish

213
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,880
and boisterous one.

214
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,440
Well, that's a clue.

215
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,120
That's what I'm thinking.

216
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,400
I do think I mean, I guess now that I'm thinking about it, I mean, maybe we would need to have

217
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,520
more than the three of us.

218
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,720
So maybe logistically, we have to figure out, you know, who's gotten, when is who got my

219
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,160
Pfizer?

220
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,120
Who got Moderna?

221
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,160
When did they get like there will be some of that logistic, because I think it will be

222
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,640
more than the three of us.

223
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,600
But I do think that's accurate.

224
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,400
Maybe big big is relative, you know, big for us might be having two guests on, you know,

225
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,880
because usually it's just one guest.

226
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,160
Well, I don't know that that many members of the wrecking crew are still kicking around,

227
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,520
are they?

228
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,080
Well, not the wrecking crew you know about.

229
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,600
OK, I had a different wrecking crew, brother.

230
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,160
Are they all bears?

231
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,760
They're all bears.

232
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,960
It's the three.

233
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,000
OK, I'll reveal it now.

234
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,040
I'm releasing three live bears into the apartment when we record while the country bears

235
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,080
episode is going on and we have to sort of just navigate that.

236
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,240
Avoid them while we so it's not we're not going to be like singing or anything.

237
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,080
The theme of it, we're just going to be like and then in 1978, oh God, then they added

238
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,640
the Christmas.

239
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

240
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,160
Yes, it's going to be it's dodging bears.

241
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,920
No singing.

242
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

243
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:45,320
A very creepy array of like Hitchcock-esque birds just went by as you were describing bear

244
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,880
attacks.

245
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,040
So forgive me for getting distracted.

246
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,280
I don't like to say the stuff that's happening outside the house, but in that case, straight

247
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:59,000
from bear attack into really creepy bird sounds, there's some real ominous stuff going on as

248
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,200
we make these plans.

249
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,760
You're tempting the universe like we're tempting the universe again.

250
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,840
I think I say, oh, my God, are we?

251
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,880
Yeah, by even discussing the country bears plan is the whole state of the world writing

252
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,120
on how we cover the country bear jamboree.

253
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,080
We're going to have a country bear on the books and then there's going to be like there's

254
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,000
a new virus and it's like shuts everything down again.

255
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,200
And then somebody like some mad scientist is going to have to run up to us and be like,

256
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,920
it's you.

257
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,320
You're doing this.

258
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,000
You can't do this country bears on your podcast.

259
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,880
I've been listening to every podcast for clues.

260
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,920
It's taken me hours and hours and days and weeks and years.

261
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,640
I haven't slept, except when the podcast put me to sleep, which happens very often.

262
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,320
Yes, it's too long.

263
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,240
You go on for too long.

264
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,360
Hours and hours come now.

265
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,400
Oh, yeah.

266
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,840
Well, very exciting jamborees to come.

267
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,280
Jamborees you'd have to have to say are among the things not allowed.

268
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,680
Right. And jamborees have been banned by local and state officials.

269
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,440
What a year, a year of no jamborees.

270
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,520
Very sad.

271
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:10,800
Yeah.

272
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,920
So, yeah, why would we have the country bear jamboree in a year of no jamborees?

273
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,720
We will not.

274
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,080
So when things are safe, that will be the sign.

275
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,040
That will be the flags triumphantly re-raising.

276
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,520
And that's when you, the listener, will know that the world is is healed and that we were the virus.

277
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,480
When Mayor Eric Garcetti puts on his overalls and pulls out his jug and blows on it three times,

278
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,280
then we know jamborees are safe.

279
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Well, then we know he will establish a commission to examine.

280
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,280
Jug? Jug music?

281
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah, the jug music, the viability, the surveying, jamborees.

282
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,320
Task force devoted to pushing the ball forward on jug blowing initiatives.

283
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,520
Yeah.

284
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,960
Yeah, he wanted to get that job in Biden's cabinet, examining jug blowing techniques.

285
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,920
But Mayor Pete got it.

286
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,280
Mayor Pete is the jug blowing secretary.

287
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,280
He's the secretary of jug blowing.

288
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,680
And he's oddly amazing at it.

289
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,080
He's very talented.

290
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,880
The guy he plays piano, he speaks languages, he plays a mean jug.

291
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,800
Makes sense to me.

292
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:37,200
Whatever the upload scientist jack into the port in the back of his skull, he's a...

293
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,800
Whatever Morpheus uploads into the computer.

294
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,640
Whatever.

295
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,600
Yeah, six million dollar man.

296
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,360
Initiate jug playing protocol.

297
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,000
I...

298
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,960
That also, if we're doing like a year in review, I think it really like dates everything.

299
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,960
There was a point in this calendar year where the politician we were the most mad at was Pete Budažiš.

300
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,360
Boy, if only we knew what was to come.

301
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,920
I don't remember that.

302
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,280
And if I do, it's like a dream 10 years ago I had.

303
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,080
It's crazy.

304
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,000
The whole thing is madness.

305
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,400
Sometimes when I sit and reflect on just everything, I just, you go, oh, I see how you would lose your...

306
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,800
I see how the joker would become the joker.

307
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,160
You kind of see how a person could lose their mind.

308
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,480
And I haven't been through nearly as much as the joker this year.

309
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,560
So you can imagine if I'm like, oh, I can feel that thread if you pull on it a little more.

310
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,680
It's important to remember.

311
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,400
I mean, everybody's had their problems and their stresses, but no one has had it as bad as the joker.

312
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,800
Arthur Fleck.

313
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,320
Arthur Fleck.

314
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:48,960
Is that right?

315
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,200
That's...

316
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,760
That's what we were most scared of in fall 2019.

317
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,200
That's right.

318
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,400
It was the dreaded joker.

319
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:02,200
That was the scariest thing we had to deal with, is the joker was going to create many jokers, multiple jokers.

320
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,880
But then the virus came dancing down the stairs.

321
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,600
That's right.

322
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,960
Rock and roll part 19.

323
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,600
In my mind, it looks like Mr. DNA from Jurassic Park dancing, but it's like he's obviously mean.

324
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,960
It's like Mr. DNA, but he's mean.

325
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,400
Big old smile, big old tap shoes.

326
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:24,880
Yeah.

327
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,160
So yeah, year in review, weird.

328
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,440
Yeah.

329
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,600
If I had to say, yeah, the year in theme parks.

330
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,800
Well, I guess I'd have to start with weird.

331
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,120
Weird wild stuff.

332
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,520
Weird wild stuff.

333
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:39,920
Yeah.

334
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:58,960
And, you know, with some of the things we're going to be talking about today, I don't want to go jumping to our final observations, but I would have to say, based on our recent theme park experiences, I don't know, for me with theme parks, I got to say it's all about the rides.

335
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,800
Call me crazy, but I do like rides.

336
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,320
Food as well.

337
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,040
Not having a constant sense of fear and paranoia.

338
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,360
Some of my favorite things about the theme park experience.

339
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,480
Yeah.

340
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,560
I have to concur.

341
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,000
We did get some food.

342
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,520
We did get some food.

343
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,120
No, food was part of it.

344
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:35,440
Let's let's say officially what we're doing here, we're going to be discussing and reviewing the recent slate of Southern California COVID safe theme park experiences.

345
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:43,560
This is a lineup that has changed greatly in the last two weeks.

346
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,520
Like when the last two hours, that's true.

347
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,480
There was a further development.

348
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,600
I have had it changed again.

349
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,200
But yeah, there probably was there.

350
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,240
Are you going to spring some?

351
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,840
Oh, yeah.

352
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,520
Oh, my God.

353
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:56,920
Oh, yeah.

354
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,120
Yeah.

355
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,080
Oh, OK.

356
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,320
Is it in one of the parks?

357
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,240
I guess we wait on that.

358
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,680
Yeah.

359
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,240
Oh, boy.

360
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,520
It's in the second thing.

361
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,320
Oh, my God.

362
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,560
I feel like there's a happy end.

363
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,440
It's one of these parks.

364
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:14,120
Well, I will give a lot of credit to for rolling with the punches for a while for months now.

365
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,800
They have been managing, I think very well.

366
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,800
Absolutely.

367
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,400
And yeah, and there will be a happy ending to this episode entirely.

368
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,840
This I will promise.

369
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,200
Put a pause button on that.

370
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,080
You'll hear it later.

371
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,480
But for now, I mean, look, a lot of fun was had.

372
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,640
We went and covered a lot of ground between the three of us.

373
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:41,880
I did all three of the things on this roster, and I wasn't sure that I was going to do all of them.

374
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,960
But last night, I completed the trilogy

375
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:52,560
and that the completion of the trilogy being the Disneyland holiday experience.

376
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:59,800
I went to downtown Disney and to what remains of Buena Vista Street.

377
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,320
If you aren't in California, I haven't been following it closely.

378
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,680
Here's the deal.

379
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,600
Downtown Disney has been open for a little while.

380
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,920
I hadn't been. I don't think any of us have been.

381
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,480
Last night.

382
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,120
Well, yeah, I mean, I went and did it.

383
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:22,160
But a couple of weeks ago, they finally and I was very excited that they finally opened up a little bit of California adventure.

384
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,920
Finally, you were able to go on to theme park property proper.

385
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,680
And that lasted for two weeks.

386
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,920
How long did it go before California got way, way, way more strict?

387
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,880
Because it's been been insane here.

388
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,600
And if you forget, you know, like all the stuff's good.

389
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,680
You know, the you know, it is ICU shortage and all that stuff that we're dealing with again.

390
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,240
So I guess it had to be done, but they didn't close it entirely.

391
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah, if you don't know, it was opened briefly and there were there were restaurants open.

392
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,840
There were a couple of restaurants you could go to.

393
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,560
We've all been clamoring to go to Smokejumper's Grill.

394
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,240
Give me those hamburgers again.

395
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,600
Chicken sandwich, I guess.

396
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,480
Iceberg lettuce at the counter.

397
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,480
Right. Where you put you take pieces of iceberg lettuce and manually put them on.

398
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,840
Is that right, Jason?

399
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,680
Toppings bar. Yes. Yes.

400
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,640
They did have.

401
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,120
I don't know that they came back with a full toppings bar.

402
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,440
Seems like not the best plan.

403
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,760
Fuddruckers closed out here.

404
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,320
So now I guess I am craving a toppings bar.

405
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,080
So I know it's the little thing.

406
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,440
Yeah. Anyway, smokejumper's we all want that toppings.

407
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:51,720
I, of course, you know, I was excited because they were going to reopen my beloved Carthay Circle lounge,

408
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,920
albeit in an outdoor setting.

409
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,360
And it was certainly my hope that after this crazy year that I could close the episode and say, and then,

410
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:04,040
but after all that, I got to enjoy a Carthay Manhattan and it was like none of it happened.

411
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,720
And I had the reservation and then everything shut down three days before.

412
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Yeah. All set to do it.

413
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,240
2020. Yeah, yeah, that's that's it in a nutshell.

414
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,200
It was the writing was on the wall.

415
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,960
It was like because in California, it's been all these like, OK, if we tip into the purple zone,

416
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,200
then you'll know. And then like by the time that sentence is finishing being said by the governor or whatever,

417
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,080
we are in the purple zone. Right.

418
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,440
We've had to add we added colors before the press conference was over.

419
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,640
So it all went away.

420
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,440
The thing did not shut down, though.

421
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,200
It is basically just open as like a minimal shopping mall,

422
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,400
which is what it felt like.

423
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,480
Basically, it kind of was like the Grove or the Americana,

424
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,320
albeit with less to do.

425
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,800
It was all very strange, I would say.

426
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,240
And just to say, obviously, messed up hand washing, sanitizing, all this.

427
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,640
You know, it was very safe.

428
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,360
I felt safe. If you guys wanted to do it, I would say it makes sense to do it.

429
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,800
Especially, you know, with eliminating, you know, I didn't see anything alarming going on.

430
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,680
Not too many people sort of a ghost town, probably due to the fact

431
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,440
there is like nothing to do there.

432
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,320
I mean, it's basically taking a walk instead of taking a walk in my neighborhood.

433
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,280
I took a walk there.

434
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,120
A very surreal experience for more reasons than one.

435
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,960
I'm driving into Disneyland, just having not done that drive since March.

436
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,720
I'm driving in just like I'm a different person than the last time I was here.

437
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,600
Like, besides enduring all of this stuff,

438
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,120
the last time I was driving onto this property,

439
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,600
I was changing out of an orange orange spacesuit

440
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,480
because of a pop up show we did in a closing electronics store.

441
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,720
And and now I'm coming in as a father

442
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,880
who doesn't go anywhere or do anything.

443
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,600
I'm driving into a theme park that is darkened.

444
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,800
I don't know if you guys know this.

445
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,920
I was curious what it was going to be when I drove in.

446
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,960
The the black spires are extra black.

447
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,280
They're not lit up.

448
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,360
Mickey's fun wheel is not fun.

449
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,120
It is dark. There is nothing lit anywhere.

450
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,760
It's just it's like this odd, you know, many levels deep of flag half mast.

451
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,160
Just very strange to drive up.

452
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,800
That seems scary.

453
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,920
I think we're about to talk about well, in a little bit, we'll talk about it.

454
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,080
I had a similar vibe going on for part of it, and I got a chill,

455
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,640
a chill ran up my spine.

456
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,240
Anytime you see a large area like that with large structures

457
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,440
and it's just completely black darkness,

458
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,200
I find that's very eerie because I think you immediately kind of go to

459
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,520
this is the apocalypse.

460
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,440
This is what the apocalypse looks like.

461
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,320
I mean, so much I've had I've had a number of things this year where I

462
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,000
despite being at the thing and constantly thinking, boy,

463
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,840
this is apocalyptic.

464
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
I'm still like close enough.

465
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,360
Sort of close to fun.

466
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,680
That's kind of what all this was.

467
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,920
I think everything we're going to talk about.

468
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,440
So very surreal.

469
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,440
You go in and if you don't know what they did, it's basically like

470
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,560
you can walk into California Adventure through the Buena Vista Street area

471
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,720
and their shops and they minimize the people who can go into the shops.

472
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,760
You can go look at the Carthay Circle building and marquee.

473
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,360
You can walk not very close up to Smokejumper's Grill

474
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,960
and the ride Soren that I miss very much.

475
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,120
And you can walk much deeper into the Hollywood

476
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,040
back lot area of California Adventure, which is, of course,

477
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,520
the ugliest area of California Adventure.

478
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,000
Can you see Guardians Tower or no?

479
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,680
Probably not, right?

480
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,080
They do light it.

481
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,880
They light it.

482
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,400
And it's so exciting.

483
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,120
It's so nice to see.

484
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,200
Yes, that that did my heart well.

485
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,800
See, I mean, see, just looking at Carthay Circle was was really nice.

486
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,520
I know the bar is so low, but seriously, see, just seeing all these things

487
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,360
still was heartwarming.

488
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,920
Yes, let's talk real quick.

489
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,720
Bad boy stuff.

490
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,240
How far could you get before security tackled you into California Adventure?

491
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,600
Could you make it to the front of Tannaleer Tavon's house?

492
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,760
Let's see.

493
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,960
I think if you had advanced knowledge of backstage areas

494
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,160
and you could duck and weave, I think if you dressed in dark clothing

495
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,800
and especially dark clothing that might blend into your surroundings,

496
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,040
like if you pick a pattern that is kind of the level of tan

497
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:55,600
of a California Adventure wall, you might be able because it's not the most staffed.

498
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,360
I mean, I'm sure you get sniped.

499
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,640
You still probably get sniped.

500
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,200
I think you maybe you could get like 10 feet closer than you imagined,

501
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,560
and then you would be shot in the legs.

502
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,760
You think they're they have a shoot on site, Edict,

503
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,040
perhaps in these times.

504
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,240
I'm not so around with it.

505
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,120
Yeah, things are scary.

506
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,760
I think I always this is always I'm always, you know, because we're good boys,

507
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,880
but I always have like bad boy instincts sometimes.

508
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,120
So that does interest me to go like, well, what are they really doing?

509
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,360
Could I make it inside and do one ride on Guardians before security got me?

510
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,640
I don't know how to operate.

511
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,120
I just started or I was going to say, like,

512
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,040
climb up the elevator shaft yourself like a gym rope.

513
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,200
Oh, do a manual do a manual drop.

514
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,000
I'll have I want you back on my phone in headphones.

515
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,040
And I just slide up and down the cord that holds the elevator

516
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,200
or that little box.

517
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,040
Yeah, you're up.

518
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,800
I die into the bay.

519
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,520
Hide that launch yourself like like a Jason Borner and Ethan Hunt

520
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,480
type escaping a building into a body of water, the world of color.

521
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:14,480
Bay, don't if you're listening, don't try this, but have fun

522
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,520
fantasizing about breaking Disney rules and jumping into a ride.

523
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,840
Yeah, just go go up to it.

524
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:27,360
Look at it, stroke your chin like what if and then walk away.

525
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,280
Yeah. So yeah, you can't get that close to you.

526
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,960
You can. There's a new marquee of PhilharMagic.

527
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,480
That it's like a like neon sign.

528
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,320
That's nice. But then like great.

529
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,560
So much of what is open are just like those areas that are like scaffolding

530
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,640
in the backs of buildings and pipes.

531
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,440
A lot of it is. But if you want, if you miss all of the Hollywood pipes,

532
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,880
you could go, you can go see them and it just costs ten dollars to park.

533
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,600
It does. I do. I was. That was my question.

534
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,720
Still does. Yeah. Yeah.

535
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,200
If you do, when they first Hollywood pipes is a different

536
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,400
rock and roll band, though, to the Johnny Depp is in.

537
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,760
Oh, yes.

538
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,360
Those are for the people who belted out.

539
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,080
Yeah. Yeah. That all night singer. He's right.

540
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,440
Well, when they first announced this was happening in the first couple days of it,

541
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,960
it seemed like chaos because there was like multi hour lines,

542
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,320
every step of that lines to get into the Esplanade from either side,

543
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,280
lines to get into downtown Disney, lines to get into Buena Vista Street,

544
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,400
lines to get into the shops and the Carthay list.

545
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,040
And then eventually they started doing reservations for Carthay.

546
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,120
But I read like a piece, I think it was from a San Francisco

547
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,600
Chronicle reporter who seemed like a regular, who seemed like they had covered

548
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,800
the parks before and and knew the lingo, like knew the stuff to expect.

549
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,040
And they they stayed for a few hours and like just tapped out.

550
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,480
They're like, I can't I can't do this.

551
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,200
And so that was that was my point of like, OK, I'm not rushing down.

552
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,640
But maybe if I let it go for a couple of weeks, maybe go on a weekday,

553
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,960
go real early, really.

554
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,280
Scott, you opted for real late, of course, now very heavily scaled back

555
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,320
from the original. Yeah, and taste extremely.

556
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,160
It truly is.

557
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,400
Do you want to go take a walk near some stuff that made you happy before?

558
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,800
And for me, I don't know.

559
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,120
I am like seeing the gates and like at least looking at the train station

560
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,800
or whatever, seeing the shuttered uva bar.

561
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,880
Like there's all of the bottles.

562
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,920
Think about that.

563
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,920
There's like a little door shutting them off.

564
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,440
Scott's nightmare.

565
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,480
I will be having nightmares about all this for weeks.

566
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,880
There should be you should have had a video of you just on your knees

567
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,000
outside the uva bar, screaming in pain that it was closed.

568
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,040
I mean, I don't I've never seen it closed.

569
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,080
I don't maybe early, maybe very early.

570
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,640
It's always open.

571
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,080
It's always got people there.

572
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,600
It's such a hive of activity.

573
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,640
Yeah, that's a jamboree.

574
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,920
A constant jamboree at the uva bar.

575
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,000
Yeah, it was upsetting.

576
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,480
Yeah, no, I'm going to go camp out there with a recall Newsome sign.

577
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,240
That was the last straw for me.

578
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,920
Everything else has been fine, but everything not my own.

579
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,360
Because it's outdoors side uva bar.

580
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,840
Yeah, yeah.

581
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,680
But you also you got all your Christmas shopping done at Sugar Boo and Co.

582
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,080
Hey, how about that?

583
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,880
You got your signs.

584
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,680
You got your sign.

585
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,440
It's just as imagine.

586
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,160
Did you get your Tom Petty sign that says I'm free, free fallen?

587
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,840
And it's a big piece of wood and it was one hundred and fifty dollars.

588
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,520
Yeah, definitely.

589
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,280
And and all of the rest of the lyrics of the song are all like embedded

590
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,640
in his hair, if you look close, it's all the different strands. Right.

591
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,080
It's a really moving piece.

592
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,640
I did do a little Christmas shopping at a thing called the Backlot Premier Shop.

593
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,960
They they converted a soundstage.

594
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,320
They've used it for like, you know, here's a seasonal frozen experience.

595
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,000
And, you know, just various odds and ends have happened.

596
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,640
It is just like a big empty soundstage in the Hollywood area.

597
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,960
And this is, I want to say, the most depressing thing

598
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,920
I've ever seen on Disney property.

599
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,280
This was like Disney doing a spirit Halloween store

600
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,120
for like truly in every way, because you know, that's not what's supposed to be in there.

601
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,680
There's walls like spirit telling you,

602
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,200
like they're trying to trick you and thinking there's not more building.

603
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,360
But you can see that there is

604
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,280
and just kind of like words projected monitors and, you know,

605
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,680
very Meghan Trainery music blasting to convince you that it's fun.

606
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,160
I still bought a couple ornaments.

607
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,640
And yet, with all that weirdness,

608
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:04,760
it was pretty cool because this building is where they hosted the attraction.

609
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,800
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Play it.

610
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,720
And if you haven't seen this on Twitter, as you're exiting,

611
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,200
you exit past the big orange words, play it.

612
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,880
Really strange.

613
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,080
And again, just where my bar is, we're like, yeah, wow, I saw the play it sign.

614
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,720
I think I can't think I told Erin all this.

615
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,080
How was it? I saw the play it sign.

616
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,560
And she blinked so loud that it made a little dink.

617
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,960
Made a cartoon dink like a litty to.

618
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,320
Yeah. Wow.

619
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,240
I mean, I am I am a little jealous that you got to see the play it sign

620
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,400
because it's still there. It's a remnant of the past.

621
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,400
I think what's exciting to me about it is if like super

622
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,240
if there was a superstar limo sign hidden somewhere,

623
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,440
I would make a point to go see it once in a while.

624
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,440
Yeah. Oh, absolutely.

625
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,200
Yeah. Yeah.

626
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,480
Knowing there was this this odd secret.

627
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,760
Right. Insiders only.

628
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,680
And it was cool.

629
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,560
Also, going into this building is like you enter

630
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,480
not through the park, but through the outside of the park.

631
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,040
And you walk through like an employee parking lot.

632
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,440
You have to wind through parking spaces that say gold sticker only.

633
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,800
And then you you go past a chain link fence

634
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,000
that has a step and repeat plastered onto it.

635
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,120
And you're looking up and there's like a not lit sign

636
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:34,280
for the Leslie Jones supermarket sweep and some like Ryan Reynolds thing.

637
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,880
I just and then the chain link fence is covering up

638
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,320
like a giant vent, like some air conditioning unit.

639
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,560
I like I can't believe I'm not Disney.

640
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,480
This was and as we talk about some of these other things,

641
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,760
I'm curious your guys feelings.

642
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,840
But I think of the three things we're going to talk about,

643
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,600
I think Disney loses.

644
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,200
I think by holding out and not preparing for this

645
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,680
and thinking we should do some kind of semi open situation,

646
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,200
I think they ended up with the most bummer event of the three.

647
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,200
Well, it's yeah.

648
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,680
Yeah, I think I think the.

649
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,240
Giant bureaucracy that is the Walt Disney Company,

650
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,800
I mean, slightly less giant with their kind of gruesome layoffs.

651
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,600
But I think there's still a lot of levels of approval to go through

652
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,320
that some of these other parks do not have to go through.

653
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:34,160
And that really hampered their like I think they were all in on like,

654
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,000
we're going to open in July.

655
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,080
Like, yeah, I remember it still like horrified by that prospect.

656
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,480
But that was Jason Sheridan's prediction when Disneyland would open was July 4th.

657
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,840
That was my first.

658
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,200
Yeah, first projection.

659
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,640
And then they they stuck on that for a while.

660
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,200
Like, you know, people would feel have been looking in like the gates

661
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,120
of Disneyland and Universal for some time and going like,

662
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,120
oh, I see the distance markers, I see the hand sanitizers.

663
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,320
So, I mean, at a certain point, you just have to, you know,

664
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,600
you bought those things and you want to put them in anyway.

665
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,200
But yeah, I don't know.

666
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,400
I mean, they even the unrelated only kind of related.

667
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,560
They were supposed to open the villas at the Grand Californian

668
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,520
because of, I don't know, timeshare law or regulations.

669
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,920
So there was a chance that downtown Disney would be open.

670
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,720
Buena Vista Street would be open and a chunk of the hotel

671
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,640
would be open for DVC members of timeshare law.

672
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,040
Well, there's a certain thing because those are people technically owned.

673
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,000
All right. Right. Those

674
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,240
residents, those are shared partnerships.

675
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,920
Timeshare law, though, I just is it like a martial law?

676
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,840
Is it like maritime law?

677
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,960
Anything goes in a timeshare?

678
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,920
Do anything you want in a timeshare?

679
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,720
Knowing how a little out timeshares where it's probably closer to

680
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,800
it's always sunny in Philadelphia's Bird Law.

681
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,320
The episode where Charlie convinces himself, he's a expert in Bird Law concerns.

682
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,720
So, yeah, but they scrapped that, too,

683
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,240
because I think the writing was on the wall that recreational hotel,

684
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,760
hotels still many of them still open for emergency purposes.

685
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:25,240
But for for like casual jaunts, not really an option.

686
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,680
There are just some windows lit up in the Disneyland Hotel, which was so unnerving,

687
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,760
like imagining being up there, how creepy it would be.

688
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,440
Like if you were the only person staying in the Disneyland Hotel.

689
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,000
I am. It's sounding much actually more depressing than I thought it would sound,

690
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,160
especially with the park being dark and everything.

691
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,120
But now it actually makes me a little bit more intrigued to go down there

692
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,120
because I missed out on haunts this year and there's nothing scarier

693
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,440
than like a rundown, desolate Disneyland.

694
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,360
That's the biggest nightmare of all.

695
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,960
The happiest place on Earth is gone.

696
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,920
It's shuttered. And I guess you would get a piece of that.

697
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,800
I would get that true fear.

698
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:12,520
Sitting on a bench on the side of the long closed rainforest cafe,

699
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,200
which is pretty dimly lit over there.

700
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,960
And there was nobody again.

701
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,760
You're going to go and like not bump into people.

702
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,840
It is really especially at night.

703
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,840
You know, yeah, if you're looking for a thing where you'll be you'll be plenty distant.

704
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,360
So just like sitting and staring at the non branded,

705
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,800
non-functional rainforest cafe.

706
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,760
Yeah, that was my haunt for the year.

707
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,200
I'll put on like a Phantom of the Opera mask that also covers my nose and mouth

708
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,760
and a cloak, and I'll go in the dead of night

709
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,120
and I'll try to pick up a sandwich from Earl of Sandwich.

710
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
Is that open?

711
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,240
Yeah, yeah, it is.

712
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,000
OK, good.

713
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,640
I'll pick it up.

714
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,400
I'll mobile order it and then I'll pull my cape over my face

715
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,080
and just like the night I'll be gone.

716
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,280
Yes. I get to dress up like it's Halloween

717
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,320
and I'll get to see all the spookiness.

718
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,000
You could you could get

719
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,360
Ralph Brennan gumbo to go and eat in the car.

720
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,280
You could drive home with gumbo.

721
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,480
And this is something you can do.

722
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,520
OK, that's from the express, the Ralph Brennan's Jazz Kitchen Express,

723
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,360
which is right.

724
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,960
Or is it the restaurant proper?

725
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,040
Is anything of that?

726
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,000
No, that's the express that to go in is open.

727
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,800
I think you can only get beignets and gumbo almost nothing else.

728
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
There was a po. Nothing wrong with that.

729
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,880
We had a wonderful time at Ralph Brennan's actual restaurant.

730
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,440
And I have tried the express a couple of times and the beignets are good.

731
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,200
But like I had a po boy and it was just it was dog shit.

732
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,880
It was horrible.

733
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,720
It was like too much bread and the bread was bad and the fried

734
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,480
the breaded shrimp was bad.

735
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,080
You know, recalling the downtown Disney ordeal as I walked through

736
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,800
largely empty downtown Disney, it was like this is kind of the world

737
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,320
that we imagined that we forced onto ourselves during the downtown

738
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,640
Disney ordeal, where this fun experience is close,

739
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,760
but you can't go on them or participate in them.

740
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,200
And in this case, they are they are literally off limits and they are darkened.

741
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,240
It's like they've been taken off a map.

742
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,800
It's a video game level that hasn't been unlocked.

743
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,120
It's the I mean, you went it. You were in the underworld.

744
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,240
You were in the other world.

745
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,520
My God, even the upper world became the underworld.

746
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,720
It's all the underworld now.

747
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,800
But none of us have visited the city walk underworld.

748
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,160
Right. No one's been up to city walk since that one takeaway only.

749
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,200
Well, I don't think there actually is technically stuff.

750
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,480
Yeah, I don't think there's technically is an underworld

751
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,880
because we didn't put that in the myth, the mythology.

752
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,400
There is. Yeah, right.

753
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,040
There is no city walk underworld as far as we know.

754
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,040
We know we could always.

755
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,640
You never know what the keeper is going to spring.

756
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,960
You never know. Right.

757
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,280
So, gosh, very strange.

758
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,600
We can we can wind it down.

759
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,320
I just know the whole thing felt like I don't mean to convey like truly

760
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,680
like getting to see these things that I liked again.

761
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,320
What was very nice and I kept it quick and I kept it safe.

762
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:03,560
But the whole thing, you know, it I I was thinking of it as like

763
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,280
it's like seeing a relative in the hospital

764
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,640
and it's you're you're pretty sure they're going to pull through.

765
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,200
You know, you're a fighter.

766
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,560
You're going to be OK.

767
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,600
I feel good.

768
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,440
I'm just glad to know that you're you're still alive and kicking.

769
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,760
That is the feeling right now of going to Disneyland.

770
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,720
Well, wow, I think as soon as everybody just put their podcast on pause

771
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,560
and hopped in the car, you got to get there.

772
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,560
You got to do it.

773
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,440
On a more uplifting note on the way home, as I showed you guys, I

774
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,440
for the first time ran through the Portillo's drive

775
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,760
through in the greatest city on Earth, the Buena Park, Buena Park, California.

776
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,400
And what was your I didn't do a cake shake because I didn't think I could handle it.

777
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,280
I've never actually done it.

778
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,600
Oh, oh, really? Really?

779
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,080
No, I thought I was missing out on a big thing.

780
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,600
I might have been. I got a vanilla shake and they were pretty insistent on

781
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,400
like, you got to put some peppermint in there.

782
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,520
And it is the holidays.

783
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,400
And I did. So that was like they just crumbled up a candy cane.

784
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,320
And you're just getting pieces of candy cane as you're eating your milkshake.

785
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,280
It's a it's a real tooth rotter.

786
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,720
That's for sure. I liked it a lot, but I had to bail for the sake of my teeth.

787
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,600
But a nice, nice drive back.

788
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,520
My only complaint with Portillo's is because, I mean, I think you were dying

789
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,600
that you could go into dying, but they really should put some of the great photos

790
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,840
that are inside of Portillo's outside for this period.

791
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,160
Like the Jim Belushi with

792
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,560
Dick Portillo, the founder of Portillo's, should be outside

793
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,880
and it should be blown up.

794
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,400
Dick Portillo with Carmen Electra should be outside.

795
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,440
The other photo of Dick Portillo and Jim Belushi that's inside should be outside.

796
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:53,880
Multiple pictures of the founders of founder of Portillo's with Jim Belushi.

797
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,960
And they're in every Portillo's.

798
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,280
He's had copies of these photos made.

799
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,600
And they are in all every Portillo's, at least I've been in.

800
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,400
They are there.

801
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,320
Believe it. I did it.

802
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,680
I've lived quite a life.

803
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:12,000
I've met Jim Belushi twice and I can have hot dogs whenever I want.

804
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,880
Dick Portillo.

805
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,960
So, yeah, that's that's the Disney experience.

806
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:25,080
Let's let's keep heading for the elsewhere into Orange County.

807
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,080
Is that correct?

808
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,000
Hmm. Yes. Still in Buena Park.

809
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,080
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

810
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,200
Well, just stop skipping a jump away.

811
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,760
Yeah. Jason and I both did.

812
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,080
Knott's Taste of Mary Farm.

813
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:43,480
They're, you know, by framing it as a food tasting event,

814
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,480
which it is, and it is a good one of those.

815
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,320
They've they've let the park be open for eating and drinking.

816
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,680
Yes. Now, so this was the one I was alluding to.

817
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,040
There has been developments like hours before we started recording.

818
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,960
So the Taste of Mary Farm

819
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,240
was the second or third tasting event that Knott's had done.

820
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,360
Basically, they open up the whole park and there's different food stations.

821
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,680
You don't really pay for entry, you pay for a tasting card.

822
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,920
And it was forty dollars.

823
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,240
And you got five items to choose from.

824
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,440
And like Scott said, we had a great time.

825
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,840
You know, I felt very safe.

826
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,880
This was kind of my first experience about eating outside.

827
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,120
And I had a feeling that turned out correct, which is like, oh,

828
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,000
the whole park's going to be open.

829
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,680
And it's pretty large.

830
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,040
You forget how big Knott's is because you don't think it's a huge footprint,

831
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,200
but it is large.

832
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,080
So very easy to get a table away from people and then like take your mask off,

833
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:53,280
eat, put it back on and then head to the next thing.

834
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,400
So Taste of Mary Farm was tabled with the current

835
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,240
stay at home rules, and they were going to start selling tickets

836
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:05,560
again a few weeks out December twenty seventh to January third.

837
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,800
But just a couple of hours ago

838
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,240
when we record this, they just pulled the plug and canceled it.

839
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,320
That said, they are doing a number of dates for what they're calling

840
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:22,120
the Christmas Crafts Village, which is a lot of the outdoor vendors,

841
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,040
woodworkers and jewelry makers.

842
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,360
And basically you can go into the park and get some Christmas gifts

843
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,920
and support some local artists and stuff.

844
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:36,440
And yeah, Knott's I think has been one of the more resilient SoCal parks.

845
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,200
They since like, I mean, I went down and got that chicken back in the summer.

846
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,280
The marketplace is doing takeout still and the shop is open.

847
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:50,160
So there's still some stuff to do at Knott's and the surgery was great.

848
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,880
Jane and I had a great time.

849
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,440
We we loved it.

850
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,640
Yeah, I had a great time.

851
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,520
The I mean, also notable for me, this was this was Aaron and I's first

852
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,000
date since having a baby.

853
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,600
This is the first time. So why? Yeah. Yeah.

854
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,640
And what? Yeah.

855
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,280
By that point, like seven months in or something in another world.

856
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,040
Certainly would have happened multiple times by that.

857
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,120
But it just doesn't yet.

858
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,360
Doesn't make sense. Like even if you got out, like where would you go?

859
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,800
So this was thank God for theme parks, because, you know,

860
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,200
Aaron also joined me on the last thing we're going to talk about.

861
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,200
I yeah, they've like some of the only things that we've done.

862
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,760
And this one was the most satisfying food.

863
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,360
Great. We had stuff we really enjoyed.

864
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,800
I guess it's weird now to be, you know, like hyping an event

865
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,640
that you, the listener, go to. Sorry.

866
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,440
So but I had a nice time.

867
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,000
It's a little photo album now.

868
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,520
If there is this craft village thing happening, let me shout out Calico Carver.

869
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,200
I've had my eye on on a wooden sign for a long time,

870
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,480
the wood signs that they make at knots.

871
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,720
And we got one.

872
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:03,320
It says the Gardner's and I have never felt more like we're a family

873
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,920
than putting that sign up.

874
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,720
I said I would post it on Instagram and I haven't done that.

875
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,200
I said that to the gentleman, but I'll do one better and say

876
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,480
I'll say it on a podcast.

877
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,880
Yeah, check out Calico Carver.

878
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,720
If you go to that thing, buy a sign there.

879
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,480
They're fantastic. It's great quality.

880
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,920
And yeah, you know, it's got a bear and I it's so cozy.

881
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,480
Now I feel like we like live in a Lake Arrowhead cabin.

882
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,520
It's great. Or in a country bear theater.

883
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,920
Yes. There you go.

884
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:38,240
Absolutely. It is a little slice of like that that shiny theme park wood.

885
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,280
It's really nice that we like our I want to say fake wood.

886
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,600
It's not fake wood. It's definitely real wood.

887
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,920
I use fake as a compliment.

888
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,080
It feels like fake wood in the best way.

889
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,400
Like you're in a cartoon.

890
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,880
Is there a real wood final four that we could do?

891
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,440
Is there enough real wood? There has to be real.

892
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,280
Yeah. There's plenty of wood.

893
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,320
Many, many structures and theme parks are made from wood.

894
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,360
Yes, we like wood of wood.

895
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,120
We love wood. Big wood fans.

896
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,280
So maybe maybe we'll talk about this.

897
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,320
I was by a wooden structure at knots.

898
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,240
I'll set this up a little because it it touches on something we were talking

899
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,920
about recently, which was the carnival episode.

900
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,800
We played a game when we were down there because they had some of the games running too.

901
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,840
And in carny lingo, this game is called a hanky pank,

902
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,640
which means you always everyone who plays wins a prize.

903
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,360
And it was very funny because they were very upfront.

904
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,400
It's this was classic carnival game.

905
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,520
It's a bunch of rubber duckies going around in a row.

906
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,480
And you kind of have to pick to that match.

907
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,280
But they're like, OK, just play until you win.

908
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,120
And it costs five dollars if you want one of those.

909
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,920
Ten if you want one of those or 15 if you want one of those.

910
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,560
So basically, it's like, what stuffed animal do you want to buy

911
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,360
and have a little fun to get?

912
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:01,680
So we played immediately, got a pairing and got this lovely

913
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:07,400
snow is a little minimalist snoopy sort of like in style a little bit.

914
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,920
That's great.

915
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,840
Yeah. And I immediately like was holding him and I was like, I love him.

916
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:17,560
I I remembered as a kid, I had a giant stuff snoopy

917
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,720
and I forget which relative gave it to us.

918
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,400
But my parents for years were like, please, it's mildewing.

919
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,520
It's falling apart. Let's get rid of it.

920
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,640
And eventually I acquiesced.

921
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,440
And they made you take it out back and

922
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,160
dismember it to put it in the.

923
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,400
Yeah, dismember it into the trash.

924
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,400
You have to take it apart, Jason.

925
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,800
This is a learning experience.

926
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,880
Oh, yeah. Your old yellow moment.

927
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,320
Shoot it with my old yellow.

928
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,840
Oh, it's got I'm sorry.

929
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,960
I do. I do have to tell you this very cute minimalist snoopy.

930
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,680
The tag, the official name of this line is.

931
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,520
I'm so sorry.

932
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,200
It's called Squish Mall Squish Mallows.

933
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,520
So soft cuddle and squeeze me.

934
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,760
And I feel like I knew, you know, I had to read.

935
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,880
I just had to.

936
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,640
I know that's that probably since chills up your spine.

937
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,680
Could that be worse than Toofy Spooders?

938
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,320
For it is a name for me.

939
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:19,640
Spood me. He's he's just so cute.

940
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,120
And hey, look, you're talking about wood.

941
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,440
Let's say not.

942
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,360
You know, they of all the parks, they remember the reason for the season

943
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,440
because I got my picture with this giant.

944
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,120
But wow. Yeah.

945
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,120
Big Nativity and big.

946
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,440
Yeah.

947
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,560
How I can see.

948
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,640
Well, let me squint.

949
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,920
I can see the ghost of Walter Nott.

950
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,840
And he's that's right to the side of the Nativity.

951
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,000
And he's just smiling and nodding.

952
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,360
Wow. And he's got a mega hat on.

953
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,800
Yes. And he's saying stop the deal.

954
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,600
Stop the steal.

955
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,880
And, you know, with the crew, with the marketplace open and the craft fair,

956
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,400
it turns out he was right.

957
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,960
Free enterprise survived.

958
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,600
So and of course, that Nativity scene set up under a massive roller

959
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,320
coaster. Yeah. The flip side, what you're looking at in the photo is, yeah,

960
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,440
bright orange roller coaster.

961
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,960
It's so insane that that's there. Yeah.

962
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,440
Yeah. We kind of forgot.

963
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,160
And there's a bunch of missions around.

964
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,520
What a weird part. Oh, the missions are very cute.

965
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:21,400
They should add they should add that to the log ride during Christmas time.

966
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,240
Like instead of that alien and band with the bear

967
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,200
on the Timber Mountain log ride, they should just put a Nativity at the end.

968
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:34,840
Doing a yeah, there's Christmas overlays, but nowhere is done a Nativity.

969
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,280
Right. Overlay.

970
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,320
It came up earlier in this episode.

971
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,400
But if you if you could time out the music to where when you did the drop,

972
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,800
you heard the part of Oh, Holy Night.

973
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,960
Fall on your knees.

974
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,160
And here.

975
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,720
Let's see. What else?

976
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,360
What if the bear? Wait, hold on.

977
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,600
And then as you go by the bear, he goes, Oh, Holy Night.

978
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,800
Not not Happy Halloween.

979
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,000
Christ the Savior is born.

980
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,760
The actors, there was a lot of actors.

981
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,400
Oh, yeah.

982
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,840
Yeah, the actors were really good and there were some characters.

983
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,920
Santa Snoopy was a real highlight.

984
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,960
Yeah.

985
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,800
Distant photo. Yes.

986
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,760
Well in front of. Oh, that's great.

987
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,880
Yeah.

988
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:28,760
Up on the second floor of a saloon or something was an Ebenezer Scrooge.

989
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:34,280
Who was one of the funniest people I have seen in a theme park.

990
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:39,040
I he was so funny, just like pointing and making fun of people below.

991
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:43,120
People below are trying to get the upper hand on him.

992
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:47,440
Like somebody is making fun of him and says, Hello, Governor.

993
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,960
And then he looks down and says, So I'm the governor now.

994
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,200
Wonderful. More power for me.

995
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,320
And then like the what was the thing?

996
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:01,440
He pointed at a baby and said, Why isn't he working?

997
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,960
They should be working in one of my minds.

998
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,680
Getting it should be getting gold for me.

999
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,160
Was he playing Walter not?

1000
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,120
We also didn't know they were doing a Christmas Carol overlay.

1001
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:21,320
And only the first thing we saw was just this old man

1002
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,160
screaming at everyone from the rafters.

1003
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,080
And I was like, Oh, this ghost town actors, they have a lot of fun.

1004
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:30,280
And then apparently there was even more stuff like around.

1005
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,840
I think Eva Anderson went to this at some point, too.

1006
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:38,280
And she said that he said something about like merry recession, everyone.

1007
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,360
Jesus. Whoa. Wow.

1008
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,040
Dark topical comedy.

1009
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,560
Don't see that in a theme park.

1010
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,960
Yeah, they can be. I mean, they can they can get religious.

1011
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,720
They can get body at knots.

1012
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,160
That's the fun of knots.

1013
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1014
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,320
Less standards. Things get wild.

1015
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,280
Wild. As body as you want to be.

1016
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,040
Also, we we learned at Camp Snoopy, they have

1017
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,640
child size benches.

1018
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,960
This is an amazing photo. Wow. Whoa.

1019
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,320
Yeah, because Jane ran to get something and just gesture

1020
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,360
was like, take a seat on that bench.

1021
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,240
I didn't realize what it was.

1022
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,520
I went, OK, man.

1023
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,240
And so I did. And it's.

1024
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,680
OK. Oh, I'm sorry.

1025
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,240
I was wrong. She was owning my ass.

1026
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,840
She said it's a Jason size. Oh, OK.

1027
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,560
Thank you, Jane, for clarifying.

1028
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,920
You want to credit for that slam?

1029
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,960
Yeah, there's a bunch of empty space there, and I wish that

1030
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,120
that Mike and I were there to join you to sit down with you.

1031
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,920
And once we sat, you get launched.

1032
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,320
The weight launches you across camp Snoopy

1033
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,160
onto one of the rides, hopefully face down in a

1034
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,920
like a balloon bucket like, yeah, Woodstock's

1035
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,920
boost of a balloon or into the into a Snoopy show, maybe.

1036
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,400
Oh, and he just has to just has to like to go with it. Right.

1037
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,160
Yeah, there wasn't really a show, but line

1038
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,440
like rotating characters were on stage waving and.

1039
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,560
Yeah, there was a lot of very cute

1040
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,720
Woodstock's just extra Woodstock's just everywhere

1041
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:29,480
in scarves and ear muffs and was high.

1042
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,720
Was Spike anywhere to be found?

1043
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,840
I didn't see a spike.

1044
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:38,640
Mike, he was still avoiding Snoopy's drifter relative.

1045
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,800
Yeah. And if anyone listen to our peanuts episode, Jason

1046
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,320
and I tried multiple times when we were at Nats to get a picture with Spike.

1047
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,320
And we he kept like avoiding us.

1048
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,440
It was really we felt that did feel personal, honestly.

1049
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,160
I did find this grant a great

1050
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,480
spike doesn't. Yeah.

1051
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,680
I never noticed this rock work with Charlie Brown

1052
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,040
Snoopy sleeping on his lap, which you rarely see.

1053
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,600
And then a brass Woodstock like I.

1054
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,240
Yeah, I just thought that was really great.

1055
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,800
And then we I believe Scott, you and Aaron got this to this

1056
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,120
this fun little bundt cake with like an ice cream cone Christmas tree

1057
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,800
on top. Very, very fun.

1058
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,440
Really fun. Took it all the way home to go, despite being very precarious

1059
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,440
and hard to hold.

1060
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,640
Then got home, took a bite into the icing, which was not edible,

1061
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,560
at least not by that point.

1062
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,640
The ornaments were not.

1063
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,760
The lower half was good.

1064
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,160
The low the cake, the cake and the icing was good.

1065
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,760
But the yes, the cone was not not great.

1066
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,920
Yeah, I figured out a way to rig it up.

1067
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,040
I asked for a large soda cup and I covered it on the plate.

1068
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,920
And I had a no, jeez.

1069
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,200
Yeah, we're dangling this thing all the way back.

1070
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,000
The the if they hopefully they restart these events for like

1071
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:01,160
Peanuts Festival and like boys or Peanut Celebration.

1072
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,000
Boys and very fast, we'll kind of do tasting events like this

1073
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,360
because the portions were huge.

1074
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,080
Like we ate like two things and we're like, what do we do with the rest of these?

1075
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:14,160
Taste it like we are like just doing laps to walk off the food

1076
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,680
before we can eat any others.

1077
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,160
Yeah, massive ice cream sandwiches.

1078
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,000
I it was great. The food was great.

1079
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,080
Awesome beer.

1080
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:27,880
And again, as I said, like, well, you know, you add the new parent thing to it.

1081
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,320
Like, oh, my God, we are out, baby safe with grandma.

1082
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:37,320
And we are getting to enjoy a beer with a view of fake rocks.

1083
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,840
And they did turn the log flume on.

1084
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,240
We're watching water come out of it.

1085
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,800
So nice to see.

1086
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:48,400
It was the sweetest beer we've ever had, and not just because it was full of berry flavoring.

1087
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,480
We shared a drink that was like sparkling wine

1088
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,680
with a scoop of boys and very ice cream in it.

1089
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,200
And it was it was the sweetest thing I've ever had, but it was pretty good.

1090
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,880
Scott, I really think you need to if you want to compete with Jason and I,

1091
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,320
I think you need to start getting your tolerance a little higher for sugar.

1092
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,760
OK, we was revealed last was the last.

1093
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:13,000
Yeah. You haven't had nearly the amount of sugar cereals we've had.

1094
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:17,760
And I just think maybe it's like you weren't like you weren't trained on it

1095
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,400
as much as a youth.

1096
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,520
And I think maybe you should start every morning now taking

1097
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:29,480
like a big spoonful of sugar and just getting your taste buds numb like ours are.

1098
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:34,560
You know, well, I'm never going to give up wine, which has natural sugar, too.

1099
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:39,720
But maybe what I need to do is just like dump half a box of sugar into the one,

1100
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:44,840
mix it up and then I will match the drinking taste of the rest of the show.

1101
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,720
That's yeah, I think that's good because then you'll be able to really experience

1102
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,880
all the treats.

1103
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,720
And then, yeah, you should probably just start

1104
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,120
probably just have a little cup of Lucky Charms for every meal.

1105
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,600
Just a side like a little appetizer of Lucky Charms or fruity pebbles.

1106
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,040
Well, I'll just either neither you if you had the right, you said.

1107
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,280
Or I'm just not sure I've had Lucky Charms, but not never.

1108
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,120
None of it on the regular, really.

1109
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:16,320
I mean, just I think the big thing impeding me in the recent past has been that I am

1110
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,600
not a child and haven't been for a number of years.

1111
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:26,840
So that's in my way. But but this podcast you do would suggest otherwise.

1112
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,000
Huh? That's interesting.

1113
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,080
That's yeah, that's fair.

1114
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:38,360
I well, look, I'm probably going to have more of that stuff in the house with the baby.

1115
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,240
And maybe what I do is start weaving it.

1116
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:46,680
Like I still make myself like a nice salmon or something, but I bread it in Lucky Charms

1117
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,360
all off Planet Hollywood.

1118
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,800
And so you don't get to go to those anymore.

1119
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,600
I'll bring Planet Hollywood to me.

1120
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,680
So, yeah, this thing was great.

1121
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:01,200
And and I think and as clearly the victor over

1122
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,840
Disneyland.

1123
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:09,600
And I think like, first of all, my thought to Disneyland is open up that whole park,

1124
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,920
get it all open, even if it is just like little stores and kiosks.

1125
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,880
I felt so much safer.

1126
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:19,560
Not that I of course, I felt safe at Winavista Street, but I there was something about like,

1127
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,960
oh, my God, the whole park is open at knots with plenty of room for everybody.

1128
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,560
And they've capped the capacity.

1129
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:29,640
And I think for these remaining months, however many more there are, I hope it's not a ton,

1130
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:33,240
but there certainly will be some before these places are open again.

1131
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:36,280
I think we'll find ourselves in these weird in between.

1132
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,920
It's kind of open.

1133
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,280
And I think Disney has to take a page from the Knotts book and they have they've done

1134
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:46,160
it before. Big Thunder Mountain is basically a dressed up knots ride.

1135
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,360
You can steal ideas from knots.

1136
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,640
Start doing it again because knots pulled it off.

1137
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,280
They did it better.

1138
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:58,640
Well, yes, I think Disney, yeah, the Disney likes they were just like,

1139
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,200
we want it all or nothing.

1140
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:04,280
And then they sort of acquiesced at the end of the year and it was too late.

1141
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,600
We'll see. We'll see what happens.

1142
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,920
Will Bob Iger join Joe Biden's cabinet?

1143
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,080
Like I read today.

1144
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:15,440
As an ambassador, that's not a joke, by the way, that's really well, yeah, possible.

1145
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,880
That's possible. So I don't know.

1146
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,320
I don't know if it's a Chaypeck thing.

1147
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,120
It's Iger. We'll see.

1148
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,000
Maybe that will happen for a couple of months.

1149
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,960
It would be it would be nice to go.

1150
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,240
They have those little box, those little vendor boxes.

1151
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,080
For the food and wine.

1152
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,400
A California venture. They should do food and wine.

1153
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,400
I think that'd be that'd be huge.

1154
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,240
They yeah, they got those pieces already.

1155
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:42,040
And my other thought, and forgive me because this isn't so comedic,

1156
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,600
but I am curious if you guys agree.

1157
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,920
OK, this this weird time that we're going to that hopefully will be limited.

1158
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:52,800
But before the theme parks are open, I do think that some limited like

1159
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,520
I love that they started trying to do this stuff.

1160
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,680
And I'm at not just realizing like

1161
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:02,000
I was doing a big outdoor food thing makes so much sense.

1162
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,320
And it felt like I have seen things I've passed by things on the street

1163
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:10,160
and seen with my own eyes stuff that shouldn't be happening.

1164
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,560
It is way more dangerous than what's happening at not.

1165
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,680
So the whole like we're just not going to do theme parks at all.

1166
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:21,320
Basically, like not thinking of theme parks as one thing.

1167
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:25,720
An amusement park is one type of thing, and that is all that it is.

1168
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:30,720
Doesn't make any sense to me because a theme park is indoor space and outdoor

1169
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:34,720
space, it's restaurants and it's outdoor rides and it's indoor rides

1170
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:38,200
that where you should, you know, limit capacity or not do them at all for a while.

1171
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,000
But isn't there something to the governor

1172
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:48,600
looking at theme parks with a more nuanced eye and saying like, OK,

1173
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,080
so you can't run this, this and this and this.

1174
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,920
But you can do some of this and start getting people back to work.

1175
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,320
Because I like that not thing.

1176
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,760
I just like there was so much of it that felt perfectly safe to me

1177
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:05,120
and will especially feel absolutely safe come May

1178
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,360
when people are starting to have the vaccine more and more.

1179
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:12,760
Yeah, I Todd Martin's are very like thoughtful and, you know,

1180
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,600
like you're saying nuanced piece about going down.

1181
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,680
And he made it in, I think, to Carthay, either on Thanksgiving

1182
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,800
or Black Friday.

1183
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:26,600
And, you know, I think similar similar feelings of like,

1184
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,240
it's nice to be near this stuff.

1185
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,280
It is a little melancholy.

1186
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,720
But to your point, I believe he he, you know,

1187
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:39,920
referred to, you can think about these places as like outdoor sculpture gardens

1188
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:45,840
or large, you know, cultural like pop culture centers, you know. Yeah.

1189
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,320
Experiences and and yeah,

1190
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:56,040
I think I think that where the problem comes in is, I think, not is,

1191
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:00,120
you know, kind of a neighborhood park.

1192
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,560
It is a smaller park.

1193
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:06,800
And I think once you there's stuff that has its fandoms

1194
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,960
like a Disney or or if Universal was like, we're opening

1195
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,640
just the Harry Potter restaurant like that would get slammed.

1196
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,960
So like then you have to build the infrastructure for reservations

1197
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,560
or drawings of who gets in.

1198
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:26,040
And I think that's where the complications arise. Yeah.

1199
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,360
Well, it's just I mean, look, if you're asking for my

1200
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:34,320
Fauci like wisdom on this and the man who reads his Reddit,

1201
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:38,280
it's like, first of all, the whole thing is confusing.

1202
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,160
This is going to get very boring, very fast.

1203
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,320
The whole thing is confusing because everyone's fighting a different battle

1204
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,760
on different like playing fields, essentially, like

1205
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,920
probably everything should just be closed,

1206
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,600
except for grocery stores and hospitals.

1207
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,120
Oh, of course, that's what it should have been at the very beginning.

1208
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,880
Absolutely for a limited amount of time.

1209
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,920
And this shit would be over. Right.

1210
01:06:58,920 --> 01:06:59,720
And it should have been.

1211
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,680
And then at that point, masks until vaccine blah, blah, blah,

1212
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,280
and spread, blah, blah, blah, mind everything.

1213
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,200
So then that's out the window.

1214
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:10,240
The government has I mean, California is doing an OK job with unemployment.

1215
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:14,240
OK job. But the government has abandoned workers essentially now,

1216
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,480
which is fucking crazy.

1217
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,320
Now we're getting serious here.

1218
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:21,520
And I understand why people like I need to go back to work.

1219
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:24,280
Like you're stranding me without money.

1220
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,760
So I'm sympathetic to that.

1221
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:30,960
But it's hard because it's like if it's just purely like

1222
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,920
if Disney opens, even with like only outdoor rides,

1223
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,200
which I do think would probably be mostly safe if it's just Big Thunder,

1224
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,720
if it's just, I don't know, whatever other open air ride,

1225
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,000
goofy sky school, for instance. Yeah.

1226
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,040
It's like that all would be safe.

1227
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:48,200
But then now you have thousands of people coming in from other states.

1228
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,840
They have to stay somewhere.

1229
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:55,840
Maybe they are getting together in a restaurant like you are moving people around.

1230
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:00,160
So it's like I do get the idea that like Disney is its own thing.

1231
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,000
It's not nuts.

1232
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,840
People aren't traveling as much from out of state, especially to nuts,

1233
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,280
just to eat a fun Christmas tree.

1234
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,240
Yeah. Right. Which is fun.

1235
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,880
But yeah, so I get that idea.

1236
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,960
But then I'm also like everything is screwed and I don't know what to do.

1237
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,600
I'm not. Yeah, right.

1238
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,920
I'm not saying do this tomorrow.

1239
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,480
God knows it's terrible.

1240
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:25,320
And I'm talking about like in September, are we still going to be?

1241
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,160
And I don't know where things are bad in September.

1242
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:30,080
But like, is it still just going to be unilaterally?

1243
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,560
There are no amusement park, anything of any kind.

1244
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,520
That's what I don't quite get.

1245
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:39,320
I feel like you have to start easing into the water a little bit.

1246
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,360
Well, it depends.

1247
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,120
I mean, I also think that there was an argument to be made.

1248
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,520
Like maybe around now or the last couple of months where it was like

1249
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,640
all the vaccines failed, they're all bad.

1250
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,680
And you go, well, are we going to do this for six years?

1251
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:56,200
Like, how long are we going to do this?

1252
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,600
Well, that's just like all like we can sort of collectively figure something out.

1253
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,080
But it does seem like and I don't want to say jinx anything,

1254
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,560
but it does seem like we have two vaccines that work.

1255
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,960
We have a decent amount of them.

1256
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:13,000
There's also a lot of people are going to get the disease, unfortunately.

1257
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:16,800
And it feels like you will have, you know,

1258
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,800
the spread will be going down by the spring.

1259
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:24,640
And by September, I would imagine a nice amount of America

1260
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:25,920
will have been vaccinated.

1261
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:31,440
And just by the natural, the natural nature of the cycle of these things,

1262
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,120
I do probably think that.

1263
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:38,000
The transmission rate at that point will be so low that will probably be

1264
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,880
in some version of open again, I think.

1265
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,600
This is my reading Reddit.

1266
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,400
This is my guess based on Reddit. Sure, sure.

1267
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,080
Yeah, which it is well informed.

1268
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,400
My none of mine is it.

1269
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,200
Don't quote me on it.

1270
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,160
If I'm way off the mark on anything I've said, I do not.

1271
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,960
Disclaimer, Scott Garner does not claim to be a scientist

1272
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,520
or know anything about anything.

1273
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,880
This is a joke. This is a podcast for jokes.

1274
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,440
I don't think you are.

1275
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:09,280
But I mean, I think it's going to it's going to be a long time to rebuild.

1276
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:13,880
Because the failure at local, state and federal level of governance.

1277
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:18,080
I mean, someone on a podcast on like Chappell or something years ago said,

1278
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:22,920
like, you know, you think the bare minimum function of a country

1279
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,720
is to keep its citizens alive.

1280
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:30,800
And 2020 has shown we are not a functioning state.

1281
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:37,680
So, you know, and then on top of that, with all these mixed messages,

1282
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:40,320
then you have 300 million people living in,

1283
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,920
I don't know, 100 different million realities.

1284
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,960
Like so no one can agree on a shared reality anymore.

1285
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:53,600
Yeah. Besides the American tradition of disdain for the poor.

1286
01:10:54,200 --> 01:11:00,360
Yeah. So I get I get where you're coming from, because just in a in a bubble,

1287
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:04,120
to use a phrase people have been using in a bubble, that makes sense

1288
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:07,600
that like you could walk around outside and even get on a ride or two on outside.

1289
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,200
And it's probably going to be OK.

1290
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:14,400
But I'm not necessarily saying it, by the way, because just because I want to do it.

1291
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,920
I mean, sure, but I don't want to do it till it's safe.

1292
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,360
It's just more like,

1293
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:25,840
I don't know, just to like get the gears going again in the tiniest degree,

1294
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,080
you know, and still in a very modest way.

1295
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,000
But just Mickey's fun wheel opens in January.

1296
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:38,400
Open air, you know, the cars are maybe one person per car.

1297
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,920
One per one person, not even one party.

1298
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,400
Yeah, not even party one person. OK. OK. Yeah.

1299
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,120
And so, yeah, and the Florida situation is different.

1300
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:52,200
That's Florida's lawless international waters.

1301
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:55,280
A whole state that's international waters.

1302
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,280
Yeah, I don't share a lot.

1303
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,680
Yeah, it's time. Share a lot in Florida.

1304
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,160
Don't share a lot. Yeah.

1305
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:05,880
Read large. We just statewide and also cut like there's some contact tracing,

1306
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,840
but I still feel like we don't have some crazy, crazy.

1307
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,360
We should have had some crazy contract tracing apparatus

1308
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,840
that would have really been able to track every single person

1309
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:19,120
eating in our inner cider restaurant, going to Disney World,

1310
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:22,480
tracking all of them for a couple of months and really determining like,

1311
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,440
hey, no one's gotten sick. Right. Right.

1312
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,280
From doing that, like there would have been a there would have been like

1313
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:31,000
information because we're all still sort of like grasping it like,

1314
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,640
I think this is good.

1315
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,000
And I don't just anyway, I don't know.

1316
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,360
I really don't know. But that's those are my thoughts.

1317
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,480
Those are my loose thoughts. Sure.

1318
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,840
The transition time for sure is going to be in.

1319
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,680
Oh, my God, it's going to be like it's going to be like we haven't prepared

1320
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:51,640
ourselves. 25 million people have the vaccine and they'll be like, I'm fine.

1321
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,720
I'm going. And then things are fine.

1322
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,600
Yeah. You get bullied by other friends like let's go.

1323
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:59,600
And you're like, well, I only got one half of the Pfizer vaccine.

1324
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,800
They're like, that's enough.

1325
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,840
You're young and it's provide some safety, they say.

1326
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,840
It's going to be all it's going to be. Bedlam is what's going to happen.

1327
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:13,720
But yeah, I mean, I think for sure, whatever stimulus, God willing, passes.

1328
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:18,080
Needs to help the tourism industry.

1329
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:23,720
I mean, less the Walt Disney Company, you know, LLC or whatever.

1330
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:27,840
But and more like the employees of said company.

1331
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,360
Oh, yeah. The people on the ground.

1332
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,400
Well, and all the surrounding businesses and everything that do

1333
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,720
benefit from these places. Oh, yeah.

1334
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:35,760
Yeah. Yeah.

1335
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,200
It's a reality in restaurants and Captain Kids been closed.

1336
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,440
Do we know we have to save Captain Kids?

1337
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:45,160
I don't know where they're at, but I can't be anywhere good.

1338
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,720
So if Captain Kid is in peril, we got to rescue him.

1339
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,120
We got to be Captain Kids, little little Buccaneers

1340
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:57,120
and get Captain Kid that PPP alone.

1341
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:01,720
That's what modern day pirates need is PPP loans.

1342
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,880
Yeah, that's their treasure.

1343
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:08,040
You are there be PPP loans up ahead.

1344
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:12,920
Oh, let's get into Mountain.

1345
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:15,400
Let's say, OK, yes.

1346
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,960
What? Yeah, I was just going to say we'll get into it on the harbor.

1347
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:18,960
Hold on.

1348
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,560
Uh, what?

1349
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,840
So let's discuss this off air.

1350
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,320
OK, OK.

1351
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,960
OK, we drove our cars through a theme park.

1352
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:30,040
We drove our cars into Six Flags.

1353
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,840
I assume I assume Six Flags.

1354
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,440
They did like a holiday light special, but I assume Six Flags thought of the idea

1355
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:42,440
because teenage boys are constantly driving cars into their theme park anyway.

1356
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:45,200
Their girlfriend works there, cheated on them.

1357
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,560
They drive into the theme park all angry.

1358
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,920
And this happens a couple of times a week

1359
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,280
and screeches to a halt in front of a roller coaster.

1360
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,000
Look, Linda, you cheated on me.

1361
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,720
What are you doing?

1362
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:00,680
With Brian? I'm not moving this car until you get back together with

1363
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,920
until you're in it.

1364
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,600
I assume this happens constantly at Six Flags.

1365
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,000
So this is they're like, ah, yes, this is a good way to reopen.

1366
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:14,240
Yeah, well, I should say, first off, we're talking about Six Flags

1367
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,320
holiday in the park drive through experience.

1368
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,600
This was not my first time riding a sedan

1369
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,760
through the walkways of Six Flags,

1370
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:27,080
because I went to a construction tour once and I must have been one of the later

1371
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:30,360
people there because they were like, oh, yeah, we already took the golf carts.

1372
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,920
I was someone's, oh, I'll take them up.

1373
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:32,840
I'm going out there.

1374
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,800
And I just got it like a Nissan Sentra

1375
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,920
with with one of the media people and Eli floored it

1376
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:43,120
through the park up to like the construction site.

1377
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:48,600
So this was definitely the slower speed experience of driving through Six Flags.

1378
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:54,720
I love it. I want more experiences where you drive a vehicle through a Six Flags.

1379
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:58,040
It's the greatest thing. It's so funny.

1380
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,840
It felt so silly making our way.

1381
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:05,760
I mean, you know, the three of us all in the same car together,

1382
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:10,560
we're laughing so hard, boy, we were just laughing so much that we were spitting

1383
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,760
like spittle was coming out of our mouths onto each other.

1384
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,920
It made us. Oh, man, it was so funny.

1385
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,680
Yeah, I sent our 10 friends in the back.

1386
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,520
Yeah, I was different.

1387
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,520
I was old. You rented a school bus.

1388
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,400
Yeah, but we only sat in the front.

1389
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:28,560
We all jammed together in the front just for peak camaraderie.

1390
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,600
Of course. Oh, yeah.

1391
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,680
This whole thing.

1392
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,320
I'm sorry. Not true.

1393
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:38,360
Just to be clear, because things are serious.

1394
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,640
It's only thinking a bit is real in this case.

1395
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,560
Safety is involved.

1396
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,680
Yeah, we each individually drove our sedans with our school bus.

1397
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,480
We each drove a school bus through.

1398
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,600
Would they let a school bus through if you showed up in a school bus?

1399
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,240
Are they or would there not be the clearance you need?

1400
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:59,040
Depending on the Valencia team that worked there that on that day,

1401
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,400
you might get an OK, a clear, all clear.

1402
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,600
And how stoned are they?

1403
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,760
Yeah, they might send you right through.

1404
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,040
We went to Jason. I went on a press night.

1405
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:13,960
So they had the top people working.

1406
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:18,160
And we got greeted with a phrase I love to hear.

1407
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,680
OK, great. You're checked in.

1408
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:24,440
Here's your 3D glasses and your pound and a half of fudge.

1409
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:32,200
Yes, we got a pound and a half of fudge on our way into this man.

1410
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,760
And boy, we were excited about it.

1411
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:38,840
Wow. Just texting each other like once at a stop.

1412
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:41,560
Fudge. I thought Jason made a joke on the text chain

1413
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:43,840
because he was there a little bit early, a couple of minutes earlier.

1414
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,080
And I thought he was joking.

1415
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,280
And then I went, oh, what?

1416
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,880
We got a big, big, heavy, heavy.

1417
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:52,200
Really felt like it was two and a half pounds.

1418
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,040
It was very heavy.

1419
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,600
Different kinds of fudge, like four different kinds.

1420
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,200
Jason, do you remember the flavors?

1421
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,120
Yeah, OK, it was chocolate.

1422
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,920
There was like a cookie dough one.

1423
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,960
There was candy cane and like a green peppermint.

1424
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:14,040
Oh, there might have been a rocky road and then a chocolate peanut butter.

1425
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,640
Wow. I don't even remember, but they were sweet as hell.

1426
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,480
They were good. They were good.

1427
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,920
Yeah. And you can buy them.

1428
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,640
You can buy like some treats coming or going from this.

1429
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,840
Is this open still?

1430
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,040
Yes. So this is not only still open.

1431
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,200
It has been extended.

1432
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:38,360
I think it goes, oh, nightly through January 10th

1433
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,000
and then weekends through January 31st.

1434
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,200
But due to the drive through nature, it is still open.

1435
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,560
And you can do this.

1436
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,640
And I'll say this.

1437
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:47,920
Twenty bucks a head.

1438
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,240
Like, this is a reasonable thing.

1439
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:53,760
You can do and then you can add on if you want

1440
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:58,080
like hot chocolate or popcorn or like lanyards or fudge.

1441
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,680
Yeah, you can buy fudge is an add on.

1442
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:02,640
We, of course, are VIPs.

1443
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,880
We received complimentary fudge.

1444
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,400
So, yes.

1445
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:11,160
Well, after the regard that we have shown Six Flags time and time again,

1446
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,920
we, of course, are given free things by them.

1447
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,080
It makes perfect sense.

1448
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,520
Sure. Hey, all press is good press.

1449
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,600
Six Flags says it says it under the sign when you go in.

1450
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,520
What what else about the sign when you go in, guys?

1451
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,320
What else did you know about the sign?

1452
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:34,200
OK, so so we're driving up to Valencia and Six Flags.

1453
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,520
Magic Mountain is in an odd spot.

1454
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,000
It's the middle of nowhere.

1455
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,640
Basically, there's like there's like a Wendy's close by

1456
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,960
and maybe a couple other restaurants.

1457
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,000
Maybe is there like a Friday's or something?

1458
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,600
There's a there's a red lobster.

1459
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:51,080
We sat and had like weird pink drinks and a and the cheddar biscuits one time.

1460
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,240
That's right. Had a great time.

1461
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:55,080
So it's it's when you're driving up,

1462
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,280
it's in a weird spot.

1463
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,320
It's kind of desolate.

1464
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,680
And then during a pandemic, when most of the park isn't open,

1465
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,240
a lot of the roller coasters are not illuminated,

1466
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:08,880
which immediately, as I said earlier, struck a little fear,

1467
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,640
like a little terror, like, oh, like you kind of get a chill because it's creepy.

1468
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,200
And then we saw a lot of cars, obviously.

1469
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,880
A lot of people going to this.

1470
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,400
And the sign that says Six Flags,

1471
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,560
the S is out.

1472
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,720
The S is not illuminated.

1473
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:29,040
So you just see it says X flags.

1474
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:33,240
And could a Six Flags trip start in a better way?

1475
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,400
It I don't think so.

1476
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,760
It ended for me.

1477
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,480
It started with X flags.

1478
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:42,800
And then there was another ominous warning as I was getting back on the freeway.

1479
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:44,520
And we'll get to that.

1480
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:50,600
Are we sure that it isn't that it wasn't it's not X, but Roman numeral I X,

1481
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,000
because they changed it to nine flags?

1482
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,760
I am not sure about that.

1483
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:59,280
That would be a fun like a test market.

1484
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,640
They're trying it out around here.

1485
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:02,680
They're going to add more flags to people.

1486
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:05,280
We know more flags, more fun.

1487
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:10,480
Yeah. So why not in this trying year add more flags finally?

1488
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,280
Well, there are Six Flags.

1489
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,760
People are sitting around a table and like, OK, what should we do?

1490
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,480
Should we make the rides better?

1491
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,040
Should we expensive?

1492
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:24,160
And should we paint any of our buildings?

1493
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,520
Is it paint in the mud?

1494
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,720
We did it eight years ago.

1495
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,160
Why would we need to paint a building?

1496
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,720
And I'm like, I'm so high.

1497
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,160
You know what? He sees it.

1498
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:36,160
And it was like somebody's like, where is the paint even?

1499
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,680
I don't even know.

1500
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:40,480
Where would we find the paint in a closet somewhere?

1501
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,560
And they're like, throw it away.

1502
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,520
We put it in the river.

1503
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,000
Yeah. So then they're like, what about more flags?

1504
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,160
More flags.

1505
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:53,880
Do I have this correct that the equation we use internally is more flags equal

1506
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,520
more fun? Yeah.

1507
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,000
And they figured it out.

1508
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,920
I think we have it.

1509
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:03,040
Then they figured out they could do this trick.

1510
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,520
So they can save on sign money.

1511
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,400
And then we don't have to just turn off the heads.

1512
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,960
Then it's nine, obviously,

1513
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,640
you know, and then it'll be clear that more flags equal more fudge.

1514
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,760
Oh, I misspoke. I said fudge instead of fun.

1515
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,520
Wait a sec.

1516
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,640
More fudge is more fun.

1517
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,080
Oh, yeah, you know, exactly what happened.

1518
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,280
We're having a lot of fun.

1519
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:33,120
But I got to say, I thought these light displays are nice.

1520
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,360
Oh, yeah. Oh, completely. Yes. Yeah.

1521
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,720
I would. I mean, this is fun.

1522
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,160
At twenty dollars a head, it's about an hour.

1523
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:44,600
I say doing the experience, they say it's thirty minutes.

1524
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,680
And then there's a little bit of a line to get in.

1525
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:49,120
You got to go around the parking lot.

1526
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:52,880
You go in through the employee like and, you know, press

1527
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,400
and backstage entrance, which is cool.

1528
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:58,880
There's a lot. There's a couple of fun things that I'd like to talk about.

1529
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,440
Now, early on, you see.

1530
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:05,040
Mr. Six's bus.

1531
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,360
I. Which is great.

1532
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:10,000
Very exciting. I really liked that.

1533
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:14,600
I will say, and this is only because I and Scott, you will answer this question,

1534
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:19,840
is Jason and I did not see something that we know existed there.

1535
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:26,680
Did you, Scott, see the Looney Tunes characters waving at you or anything?

1536
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,720
I did not. I did not.

1537
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,120
Have they been doing that?

1538
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,280
OK, because I saw on mice chat.

1539
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:39,600
Dusty Sage had of mice chat, in case you don't know what I'm talking about.

1540
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,080
Mice chat is another website.

1541
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,840
They have a podcast.

1542
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,360
Doug Barnes from season past does that.

1543
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:49,000
But Dusty Sage, who is the main man at Mice Chat, posted a picture,

1544
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,920
a video of the Looney Tunes waving at him as he drove by.

1545
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:58,160
Well, and I got enraged because we did not see the Looney Tunes.

1546
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:01,080
And my sister did this on a different night and she did not see Looney Tunes either.

1547
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:05,240
I feel like there was a VIP theme park media tier

1548
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:08,320
that got to see the Looney Tunes or something, and we were shut out.

1549
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,800
And I think it's horseshit.

1550
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:10,840
It'd be a big way.

1551
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:14,360
I saw Dusty Sage household name.

1552
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,280
Yes, he Sage. Right.

1553
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,360
Finally, we're talking about him on the show.

1554
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:23,280
Head of Mice Chat, a different theme park outlet thing.

1555
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:27,880
I saw a different drive through the park that was theme park.

1556
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:35,800
Insider did a drive through and there the characters were waving by the fountain.

1557
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,360
The Looney like I think it was Bugs and Sylvester were waving by the fountain

1558
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,400
towards the end, and I didn't see them there either.

1559
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:49,080
Also, I will say, if anyone, everyone is listening to this.

1560
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,120
The website theme park insider are the ones who

1561
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:57,120
that they are the ones on the mythos banner best restaurant.

1562
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:01,960
And they're currently doing voting for best restaurant in 2020.

1563
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:05,080
So if everyone listening could go to the theme park insider website

1564
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:08,520
and vote for mythos, then they will have to and they win.

1565
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,480
If we can get it to win, then they'll have to make a new banner with another year on it.

1566
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,200
And that would just warm my heart.

1567
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:18,400
So you want to win the games.

1568
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,320
Yeah, we had a great meal.

1569
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,280
We had a great time.

1570
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,760
I know we were down there last year.

1571
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,920
It was very good. Yes. Yeah.

1572
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,360
So back to six flags anyway.

1573
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,480
I want to take away. I did enjoy myself.

1574
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:31,520
I just was we didn't see the Looney Tunes, and I feel like that would be the perfect

1575
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,680
the cherry on top to this whole experience.

1576
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:36,040
Man, yes, the bus was a thrill.

1577
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:39,600
Friend of the show, Marissa Strickland went and she described

1578
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,760
seeing the bus as a celeb sighting.

1579
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:46,400
And I think the only thing that also could have made it better

1580
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:49,320
is if the man himself was there dancing.

1581
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,640
Right. Why that one?

1582
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,840
Another one is an easy layup, I feel like.

1583
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:58,080
Yeah, just having them six flags man dancing out there

1584
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,280
would have been masked.

1585
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,440
You put him in a mask.

1586
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,600
That's an authority figure.

1587
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,560
Maybe you listen to him.

1588
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:10,720
I you know, he might have more authority than the people who are running for

1589
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,120
for the for the presidency this year, especially because he is younger

1590
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,480
than both of them.

1591
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,000
It's very good point.

1592
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,680
So, yeah, so if they did this again, which I assume they

1593
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,680
hopefully not in our lifetime, they'll have to do this again.

1594
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:28,080
But I do think maybe there could be a hybrid event

1595
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,800
like during fright nights where they like people are walking around

1596
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,320
and people are driving their cars.

1597
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,720
Just to make it a little more interesting.

1598
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:39,760
Oh, yeah, there should be like derbies through this thing.

1599
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:43,320
Yeah, 100 percent rallies, whatever you want to call them.

1600
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,760
Hey, you saw another character.

1601
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:50,280
One of our favorite characters in the world of advertising,

1602
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,880
the happy Honda days, Moral Orel.

1603
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,320
That's what I assume his name is.

1604
01:26:55,320 --> 01:27:00,920
He's the claymation character who looks exactly like Adult Swim's Moral Orel.

1605
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:04,480
He is just is they just took the character and put it in Honda ads.

1606
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:08,960
He's the boy with no other characteristics, and he was inflatable

1607
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,120
and all along the car paths several times.

1608
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,280
Huh, I don't remember.

1609
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,560
I didn't see that.

1610
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:19,200
You know, there's the ads every year of a blue shirted boy

1611
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,320
and other boys that he knows.

1612
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,360
There he has no I have no other descriptors for this,

1613
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:30,320
but there was the most prominent character, I feel the most prominent IP

1614
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,440
at Six Flags at this time.

1615
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:36,920
I do know I do know who you're talking about, but I don't remember that on the tour.

1616
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,760
Wow. Wow. Was it not there?

1617
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,920
Maybe they hadn't and then set them up yet.

1618
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,280
The sponsors, the check hadn't cleared.

1619
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,680
It's a very good question.

1620
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,680
We'll check. Maybe that was a late edition.

1621
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:47,720
I like plussing up.

1622
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,320
I'm not against it if they were like, you know what?

1623
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:52,960
We don't always have the Looney Tunes, but we'll have the little blue shirt boy.

1624
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,040
Because that would that's something, you know, that's a character you like.

1625
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,560
That's a friendly face.

1626
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,120
Yeah, we have to know that happy Honda days are ahead.

1627
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:05,320
I think the biggest, the most excitement I got for the first couple of minutes

1628
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:10,040
was seeing an unlit Johnny Rockets.

1629
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:13,120
I got excited

1630
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,840
to see that because it was there was no lights on it whatsoever.

1631
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:19,240
Now, they did a pretty good job at this because this is a huge park.

1632
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:20,480
This park is massive.

1633
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,160
And there's some sections that are like really, really well lit.

1634
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:25,560
And then there's some sections that are kind of dead.

1635
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:28,160
So I got very excited when we get into a dead section

1636
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:33,040
with it, like the Johnny Rockets not being lit up, darkened food

1637
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:36,640
courts several times because of that post-apocalyptic.

1638
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:39,720
There were a few times when I was driving through that it almost felt like a haunt.

1639
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:44,640
Like early on, there was like some things where you're like,

1640
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,840
this is a little spooky.

1641
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:50,480
We kept several times we said, what is this area?

1642
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,640
Is this like this is like a service road that they opened up for this?

1643
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,200
This isn't like open to the guests.

1644
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:59,480
And then we'd see like a coke sign and go, nope, this is a sidewalk.

1645
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,320
This is a place where guests go, even though it's full of like peligro signs.

1646
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,240
Yeah, I was thinking there would be something like that, too.

1647
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:10,320
But no, I believe everything we were driving on is just regular

1648
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:13,560
guest walkway, which is pretty crazy.

1649
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,400
I will say, yes, I was hoping

1650
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:21,880
just for the fun of it that, you know, like one of the cars would veer off

1651
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:27,120
the road onto the roller coaster track or like there would be just like

1652
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:31,200
ducks crossing for like an hour and cars couldn't move.

1653
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:35,840
Like I was hoping for some more antics, but the cars moved in and out.

1654
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:40,760
It was almost like they planned to have all the Six Flags walkways like car accessible.

1655
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,920
Yeah, oddly, because you couldn't do that in Disneyland, probably.

1656
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,640
You can drive through fantasy land, I wouldn't think.

1657
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:51,760
Yeah, no, I don't think with a smart car, perhaps, but that's about it.

1658
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,920
So, yeah, everything was smooth as far as the actual driving.

1659
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:01,360
It was I definitely imagined like, what if I just veered to the left

1660
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:04,120
and just crashed into that Dasani machine?

1661
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:05,640
What would happen?

1662
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:09,080
That was the fun was fantasizing about how much you could racket

1663
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:13,760
Six Flags with your car while you were in there with your like what you're in your car.

1664
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,240
Like there would be a couple of times.

1665
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,240
There was a part where they were playing later on.

1666
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:19,920
They were playing like a Dolly Parton Christmas song, which I found really nice.

1667
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,600
There was a lot of lights.

1668
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,560
It was really you know what I'm talking about is like kind of later in the in the

1669
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,680
I mean, it's a long one with me, but

1670
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:32,400
but then I was like, oh, I was I was not I was not thinking about Six Flags.

1671
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:37,080
At that moment, I was thinking about the holidays and everything there.

1672
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:41,080
But then the rest of the time, I would be like, hey, there's the Hall of Justice.

1673
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,800
Could I get my car in the door of the Hall of Justice?

1674
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,680
They're Rammin robots.

1675
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:52,640
That seems like a spot like have Batman there have Superman.

1676
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:54,280
Yes, there you go.

1677
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:55,680
This is what I was.

1678
01:30:55,680 --> 01:31:00,040
They had a stilt Walker, a one single guy, and he was great.

1679
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:02,480
He was talking to all of us.

1680
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:05,920
And he was like he was doing bits with the cars and stuff in front of the Hall of Justice.

1681
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:11,120
But give me yeah, give me and a stilt man is a character from the Marvel comics.

1682
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,920
So it couldn't have done stilt man, which it would be an easy,

1683
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:17,160
an easy character to use when a guy's on stilts.

1684
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:18,880
But yeah, give us a care.

1685
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:22,400
Give us who has robot legs in the DC universe, Jason. Come on.

1686
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:25,640
Cyborg, I guess has a cyborg, I guess.

1687
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:29,720
The ride. He has long legs now and he's wearing a jester's outfit.

1688
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,920
Just call him cyborg. Hey, I'm cyborg.

1689
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,920
I'm dressed up for the season.

1690
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,200
I saw some original characters.

1691
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:42,600
Well, one I saw in person and then the other I saw in video later on.

1692
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:47,120
And once you got to the what is usually the scream punk district is for the holidays

1693
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,840
is the gleam punk district. And that's a lot of fun.

1694
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:54,920
And the gleam district.

1695
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:57,800
Was Jewish this year?

1696
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:01,160
Yes, it was all Hanukkah, steampunk Hanukkah,

1697
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:04,200
which that is by far my favorite part of the whole thing.

1698
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:06,840
It was steampunk Hanukkah.

1699
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:08,080
Yeah, lots of manure.

1700
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:11,600
There was like a copper pipe with like light bulbs

1701
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:17,360
on top, menorah, and there there was big dreidel and a lot of beautiful blue lights.

1702
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:21,000
There was like a copper steampunk menorah.

1703
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,520
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

1704
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,240
Which I thought was an interesting choice.

1705
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,720
I feel like I was like, yeah, checking out at the end, I think maybe is why.

1706
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,920
Like those in the latter half.

1707
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:38,600
Yes. And while I while I did like this a lot,

1708
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:42,840
there was a point where you just go, boy, this is it's been a while now.

1709
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,920
We have been driving slowly through six.

1710
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:47,240
And we didn't stop on the way.

1711
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:52,360
So I've just had my foot on the gas for, you know, a lot for the whole drive there

1712
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,320
and then through the thing.

1713
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:58,640
And one thing I will say about this, they do they close with Santa,

1714
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,960
which makes sense. And that's fun.

1715
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,760
But I don't I think if they were to do this again,

1716
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:06,600
and I hope they don't have to for Christmas 2021.

1717
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,960
But like it didn't like build.

1718
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:13,640
I feel like the best lights probably were in a Hall of Justice area.

1719
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,680
And then they didn't like go out with a bang.

1720
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:21,640
It was just like, and now more sometimes smaller and less.

1721
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,160
And now you're not in it anymore.

1722
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,800
I think it could climax a little better.

1723
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:30,080
The dollar, whatever that dolly area was, I think is my favorite part.

1724
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,160
I think that had the most lights.

1725
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:34,280
And I think that part was really like felt special to me.

1726
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,680
And maybe you were checked out by that point, Scott.

1727
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:42,000
It was a little later in the experience because I kept going, oh, we're done.

1728
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,360
Like I did. I did that drive through experience at Halloween.

1729
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,480
And I remember going, oh, we must have like 20 more minutes.

1730
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:49,760
And then we turned a corner and we were out and I went, huh?

1731
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:53,960
And then this one, I was like, oh, we're probably done seven minutes later.

1732
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,360
Not done. Another seven minutes.

1733
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:57,520
Oh, we're probably done.

1734
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,600
Just like good.

1735
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,840
You want to get a nice chunk.

1736
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:03,520
And I do remember, though, I was fading a little bit.

1737
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:08,040
And then we got to gleam punk, steampunk Hanukkah.

1738
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:09,600
And I did come to life again.

1739
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,880
Yeah. And then I was making I was making jokes like

1740
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:20,080
where like the local dreidel works was, you know, like they should have done

1741
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:24,320
more with that and had like steam powered dreidel spinning.

1742
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,320
And if they really want to go all the way with it.

1743
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,400
So, yeah, there was a gear.

1744
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:32,760
There was a man with gears on a hat, top hat on a big, tall bicycle

1745
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:36,600
that had gears on it, and he was yelling, happy Halloween or not.

1746
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,120
Happy Halloween. That would be very funny.

1747
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:39,240
If you only got the Halloween.

1748
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:39,920
They messed it up.

1749
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:45,480
But but there, yeah, there was a lot of thematic touches in the gleampunk district.

1750
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:49,880
But when I was watching the video back, I did not see the stilt man

1751
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:53,480
with candy cane legs and candy cane arms

1752
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:59,040
who was yelling at cars, cars, greetings from the candy cane realm.

1753
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:02,800
And I'm like, well, I wish you were in the rest of the park.

1754
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,720
You nightmare, you walking nightmare.

1755
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:08,640
Maybe that's who we saw.

1756
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:11,160
And he just did not introduce himself from the candy cane realm,

1757
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,520
because I would have remembered the candy cane realm.

1758
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:17,160
What do you mean? Just everything's candy canes there.

1759
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:20,040
Like that's what they're they have instead of bones.

1760
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:23,160
Maybe it's just limbs are candy canes.

1761
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:27,320
Everyone's limbs are candy canes, which is so easily shatterable.

1762
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:32,400
If there's war in the on the candy cane realm, you win that war.

1763
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:37,000
Whoever you are, or it's like where they kind of lightly smack into one of them

1764
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,960
and they shatter into a million pieces.

1765
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:43,320
There's an X-Men character named Mero who can take her own bones out

1766
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:46,480
and they'll grow back real quick and she can use her own bones as weapons.

1767
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:49,720
So maybe it's like that where you pull out your candy cane rib.

1768
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:52,800
You can stab someone with it and then it'll grow right back.

1769
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:55,160
They grow back and they do get sharp.

1770
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:57,640
Oh, God, I'm counting out the candy cane realm.

1771
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,520
I thought this would be an easy fight.

1772
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:02,080
They got my number.

1773
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:02,840
They should do that.

1774
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:05,880
I wrote the sharpened candy cane arm.

1775
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:08,880
They should do that as a fright fest maze candy.

1776
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,560
Yeah. Oh, there's a lot there. Yes.

1777
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:14,960
And do that. Yeah. During Halloween, you have a demented Christmas thing.

1778
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:16,800
That's really scary.

1779
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,640
And they did a little of that at Halloween Horror Nights.

1780
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:24,640
They've done like a 12 or like 12 month holiday thing with like evil Santa

1781
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:26,600
and stuff, I think, or Santa was going to be just getting murdered.

1782
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,000
Maybe he's just getting murdered.

1783
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,600
I forget exactly what was happening to Santa.

1784
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:34,320
So, yes, they're they're turning Santa into a candy cane.

1785
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,840
He's in the process of being candy caned

1786
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:40,640
and he's like half of his face is red and white now.

1787
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:44,520
It's it's like it's like embalming a mummy.

1788
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:48,280
And that's like the nuts maze wax works.

1789
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:49,160
Oh, that's right.

1790
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:52,760
Turning people into wax figures before they're while they're alive.

1791
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,160
Oh, yeah, this is good.

1792
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:57,960
Maybe we can we write this for them?

1793
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:58,760
Yeah, I'm not.

1794
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:02,240
I mean, we've been begging to do this for anyone for years.

1795
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,360
So please.

1796
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,240
I mean, Six Flags in Venice, you got to do it.

1797
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:06,360
They will. We'll give it to them.

1798
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:07,520
They've been good to us.

1799
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,320
They did a good holiday experience.

1800
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:11,400
We want to write candy cane realm the maze.

1801
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,200
We should be in charge of everything at Six Flags.

1802
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:16,240
They should just hand us the keys to that.

1803
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:18,720
Like we should have written this whole drive through show,

1804
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:20,160
and I'm not being facetious.

1805
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:22,880
There's no reason not to have gotten let us do this.

1806
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,520
Give us a week and ten thousand dollars and we could.

1807
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:27,800
You wouldn't recognize the.

1808
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:31,520
Just give Jason a box of fudge and he'll do it.

1809
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:34,600
Yeah, I'll work for fudge, you know.

1810
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,160
Two pounds this time, please.

1811
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:41,320
Two pounds. Yeah, I, you know.

1812
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:43,280
Yeah, I'm playing hardball.

1813
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:46,200
Yeah, I mean, I think everything you're saying is right.

1814
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:50,280
Yeah, there's a long stretch where you go up around Tatsu and then down.

1815
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:55,320
And there are some stretches where like there there was like winter winter,

1816
01:37:55,360 --> 01:38:00,520
you know, witches or I don't know, people, people kind of on stilts

1817
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:04,720
and big outfits and some musicians and some dancers.

1818
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:08,600
I was very excited to learn, though, because I remember when I went

1819
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:13,840
on the hottest day in like 2008, there was one of those mini Panda Expresses

1820
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,760
where like you only have two options.

1821
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,760
That licensing deal is done.

1822
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:20,320
It is now a restaurant called Chop Six.

1823
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,360
And I thought that was very funny.

1824
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,360
So we high marks the chop.

1825
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:29,240
We did drive by the full throttle bar, which is where Anthony, Geo

1826
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:34,680
and I pregame to before the epic frightfest episode of podcast the ride.

1827
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:38,800
And I should see that, but it was not lit up.

1828
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:41,840
I was hoping for some sort of Christmas decoration there.

1829
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:45,520
Of course, full throttle bar has one of the tiniest bathrooms

1830
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:48,920
I've ever seen upstairs, at least.

1831
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:52,680
See the tiniest bathroom in the world.

1832
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:58,520
Well, look, I promise the audience will get back to Six Flags next year.

1833
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:02,360
I was thinking I was joking already on the show and on Twitter, like,

1834
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:07,840
should I get the trial vaccine just to go to frightfest if it was open in October?

1835
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:09,680
And I didn't even have the option.

1836
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,720
It was not even possible.

1837
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:14,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So.

1838
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:16,960
But here's what I'll say for opening back up.

1839
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:20,200
Imagine a commercial, you know, people

1840
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:23,760
unlock maybe a hand unlocking the gate, flipping all the lights on.

1841
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:27,400
And then the person turns around and it's Mr.

1842
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:29,840
Six and he goes, we're back.

1843
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:31,800
And he starts dancing.

1844
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:34,320
I mean, can you I think that in the new world,

1845
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,560
when everything on the Mr. Six episode.

1846
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:41,800
But I, I, it's haunting you every waking moment of your life.

1847
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:43,520
Is that what you're trying to say?

1848
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:46,040
No, I'm saying sometimes I don't remember what I.

1849
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,600
Oh, yeah, sure, sure.

1850
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,760
Because I'm just a fountain of great ideas.

1851
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:55,480
But I mean, I'm saying even if I did, it would have such a more magnificent impact.

1852
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,000
You know, once it once it opens back up.

1853
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:01,880
I'd love to see him open up everything that's been closed.

1854
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:04,120
Let's see him opening Disneyland up.

1855
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:08,840
Yeah, we're back at Disneyland.

1856
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:10,800
Do do do do do do do do do.

1857
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:14,240
Restaurant brands or anything that has an El Torito.

1858
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:15,920
It doesn't matter. Yeah.

1859
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:16,960
Yeah. Red Lobster.

1860
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:21,000
He's the mascot of the reopening and he'll we all start dancing like him.

1861
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,600
We all put on our bow ties because we're going to value going out again

1862
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:28,880
and we're going to look our best, put effort into our appearance like Mr.

1863
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:30,200
Six does. Right.

1864
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:31,720
It's going to be a whole new world.

1865
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:32,760
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1866
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:34,000
Something emulate.

1867
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,280
Um, does that does that cover the the Six Flags experience?

1868
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,360
Oh, yeah. I just like it was funny.

1869
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:41,000
Weird. Yeah.

1870
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,520
Sorry we didn't drive our car off a cliff or something or have more antics.

1871
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:49,200
Yeah. Oh, my omen leaving Six Flags.

1872
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:54,240
So I I when I left the park and got back on the main road,

1873
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:56,640
I knew there was an office building there that was like a

1874
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:59,280
some sort of corporate office for Sunkiss,

1875
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:02,520
but I couldn't see that sign from the angle I was coming from.

1876
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:05,320
Instead, I saw a new sign I'd never seen before.

1877
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:08,480
And it was just a dark office building with a illuminated sign

1878
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,760
that just said Scorpion.

1879
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:13,960
And I was like, what in God's name is Scorpion?

1880
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:18,400
Like with everything dark around it, I was like, what is this ominous?

1881
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:22,440
And I went to their website and I still don't know.

1882
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:25,240
It appears to be some sort of digital marketing concern.

1883
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:28,840
But it's just a lot of jargon on the website.

1884
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:32,200
But just in the pitch black night, a giant glowing white sign

1885
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:33,520
that just says Scorpion.

1886
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:37,040
Oh, my God, there's a scorpion outside Scott's window that just appeared.

1887
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:39,200
Oh, on the windows, got to turn around.

1888
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:41,480
Oh, it's a flock of them.

1889
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,720
That's what was cooing earlier.

1890
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:44,560
Oh, my God.

1891
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:47,080
The famous call of the scorpion.

1892
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:49,440
You know, they're calling on my window.

1893
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:51,680
I can't even I can't even see outside anymore.

1894
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:53,360
They've darkened the whole thing.

1895
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:57,640
Unleash your scarabs to take care of the scorpions out of my mouth.

1896
01:41:58,040 --> 01:41:59,120
Yeah. Yeah.

1897
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:03,360
Oh, Charlie Ma or whatever he says.

1898
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:05,080
There they go.

1899
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:07,040
All right. They're going to fight out there for a while.

1900
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:13,760
I guess that's a sign of the apocalypse, just as everything we've experienced.

1901
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:16,880
Yeah. And these last few weeks has been.

1902
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:21,960
Yeah. You know, look, we had fun at all of these things.

1903
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,800
Yeah. We got some smiles and some some chuckles out of

1904
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,400
all of the socially distant things that we went to.

1905
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:32,360
But look, is this the note that we wanted to end 2020 on?

1906
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:33,240
I don't know that it is.

1907
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:36,360
How much we have how great would it have been if we'd been able to say,

1908
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:40,240
oh, but then things were back to normal and we had our Manhattans

1909
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:43,400
and we all reconvene, we did an episode in in person.

1910
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,840
All that would have been great.

1911
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,800
But it's not how it played out.

1912
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:53,600
It is hard to come up with a positive note to end 2020 on.

1913
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,480
But I I thought that we had to try.

1914
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,360
We had to give it a college try.

1915
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:02,080
And that is why I have prepared a little scene.

1916
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:06,880
And this, I think, is maybe the way that we should go out of of 2020.

1917
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,520
It's a it's a it's a scene of of hope and positivity.

1918
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:14,240
I emailed it to you guys if you want to take a second, find it.

1919
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:17,560
It's it's a it's a you guys haven't seen it before.

1920
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:20,480
So this will be a cold read.

1921
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:23,440
So what will put your your acting chops to the test?

1922
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:25,240
But I think you're good.

1923
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,440
I trust you. I believe in you.

1924
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:30,000
It'll also be a tech rehearsal on my part.

1925
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:33,040
So if there's some music cues dropped, you know,

1926
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,360
it's not ready to face the public yet, maybe.

1927
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:38,560
But we'll we'll just give it a go.

1928
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:41,080
So here's what I'm thinking here.

1929
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:43,160
Obviously, terrible year.

1930
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:46,520
And we could be pessimists about where the next year is going.

1931
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:47,520
We were earlier.

1932
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:50,200
We had that discussion about like, oh, it's going to be this transition year.

1933
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:51,040
And nobody will agree.

1934
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,440
And will things really be ready?

1935
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:57,360
And, you know, there's every reason to be pessimistic about 2021.

1936
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:59,040
Now, I don't think we could do that.

1937
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:02,680
We're good boys and we have to have good feelings about the next year.

1938
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:05,040
I think we have to be optimistic.

1939
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:08,600
And maybe we can imagine a 2021

1940
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:12,640
that is like what the ultimate optimist would have imagined.

1941
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,720
Walt Disney.

1942
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:20,680
I believe that Walt Disney would have imagined a 2021 that's better,

1943
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:26,200
that's full of hope and that is full of

1944
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:33,800
that's a pull up of Q of 2021 that is full of progress.

1945
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:35,280
Oh, wow.

1946
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:47,880
Well, here we are.

1947
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:51,720
Twenty twenty one and things just keep getting better.

1948
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,160
Why the economy is booming again.

1949
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:59,360
Ever since Nancy Pelosi got everyone in America, six hundred dollars.

1950
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:01,880
Boy, that'll buy a lot of sarsaparilla.

1951
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:05,880
And now they want everybody to take this thing called a vaccine.

1952
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:08,880
It'll never work.

1953
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,640
Say, we got a new fella in the White House, Joe Biden.

1954
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:17,040
And that last fella, Donald Trump, he got sent straight to jail.

1955
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:19,680
We all watched it live on TV.

1956
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:23,480
On the way in, he slipped and fell right on his rump.

1957
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:28,080
Boy, little Michael and I sure got a kick out of it, didn't we?

1958
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:30,640
Not now, Scott.

1959
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:34,640
I'm I'm signing in so we can watch Matrix three.

1960
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,520
Wait, Matrix three, are you sure?

1961
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,040
Oh, Matrix four. I'm sorry.

1962
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:40,680
I should have made the script bigger.

1963
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:43,240
Oh, that's OK. You're behind that scrim over there.

1964
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:45,160
It's a little bit tough to see. Yeah.

1965
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:46,800
Yeah. Matrix four.

1966
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:49,720
You know, I almost forgot they got this thing now.

1967
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:52,520
HBO Max. It's a real hoot.

1968
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:58,360
Sure is. The Warner Brothers stream all the best movies right to our home.

1969
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:02,960
Yep. No need to get in the rat race and head all the way to the theater.

1970
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:05,280
I'm glad those things are gone.

1971
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:07,640
I can't wait for Space Jam 2.

1972
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:11,000
It's got that new fella, LeBron James,

1973
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:18,520
my favorite brands, Nike and Xbox and oh, that Lola bunny.

1974
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,560
Now, Michael, now, Michael, hang on there.

1975
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:25,640
You remember that talk we had about body content?

1976
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:29,080
Sorry, Scott.

1977
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,640
Boys will be boys.

1978
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:34,880
You know, there's so many great things about 2021.

1979
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:37,720
Trap music is the cat's meow.

1980
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:40,600
No celebrities we like have died.

1981
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:45,680
One billion people all deleted Zoom at the exact same time.

1982
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:50,240
And the best part is we're hanging out with our friends again in real life.

1983
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:54,040
Why, I've been seeing all my pals, except Uncle Jason.

1984
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,160
Haven't seen him since 20 Spenny.

1985
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:57,840
It's 20 Spenny.

1986
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:04,040
It's a haven't seen him since 2020, which he spent self inoculating in a bathtub.

1987
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:06,320
Maybe I'll give him a call.

1988
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:09,400
Hello, Uncle Jason.

1989
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:12,200
No privacy at all around this place.

1990
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:15,000
Uncle Jason, you're still in the bathtub.

1991
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:18,280
The lockdown's been over for months.

1992
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:22,560
They can lift restrictions, but they can't take away my privacy.

1993
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:25,400
And you're cooling the room with a big block of ice.

1994
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:28,480
We've had air conditioning for 75 years.

1995
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:32,080
Look, man, get off Uncle Jason's ass.

1996
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:34,800
Just leave me and my bath donut in privacy.

1997
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:37,760
Sorry, Jason.

1998
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:39,960
Well, some things never change.

1999
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:43,560
But lucky for us, some things do for the better.

2000
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:49,600
And this year is way better than the last, since the bar couldn't possibly be any lower.

2001
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:53,760
Hey, Scott, what do you say we sing our song?

2002
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,480
Sounds like the bee's knees.

2003
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:00,920
Jason, Jason, have you been bathing in milk this whole time?

2004
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:04,880
Yeah, and dipping cookies into it, too.

2005
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:06,480
Play the damn song.

2006
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:07,800
All right. Sounds good.

2007
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:10,320
Let me just share the screen and then we go.

2008
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,240
OK, OK. Share the screen, Scott.

2009
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:13,720
Share the screen.

2010
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:15,640
Why did you delete this? I'm doing it.

2011
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:17,400
Why did you have to re-download it?

2012
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:19,880
All right. Look, we're not off.

2013
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:21,720
We're not off Zoom yet. This is a play.

2014
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:22,600
OK, you put it up.

2015
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:25,280
Hold on. It full screens and my lyrics go away.

2016
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:27,680
Oh, shoot. All right.

2017
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:29,680
I'll put it up on my phone. I got it. I got it. I got it.

2018
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:30,880
If you hit command tab.

2019
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,720
One thing that'll be better next year is coordinating

2020
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:35,520
en masse singalongs to end little plays.

2021
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,840
OK, everybody. All right, fellas.

2022
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:39,880
Hey, let's sing our song.

2023
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:41,400
Here we go.

2024
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:45,280
There's a great big beautiful tomorrow.

2025
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:48,520
After the shitty year we've had,

2026
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:52,520
there's a great big beautiful tomorrow.

2027
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:56,120
Next year we assume we'll be less mad.

2028
01:48:56,840 --> 01:49:00,200
Man eats a bat and that's the start.

2029
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:04,240
Now everyone's been depressed since March.

2030
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:07,640
But when we achieve our immunity,

2031
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:11,480
we can eat inside of our chilies.

2032
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:14,960
So there's a great big beautiful tomorrow.

2033
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:18,480
All we need is for the year to change.

2034
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:22,280
There's a great big beautiful tomorrow.

2035
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:27,320
Just two weeks away.

2036
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:31,760
Wow, fellas, that was absolutely perfect.

2037
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:35,240
Really proved the value of the old Zoom machine.

2038
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:37,800
Maybe we shouldn't all delete the app.

2039
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:41,480
No notes. It's like being right here with all of you.

2040
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:45,280
It was as precise as robots would be.

2041
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:48,200
Boy, a beautiful show.

2042
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:49,280
Great rehearsal.

2043
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:52,360
I'm sure we'll work out all the kinks when we do it for real.

2044
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:54,360
Oh, Scott, your hand fell off.

2045
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:56,200
I feel more positive, don't you?

2046
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:59,000
Yes, I feel great.

2047
01:49:59,000 --> 01:49:59,880
Yeah, yeah.

2048
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:02,120
I think we all do.

2049
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:05,160
It's going to be a great big beautiful 2021.

2050
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:07,800
You survived podcast The Ride.

2051
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:12,280
You survived 2020 and congrats on doing it.

2052
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:15,800
More fun will be had next year.

2053
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:19,560
Hopefully by the end of the year, we're not only doing the show in person.

2054
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:22,560
We are jamboreeing in person.

2055
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:23,760
That is right.

2056
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:29,680
And that's when you'll know that we succeeded, that the human race won.

2057
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:33,200
That is this was our Independence Day.

2058
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,600
Jason, will you learn to play the jug now for a few in the next few months?

2059
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:42,320
Um, yes.

2060
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:43,320
Yeah. Yeah.

2061
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:48,400
If you can help me find one, I'm sure you can learn how to do anything on YouTube.

2062
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:49,480
Yeah. All right.

2063
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:51,520
Well, that's another guarantee for the next year.

2064
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:54,080
Jason is learning how to play a jug.

2065
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:57,120
Do we do we think that it has to be learned?

2066
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:00,120
I'm sure there's a craft to it.

2067
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:01,120
There's a technique to it.

2068
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:05,200
It's maybe not the hardest instrument in the world, but I'm sure there are jug

2069
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:10,120
playing techniques that even I don't know about a jug playing aficionado.

2070
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:15,520
Should should we then in another one of these like year marking things,

2071
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:21,080
should Jason in an early episode in 2021 play the jug, play a jug at his current

2072
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:26,280
level of skill and then by the last episode of the year.

2073
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:30,120
I will find him a jug online.

2074
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:32,640
I'll get it for Christmas for him.

2075
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:34,720
And then, yeah, we'll see where you start.

2076
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:38,640
And then your jug playing is going to be so good by the time we jamboree.

2077
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:40,840
People will be very impressed at all the practice.

2078
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:44,520
I like silence.

2079
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:46,840
I like it. Just consider it all in.

2080
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:49,440
All right. Well, there you have it, folks.

2081
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:51,000
What a what a tease for this.

2082
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,120
Yeah, boy.

2083
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:56,320
What a jug playing and if and if it spittles all over us

2084
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:59,160
in the process, that'll be a OK.

2085
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:01,440
We welcome it in that instance.

2086
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:04,440
We'll love it. We're all going to swim in each other's spittle.

2087
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:07,520
We're so glad it's 2021.

2088
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:10,040
More spittle, please.

2089
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:13,680
More spittle and more subscriptions, please.

2090
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:16,920
To the second gate, but guess the ride, the second gate at

2091
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:21,080
Patreon.com slash podcast, the ride fun stuff there.

2092
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:23,200
We've already recorded and you're going to like it.

2093
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:25,200
And you're like the stuff we haven't done yet either.

2094
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,880
So much great stuff to come.

2095
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:31,760
Happy holiday. Happy Honda days, everyone.

2096
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:36,720
And join us next week on the second gate for a little more stuff.

2097
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:39,040
Little more stuff.

2098
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:41,840
How does Oh, holy night and

2099
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:46,480
the end of the night?

2100
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,800
So far, I don't know.

2101
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:53,560
And then there is a holy night is coming.

2102
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:59,960
