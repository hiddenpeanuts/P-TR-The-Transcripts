1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
This is Podcast the Ride, the second gate.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,680
Here now, Scott Gertner.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,680
Welcome to an emergency solo Podcast the Ride,

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,400
the second gate.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,640
This is actually the first ever one host only

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,720
Podcast the Ride.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,800
It's an unprecedented move, but then again,

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,440
these are unprecedented times.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,880
And if you'll allow me to explain

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,120
and get some thoughts off my chest.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,840
I've had, I'm Scott Gertner by the way,

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,160
I've had an extremely busy last few weeks.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,960
It's all good things, everything's good,

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,200
but it became imperative schedule wise

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,080
that I take one episode off.

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,880
And I discussed this with Mike and Jason

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,080
and they agreed to take the reins.

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,080
That said, I was of course aware of the risk of doing this.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,440
That by taking an episode off,

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,680
I was setting myself up and you the audience up

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,200
for an episode that was non-Theme Park related,

22
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,240
full of bizarre statements and points of view.

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,680
And of course, setting up an episode

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,040
that is a relitigating a matter and a story

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,600
that has come up on this podcast,

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,520
frankly, far too many times.

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,360
And as I checked in with Mike and Jason,

28
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,800
are you guys good on that episode

29
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,760
that you guys are just gonna do?

30
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,880
There was a smile, there was a glint in their eyes

31
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,240
that I could see over Zoom

32
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,600
because that's how we communicate.

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,640
There was a level of mischief

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,160
in talking about the episode

35
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,920
that ended up coming out earlier today.

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,000
I was beginning to smell a rat,

37
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,160
but what kind of rat would it be?

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,080
Would it be a Chukko-scented rat?

39
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,440
Would it be a Buffett-plane-scented rat?

40
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,440
And then around midnight, I refreshed the app

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,600
and along with you the audience,

42
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,600
I discovered two words staring back at me, mocking me.

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,800
And those words are of course, Casamigos tequila.

44
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,240
Now, ironically, this episode exists

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,880
because I was seeking to take some time off

46
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,440
and yet now I've created more work for myself

47
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,200
because I've realized that I need to do

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,480
some kind of rebuttal piece,

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,080
encounter to the episode that you may have heard earlier.

50
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,800
And I'd like to do that right now.

51
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Mainly, I would like to raise three primary objections

52
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,000
and there's more that I could do,

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,400
but there's three big ones that I wanna bring up

54
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,080
regarding the Casamigos episode

55
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,960
and in general, the continuing, never ceasing presence

56
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,560
of Casamigos tequila on this theme park podcast.

57
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,880
So I'm gonna discuss those three objections right now.

58
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,320
Okay, objection number one.

59
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,640
My co-hosts have time and time again failed

60
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,520
to convey to me and perhaps you the audience

61
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,520
why the Casamigos briefcase story is a good story

62
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,640
in the multiple tellings of this story on our podcast.

63
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,640
Neither Jason nor Mike has conveyed

64
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,400
why the story is interesting.

65
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,560
Is it supposed to be funny?

66
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,360
Do I hear the story where some very rich people

67
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,440
give other rich people briefcases full of cash?

68
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,120
Am I supposed to hear the story and laugh at the story?

69
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,920
What is it that makes this story worth telling

70
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,200
so many times?

71
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,760
What is it that is so great about the story

72
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,760
that it continues to thrive despite our friend Nick Mundy

73
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,160
being so bored by the story

74
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,960
that he literally unplugged the microphones

75
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,440
being used to record it?

76
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,380
Why does it continue to maintain?

77
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,280
I feel like I ask for explanations

78
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,640
of why the briefcase story is a good story

79
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,680
and what do I get?

80
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,040
I get the story told to me again

81
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,360
as if the answer is in the story itself.

82
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,560
In 90 minutes, there was no conveying

83
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,400
of why this briefcase story is good.

84
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,520
I will continue to ask for this, not just for myself,

85
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,680
but for you the audience.

86
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,520
We need to know why.

87
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,500
Why are the gentlemen behind Casamigos celebrated

88
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,540
for selling their liquor to a liquor conglomerate,

89
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,940
but the folks over at Ballast Point

90
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,940
are criticized, villainized for doing the very same thing.

91
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,720
I failed to know, but I will continue to fight

92
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,200
for answers for you.

93
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,220
Objection number two, the price point.

94
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,000
As Casamigos continues to come up,

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,040
there has been discussion of how it is too expensive.

96
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,380
Despite the perverse fascination in this tequila,

97
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,340
the big wall for my co-hosts in trying it

98
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,660
seems to be the price point.

99
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,980
When I realized that Mike had never tried it,

100
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,260
his defense was, that's a lot of money.

101
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,860
I believe at the time he said, $65?

102
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,860
I'm not gonna spend $65.

103
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,660
Then I listened to the episode that they just put up

104
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,820
and the number changed.

105
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,540
The number became $45.

106
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,860
And that was still too much.

107
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,220
Mike is self-discounting.

108
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,260
$45 is not an unreasonable amount of money

109
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,180
for a nice tequila.

110
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,480
In fact, I was just a Trader Joe's

111
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,480
where Casamigos was available on the shelf for $39.

112
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,540
That's not only a reasonable price for a nice tequila.

113
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,540
It might be the cheapest premium tequila on the market.

114
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,940
In what world is $39 not a fair price point for the,

115
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,580
I Google what other premium tequilas cost,

116
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,900
your Patron's and the like,

117
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,140
and you'll find them to be more expensive.

118
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,940
When the price is relitigated again in today's episode,

119
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,660
Jason says that he's always had an aversion

120
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,060
to spending money for comedy.

121
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,920
As if buying a $40 bottle of tequila is the same thing

122
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,780
as buying a stinky wig for a UCB sketch.

123
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,320
If you buy the bottle, then you have the bottle.

124
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,660
Then you have tequila to drink

125
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,720
and good tequila that doesn't burn.

126
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,940
And there's a lot made out of this burning issue,

127
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,780
but you know what doesn't burn?

128
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,060
Premium tequila.

129
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,400
You know what does burn?

130
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,420
Shitty cheap tequila.

131
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,400
You get what you pay for.

132
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,600
And if you pay slightly more, you know, $40,

133
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,980
the highest number in the world,

134
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,160
then you get a liquor, the tequila that doesn't burn.

135
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,080
Objection number three.

136
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,080
During the episode, Mike said the word agave several times.

137
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,460
The word is of course agave.

138
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,360
And you, the listener, deserve better than superfluous use.

139
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,400
So I made it to the end of the episode miraculously,

140
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,400
and I discovered my podcast partner's business plan.

141
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,680
Their plan to start their own podcast, The Ride Tequila.

142
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,920
And while I appreciate their consideration of me,

143
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,480
despite my absence, them wanting to include me,

144
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,480
I officially hereby reject my 20%

145
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,560
of Buenos Chicos Tequila.

146
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,200
If this 20% were handed to me in a briefcase,

147
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,440
I would spit on the briefcase,

148
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,800
ruining both the money and the leather.

149
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,320
And let me tell you why.

150
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,040
Because I have decided to take a page out of their book

151
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,040
and branch off and start my own premium liquor line.

152
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,840
["The Ride Tequila"]

153
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,300
Some of us like to play by our own rules.

154
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,380
Some of us are a little rougher and tougher,

155
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,900
and don't get stomach aches from drinking too much seltzer.

156
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,700
Some of us like different black keys songs.

157
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,840
If you're part of that, some of us,

158
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,820
grab some Mollo Nino Tequila.

159
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,460
Singular and mollo meaning bad.

160
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,080
Mollo Nino is distilled by taking premium tequilas

161
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,360
that are made by combining George Clooney

162
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,160
and the Rocks Tequilas,

163
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,560
pouring that combined tequila down the toilet

164
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,720
and replacing it with Chardonnay.

165
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,120
Mollo Nino is the only tequila that contains no tequila

166
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,760
and certainly no agave.

167
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,800
But we do add a fresh squeeze

168
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,320
of the most premium fruit there is, grapefruit.

169
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,840
Who gives a shit about grapefruit?

170
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,360
We do.

171
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,520
Mollo Nino Tequila.

172
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,240
Wait, I should tag it more.

173
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,240
You know, made for podcast bad boys.

174
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,840
Wait, made by podcast bad boys for...

175
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,920
Look, I don't know, I'm gonna sort that out.

176
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,480
Sorry, wait, sometimes it feels good to be mollo.

177
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,160
Okay, I'll tighten it up,

178
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,720
but you're gonna see that ad soon.

179
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,040
It's gonna be very well produced.

180
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,080
