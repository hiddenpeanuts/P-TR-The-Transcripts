1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,880
Warning, the following podcast contains message board madness, raving plush, text chain conflict

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,120
resolution and a very thorough yet adorable examination of Duffy the Disney Bear featuring

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,040
an interview with All Elite Wrestling's Brandy Rhodes.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,600
Aww, it's podcast the ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,720
Welcome to podcast the ride, the theme park podcast created by Minnie Mouse to keep you

8
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,860
company while you're at sea.

9
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,960
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always Jason Sheridan.

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,480
Did you have the same joke if you were to do the joke?

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,840
I have a different Duffy specific joke.

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,080
I almost joked that you were created by Minnie Mouse to keep me company at sea.

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,080
That's cute.

14
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
Why did you use that joke?

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:15,400
Well, because it's too clunky when you're doing the intro because I was like, well,

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,880
I'm Mike Carlson and then it's this is Jason Sheridan and it's like, you want to say what

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,640
the podcast is anyway, this is now clunky.

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,960
Oh yeah, because it has to be the show.

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
Why would it not be?

20
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,040
I guess we'll let sleeping dogs lie again.

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,320
That's Scott Garner talking.

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
That's correct, Ty.

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,040
And then over on this couch, returning guest, good friend of the podcast, my Shelly May

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,480
is how I refer to her.

26
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,840
You know her, Lindsay K. Ty from Teen Creeps podcast and what do you want to talk about

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
the writing?

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
Infinity Train.

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,040
I think we talked about it before.

30
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,040
We still don't know when it's coming out, but we'll just keep talking about it.

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,320
Inching ever closer to being, this is you've been in this death march of non-release of

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,240
show that you it seems like will be a wonderful show.

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,360
Yeah, death march of like waiting for it to happen, but joy march of working.

34
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,560
Oh, no. Yes. The work is not a death march.

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,640
Yeah. You've had years where Christmas never comes.

36
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,640
Yeah. Yeah.

37
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
Many years without a Christmas.

38
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
Yeah, that is what it's like.

39
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,640
Hopefully Christmas is in.

40
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,400
Or it's like I'm a mother who's just been steadily buying Christmas for presents for

41
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,040
my children and not giving them to them on a daily basis.

42
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
Yes.

43
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,400
Almost like you're just making tons of travel teddy bears, but no one goes off on a voyage

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,760
at sea.

45
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Much like that.

46
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,760
Yeah.

47
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,800
Yeah. Or imagine if I just kept creating characters in the Duffy universe and then never told anyone

48
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
about them.

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,120
I think not allowed or wouldn't make sense if you talked about it.

50
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,680
Cartoon Network won't let me yet, which is weird because Duffy.

51
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,480
Well, I was going to say we're going to get to a point.

52
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,760
First of all, we're talking Duffy the Disney bear today, which is a very important topic

53
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,080
that I've wanted to do since day one.

54
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,440
And everyone said, no, why?

55
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,480
And I said, no, we have to do this.

56
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,840
But it's actually better because now we've sort of saved up a lot of capital and it would

57
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,160
have been a weird thing to do in the first 10.

58
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
Yeah. Yeah.

59
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,000
But now now here we are.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,360
Hopefully Bill is talk about whatever.

62
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,040
If you slowly turn up the heat on a frog, they don't know they're boiling.

63
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,800
I guess that is I guess that is correct.

64
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,760
That's what we're doing to the listeners.

65
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:31,240
But I'm happy you did it post me going to Tokyo because Tokyo does help you understand

66
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,360
Duffy. Yeah, that's slightly more somewhat more and contextualize him a little bit.

67
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,800
Absolutely. Even though where you saw him was not his original home.

68
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,120
No, it's just where he has caught fire.

69
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,920
He has caught fire.

70
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,440
Real quick, though, before we launch into Duffy, there's a little show business that

71
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,640
we were just talking about via text a couple of days ago.

72
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,720
And I feel like I didn't really think this.

73
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,360
I just feel like we should talk about it now before we go.

74
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,600
I was I woke up really stressed that day and I was trying to be funny and it just got out

75
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,440
of hand. That's what I assumed.

76
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
No, I'm not trying to.

77
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,680
I just said it's good for the it's just good to sometimes let the audience in on some of

78
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,800
our so bad.

79
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,280
I haven't really seen anyone.

80
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,880
I'm not trying to shame you.

81
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,320
I'm just talking about it in a very public, recorded way.

82
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,960
To be fair to me, I said, let's talk about it on the show on the text.

83
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,760
So it wasn't like you said that.

84
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,280
Yeah. And you didn't say like, oh, no, I saw you for a little longer.

85
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,920
I only I saw Scott the other night for a few minutes.

86
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,520
But we were at a bar and I didn't want and everyone seemed like it was having a nice

87
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,000
time and I didn't want to talk about this.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,400
So we didn't have to. We felt very guilty.

89
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,920
Accords. Well, before with all that build up, Mike, explain what happened or Jason

90
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,800
would like to know.

91
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,560
No, I. Yeah.

92
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,280
Well, it's a home for days.

93
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,840
You were already called a teddy bear given to company people on a journey at sea.

94
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,880
You've gotten some fluffy.

95
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,480
I've gotten some fluffy praise.

96
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,840
I was going to say my joke is that this is the theme park podcast of happiness and

97
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,440
luck, which is a different Duffy specific.

98
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,040
That's like his nickname, essentially.

99
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,920
Go ahead with dragging my ass.

100
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,600
OK, no, I just I just want to give a little bit of a little peek.

101
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,760
So, yeah. So we were talking just because, look, Galaxy's Edge is coming up.

102
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,720
The opening is coming up.

103
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,480
We have our time. We know when we're going.

104
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,640
We're just discussing like we're obviously going to cover this on the show.

105
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,720
We're going to do show segments. Sure.

106
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,880
And so we're just discussing like how we were going to do it.

107
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,480
And we're going to be in the in the park with a bunch of friends of the show,

108
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,920
Lindsey included. Yes.

109
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,280
So it's maybe an opportunity to, you know, get some some live or right

110
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,640
right after response and such. Right.

111
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,080
So we were just sort of talking it through via text on our text chain.

112
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,800
And then Scott brought up, which I think he's brought up before, you know, little

113
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,760
loves we could have little love mics, record a little audio in the in the actual

114
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,360
park. So you brought it up.

115
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,760
Well, maybe I did. I don't.

116
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,360
I thought you brought it up first.

117
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,640
And that's why I said what I did, because I thought it was going to be a thing

118
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,520
where I was where I was like, this is one of my schemes.

119
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
So this is going to be funny.

120
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,120
Well, I had such a big reaction.

121
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,960
What are my schemes for recording the podcast content for our podcast?

122
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,240
But for doing something we have never we haven't done before.

123
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,800
It's not like it's a trademark of our podcast.

124
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,760
Trying to make an episode.

125
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,480
All right. What do we what happened? What happened?

126
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,040
Well, I think Scott's the one introduced it on the chick as he says, well,

127
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,120
I'm going to get loves, I think that might help us record without lugging

128
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,440
shit around. And I said, yeah, I have some to somewhere.

129
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,720
Let me look for those.

130
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,160
I said, like, we could end up recording like 30 minutes just standing in the line

131
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,360
with the loves.

132
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,360
And then you said, yeah, you are talking about some other stuff.

133
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,160
And then Jason says, you want to record in the line?

134
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
I think we leave all that shit in the car.

135
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,600
And then I was anticipating this because we brought up

136
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,680
what if we recorded at City Walk during the City Walk saga

137
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,880
and you flipped the fuck out?

138
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,480
That was number two crazy.

139
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
It all fair.

140
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,880
And like we didn't know.

141
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,120
We had no media contact.

142
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,600
We hadn't started the Patriot.

143
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,680
We were still, you know, in our, you know, in our infancy.

144
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,800
If we had been stripped of our right to have a Patriot,

145
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,760
we would have been caught by an 18 year old security guard.

146
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,280
We still knew still figuring out we still we had to go.

147
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,320
I concern with that. We would get yelled at at City Walk.

148
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,800
We had to go back like 10 more times.

149
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,600
This time again, I I I thought again,

150
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,320
I thought Mike was bringing this up and I thought like, this will be funny.

151
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,840
I'm responding to Mike.

152
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,040
The reaction the first time you brought when the City Walk thing came up

153
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,640
was enough that when I brought up, I did.

154
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,560
Here's my confession.

155
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,680
I had a sidebar with Mike about this before any of this

156
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,720
because I knew you were going to freak out.

157
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,560
So because the first the City Walk one went so bad,

158
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,080
the idea of recording in a setting.

159
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,160
So thus we had had a sidebar.

160
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,920
I think maybe we should record a little something.

161
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,520
I will breach it with Jason later.

162
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,720
This was the later. Yeah, right. Right. Right.

163
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,960
Jason did not disappoint because.

164
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,840
Texts within text. So, yeah, I forgot that.

165
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
Also, not to set this up anymore.

166
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,840
My response was like my second or third option.

167
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,520
Oh, well, we should hear what those are.

168
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,720
Or maybe not. You think about it.

169
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,560
So then I said I was explaining like recording line would be fun.

170
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,880
And I you said you don't want to just do it the first time.

171
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,800
Talking about going into Star Wars land.

172
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,920
And I explained like, well, I think standing outside early in Disneyland,

173
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,880
if maybe it's a nightmare, maybe it's interesting, maybe people are like,

174
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,120
you know, lining us up weird or the whole process is a nightmare.

175
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,160
And it'd be funny if we're describing that and we're

176
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,480
the listener would be on the journey with us.

177
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,120
And then Jason went counterpoint. You are wrong.

178
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,160
My first reaction, which I did not tell you, was Jesus, really.

179
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,040
Well, that's we got the message from that. Yeah.

180
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,080
So from the much harsher.

181
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,560
I like you are wrong better than I do. Jesus, really?

182
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,480
Yeah. Well, there's like a grandeur to you are wrong.

183
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,560
I didn't think that I sincerely I sincerely didn't think so.

184
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,920
And I'll tell you, Scott, I had a sidebar with Mike after that, where I went.

185
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,680
It appears I have once again spoken too quickly.

186
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,000
Like so many problems in my life I have caused.

187
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,920
Why? Whether I meant to or not being glib.

188
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,400
I think I figured all this out quickly.

189
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,960
You know, my my mom taught me back in AOL instant messenger days

190
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,040
how text can read so much harsher than you intend it to be read.

191
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,760
And I was just telling her not about this, about another thing, how that is.

192
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,120
That is true to this day with a Facebook status or a or a text.

193
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,080
You never know.

194
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,360
I think it's why it's important to air things out in person.

195
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,960
That's a counterpoint.

196
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,360
You are wrong seemed like, wow, that is.

197
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,120
But I also was loaded for bear because I knew you were.

198
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,800
I you have a you have a problem, I think, with recording in a public.

199
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,640
It less so because as Mike eventually this goes on for a while.

200
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,280
Yeah, I don't want to give away

201
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,520
because there's some other stuff in it that would give away some surprises.

202
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:29,160
But I I got once Mike and I were there the day a new ice cream place opened.

203
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,760
And it looks like fucking Errol Morris or Alex

204
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,400
Gibney was shooting a documentary, people there with so much equipment

205
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,320
to shoot like, hey, fam, this is pretty good.

206
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,160
Like it's just massive amounts of equipment.

207
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,160
I was like, oh, they might give less of a shit than that.

208
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,520
I think they do. Sure.

209
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,400
Hey, I feel you. I don't.

210
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,080
I'm not a strong man.

211
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,400
I don't want to lug a bunch of wires and shit around.

212
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,880
But that's why I'm talking about a little just the thinnest.

213
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,480
No, I and I'm I'm on, you know, I like I said, I was like, you know what?

214
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
I think I had a bit of an intense first reaction.

215
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,840
I'm on board.

216
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,960
I, you know, we'll we'll do it.

217
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,160
It'll be fine.

218
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,520
But I think I was just thinking about like the the article.

219
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,960
Still, the articles keep coming of like record crowds like, oh, yeah.

220
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,080
Police said like a void.

221
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,000
No, it's going to be insane.

222
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,280
It's crazy that we're that we're we're doing it.

223
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,600
But but like, hey, you know, it's an option.

224
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,880
It's to have the option. Sure.

225
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,600
I do have a question, Jason, which is

226
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,400
if you had to do out loud how you intended counterpoint,

227
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,640
you are wrong to be read because it was my delivery.

228
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,400
Yeah, yeah.

229
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,440
I think it was less harsh, like counterpoint.

230
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,160
You're wrong.

231
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,520
I mean, that sounds very lying.

232
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,120
You typed out in all caps, you are wrong.

233
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
No, it wasn't OK.

234
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,680
I know there was a lot of it wasn't all caps.

235
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,320
Oh, but I can see that being an interpretation.

236
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,360
I think the volume of your voice, Michael,

237
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,560
made me think it was in all caps.

238
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,640
And I was like, I think he read it exactly how it should have been.

239
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,040
I think we're all three of us given to hyperbole occasionally.

240
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,680
Sure. I do think and I'm you.

241
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,280
I'm used to your glibness in general,

242
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,240
but I will say four or five minutes you riled me up pretty good.

243
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,680
I was like, really?

244
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,880
Yeah, we both were going like, well, what do you mean?

245
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,800
But it would be we're both in a flurry.

246
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,680
I was shocked.

247
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,800
Lurie of text messages.

248
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,320
I thought the reaction would be like, oh, old man, Jason's grumpy again.

249
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,840
Like I know I was like, oh, man, I I.

250
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,600
Yeah, yeah.

251
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,240
So for me, it's because it was a sequel to the city walk

252
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
because, oh, that was a text thing, too.

253
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,800
Because I was a text thing.

254
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,960
Yeah, I said, like, oh, maybe we could record one in the in this in City Walk.

255
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,720
And then I didn't check my phone for 45 minutes.

256
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,040
And then I came back to like 70 texts with every possible reason

257
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,320
why this would have been a bad idea.

258
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,120
I've blocked that out. I remember that.

259
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,520
So yes, we've all also put our phones down at some point

260
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,560
and then come back to the other two having an hour long conversation.

261
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,040
Usually not that charged, though, usually boring logistics.

262
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,880
So, yeah, so officially on the record, we don't want to drag this out.

263
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Officially on the record, you are open to lot.

264
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,560
Jason's holding his head in his hand.

265
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,400
He is squinting as if he has a headache.

266
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,120
But I am embarrassed and I have learned my lesson.

267
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,840
Wow.

268
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,640
Geez. Well, a moment of humility, which is no, I think this was all

269
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,200
I think it all got away from us.

270
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,040
But, you know, I think my mom's lesson rings true.

271
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,760
Your mom's lesson is right.

272
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,400
I it's it is not honestly, it's not the first time recently

273
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,720
where my too brief texting style has gotten me in trouble.

274
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,760
Really? And I don't want to expound on that.

275
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,520
Oh, sure. A counterpoint.

276
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,400
You are wrong to your dad.

277
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,200
I know you won't be speaking for.

278
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,920
I know he's he's had a lifetime of the glibness and I had to get it from somewhere.

279
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,440
At least 50 percent of it from somewhere.

280
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,600
I was going through my text to try to find something indicative of mine

281
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,840
and Kelly's conversations, Kelly, my cohost for Teen Creeps.

282
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,400
We were trying to kind of tweak the description of our podcast.

283
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,920
So it's like a little more open to covering like movies and other stuff like that.

284
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,000
Maybe not just books going forward.

285
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,560
And so here's how that went.

286
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,400
I think that works. Me too. Nice. Thank you. Awesome.

287
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
I really appreciate you doing this.

288
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,640
We got each other's back.

289
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,800
We've never said that.

290
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,720
I don't think so.

291
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,080
Kelly and I are constantly texting one another.

292
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,640
I really appreciate you.

293
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,440
Not just like you doing that. I appreciate you.

294
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,160
That's very nice. To be fair to us, though, if this were doughboys,

295
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,480
it would have been Connor Point.

296
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
You were wrong. You fucking idiot.

297
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,240
That would have been on the podcast discussion of each other's dick sizes

298
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,760
and the ability to suck your own dick.

299
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,720
Dicks would have been more at play.

300
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,160
So I feel like we're in the middle as far as podcasts.

301
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,720
It's been on the table for sucking. Yeah.

302
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,800
So all right. Well, no, but look what a nice.

303
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,600
I think it ended up very, very sweet.

304
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,240
Like your text conversation.

305
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,160
You're all amenable boys.

306
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,480
It just goes to show sometimes good boys go bad.

307
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:47,400
Well, now, with that being said, that means that like tune in near

308
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,400
the galaxy's edge opening time because you may hear us live

309
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,760
in the park with some special guests or maybe not, because maybe it's

310
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,560
too stressful or not interesting or it just doesn't sound

311
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,880
or after all of this wrong.

312
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,080
Or after all of this talk, both Mike and I see somebody

313
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,040
we think is a security guard out of the corner of our eye

314
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,400
and then like panic jump and like eat the mic.

315
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,320
Again, swallow it. It's the only way out.

316
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,680
I watched someone like to go through security recently with like so much equipment.

317
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,200
I watched someone go through with like

318
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,360
cigarillos and having to assure people like, no, it's just so there's no no.

319
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,760
There's no weed. No, we didn't go to.

320
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,000
No, it's just cigarillos.

321
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,640
And I'm like, that's the kind you buy to put weed in.

322
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,600
But yeah, but like so, so much equipment.

323
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,360
I think as long as you are willing to open your bag and take it all out,

324
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
they they honestly don't care.

325
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,640
It does sound like you're more concerned about pain in the ass

326
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,440
than you are about like being caught or being a problem.

327
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,840
I think we all have different levels of tolerance for crowd.

328
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,640
Mike handles crowds best.

329
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,120
I'm in the middle.

330
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,800
And I think, Scott, you do not like crowds.

331
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,040
I'll say that. Yes.

332
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,280
I'll own that.

333
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,960
And I am kind of like, huh?

334
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,240
No crowd queen.

335
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,400
No crowd queen. Yes.

336
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,640
For filling in a queen for me. Yep.

337
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,160
Lizzie, how do you feel about do you think you've gotten better

338
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,640
being with Mike for so long?

339
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,520
Can you tolerate a crowd lover like me?

340
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,360
I would like to state for the record once again that I have been a Disney kid

341
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,480
my entire life.

342
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,440
This is not something that Mike has forced on me.

343
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
That's not what I'm saying.

344
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,880
And no, I'm just saying that I am good with crowds.

345
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,320
And it was not something that my boyfriend had to make me better at.

346
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,080
OK. I hear what you're saying.

347
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,880
I feel like I've already been owned plenty.

348
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,280
You don't have to dig in.

349
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,600
No, I just saw it.

350
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,560
I've never had a problem. I'm kidding.

351
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,880
Well, hey, crowds is a different issue, I feel, than theme parks,

352
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,320
because Mike is all you seemingly are always in a crowd.

353
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,120
If you weren't here, you're like chasing crowds.

354
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,760
I have to say I'm good with theme park crowds and very bad with concert crowds.

355
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,520
What about Comic Con crowds?

356
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,440
I mean, very bad with Comic Con.

357
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,640
Yeah, we've been in some rough crowd.

358
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,720
Yeah, I'm always fine with a theme park crowd, though.

359
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,520
Yeah. I don't know why that is.

360
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,840
My dad just trained me.

361
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,120
He's just so good at black and theme parks just blocks out

362
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,520
the surrounding like noise and stuff.

363
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,640
That's my answer. If like somebody has the knee jerk

364
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,320
where you like theme parks a lot, don't you hate the crowds?

365
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,760
And the answer is I don't pay attention to it.

366
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,920
I actually can't see past it, but I can't.

367
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,960
I can if it's a concert I really like.

368
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,320
If it's a concert I was on the fence about, I can't handle it done.

369
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,640
Cons, no.

370
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,240
The cues are so well planned.

371
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,480
And so I know that I will.

372
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,720
There's a clear route for getting to the thing

373
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,400
I'm trying to get to as opposed to Comic Con, where it's like

374
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,440
I have to throw myself into a rush of people to get to a table

375
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,480
where I then have to like try to maneuver myself to the front of.

376
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,160
So it's just like that's stressful.

377
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,600
There's no there's there are no light at the end of the day.

378
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,120
Yeah, there's no. Yeah.

379
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,120
There are no guaranteed ways to get anywhere.

380
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,480
Sort of true a little in that Coachella zone.

381
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,160
Like, obviously, there is ultimately the stage.

382
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,560
But when you're leaving, it's like I need to go be alone for two months.

383
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,200
I need to not be in a public place.

384
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,960
This is so stressful.

385
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,880
I will say this to Warren Lindsay, and you gentlemen also should go to this.

386
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,360
Bruce Springsteen just announced he wrote a full East Street Band album

387
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,640
a couple of months or two ago.

388
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,800
So there will be another East Street Band tour.

389
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,040
So prepare for the pit is what I'm saying to you now.

390
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm a less sleepy person than the last concert.

391
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,080
That's true. I'm a different person.

392
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,360
That's true. In general, or just on the.

393
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,080
Well, that's a whole. Actually.

394
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,880
OK, that's a whole nother story.

395
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,560
But long story short, we went to a Springsteen concert

396
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,480
and you were very sleepy and about an hour and 45 minutes in.

397
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,600
You were like, I got to go sit down and then cut to three hours

398
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,160
because Bruce plays, you know, a very long time, even in his 60s.

399
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,120
Cut to three hours later, you were like, well, it's the encore.

400
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,360
I better I'm going to rally.

401
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,120
We're going to do born to run. We're going to do all of it.

402
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,800
I had been standing at the back of the crowd the whole rest of their

403
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,880
or the back of the floor the whole rest of the time.

404
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,400
And I'm like, I'm coming back in.

405
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,920
I'm up as like close as possible when he's doing his speeches.

406
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,200
And I'm like tearing up at all the time where you like

407
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,200
touched his hand or something.

408
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,080
I went to a show two days before that without you.

409
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,440
And that's when I touched his leg because he's crowd surfed over me.

410
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,640
And that was very it was a religious experience.

411
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,680
Yeah. So anyway, so prepare for that.

412
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,880
We don't we have so much stuff to get to.

413
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,000
We don't need to hash out all this crowd talk.

414
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,360
Yeah, we got to get to like talking about boring.

415
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,720
We got to get to Mike's eight year long sickness.

416
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,680
You have the crowd in your brain of bears and links and

417
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240
another in the genre.

418
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,480
If we if we package these, you know,

419
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,480
if there was a mini genre within the show,

420
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,640
one might be episodes where you are so stressed out

421
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,480
because you have 40 tabs open. Yes.

422
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,080
I have to remember that at this point, there's been like

423
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,000
at least like eight or nine of them.

424
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,520
You have and I can imagine this is one stuffed animals next year.

425
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,720
Yeah. So so yeah, I'll start by Jason.

426
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,360
Somebody paint a picture of what's going on behind me.

427
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,880
There are let me do it because I don't know their names.

428
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,920
All right. Great. This three bears.

429
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,200
One is a cat. One is not a bear. It's a cat.

430
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,640
I guess I know three bears. One is a cat.

431
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,400
There's three bears.

432
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,760
The interesting thing about one of the bears is a cat and they are of different

433
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,200
variety. It's OK. It seems like the female bear.

434
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,520
And I think I know their names.

435
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,040
But let me just say the female bear

436
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,840
and the cat are normal.

437
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,760
Male bear Duffy, obviously,

438
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,480
is in a sombrero with Mickey ears on it.

439
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,400
And then there's a little bird in the sombrero.

440
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,400
The bird is wearing like a backpack or a knapsack and then also a hat.

441
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,560
Yes, that's right.

442
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,800
And they're all sitting.

443
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,120
There's somebody else in there, too.

444
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,240
Oh, I missed that.

445
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,120
Oh, and then a tiny little chef dog.

446
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,600
That's right. So proud that I remembered who that was just now.

447
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,560
I couldn't see it from my.

448
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,720
So these are Duffy's friend, Duffy and his friends.

449
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,720
Duffy and friends.

450
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
Duffy is the bear.

451
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,920
His female bear is Shelly May.

452
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,280
Can I try to name them?

453
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,960
Yeah, please. OK.

454
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,440
Duffy, boy bear, Shelly May, girl bear,

455
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,560
Jelatoni, cat bear,

456
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,040
tippy blue bird bear and Cookie

457
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,400
cook bear. That's right.

458
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,520
Very good. A gift from a listener, Cookie.

459
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,880
Yeah. Who is a Hong Kong exclusive?

460
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,240
Yes. At the moment, at the moment.

461
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,120
And where does tippy blue factor in?

462
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,320
I mean, there's probably some order rhyme or reason, but who just tippy

463
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,240
boot belong to one of them or?

464
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,120
Well, he's a bird mailman.

465
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,880
He delivers stuff. He's with the knapsack.

466
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,600
Yeah, he has a little knapsack and he's the bird mailman.

467
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,080
And he is in Cape Cod.

468
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,400
He's the Cape Cod bird mailman.

469
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,840
In case you don't know what we're talking about, these are characters

470
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,200
that are all basically plush specific Disney parks characters.

471
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,120
They don't really appear in any TV, like TV or movies or anything.

472
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,720
They appear in like shows in like Tokyo, Disney and Paris.

473
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,920
They appear on the in-room channel at the hotels.

474
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,400
They used to. Oh, is that over?

475
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,120
I think it's over because I watched it today.

476
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,480
And at the very end of that in-room loop, it says there's a whole big thing.

477
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,040
Come see Duffy at Epcot.

478
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,120
And that ended a few years ago.

479
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,160
So now they could do the story without that tag, but I'm not 100 percent sure.

480
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,920
I see. So Disney World.

481
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,640
They were on the hotel TV.

482
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,720
They were on the hotel TV.

483
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,880
You used to have the power to edit.

484
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,840
We may never know.

485
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,280
We may know.

486
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,880
There's also a bear making the show, filming it, boom, making it.

487
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,680
I mean, there's it's a long sock like Duffy has multiple origin stories.

488
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,280
Yeah. So so yeah.

489
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,360
So basically synergy being one of them.

490
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,640
The true one. The true one.

491
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,800
He yes. So basically he was into what is a 2002.

492
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,800
He was just created and he was the Disney bear.

493
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,280
His name was not Duffy.

494
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,520
He was just available at Disney World's downtown Disney once upon a toy shop.

495
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,880
And he was an exclusive there.

496
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,320
There's also word for like there were there were different color versions of Duffy,

497
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,120
but when he was not called Duffy as well, and you can find those on eBay,

498
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,280
there's like lavender, Duff, pre Duffy, Duffy for like three hundred dollars.

499
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,040
I was going to say how expensive are those now?

500
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,640
I have not been on any of them.

501
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,400
I just want to let everyone know

502
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,680
that's not on my radar yet.

503
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,600
You're busy with your beanie baby purchases.

504
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,120
Yes. I want Tabasco the Bull and Garcia.

505
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,800
I want to Mint Garcia.

506
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,120
That's what I've been looking for.

507
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,120
The tie dye bear.

508
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,240
Also, we need to do a second gate on Ty Warner, the beanie baby man.

509
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,480
Oh, really? Who created it?

510
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,360
I don't know. I hope so.

511
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,960
OK. I thought you knew something.

512
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,040
It just feels ripe.

513
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,200
I don't know. I can just get a sense that it's going to be good.

514
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,240
Just like we're going to do that Robert Earl episode eventually.

515
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,560
Oh, yeah. Sure. Sure.

516
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,840
Yes. You can just tell.

517
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,320
As long as I'm careful with my words to not slander.

518
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,280
That's true.

519
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,640
Well, I've had a lawyer listen to the Robert Earl episode.

520
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:33,240
We'll get the prosecutor from the Alki Davis case.

521
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,720
Oh, boy. Oh, yeah.

522
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,120
If you remember lots of episodes ago, the man who runs the hologram

523
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,080
theater in Los Angeles, I sort of implied that he was kind of a shady guy.

524
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,880
And I was worried there'd be legal ramifications for me doing that

525
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,600
on our podcast. People did not really listen to you at that point.

526
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,840
Anyway, that guy's getting sued for lots of money.

527
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,240
The suit is over. He is the court.

528
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,360
He owes lots of money.

529
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,600
Yeah, like tens of millions of dollars, which and he was incredibly sexist

530
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,920
during the trial.

531
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,960
Like just like you woman to the attorney.

532
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,400
He's a he's not a good man.

533
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,160
Business man, you say was acting this way.

534
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,720
A businessman whose money is it's not clear where it comes from.

535
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,000
And who owns many businesses that you've never heard of

536
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,080
that involve like CBD and also has a theater on Hollywood Boulevard.

537
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,000
This doesn't add up.

538
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,640
No, no, none of it's making sense.

539
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,120
Anyway, I have no regrets about what I said about the hologram.

540
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
The theater man anyway.

541
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,760
So yeah, back to Duffy.

542
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,840
So then in 2005 is basically or no, excuse me.

543
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,560
2004 is when they gave him his name, Duffy.

544
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,080
They gave him a sailor suit and a backstory.

545
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,920
He wasn't named until 2004.

546
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,040
Yeah, because he was a real.

547
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,640
It was a real like short run like of him in 2002 as that exclusive.

548
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,680
You know why they did this?

549
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,680
It was just why don't we have a bear?

550
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,120
Tokyo wanted.

551
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,520
Well, Tokyo, yeah, you wanted something.

552
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,360
Well, I think at the time in 2002, it seemed like they wanted

553
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,440
to get a little bit of that.

554
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,000
The old bear shine.

555
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,440
Yeah, right.

556
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,760
Yeah. Which is very funny because for a long time in downtown Disney

557
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,520
in Anaheim, there was a build a bear location.

558
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,560
So at one point in time, they were trying to sell Duffy

559
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,360
and his costumes in the park and at downtown Disney, they were had build a bear

560
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,800
with other Disney costumes.

561
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,040
And he said, so you should be building the bears.

562
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,120
Yeah. And raking money.

563
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,560
The rent money is not enough.

564
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,280
We can't trust you jokers to build these bears.

565
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,240
You're building them wrong.

566
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,720
We're building them. Yeah.

567
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,720
So 2004, they have now added a backstory and a sailor suit

568
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,760
and a sailor suit.

569
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,920
Well, very important.

570
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,720
It becomes very important to where he lives and where his prominent home now.

571
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,160
Yeah. So then then that's sort of around.

572
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,480
2005 is when they start really like

573
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,320
pumping them up in Tokyo and end in.

574
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,520
But in Florida, they were calling him my first Disney bear.

575
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,480
And it said, giving him out as the boy substitute toy

576
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,880
at the perfectly princess tea party at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort.

577
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,160
So for your son, we have this handsome boy substitute toy.

578
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah. Daddy, I love my boy substitute toy.

579
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,600
There's also around that, like they at one.

580
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,440
There's a story where it's like Duffy was brought to life by Tinkerbell,

581
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,280
which was retconned. So, yeah.

582
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,800
So Duffy has had a couple of origin stories, the first one being

583
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,640
Tinkerbell just created him out of Mickey's face.

584
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,760
So you can see Mickey like you see, like in the shape of Duffy's fur.

585
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,880
It looks like Mickey Mouse is like the Mickey or something.

586
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,840
I didn't I didn't know that the lighter part of his fur.

587
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,080
Yes. Is it is a Mickey?

588
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,000
Right. So taking her cues from the movie Face Off, she created a bear

589
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,600
in a similar way.

590
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,760
Like she traced it like Trace Off.

591
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,840
She just as many doves flying around in the process.

592
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,880
But that was boring, I guess they thought.

593
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,880
And they wanted to make something much more dynamic.

594
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
And if you didn't know what I was talking about at the

595
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,640
joke with that joke at the start, the or now still official origin

596
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,360
is that many sewed Duffy together for Mickey,

597
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,520
who is, of course, a captain, a sea captain.

598
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,920
And Duffy was made to keep him company while he was at sea.

599
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,560
Yes. So when?

600
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,640
Yeah. When did he become a sea captain?

601
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,960
This is new information to me.

602
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,840
Documented in the storybook you could buy, but also in the in room

603
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,400
hotel channel where you can watch the Duffy, the Disney Bear Bedtime Story

604
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:49,760
that plays pretty much every like 12 minutes on a loop around bedtime.

605
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,880
So I my family went down to Disney World like in 2012,

606
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,120
and we're flipping through like when we get in, you know,

607
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,600
we're flipping through the TV channels and there's the resort,

608
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,400
the loop that we love so much about everything to do.

609
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,960
And then we're like, what the fuck is this channel?

610
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,080
What is we love?

611
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,760
Our two loops. We love it.

612
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,760
That's a final four in the future. Our favorite. Oh, yeah.

613
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,800
I like 87 when Pleasure Island opened. Strong loop.

614
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,960
But then there's a loop with just this Duffy bedtime story,

615
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,360
which is a mother reading to her children this story,

616
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,400
which, as Mike has indicated, does include the the line.

617
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,240
Mickey is a sea captain, so naturally he spends a lot of time on the ocean.

618
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,200
Naturally, as you do

619
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,560
when when being a sea captain.

620
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,000
Yeah, he is.

621
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,720
Well, it seems like they're using the origin of Mickey

622
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,600
in their like narrative of Tokyo, Disney Sea.

623
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,680
So in that world, Mickey, you know, like Mickey loves the sea,

624
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,760
like his life and his love and also his lady.

625
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,640
Right. He told me that his love is the sea.

626
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,840
You can't settle down with her.

627
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,600
And so for some reason, instead, she made him a bear.

628
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,720
Yes. To keep him company.

629
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,240
And then he's a slutty.

630
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,440
Nobody's worried.

631
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,480
Well, he has his crew, but it's lonely out on sea.

632
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,720
So when he's home, sick, who's on his crew?

633
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,520
Well, never explained.

634
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,920
Probably criminals, people hiding from the law.

635
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,200
Scientologists.

636
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,440
Yes, Scientologists career.

637
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,960
Longshoremen. The master.

638
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,720
Walking.

639
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,560
Lori Loughlin's daughters.

640
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,520
Olivia Jade's out there influencing.

641
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,760
Yeah, the prisoners.

642
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,840
So yeah, so that's that was quietly his origin.

643
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,960
Now, at this point in the story, I mean, there's probably things I'm forgetting.

644
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,080
But at this point in the story, it's 2000.

645
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,320
I'm trying to think when I first go to Disneyland at 2007 or eight or nine.

646
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,720
And we all I think have a similar thing.

647
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,000
A California adventure.

648
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,520
There is all of a sudden a Duffy presence and you have signs.

649
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,200
And there is a character, a walk around character for a while.

650
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,560
And I think we've mentioned this in the show before, but everyone was saying

651
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,200
who the fuck is Duffy?

652
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,560
What? Who is this?

653
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,720
Much like Mickey being a sea captain.

654
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,320
It's just here it is.

655
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,640
You know, it's it's it felt like the we started seeing ads for Mordecai.

656
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,720
Hey, here he is. It's Mordecai.

657
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,240
What? What do you mean? I don't know.

658
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,160
I don't know who that is. We all know him.

659
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,160
Yeah. Oh, when did you all meet and get to know him?

660
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:29,000
Like have a banner that said, like introducing Duffy.

661
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
But instead, it was just like, hey, it's Duffy.

662
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,960
Want to know her?

663
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,040
And no one did. Yeah.

664
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,240
I didn't know the gender.

665
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,160
I probably might have assumed female.

666
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,760
Yeah. But and I was I had more of a curiosity.

667
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,600
I went and took a picture with Duffy and the look in.

668
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,640
I know the picture and the look on my face communicates

669
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,120
my faux excitement for this character.

670
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,280
I don't know. Right.

671
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,640
Which felt very and once you realize, oh, it's Disney's attempt at a teddy bear.

672
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,960
It feels very crass.

673
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,760
Feels like like my instinct was to to sort of poke fun at it,

674
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,800
as maybe yours was initially as well.

675
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,000
It feels very poochy.

676
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,640
Yeah. Yeah.

677
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,960
An arbitrary filling of a need.

678
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,600
Yeah. And when he's not on screen, everyone should be asking at all times,

679
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,520
where is Duffy?

680
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,840
It does seem like for a company like Disney, obviously, you know,

681
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,440
there's a lot of crass stuff.

682
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,000
There's a lot of like just Jack and Jack and a prices for things

683
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,320
for something to feel so crass really says something about the gesture of Duffy.

684
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,560
Doesn't it? Yeah.

685
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,920
Like when there's the gesture of Duffy crass. Yeah, sure.

686
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,360
Like when we go like when we go up and be like, oh, it's five more dollars

687
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,120
for a vegetable skewer now.

688
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,760
All right. But this Duffy makes me mad.

689
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,000
What is this?

690
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,080
Like for whatever reason that felt like you're forcing a thing

691
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,200
we don't know in the parks.

692
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,320
Well, screw you.

693
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,680
Like we were some might say they they make entire

694
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,920
trilogies of films that don't really need to exist. Sure.

695
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,960
It was like they were trying to inception us on level one.

696
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,080
And it's like, I'm not asleep.

697
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,400
I know this wasn't a thing.

698
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Yeah, I just try to insert this into my memories of Disney.

699
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,600
When I was five, Duffy was not here.

700
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,880
I don't need the kick.

701
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,760
I don't need the kick to wake me up out of this dream state.

702
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,920
I can wake myself out of this one. Yeah.

703
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,640
But Lindsey, go back, check your photos.

704
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,680
But Duffy's in all of them. You'll see.

705
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,200
We got here quick.

706
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,400
Get to her photos. Fucking terrifying.

707
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,000
Yeah. Oh, sure.

708
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,360
Well, with meeting Duffy and not trusting Duffy, you don't know.

709
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,040
Duffy might have like weird sort of like a reverse.

710
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,000
Back to the future. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

711
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,400
She or he, whatever it is, just appear in planet itself.

712
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,480
In your mind, we should get like we should take photos of ourselves

713
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,960
in the parks as kids and then Photoshop Duffy like it's a meeting.

714
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,000
Duffy in 1987 or something.

715
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,440
Me hugging Duffy with a Clinton Gore shirt on

716
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,680
with a Clinton Gore shirt on

717
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,440
Duffy, totally mini Nixon.

718
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,200
Clinton Gore shirt. Yeah.

719
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,880
Can I can I summarize the storybook real quick?

720
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,160
Oh, yeah. Before you go on. OK.

721
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,160
So yeah. So as you said, Minnie makes Duffy for Mickey.

722
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,160
She gives it to him right before one of his sea voyages.

723
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,240
Mickey goes on the sea voyage.

724
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,600
It is implied he has a long day of training new crew members.

725
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,200
And after dinner, he goes down to his room

726
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,720
and he's very tired and he's feeling very homesick.

727
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,560
But then he sees Duffy and he gives Duffy a big hug and he feels better.

728
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:41,920
But he has a dream that Duffy talks to him in the dream.

729
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,480
And I don't know.

730
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,880
There it is. I already tried.

731
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,200
I forgot what Duffy actually says in the dream, but I wrote down

732
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,280
I am become death, just true of worlds.

733
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,280
But that's not it.

734
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,440
So so then I do have some screen grass.

735
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,400
So the next day he wakes up and he gets dressed and he says, to this day,

736
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,000
Mickey still swears that the teddy bear smiled back at him and winked

737
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
while he's at sea.

738
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,240
So I think that that's sea madness, right?

739
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,480
He's hallucinating.

740
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,640
It's not good if your doll comes to life.

741
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,880
That's a bad thing.

742
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,640
That's a child's play thing.

743
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,600
It's not good.

744
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:25,480
And then he gets back to shore and he tells all of his friends

745
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,280
about the dream he had about Duffy coming to life.

746
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,280
And my note on that is he came back from the sea changed.

747
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,320
He wasn't the same man anymore.

748
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,920
He'd seen some real shit.

749
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,960
He'd seen some real shit.

750
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,720
They left with 20 and came back with 15.

751
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,960
And then the net, the very end, all the friends like Duffy so much,

752
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,280
they all go to Minnie and they want their own teddy bears.

753
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,560
So that's that's a bit crass.

754
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,160
That is where the crassness really hit.

755
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,560
Oh, yeah.

756
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,400
You should get your own bears.

757
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,760
You get your own bear.

758
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,080
Everyone should get one.

759
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,480
Many started charging 18.99 for them, a reasonable price,

760
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,160
and considering the quality.

761
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,320
Discounts available with annual passes.

762
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,200
You know what? Money is just energy.

763
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,000
And then the end card says, come meet Duffy at Epcot for more information.

764
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,520
Visit your concierge and down in the corner.

765
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,360
Entertainment subject to change without notice.

766
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,200
Like they still had to put the legalese.

767
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,080
The sweetest legalese ever told.

768
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:33,160
So things so we the Duffy story for at least in America before the first.

769
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:38,480
Well, we're still in the first seven years or so exists in this weird crass.

770
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,800
What what is it?

771
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,440
Is anyone biting on this?

772
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,400
Does anyone paying attention to it?

773
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,480
Don't take the bait.

774
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,280
Yeah. Right.

775
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,000
We told Japan immediately.

776
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,240
Or is there is there one day when it happened?

777
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,320
Or was it just like slowly building in popularity like a band?

778
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,040
It's known as D-Day.

779
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,760
Maybe less funny for Japan.

780
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,760
It's fair. Japan fared pretty well on D-Day.

781
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,400
That's true.

782
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,040
So yeah, I couldn't.

783
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,720
It makes it seem like everything I read, at least it makes it seem like it was

784
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,280
pretty a pretty big hit pretty quickly.

785
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,680
OK, so people like people.

786
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,760
So at the same time of us seeing it and going, what the fuck is this?

787
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,440
It's it's like catching fire because I remember.

788
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,320
So let me go back.

789
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,080
And we've told this story, I think, on the show in a brief version of it.

790
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,440
But it was Lindsey's 30th birthday.

791
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,600
And I was down at the parks with my mother and sister who were visiting.

792
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,800
And I said, you know, be funny.

793
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,840
We always talk about this Duffy character.

794
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,400
You know, we always have this joke about it.

795
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,400
What if I got her Duffy and a couple outfits and my mom and sister

796
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,040
thought that was funny or whatever?

797
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,600
And I did.

798
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,680
And I got and the outfits are still here.

799
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,000
His obviously his sombrero and what do you call this?

800
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,800
Poncho. This poncho. Thank you.

801
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,120
That's the original outfit.

802
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:07,320
And his little pit crew cars outfit.

803
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,080
Oh, it's a red.

804
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,080
It's a lightning McQueen.

805
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,160
Yeah. Reminiscent Rusty's racing suit.

806
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,800
And that was lightning himself.

807
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,160
That's what you said when you saw it. Right.

808
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,320
That's what Lindsey's always say.

809
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,480
And I gave a tour and I was like,

810
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,560
pretty sure it would be fine.

811
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,880
And you were not thrilled with it.

812
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,440
No.

813
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,640
As yeah, we talked about this on the Tokyo

814
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,480
Disneyland episode.

815
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,200
It was.

816
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,320
Just the fact that it was my 30th birthday,

817
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,360
it was sort of, you know, one of the milestone birthdays.

818
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,520
If if you would come back from the park

819
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,880
and it was just like a surprise gift out of nowhere,

820
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,080
I would have thought it was great and hilarious.

821
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,800
But when it was like, I'm really a woman now, I'm 30.

822
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,640
Is that how you were thinking of 30?

823
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,080
Oh, I'm a woman now.

824
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:15,160
Like, wow, I'm moving into my 30s, leaving my 20s behind.

825
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,560
My life is a little more on track.

826
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,920
I've had a stable job for two years now, which is

827
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,760
the longest I'd had a job for.

828
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,680
I'm in this relationship for two years,

829
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,480
the longest relationship I've ever had.

830
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,160
Were you living together now?

831
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,160
No, not yet.

832
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,440
So that so at the time.

833
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,640
So it was like a thing.

834
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,200
It's not like you just saw each other

835
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,400
every day automatically when you came home.

836
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,840
You had to make a point to see each other.

837
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,960
Yeah, we were seeing each other maybe almost every five times a week.

838
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Yeah.

839
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,080
So it was the fact that it was my 30th birthday

840
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,080
and I was getting a joke bear for my birthday.

841
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,200
He was a joke bear.

842
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,840
I will say he started as a joke bear.

843
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,680
Of course, I like to think he really warmed his way into our hearts.

844
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,960
I mean, certainly he's got a whole family on the couch right now.

845
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,760
Much like his general popularity, it just took a minute.

846
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,320
Now, I probably asked this before or we might have covered this before.

847
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,200
Was this the primary gift?

848
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,920
No. OK. No.

849
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,760
Well, in that case, if it's a supplementary gift,

850
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,520
feel like it was going to be I was probably the most excited about it.

851
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,680
So it probably took like center stage.

852
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,840
That was part of it.

853
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,160
Like I expected, like because you were excited about it being funny,

854
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,000
I just thought it was like a really good gift.

855
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,880
Everything I said makes it sound so much worse.

856
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,440
But I thought it was going to be a really good gift that I'd like is the thing.

857
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,400
It is. It's overshadowed

858
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,520
even my memory of what we did or where like we went to dinner or anything, too.

859
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,560
It's just all I can think about is 30 years.

860
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,280
But receiving this. Yeah.

861
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,400
In my mind, maybe that's all I remember for my 30th birthday.

862
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,560
Well, you know, those iPhone four photos are so blurry.

863
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,360
You can barely make them out anymore.

864
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,480
You know what I'm saying on the last episode is it was like,

865
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,240
had we said I love you yet? I don't know.

866
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,880
And then I got a Duffy bear on my 30th birthday.

867
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,160
It all ties into it, I think.

868
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,880
Well, you just said that in February.

869
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,240
It's a whole stew of it being

870
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,840
not the most thrilling present.

871
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,920
I mean, when does it get like when does a couple say I love you?

872
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,200
When does a couple give their first tiny red racing suits for a bear?

873
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,440
Joke bear. Joke bear.

874
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,560
Now, it's a joke bear.

875
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,800
The joke bear.

876
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,600
If they put that up in America, that's what they call it in America.

877
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,840
Would have made sense completely.

878
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,920
When Mike explained it to a bunch of us,

879
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,000
it brought us a lot of joy because we all thought it was hilarious.

880
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,080
Now I've had endless joy in telling this story.

881
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,120
Yeah, absolutely.

882
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,200
A lot of mileage out of it.

883
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,600
I mean, one of my favorite parts is he when I was like,

884
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,880
wow, that's very funny.

885
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,920
How did she what did she think?

886
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,200
And his something a lot of stuff.

887
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,960
She wasn't thrilled.

888
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,120
Lindsay said, counterpoint, you are wrong.

889
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:13,720
Well, that was her first reaction, which she apparently kept it to herself.

890
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:18,600
So I can't imagine opening a gift and just saying counterpoint.

891
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,960
You are wrong.

892
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,600
The only way that phrase is.

893
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,480
Mm hmm.

894
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,960
But you're this story is not now like like Jason,

895
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,160
you were just telling the Duffy origin story within.

896
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,800
And I was looking over your shoulders, seeing like the storybook panels

897
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,120
of the sweet story of many giving the gift of Duffy.

898
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:45,160
And it's funny how in reality, it was a slightly less sweet of a tale

899
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,560
or at least less idyllic.

900
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,680
But now I'm imagining this story being told just realistically,

901
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,160
but in storybook panels.

902
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,840
Well, also, the 20 page story.

903
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:58,040
What got added on top of that was me knowing how much I was disappointing

904
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,720
you by not having the reaction that you wanted me to have.

905
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,560
So then I felt bad about not loving the gift.

906
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:11,240
It was just a whole a whole stew of it not working out.

907
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,920
And I usually I feel like usually I'm pretty good with gifts, too.

908
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,320
Usually, as I said, I think you're much better than I am.

909
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,040
Thank you. We didn't need to go that far.

910
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,320
I just wanted to say at least usually I'm putting Duffy in his racing outfit.

911
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,920
If you're hearing clothing rustling, you are changing your Duffy.

912
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,040
I do think this is the superior outfit that we own.

913
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,360
I think so. But I love that little poncho.

914
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,360
So only the two.

915
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,400
We have tried to put the poncho on.

916
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,040
You can't I can't go too nuts.

917
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,320
There's other toys I need to buy. I would.

918
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,920
I would imagine also that when that was my reaction, it was like,

919
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,520
I guess I won't keep buying clothes for the bear.

920
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,560
Perhaps if you had been like very excited about it, I would have been like,

921
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,240
you know, they have a sully costume and they are from much as not the pilot.

922
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,400
Not the pilot.

923
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,840
I immediately thought the pilot as soon as I said it, you guys love making

924
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,520
so little mustache for for his in his outfit.

925
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,520
That must be a great accessory. Yeah.

926
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,160
Well, I do wish that you could.

927
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,720
I wish that you had enough costumes to change Duffy's clothes

928
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,160
every 45 minutes that we're recording this like he's a bet.

929
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,480
Miller Vegas show in a share manner.

930
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,280
Yeah, I got some cost.

931
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,200
Like this is this is a picture of four different Duffy costumes.

932
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,960
It kind of looks like those old headshots where you would have four different

933
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,400
like kooky outfits.

934
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,800
A doctor, a basketball player. Yeah.

935
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,760
Here's a Duffy 2014.

936
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,960
He's got a classic Disney year shirt.

937
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,000
There's steam, but Willie, there's Stitch.

938
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,640
There's Duffy in a vintage yellow.

939
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,360
Oh, that's great.

940
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,040
Poncho, which they, of course, don't make anymore because they found

941
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,720
it was too easy to shoplift wearing those ponchos.

942
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,640
So now they sell clear ponchos.

943
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,880
Oh, they smell. We didn't even talk about this.

944
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,960
They made us sick. Terrible.

945
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,360
Oh, we were an animal.

946
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,320
They come out. No, they're clear. Oh, OK.

947
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,960
We were in Animal Kingdom the last time we were in Florida.

948
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,440
And it was downpouring.

949
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,040
And we just were like, we should just buy.

950
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:08,960
Let's just buy him.

951
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,800
And we put him on.

952
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,960
And I think we went on Everest.

953
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,320
And we were like Everest.

954
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,600
I think we were like it was almost like you were sniffing a marker

955
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,600
and it wasn't fun or it was like a bad marker.

956
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,000
It was like opening a can of paint and then just breathing it in.

957
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,720
It was insane. I don't know. It was crazy.

958
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,600
What was wrong with if it was normal or whatever.

959
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,560
But anyway, stay away from those. Yeah.

960
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,000
Anyway. So yeah, Duffy has a lot of great outfits.

961
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,560
There are an insane amount of outfits.

962
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,320
And in Tokyo, specifically, they have them here.

963
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,080
And they're still like maybe between 12 and 20.

964
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,480
But in Tokyo, it's out of control.

965
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,800
There are merchandise events.

966
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,320
They call it Sweet Duffy.

967
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,800
It's a it's like a shopping season.

968
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,400
I don't know exactly how long it lasts, but they have introduced

969
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,480
a whole new spring collection of Duffy.

970
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,000
And Shelly May and now Gelatoni and the other characters, costumes.

971
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,720
And like they're like, especially the stuff in Japan.

972
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,920
It's like little overalls and a little cardigan and a little like polo shirt.

973
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,160
It's like it's real fucking cute.

974
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,920
Yeah. Like well-dressed dolls.

975
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,800
Well-dressed little gentlemen.

976
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,040
Yeah. Here it's more like you can dress them up like Woody from Toy Story.

977
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,080
But out there, it's like make like make them your little son.

978
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,000
Like dress them like a little boy going to picture day.

979
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,160
People take them to the park like their their seats and perches for Duffy.

980
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,040
Yes. In the park.

981
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,160
There's no. But when we were there, there's so many people.

982
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,480
There was one person with a double wide stroller,

983
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,560
which I don't know if those will be banned in Tokyo.

984
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:40,000
There was no mention of that because they're now banned in Florida

985
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,160
and California at the Duffy and a Gelatoni in there.

986
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,800
But yes, if you have your plush children, your adoptive

987
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,520
plush children, will that be OK?

988
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,800
As long as you buy your kids here, it's fine.

989
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,000
So, yeah, so it's a whole thing.

990
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,840
And so having this little guy, Duffy, in your apartment, though,

991
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,800
started me down a rabbit hole of exploration.

992
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:08,480
And I think I remember vaguely of like, do you know, this is really popular

993
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,080
in Japan, like insanely popular, like maybe more popular than Mickey is.

994
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,520
And then like this started the whole my whole fascination

995
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,600
with this whole thing and going down message boards.

996
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,000
And you say as you nervously rub your legs.

997
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,840
And that's the obsession.

998
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,160
And you are stressed.

999
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,280
I am stressed about this episode, for sure.

1000
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,240
There's too much stuff.

1001
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,760
I'm like, are we going to get to all of it?

1002
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,040
So I can't. Didn't you talk to somebody?

1003
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,760
Oh, yeah, we talked about the interview coming up as well.

1004
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,600
So I am nervous that we're not going to.

1005
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,880
I shouldn't have lit relitigated the problem with Jason at the top.

1006
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,480
That was a mistake.

1007
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,520
I can't imagine it helps to keep bringing up the whole Duffy

1008
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,240
for my birthday story.

1009
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,240
Let's tell it one more time. Here we go.

1010
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,680
I guess that. But I feel like we needed the context of you all

1011
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,080
because you were because you were witness to my madness,

1012
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,640
which is why you're here. Yes.

1013
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,960
Also, just so you know, the problem is going to get worse at that point.

1014
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,120
Well, I thought it was a fun gift for me, but much like Homer

1015
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:08,400
buying Marge a bowling ball, I guess that that was really a Michael present.

1016
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,480
Yeah, I guess that is that.

1017
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,680
I will agree with that.

1018
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,040
I should have gotten Duffy lessons from a handsome Frenchman.

1019
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,040
It's much bigger.

1020
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,600
Like in Tokyo, Duffy has like all about Eve to Mickey.

1021
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:25,360
Like Duffy was the young star, and now he's he's the draw.

1022
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,440
He's the Harrington with the wolf into the house.

1023
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:34,120
So then that is when the forum diving began.

1024
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,760
Well, yeah. So so eventually I so pretty quickly, I think I was like,

1025
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,560
did you know that Duffy has a lady bear?

1026
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,520
And she was I was like, and I was of course, the answer probably was like,

1027
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,480
no, I don't. I don't care.

1028
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,160
I mean, pretty much. Do you know that Duffy dot dot dot?

1029
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,520
And it's always going to be no with anyone.

1030
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,240
You have to turn really hard to stay away from that point on.

1031
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,440
When we went to Florida the first time, which is about five years ago already

1032
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,720
together, I mean, I called.

1033
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,840
This is just how much how willing I was to double down on a bit.

1034
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,640
I called because there was a number that said, well, if you want anything

1035
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,200
like sort of like special in your room when you get there, let us know.

1036
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,240
You know, because usually they would put like some flowers in there,

1037
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,920
like maybe a bottle of wine.

1038
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:21,880
And I said, hey, there's a bear in Tokyo named Shelly May.

1039
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,240
And I know it's not available in the US parks, but is there any way

1040
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,480
I could have that bear waiting for us?

1041
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,360
And she was like, I don't know.

1042
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:35,640
Like she was like, really not even a Disney like magic answer.

1043
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,760
Like, what a good idea, sir.

1044
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,160
I wish that we could.

1045
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,000
She was my lady.

1046
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,520
We love making dreams come true. Right.

1047
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,080
Yeah. She was very nice, but she didn't.

1048
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:51,760
And I'm probably remembering it in a much more curt way than she actually said it.

1049
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,200
But there was no like, oh, let me ask someone about that or let me see

1050
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,120
if that would be possible.

1051
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,280
We'd like to go the extra mile because also money would be involved, I'm sure.

1052
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:04,920
Like give us $200 and we'll ship a Shelly May, whatever you want, you maniac.

1053
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,560
She had both your Disney IDs open with your birth dates

1054
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,400
and was just thinking like, you got to be fucking kidding me.

1055
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,480
Too old. Yeah.

1056
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,040
If it was like for my daughter or something, they were like, all right,

1057
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,160
well, maybe we can make this happen for this maniac.

1058
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,040
They Google imaged you, saw you had a beard and said, no way.

1059
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,320
Are we getting this guy? Girl bear.

1060
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,360
Cancel his hotel reservation.

1061
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,520
Cancel all of it.

1062
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,560
He's not allowed in the party.

1063
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,560
Not let this man into Florida.

1064
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:35,320
Did you get them a wine or chocolate or something?

1065
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,000
No. Oh, my God.

1066
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,360
The end of that story is there was no nice thing.

1067
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,280
I mean, it also it wasn't my birthday or anything.

1068
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,480
Yeah, yeah. It was just like it was just a trip.

1069
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,040
We'll have plenty of wine and chocolate when we get there.

1070
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:53,480
That's just that there's waiting for us would be Shelly May would be really.

1071
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,320
I would have. Yeah.

1072
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,680
I would have been so self satisfied with that.

1073
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,160
Yeah, but there's no way it would have occurred to you to go, OK,

1074
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,560
well, then I will instead get something else.

1075
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,920
Can I get you something else nice like that adults would want?

1076
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,320
No, I got to go click.

1077
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,400
I'll just go to fucking Publix on the way in.

1078
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,000
I do. I do remember that first trip we went.

1079
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,920
We were at the one of the all star resorts and we went straight to the cafeteria

1080
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,560
because I wanted to try a rainbow dessert.

1081
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,840
That was a big deal. That rainbow cake at the time.

1082
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,160
Jason, I think I've been texting.

1083
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,960
I was like, you know, I'm going to it's our first stop there.

1084
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,240
We're going to check out that rainbow.

1085
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,120
You were only staying there for one night.

1086
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,920
Yes. Before you went somewhere else.

1087
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,280
The famous rainbow cake of Ot 14.

1088
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:39,120
The hotel pop century, where I immediately kicked my suitcase

1089
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:43,320
and then spent the whole rest of the trip limping around Florida.

1090
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,720
Oh, my God.

1091
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,240
I have very bad luck when it comes to going on vacations.

1092
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,600
Yeah, you got injured and you got injured in Tokyo episode.

1093
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,040
Yeah, you bruised your back.

1094
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,120
Yep. In Tokyo.

1095
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,080
Forgot my meds.

1096
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,760
Yeah, you can go back and listen to that.

1097
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,840
That is it for the Yakuza. Yeah.

1098
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,360
I was just drug smuggling.

1099
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,400
It didn't work out.

1100
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,960
What's that for two weeks?

1101
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,440
Did the other Orlando trip? Did you get sick?

1102
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,480
No, it's sort of what goes.

1103
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,080
What tends to happen with me is the first time I go anywhere,

1104
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,240
I either get lost or I injure myself.

1105
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,880
And then all the times after that are fine.

1106
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,560
OK, so that the other Orlando trip was not.

1107
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,680
No, everything was fine.

1108
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,440
Just don't go to a place for the first time ever again.

1109
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,080
It's just know that I will hurt myself. Right.

1110
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:32,800
So, yeah, so so I recall then like Duffy providing hours of entertainment for us.

1111
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,120
I would make Duffy dance to house music.

1112
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,960
I recall doing that a lot.

1113
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,080
There's a really good video that.

1114
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,720
Oh, we should post that. We have to post.

1115
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:42,480
Yeah, yeah. You have a.

1116
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,040
Yeah, because you have to admit that was fun.

1117
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,800
That was a funny thing that I did.

1118
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,200
It was just I was crazy.

1119
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,320
You have to. Got a counterpoint, Lindsay?

1120
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,040
If it had only not come on my 30th birthday.

1121
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,120
Everything after this has been fine.

1122
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,640
Everything's fine now.

1123
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,400
All right. Everything's good.

1124
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,960
I am in this relationship of my own free will.

1125
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,520
Don't send any like hidden signals to the listeners that they need to save you

1126
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,640
or anything. That's really hard on a podcast.

1127
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,360
I'll just start going.

1128
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:16,360
We were those sounds a signal Lindsay was sending or is that you adjusting the mic?

1129
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,480
Oh, that's the listener.

1130
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,080
You'll never know.

1131
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:23,240
Why did it sound like dot dot dot dash dash dash dot dot dot?

1132
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,160
So, OK, so boards.

1133
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,560
Yeah, we get to the message boards.

1134
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,440
And here's what I'll say.

1135
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,400
I won't. I really thought about how to sort of talk about this.

1136
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,000
I won't say what boards they are.

1137
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,080
I won't announce any user names,

1138
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:45,200
but I got very deep into looking at the Duffy message boards.

1139
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,680
Specifically, it was about Duffy.

1140
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,160
And this is already I was looking at these posts.

1141
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,200
These posts are six years old already.

1142
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,480
A lot of them, some of them predate that because you were reading these

1143
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,800
when I was still in my old apartment before we moved in together.

1144
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,200
Yes, I think many a night we would be going to sleep

1145
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,240
and I would be on my phone scrolling through.

1146
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,280
You talked about this the first time we hung out proper in 2014.

1147
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,480
That was my big. Yes, that was my big sell.

1148
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,720
I was like, you know,

1149
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,800
there are these four I got up my sleeve.

1150
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,920
Yes, how weird I am.

1151
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,040
We were either at the park or like at an improv practice.

1152
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,760
And you were explaining this to me.

1153
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,640
And I feel like you came in beaming like, guess what?

1154
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,720
I found the fun with real audio like Mike, just an

1155
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,280
continuous run of saying these message board posts.

1156
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,680
It is comforting at a birthday party.

1157
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,080
It has been.

1158
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,120
I mean, these are a real find, but sorry.

1159
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:44,400
Yeah, no, I was just going to say it has been in a decade of change

1160
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,560
for both personally and for the country in the world.

1161
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:52,360
It has been a comforting constant to the 20 teens.

1162
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,560
I'm assuming even more so for you.

1163
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,560
Because you know them by heart.

1164
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,760
Sure. Yes, I would agree with that.

1165
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,560
I also forgot that Duffy is named after Duffel Bag.

1166
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,720
What? We just figured that out.

1167
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,000
Yes, we just. Yeah.

1168
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,040
After all that sweet shit. Yeah.

1169
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,400
It's Duffel Bag. That's what it's.

1170
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,880
Yeah. Mini presented it in a go in your duffel bag on the trip home.

1171
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,840
It's not named after Troy Duffy, director of Boondock Saints.

1172
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:24,200
I really wanted it to be named after Troy Duffy, director of Boondock Saints.

1173
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,520
So anyway, so there's a there's these message boards.

1174
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,640
And I have and I did this like five years ago.

1175
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,840
I screen shotted some of my favorite

1176
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:40,800
posts because this was a very active board and people.

1177
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:45,920
And this is mostly Americans and mostly people that were sort of upset

1178
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,240
with Duffy not being embraced by the American audience.

1179
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:54,200
And I I love this so much.

1180
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:59,400
Because it's also like it was actually now funny is reading these now

1181
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,920
is that I I see myself more in them than I did then.

1182
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,800
A little bit like, yeah, you crass Americans.

1183
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,080
Back then, it was like I didn't have a podcast about theme parks where I,

1184
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,640
you know, we had a deep dive on anything like that.

1185
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,080
And it would just be like, ah, this is funny.

1186
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,280
These people, they they're so silly.

1187
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,880
They like these things, these insane things so much.

1188
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,040
This is crazy. They haven't been talking about this for an hour straight.

1189
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,280
Right. We've already been in an hour.

1190
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:35,160
You laughing at these people doing this became the first thing

1191
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,160
that you started to collect,

1192
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,080
like the first weird thing that now is your thing.

1193
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,720
That's interesting. Maybe. Yeah.

1194
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,800
I guess like McGruff.

1195
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,120
I mean, I know all your other bullshit, whatever.

1196
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,080
That's fair. And Buffett Duffy and Buffy.

1197
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,920
Duffy. That's an idea.

1198
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,000
You need a teddy bear that looks like Jimmy Buffett.

1199
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,480
So, OK, OK.

1200
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,000
So that is amazing.

1201
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,560
Mark, the companies have not come up with a free idea for them.

1202
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,400
Yeah. So let me get let's get to this.

1203
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,800
OK, there's there's there's a few posts here and I'll skip a lot of this.

1204
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,720
There's a whole section of postings about how people don't understand

1205
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,400
and there's a backlash against them for carrying their bears around.

1206
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,280
And there's a backlash.

1207
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,440
Yeah, it's great. Remember that.

1208
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,200
Yeah, it's like I'm starting to get flack from friends and family

1209
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,520
about bringing Shelley places and taking pictures.

1210
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,880
They bring up how I'm 21 and why do I like to bring a teddy bear with me

1211
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,120
and take photos with her?

1212
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,920
I also like to hold her so she can see and not put her in a duffel bag.

1213
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,840
Has anyone else experienced this?

1214
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:45,240
And then there are just posts of people saying, yes, I have experienced this.

1215
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,680
And then there's like a post with somebody.

1216
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,800
This is one of my favorites, just that says, my parents don't support it.

1217
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,560
And it's like it's like it's crazy.

1218
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,440
It's just over and over again, everyone like it.

1219
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,000
Some people like a lot of people have a sense of humor about it.

1220
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,400
There's one person that said they bring the bear to the biker bar

1221
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,200
that her boyfriend and her go to and that everybody likes it

1222
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,560
because they dress duffy in a little leather jacket.

1223
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,880
That's nice. And that's like so it's not like every like.

1224
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,360
So anyway, so you're like we got a sense, especially back then, of like

1225
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,720
these people obsessed with Duffy and especially not knowing all the Tokyo

1226
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,240
context, it seemed extra crazy.

1227
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:29,600
But here, let me get to the the club, the special club,

1228
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,200
which I think you know what I'm talking about.

1229
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,240
Yes, I do.

1230
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:37,640
So someone on this board, they wanted to organize

1231
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,800
what they call the Duffetier Creators Club.

1232
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:48,480
And they wanted basically to encourage art to be created,

1233
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,920
inspired by Duffy and his friends.

1234
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,800
So I'm going to read some of this post.

1235
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:58,360
It is very long and just stop me when I've been too annoying.

1236
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,480
OK, so this person says, so I've been noticing two things for a while now

1237
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,280
and haven't had time or focused energy to do anything about it.

1238
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,520
I still really don't yet. But a break is in sight.

1239
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,400
First off, we've got a lot of new people.

1240
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,920
That's a lot of untapped talent and energy.

1241
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,840
Second, buying stuff, especially Tokyo Disney Cape Cod Duffy stuff,

1242
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,240
is fun and supports Duffy.

1243
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:23,680
But I'm a little worried we're becoming too consumer without enough creator.

1244
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,520
So here's some motivation.

1245
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,080
Starting with Halloween and running through Sweet Duffy 2014,

1246
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,000
which is the merchandising event,

1247
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,240
folks who actively contribute truly impressive fan creations

1248
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:40,960
to the Duffetier community will get a gratuity rate of just 20 percent flat.

1249
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,880
Now, I think what that is, is that there was some sort of buying program

1250
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:48,320
where somebody in Japan would buy merchandise for you.

1251
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,000
And they're saying that you can get a discount on this

1252
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,600
if you do high quality Duffy related art.

1253
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,120
I'm confused by the economics of all this.

1254
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,800
Well, it's not clear in this post also.

1255
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:04,480
So like the person going to Tokyo Disney buying Duffy stuff

1256
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,920
would have a charge on top of that for their troubles. Right.

1257
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,800
But the discount is just bringing that charge down to 20 percent.

1258
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,840
So who knows what the initial charge? Right. That's unclear.

1259
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:20,560
I'm sure that was in a different post, which I think is is not important.

1260
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,040
This might be the person that is in charge of that.

1261
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:27,640
But they're saying that basically in service, getting a promo code.

1262
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,600
Yes. In service to making Duffy a bigger presence in the world,

1263
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:36,680
you will get a bit of a discount on whatever you'd like to buy from Japan.

1264
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,400
Now back to the post.

1265
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,800
Just a cute photo will not be enough.

1266
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,040
You'll have to do a photo story with high quality photographs, great lighting,

1267
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:49,760
settings, compositions, costume and props, professional quality.

1268
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,360
You'll need a good camera and they'll have to be made into a book

1269
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:56,520
with something like MixBook so that we can all order one.

1270
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,720
Really high quality calendars would work too.

1271
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:03,440
Maybe through Zazzle. If you're a good illustrator, let me know.

1272
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,600
I have two stories that need to be illustrated by good.

1273
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,120
I mean, at least as good as the US storybook, although the Tokyo Disney

1274
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:15,000
sees style or your own original, but equally detailed style is even better.

1275
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:19,200
Illustrators might make calendars to and post on DeviantArt to help promote

1276
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,400
Duffy in that thriving community.

1277
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,760
I will say just to interrupt for a moment and not go on a tangent

1278
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,120
is I am disturbed at how much more of this language I understand now,

1279
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,400
like sweet Duffy and Tokyo Disney and DeviantArt and

1280
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,160
and what they mean by like putting a book together.

1281
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,680
Right now, which is like what you were saying.

1282
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,760
One might say you went clear.

1283
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,560
There's a lot of parallels between Duffy and Elrond Hubbard

1284
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,200
now that we're really thinking about it.

1285
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,320
Sure. Boats for one, sailor suit.

1286
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:54,400
Boats for one, sailor suits for second, cult for third.

1287
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,520
Well, that's why I was saying to when I was looking through all these,

1288
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:02,000
I was I was much more like, oh, I'm like one step away from this person posting.

1289
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,520
Like we need more Batman 66 toys in these toy stores.

1290
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,680
I want an egg. I want an egghead toy.

1291
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,800
OK, we tell won't make an egghead toy.

1292
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:15,240
I need all iterations of the Ninja Turtles in figure form.

1293
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:15,920
Yes, that is.

1294
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,320
There's a super seven is going to remake all the Ninja Turtles.

1295
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,200
And I'm like, I want wing that I want screw loose.

1296
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,600
I want like I'm exactly like this person.

1297
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,880
And now I can see it with a little perspective.

1298
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,200
Oh, you have the time. We're like these fucking nuts.

1299
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,720
Right. You eased our audience into this craziness.

1300
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,720
And now you've got an army backing you up.

1301
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,960
Exactly. So a Navy. This goes.

1302
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,760
I got it. There's so many things.

1303
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:46,920
OK, so so that goes through it goes on a couple more paragraphs of different ideas.

1304
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,360
And then this is my favorite sentence.

1305
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,280
I will be the final judge of quality.

1306
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,000
How could I forget my favorite line?

1307
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,240
Perhaps your first attempt is good, but not good enough.

1308
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,640
You'll have the opportunity to revise and improve.

1309
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,960
We have to start doing more.

1310
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,720
We have to start doing worse.

1311
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,440
We are letting Duffy down.

1312
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,960
Yeah. So I want to know is I will be the final judge of quality.

1313
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,080
All caps or no? No, it's not all caps.

1314
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,600
How all these years?

1315
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,640
I thought it was all caps.

1316
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,080
Well, it was the delivery. Yeah.

1317
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:20,760
That's what it means.

1318
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,000
It's reads harsh.

1319
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,160
You know, like Jason's a little bit of Jewish.

1320
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:29,400
Edwin looked at me just then like I had offended him. Yeah.

1321
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,800
I will be the final judge of quality existing is like a I mean,

1322
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,960
that's a meme worthy phrase.

1323
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,800
I will be the final judge of quality.

1324
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:42,960
Take your favorite villainous screenshot from your from your game of thrones.

1325
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,360
Oh, yeah. Star Wars or your Jafar or what have you.

1326
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:47,880
Be creative.

1327
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,720
And guess what? I will be the final judge of quality.

1328
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:55,880
I put this to the listeners, create that storybook of Mike

1329
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,440
giving me Duffy for my 30th birthday.

1330
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,880
I know that's I will be the final judge of quality.

1331
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,920
Oh, man, I did want to make that request.

1332
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,560
I just seen that one seems like a lot of work.

1333
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:11,840
That one seems like we have a 20 percent commission has to be more.

1334
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,960
We have to do more for Lindsey.

1335
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,320
Do more for the podcast.

1336
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,640
I would check these every once in a while and there would be new posts.

1337
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,760
And in this specific thread, somebody started to make

1338
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,920
art of Duffy and I'll show you this.

1339
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:31,160
And it's Duffy and there's a snowman and he's got his little winter coat on

1340
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,400
and a scarf and it's very cute. Yeah.

1341
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:39,760
And the the person who made the first post writes that they love it.

1342
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,640
The colors are beautiful.

1343
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:44,600
In case you actually want some constructive feedback,

1344
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:48,360
I'd say Duffy's hands are too small.

1345
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,800
Duffy doesn't have elbows or wrists.

1346
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,440
He doesn't have joints or bones.

1347
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,880
There shouldn't be a difference there.

1348
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,640
The arms should just round out.

1349
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,840
The same is true of the legs.

1350
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:03,240
And Duffy doesn't have ankles.

1351
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,600
And I mean, this is just a fact.

1352
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,640
And the legs are a bit too long and wide.

1353
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:12,320
Also, while Duffy has a round bottom, he doesn't really have hips

1354
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:15,000
and definitely doesn't have a waist.

1355
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,840
And there are four or five, six more paragraphs.

1356
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,240
You know what? There's more context for this now, too,

1357
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,600
because they're changing the design of Sonic.

1358
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:27,920
Oh, yeah.

1359
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,040
Sonic definitely doesn't have human teeth.

1360
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:35,440
The entire world did that to an actual movie production.

1361
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:39,160
Now, if they if there was a Duffy movie and they give Duffy human teeth,

1362
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,160
I certainly would not stand for that.

1363
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,640
It would be hearing from me.

1364
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:46,320
I would be the final judge of quality.

1365
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,320
The whole world is just posts now.

1366
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,200
The whole world is just message word posts.

1367
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,440
Look at our president. He never stops posting.

1368
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,240
I find this innocent that it was this madness was contained

1369
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,480
to the Duffy message board in 2014.

1370
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,440
And we thought it was strange.

1371
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:03,360
And then so so after this person post another version of it,

1372
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,920
that's honestly to me looks about the same.

1373
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:11,240
This the the creator of the post writes, Wow, the legs and hips

1374
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,400
are now perfect in both weight and length.

1375
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:16,080
And by length, I mean, short stubbiness.

1376
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:21,000
The torso still feels a bit too long and seems kind of extra stretch now

1377
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,200
because the legs are so perfect,

1378
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,480
but isn't necessarily something you'd redraft for.

1379
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,520
Just maybe consider for the next one.

1380
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,840
Duffy's right arm, which was too long before, is now also perfect.

1381
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,320
And you totally nailed the bend.

1382
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:39,400
And then I kid you not, there are about 12 more paragraphs.

1383
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:45,280
Oh, to discuss this children's style picture of Duffy making a snowman.

1384
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,040
And we don't have time for all of it.

1385
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:51,160
And this person just keeps taking the notes and like make.

1386
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,040
And I'm like, what's going on?

1387
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,400
Doing revisions? Yes.

1388
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,480
What? She's turning around new.

1389
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,720
Yes, she's turning.

1390
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:01,360
I believe the original poster at some point in response to concerns

1391
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:05,000
about their their rules and regulations did say like, well, everyone

1392
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,080
to each your own abilities, you know.

1393
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,480
Yeah, I think that that does appear somewhere.

1394
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,320
If you're not good enough, I will allow mistakes. Yeah.

1395
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:15,720
Yeah. If you're dumb or something, but otherwise,

1396
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:20,080
but I will need to see a report card from your latest year of schooling.

1397
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,040
Even that, though, felt like they were annoyed that people like,

1398
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,080
well, clearly you've misunderstood me.

1399
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,440
Like, so you have made it yet another mistake.

1400
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,440
I have the grand reveal at the end of this was that this is all

1401
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,440
exchanges between like mother and daughter.

1402
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,840
Oh, mother and son.

1403
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,880
You just know it'd be mother and son.

1404
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,040
Almost there, dear.

1405
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:47,080
This is a Munchausen, but by proxy situation, it is really fun situation.

1406
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:48,640
Yeah.

1407
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,720
But for Duffy drawing.

1408
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,640
For Duffy, yeah.

1409
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,040
I've seen people post their

1410
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:01,840
like fan art when they started out and then later years

1411
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,360
and then what it looks like now.

1412
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:07,080
And it is really fun to see that like, oh, they really kept at it.

1413
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:10,080
Like these people are not going into animation.

1414
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:15,200
They're just doing fan art of other shows and they come really far.

1415
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:16,720
Oh, yeah, sure.

1416
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,640
So I wonder what this person's art looks like now.

1417
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,600
They may be making like

1418
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,720
just incredibly detailed paintings of Duffy and Shelley May or making snowmen.

1419
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,360
And what if I work with them?

1420
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,400
It's very possible.

1421
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,640
What if they work on Infinity Train? I don't know.

1422
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:36,840
Do any of your any of your animators know how to perfectly draw bear hips

1423
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,000
or the lack thereof?

1424
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,040
Or can they get the bend just right?

1425
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,840
Can they get the bend just right?

1426
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,080
Well, you'll you'll keep.

1427
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:48,120
They hear the phrase wishlist, they shutter sweet Duffy,

1428
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,360
lock themselves in a closet for two hours.

1429
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,560
But there's not pleased.

1430
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,120
They get a check with the suggestion.

1431
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,520
You know, they have the suggested tip amount percentages on the bottom.

1432
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:03,240
They see 20 percent gratuity and they just start sweating like, oh, no.

1433
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:05,640
Can we make it 19?

1434
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:06,480
Please make it 19.

1435
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,760
So so there's OK, so I'm just jumping around here.

1436
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:14,280
There there was a thread here when Duffy was so at a certain point,

1437
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:18,240
Duffy went away from California Adventure as far as being a walk,

1438
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,920
like a character you could take a picture with.

1439
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,400
Yeah. And they still have Duffy in the parks.

1440
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,440
But like he was his presence was being drawn back clearly

1441
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,520
because it was just not working.

1442
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:31,520
And this one person on the board was very a lot of people,

1443
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,480
obviously, very upset about it.

1444
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:38,000
And then this person shined in saying that the thread of people commenting

1445
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,080
was really demonstrating what a poor job was done introducing Duffy

1446
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,360
to the American public.

1447
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,600
If people had been presented with Duffy's charms,

1448
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:47,880
if the actual backstory had been told effectively,

1449
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,160
if Disney fans understood the artistic sincerity

1450
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:54,640
and creative integrity that defines Duffy in Japan,

1451
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,520
there would be no question of Duffy's Disney pedigree

1452
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,800
and history making significance.

1453
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:04,920
Sadly, he has been handled like a commodity instead of a force of nature.

1454
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,240
And many have responded with disinterest.

1455
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,400
It's not Duffy's fault, though.

1456
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,480
Duffy will always be legendary.

1457
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,480
Duffy is unstoppable no matter what happened in the US.

1458
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,920
Duffy is pure Disney, transcendent.

1459
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:26,160
So that the US team failed to convey that is a genuine disappointing shame

1460
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,400
that Disney that Disney fans would rather be dismissive,

1461
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:33,800
which I guess this person would think we were being very than educate themselves

1462
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,880
is truly their loss.

1463
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,120
It's all very unfortunate and very sad.

1464
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:44,040
Like this should be given as a monologue for theater students to do in class.

1465
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,480
Very well written.

1466
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:51,360
It is so dramatic and builds and has tension and an arc.

1467
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:58,200
Yeah, sort of start like you reasonable step into the logic pool before it gets

1468
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:01,160
extremely a streetcar in desire.

1469
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,200
But like what of the backstory

1470
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,560
do they think was not conveyed?

1471
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,560
That's the thing we were trying to figure out.

1472
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,480
History making significance.

1473
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,360
What are what are you talking about?

1474
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,360
Mickey was a sailor.

1475
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,960
Did they say Mickey had a crew?

1476
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,040
Say the part about him having a dream.

1477
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:25,600
Yeah, we I think that was especially without seeing it in Tokyo,

1478
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,320
which doesn't in Tokyo, it's still not like he has some rich backstory.

1479
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:33,760
It does help to see the reaction in Tokyo

1480
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:39,480
because like reading this in the vacuum of America, California adventure,

1481
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,520
we were baffled.

1482
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:46,320
But then when you go over there and you see everybody buying stuff

1483
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:53,160
and there is a live show with Duffy while you eat it, it's like, OK, this exists.

1484
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:57,160
Whereas when we're reading it here, it may as well be just the rantings

1485
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,560
of crazy people about something I've never heard of.

1486
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,840
Yeah, it's crazy. It's in Japan.

1487
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,160
It's fun and cute.

1488
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,440
And there's a culture around it.

1489
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:08,960
And of course, the American interpretation is Rorschach's Journal from Watchmen.

1490
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:13,440
It would be exactly that.

1491
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:19,080
It would be like if you just like went to somebody who had never heard of Disney

1492
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:22,000
and you went, look at this mouse.

1493
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,280
And they were like, OK, like, no, you don't.

1494
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:29,560
OK, so like there is a history

1495
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,200
making significance to this mouse.

1496
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,480
Like what you don't understand is that.

1497
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,360
So the first time you see him, he's on a steamboat.

1498
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,480
OK, it's on a steamboat.

1499
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,160
So like, OK, there's this man.

1500
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,760
His name is Walt Disney. He came up with him and.

1501
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,480
And then he just like changed everything.

1502
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,440
He was on a train. He had an idea on a train.

1503
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,680
I don't know what you're talking about.

1504
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,240
You would think that person was crazy.

1505
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,360
But the mouse is a cipher because he's on a steamboat,

1506
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,680
but he's also a sea captain.

1507
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,400
And sometimes he's a ghost hunter.

1508
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,040
Sometimes he's the mayor of Toontown.

1509
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:04,400
Sometimes he appears with his girlfriend who will never marry.

1510
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:08,720
And so you'll see him in a lot of different outfits.

1511
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,600
Does that sound like someone we know?

1512
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,280
He has two dogs in his life.

1513
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,960
What is his pet dog? What is a dog man friend?

1514
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,360
He has an exact double, but you don't find out about him until 1990

1515
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:22,120
and know it doesn't stay important.

1516
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:27,320
So so, yeah, we're saying like that, like we really didn't get it.

1517
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:31,160
But seeing in Tokyo and going there and then learning all the friends,

1518
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,840
it is different now.

1519
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:36,720
And it's almost like I do sort of see what they're saying on the boards about,

1520
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:40,760
oh, it is kind of cool that they're this is only like a thing in the parks.

1521
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,320
It's obviously like a big part of the culture.

1522
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:46,040
And then it's like now I look for even in our American parks,

1523
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,680
like a gelatoni little bag somebody's carrying.

1524
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:53,160
Yeah. Like if you see a little keychain on somebody's bag

1525
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:56,840
or they have a Duffy backpack, we'll both be like Duffy backpack.

1526
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:00,600
Yes. And like more obscure Duffy character, the better for pointing out.

1527
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,040
It gets very exciting. Sure.

1528
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,280
So it is interesting.

1529
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,960
Our arcs with Duffy.

1530
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,360
So, you know, before we finish this, there's more message board.

1531
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,240
We have an interview with somebody because we're trying to find

1532
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,920
like a true Duffy super fan.

1533
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:18,680
And yeah, we felt so now we're going to pair this person with that.

1534
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:25,280
Is it of like understanding the legend, having your own relationship with him?

1535
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,680
Yeah. What is it?

1536
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:30,120
What is a functioning American Duffy fan like? Right.

1537
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:33,840
And also, I was trying to say that before, though, is because, look, we have all of

1538
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,640
I have all of them. So I am a legit Duffy fan.

1539
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,760
Well, not all of them.

1540
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,960
Not all of them. Excuse me.

1541
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,440
I don't see the bunny.

1542
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,160
Don't press on the wound.

1543
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:46,440
I just say I know a couple.

1544
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,600
Yeah, you're missing out.

1545
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,760
We have to take a trip to Hawaii. Yeah, that's all we do.

1546
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,160
Only for that.

1547
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,960
Stella Lou. Go to a store and turn around.

1548
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:59,440
So on Twitter, I noticed Brandi Rhodes, who is a professional wrestler.

1549
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:04,680
She's a chief brand officer of AEW Wrestling, which is coming soon to some TV.

1550
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:08,280
And there's a big event at the end of May at the end of this month

1551
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:10,240
in Las Vegas called Doubler Nothing.

1552
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:14,000
She is constantly posting photos of Duffy and his friends

1553
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,640
in various places in their house.

1554
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:19,000
Like, I think I saw her post like on airplanes.

1555
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,720
She's bringing Duffy with.

1556
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:24,880
So we reached out and she was gracious enough to talk to us.

1557
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,720
Not about wrestling, not about wrestling.

1558
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:29,200
This should say like AEW is one of the biggest things

1559
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,800
to happen in the world of wrestling. Yes. Years.

1560
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:36,800
We just talked to her about Duffy and her relationship with Duffy

1561
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,800
and the universe. She doesn't want to think about work.

1562
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,480
Yeah. Yeah. So here we go.

1563
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,240
So, folks, we are joined today by a very special guest.

1564
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,520
She's a professional wrestler.

1565
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,640
She's the chief brand officer for all elite professional wrestling.

1566
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,480
And most importantly, she's a huge Duffy super fan.

1567
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:57,520
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show. Brandi Rhodes.

1568
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:01,640
Oh, yeah. No, I was I was really excited for once for somebody

1569
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:04,000
want to talk to me about Duffy the Disney bear

1570
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:06,040
as opposed to wrestling.

1571
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,520
So, yeah, I get to be on.

1572
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,400
Yeah. So, yeah, we're thrilled to have you.

1573
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,560
Is it safe to say you've done a lot of press lately,

1574
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,800
but this is the first Duffy specific interview that you've done.

1575
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,760
This is the first Duffy interview I've ever done.

1576
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,640
Oh, like, so I'm I'm I'm happy for humanity in this point,

1577
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:26,560
because most of the time when I talk about Duffy, people ask me, who is that?

1578
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:32,600
So it's starting to grind my my gears a little bit.

1579
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:36,720
But so I'm really glad that I'm starting to come across people

1580
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:40,160
who understand the Duffy fandom and appreciate him.

1581
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:44,680
Yes. We're one of our missions on the podcast is to spread more Duffy awareness.

1582
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:48,640
So that is part of our beautiful, beautiful.

1583
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,400
So so, yeah, let's start.

1584
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:51,600
Let's start at the beginning.

1585
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,280
Where and when does your Duffy fandom start?

1586
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,440
So my Duffy fandom started two years ago

1587
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:05,040
at DisneySea in Tokyo, and it actually started off as a patron.

1588
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,560
I went to the park for the first time and I saw all of these people

1589
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:15,280
decked out, I mean, babies, kids,

1590
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,200
service animals, adults.

1591
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,800
Everybody was decked out in Duffy gear.

1592
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,840
And I mean, like from Duffy

1593
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:27,920
gloves to the Duffy hat to Duffy puppet,

1594
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,480
full sized Duffy dolls, Duffy George.

1595
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:35,000
And I was just getting angry because, you know, I'm kind of a Disney purist.

1596
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,640
Where was Nicky? I was so confused.

1597
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:38,600
And I was like, why?

1598
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,560
Why is there no representation of Mickey Mouse here?

1599
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:42,760
This is kind of nuts.

1600
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,720
So I ended up looking into it while I was standing in one of the lines,

1601
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:49,800
because I know, you know, people are familiar with DisneySea.

1602
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,760
You're always in line there.

1603
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,720
There's no way to avoid it.

1604
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,720
And so I started looking into the story and how,

1605
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:03,240
you know, Duffy was invented for the Japanese audience, not for us.

1606
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:10,320
So me being kind of the that person that you can always take as wanting to be

1607
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:15,040
different in some kind of way, immediately my heart started to turn

1608
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:20,560
because I realized I could take Duffy home and he could be for me and not all

1609
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:25,360
the other kids running around the park at Disneyland and Disney World in the

1610
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:29,880
States. So I got, you know, immediately when I got on line, I went into one of

1611
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:33,480
the Duffy stores and I got a Duffy puppet.

1612
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:38,320
My thinking in doing that was that the Duffy puppet would, I would use it to

1613
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,520
play with my dog.

1614
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:42,360
And that was history.

1615
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:47,040
Now I have a lot of Duffy stuff, but I have all of the puppets for all of the

1616
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,480
friends as well.

1617
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,760
It's a situation over here.

1618
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:56,400
So you have not only like all of the plushes of Duffy's friends, but you also

1619
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,600
have all of the puppets as well.

1620
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,320
Is that what you're saying?

1621
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,160
No, I just have the puppet.

1622
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,560
I don't have the plushes.

1623
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,240
I don't want the plushes.

1624
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,080
Oh, interesting.

1625
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:09,680
I just want the puppet because that was my original thing.

1626
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:14,080
So I feel like if I were to get the plushes, I would, I, there would be some

1627
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,240
lack of authenticity on my end there.

1628
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,960
But, you know, as far as like other Duffy things, I mean, I have like Duffy

1629
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:25,240
backpack, I got the Duffy mittens, I got Duffy jewelry, I have a Duffy purse.

1630
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:30,760
I got Duffy coming out every nip and cranny of this house, except for the actual

1631
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:31,280
bear.

1632
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:36,840
Do you have the limited run Duffy Chuck Taylors they made?

1633
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,560
Uh, what, what are these?

1634
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,120
Where are these?

1635
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,880
How do I acquire these?

1636
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,840
The classic Converse shoes.

1637
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,280
I knew nothing about this.

1638
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:52,320
So now I'm going to be, as soon as we get off the phone or maybe while we're on

1639
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:57,080
the phone, I'm going to maybe just hit this speaker and we'll get off on Duffy

1640
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:57,920
Chuck Taylor.

1641
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:58,680
I mean, that's fine.

1642
01:20:58,680 --> 01:20:59,480
Oh my God.

1643
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:03,840
My other favorite Duffy specificity or oddity.

1644
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:07,560
Did you ever ride in the Duffy Disney transportation bus?

1645
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,640
No, I've never seen it.

1646
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:17,240
Now I've seen the, the Minnie Mouse ones that we have here in Orlando and that

1647
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:20,200
one I'm, I've been jealous of because I want to be in there.

1648
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,320
But so in Tokyo, they have Duffy buses.

1649
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:24,560
Yeah.

1650
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,560
I think, I think that may also have been a limited time one.

1651
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:29,160
Oh man.

1652
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:30,560
That's a bummer.

1653
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:30,960
Yeah.

1654
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,480
No, I never, I've not.

1655
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,680
Now I'm getting jealous.

1656
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:35,640
Yeah.

1657
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:40,600
Feel free to browse, feel free to browse for merch while we're talking.

1658
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,240
It's okay.

1659
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:47,600
So, so do you have, so, so there's a lot of characters now, a couple of years ago,

1660
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,200
it was just Duffy and then Shelley Mae, and now it feels like we're getting a

1661
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,360
new character every three months.

1662
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:57,280
Do you have a ranking, an official ranking of your favorite characters or is it

1663
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,800
all, are they all equal in your eyes?

1664
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:00,560
Oh no, not at all.

1665
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:06,680
So all of my, all of my, my characters, they're, I'm very childlike with them.

1666
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,840
I'll say they all have different personalities.

1667
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:11,480
They have different voices.

1668
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:17,960
They're nothing like what you read in the story books about Duffy and his friends.

1669
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:25,120
So Duffy himself is kind of like a little bit hood, but he's a little bit

1670
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,640
of a G and a little bit like of a smooth guy.

1671
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,560
So he's kind of smooth.

1672
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:36,720
Whereas Shelley, she's a little bit more, I don't want to say anything,

1673
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:43,480
this is too crazy, but she's a little more like your typical city girl.

1674
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:49,360
So like, she likes to shop, she likes to go shopping, she likes to go to

1675
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:53,440
the mall, she likes to go to the mall, she likes to go to the mall, she

1676
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:59,040
likes to shop, she likes Louis Vuitton, she loves the Mac store, that's her thing.

1677
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:07,680
And then Stella, she's true to the fact that she's a dancer, but she's also a

1678
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:14,000
devout Christian and she likes to talk about Christianity a lot and how blessed she is.

1679
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:21,200
And then Jelatoni is French and he always speaks with a French accent

1680
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,400
and he's just a ladies man.

1681
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:23,640
Right, of course.

1682
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:28,080
Which he is Italian, I think, in the canon, official canon.

1683
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,560
So he's French in your narrative.

1684
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,480
Yeah, I totally blew that.

1685
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,200
No, it's okay.

1686
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:38,400
I know, I love, what I think is interesting is that if you go on, like I have for years

1687
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:43,160
now, the Duffy message boards, there's specific Duffy message boards and a lot of

1688
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:47,560
people have, because there's not so much story out there, have created their own

1689
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:51,520
narratives, which will lead me into this question, which is very controversial, I

1690
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:56,480
think on the message boards, are Duffy and Shelley Mae a couple?

1691
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,800
Are they lovers or are they just good friends?

1692
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:01,560
In my world, they're a couple.

1693
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,400
Shelley is his girlfriend.

1694
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,320
I see that.

1695
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,160
Absolutely.

1696
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,760
Yeah, I like that better, but there's people on the message boards that want to keep

1697
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:12,040
their love pure and make it sure it's just between friends.

1698
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:15,840
So I think that that, and there were like people arguing against it.

1699
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:20,400
So I think in the Duffy community, there's a lot of contention about, but look, that's

1700
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:23,160
the fun of Duffy is you get to choose your own adventure.

1701
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,640
I think that's sort of what I feel.

1702
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:25,320
Yeah.

1703
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:25,800
Yeah.

1704
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:33,720
I feel like that's part of the fun in Duffy being not such a US match is that I

1705
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:39,200
can kind of make him whoever I want him to be to people when I'm introducing it.

1706
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:39,560
You know?

1707
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,200
Oh yeah.

1708
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:40,480
For sure.

1709
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:45,520
I, when I first, I first bought Duffy for my girlfriend years ago, and it was a

1710
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,040
little bit of a bit, it was sort of to be funny.

1711
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:53,280
And then, and I would make him dance to like EDM music for like five minutes.

1712
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:58,480
So I think my Duffy, he started out as more of a raver, but now he's a

1713
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,680
little bit more domesticated.

1714
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:03,800
Do you think, I guess this is a question for both of you.

1715
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:08,960
Do you think they would do a story where Duffy and Shelly may get married?

1716
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:14,600
Because Mickey and Minnie famously have never been married, but Duffy and Shelly

1717
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:18,720
I feel like there's less history there where maybe they could get away with that.

1718
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:22,560
They could certainly sell a lot of outfits of, you know, a little tuxedo and dress.

1719
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:29,040
I don't really know because I think you kind of run into that once they're

1720
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:33,760
married, then what, you know, then are they going to have a little Duffy, you

1721
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:34,480
know, babies?

1722
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:39,120
And then we got a lot of, we got a lot to think about if they decide to get married,

1723
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:39,720
you know?

1724
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:40,360
Yeah.

1725
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:41,360
I don't know.

1726
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:46,320
I think I'm cool with them just having, you know, their happy domesticated

1727
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:49,360
relationship without taking it too far.

1728
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,760
Yeah, I agree with that.

1729
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:54,480
Cause I think also like, you know, with Jim and Pam on the office, once they got

1730
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,480
married, you sort of run out of some narrative possibilities, I think.

1731
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:01,400
So you kind of want to keep the possibilities, I think, alive for the two

1732
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:01,920
characters.

1733
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,240
So that's my official stance.

1734
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:04,600
Yeah, I agree with you.

1735
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,720
I feel like that as well.

1736
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:06,000
Yeah.

1737
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:06,760
Thank you.

1738
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:07,720
I'm glad we're in agreement.

1739
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:11,240
Let's talk clothes real quick.

1740
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,960
There's another controversy on these, these message boards.

1741
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:18,120
Some people dress their Duffy's in build a bear outfits.

1742
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,400
Do you think that's okay?

1743
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,440
Or are you against that?

1744
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,760
Uh, I, I mean, that just depends on who Duffy is to you.

1745
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:31,960
Is Duffy, you know, your Walmart guy or is Duffy your Neiman Marcus guy?

1746
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,360
For me, he's Neiman Marcus.

1747
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:38,720
So he wouldn't be wearing, you know, build a bear Walmart, you know, I'm

1748
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:39,120
sorry.

1749
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:47,480
Now I do have a Yoshi doll from build a bear that is wearing a figure skating

1750
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:49,680
outfit because I used to be a figure skater.

1751
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:55,200
I'm totally okay with that, but I don't think I would be okay with Duffy wearing

1752
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,160
a build a bear skating outfit.

1753
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:57,840
Sure.

1754
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:01,880
So if there was, but if there was like, maybe if Neiman Marcus started their

1755
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:06,560
own like high end build a bear, would you take clothes from there maybe and

1756
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,880
put them in, put them on Duffy?

1757
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,160
I don't, I don't think so.

1758
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:15,640
I think, uh, there's just some things that you, you gotta keep keeping that

1759
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,880
right frame of mind.

1760
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:23,160
Like, um, you know, if you've got a bunch of authentic Louis Vuitton bags,

1761
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:27,560
you can't go get a knockoff and set it on the shelf with them.

1762
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:28,040
Got it.

1763
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,200
Because you know, maybe somebody else doesn't know, but Susan always know.

1764
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:32,120
Right.

1765
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:32,440
Yeah.

1766
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,880
I'm not being true to myself here.

1767
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,400
Yeah, no, I hear that.

1768
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:35,680
Yeah.

1769
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,800
So yeah, keep it.

1770
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:37,440
I get it.

1771
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,440
I totally agree.

1772
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:39,880
Um, too.

1773
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:44,280
So, yeah, we were talking a little bit before about, uh, how it's expanding.

1774
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:48,560
So, you know, they have always at Olu now is a turtle is in the Duffy

1775
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:52,040
universe, who's a, he's an exclusive to Hong Kong.

1776
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,720
No, excuse me.

1777
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:56,120
He's exclusive to the Alani resort in Hawaii.

1778
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:59,240
Cookie, the dog who makes waffles is exclusive to Hong Kong.

1779
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,840
Do you have Cookie or Olu yet?

1780
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:05,280
Or are you, do you have any plans to visit and go to these places and get the

1781
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:05,760
characters?

1782
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:13,440
So I didn't know about Olu, but I know about Cookie and, um, I have some real hope

1783
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,720
about, uh, going to Hong Kong, hopefully sometime this year.

1784
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,920
And, uh, the Cookie is absolutely on the, on the radar completely.

1785
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:27,000
But you know, Olu sounds like a great reason for me to go to Hawaii.

1786
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:32,280
So now that you've opened this, you know, can of worms up, the first thing I'm

1787
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:33,440
going to do is get off the phone.

1788
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:37,120
And, um, after I finished looking at merchandise that I'm going to order,

1789
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:42,560
that's Duffy, then I'm going to start looking at, um, take it to, to Hawaii to

1790
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:46,880
book a trip so that I can meet Olu for sure.

1791
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:47,720
Great.

1792
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:48,000
Great.

1793
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,240
I'm glad we're doing, we're doing the Lord's work here, spreading the word about

1794
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:51,680
these characters.

1795
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:51,840
Yeah.

1796
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,920
And I'm just going to tell, I'm just going to tell my husband, like this all

1797
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,360
spawned from this conversation.

1798
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:00,880
So when you start to get like eight tweets from him, just ignore them.

1799
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:01,280
Okay.

1800
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,200
We'll just block him from our account.

1801
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,320
So we won't even see it.

1802
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:07,200
Just block him, just block him, mute him, whatever.

1803
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:07,600
Sure.

1804
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:12,400
Um, so I, we have one listener question and then we'll wrap up.

1805
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:17,280
Um, this is from our listener, Matt Cardona, AKA Zach Ryder.

1806
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,240
Uh, he has a question for you.

1807
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:24,040
His question was, how can you take Duffy to universal?

1808
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:27,600
Which is, I think is a specific question he might know, like he's, has

1809
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:28,400
experiences.

1810
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,440
I think he's upset that you've taken Duffy into a universal park.

1811
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:32,760
Oh man.

1812
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:39,040
So Matt, Matthew Cardona, really hilarious story, by the way, the first time, um,

1813
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:44,200
Cody and I hung out with him on a, uh, a Disney trip.

1814
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:48,640
Um, we, we meant to went to meet him at the hotel and he had said, yeah,

1815
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:52,040
everything's under my name, but we're driving into the resort.

1816
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:54,480
We had stopped and we asked, who are we coming to meet?

1817
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:57,000
And he said, yeah, we're going to meet him at the hotel.

1818
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:58,640
And he said, yeah, we're coming to meet.

1819
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:02,680
And all I knew his name was Zach Ryder.

1820
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:10,160
So I almost got denied at Disney getting in because I didn't, I knew his name was

1821
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,760
Matt something, but I didn't know it was Cardona.

1822
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:16,880
So we had, we had all kinds of drama from the beginning.

1823
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:20,760
So that, that gives you a little bit of what our relationship with Zach is like.

1824
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,280
Um, but yes, Zach formented me.

1825
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:28,280
I posted a picture at, um, outside of Hogwarts a couple of weeks ago, holding

1826
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:30,920
Duffy up, um, in front of the castle.

1827
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,400
And, uh, Zach freaked out about it.

1828
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:36,120
He does not like the cross brand at all.

1829
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,520
He thinks that's disgusting.

1830
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:41,840
Um, and you know, I, I do think it's controversial, but sometimes you've got to

1831
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,040
do, you got to have a little bit of controversy.

1832
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:47,480
I mean, you gotta have a little bit of fun, you know, he immediately

1833
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:53,040
texted me and asked me if I was, um, not from the United States because he,

1834
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:57,160
says constantly that people who are from other countries are the ones that do

1835
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:59,040
this and that they don't know any better.

1836
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:03,240
And so he, he was very, very upset with me, very angry.

1837
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:08,600
And, um, I plan on bringing Duffy when we go to, um, Halloween Horror

1838
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,800
Nights this year too, so he's going to be really mad.

1839
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,280
Oh, well, you know, I think I'll be honest.

1840
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:16,000
I think he's wrong about this too, because it's like going to, you know,

1841
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,360
a Rolling Stones concert and you wear an Aerosmith shirt, that's kind of

1842
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,040
the cool move to do actually.

1843
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,320
I kind of agree.

1844
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,080
I kind of agree.

1845
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:26,000
It gets people talking like, Oh, Hey, what's that?

1846
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:26,840
Oh, Duffy.

1847
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:27,480
Oh yeah.

1848
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:28,520
I forgot about that.

1849
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,240
I, I am all for it.

1850
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,920
I think Duffy can go anywhere.

1851
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:35,160
I think you may be pushing it a little bit.

1852
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:36,040
If you're wearing.

1853
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:38,480
Universal.

1854
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:39,680
That might be a little bit much.

1855
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:43,800
If you're wearing your Harry Potter robe at a Disney park, that's a little bit

1856
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:48,240
much, but if you just got Duffy hanging off the top of your, your bag, I think

1857
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:49,160
it's okay.

1858
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:49,840
Sure.

1859
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:55,280
I'm sure we'll, we'll have this argument for her months on end and then I'll do

1860
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,880
something else that makes them super angry.

1861
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:57,160
So.

1862
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:03,680
If you're taking Duffy to Halloween Horror Nights, I would need at least a Duffy to

1863
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:05,480
make it through Halloween Horror Nights.

1864
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,240
Oh, come on.

1865
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,120
Halloween Horror Nights for everyone, man.

1866
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:14,000
You know, Zach used to hate Halloween Horror Nights.

1867
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:18,680
He, he was scared of them going and I made him go and now he loves it.

1868
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:21,320
Now he acts like it's his thing when it really was mine.

1869
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:22,360
Oh, okay.

1870
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:23,680
Yes.

1871
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,000
This is the same situation with me.

1872
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,760
I recently have gotten into the haunts, so now I will be going to the Horror

1873
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:30,680
Nights, so I'm, I'm very on board now.

1874
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,360
Um, well, I was.

1875
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:33,480
Now you gotta bring your Duffy.

1876
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:34,080
Oh yeah.

1877
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:34,840
No, I'll bring him.

1878
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,800
I've brought him to different places before.

1879
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:41,040
Uh, I was going to say also to make Zach mad, maybe you bring like a

1880
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,880
minion doll to Disney World.

1881
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,080
Oh my God.

1882
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:47,160
He would, he would get so, so offended.

1883
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:49,840
I think he wouldn't even want to walk around together.

1884
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,040
Like he'd be that angry about it.

1885
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:55,920
Or maybe like try to feel it and throw it away or something.

1886
01:32:55,960 --> 01:33:00,920
Like he's very, very vindictive in these such an angry person to love

1887
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:03,360
Disney, like Happy Park, you know?

1888
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:08,960
You know, there is one thing that I want to say about Disney here, uh, in the

1889
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,200
States is man, they really showed up.

1890
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,120
He no love whatsoever.

1891
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:17,160
He has one meet and greet at Epcot, like once a year.

1892
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,320
I've every time I'm there, he'd never had, he's never out for a meet and

1893
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:20,560
greet.

1894
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:21,520
I think it's terrible.

1895
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:22,960
Yeah, I agree.

1896
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:26,360
Uh, he used to be out here because we're in California and he used to have a

1897
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:28,960
little meet and greet spot that that, and that's just gone now.

1898
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:31,760
So you can still buy him, but yeah, you can't.

1899
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,720
It was a California adventure on the pier.

1900
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,200
Something's gotta happen.

1901
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:38,840
And do they still have Oswald at California adventure?

1902
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,520
He's hanging around.

1903
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:40,880
Yeah.

1904
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:44,280
But less, it's the less of a chance of seeing him.

1905
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:48,000
It used to be, you'd always see him out and now it's less of Oswald, I think.

1906
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:53,960
I saw Oswald one time and it was, um, where I was kind of on the fence of like

1907
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,480
getting behind Oswald.

1908
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:58,000
Like I was thinking maybe, maybe I'm an Oswald fan.

1909
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:00,560
And then I walked into the park and there he was.

1910
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,520
And I went running towards him cause I wanted to get a picture and he left.

1911
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,360
He just waved at me and left.

1912
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:10,640
And I thought to myself, Oswald, how many people do you actually have out

1913
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:14,240
here that give a damn that you can turn me away like this?

1914
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:16,000
So that was it with me and Oswald.

1915
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:17,120
Like we're not friends anymore.

1916
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,240
I made the change that day, that moment.

1917
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:21,720
No more Oswald.

1918
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:26,280
That happened to me with some of the three caviaros said it still kind of burns me up.

1919
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,120
Hurtful.

1920
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:30,520
It's very hurtful.

1921
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:31,160
Yeah.

1922
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:32,280
No, for sure.

1923
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:33,080
So, okay.

1924
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:37,080
So yeah, to sum up down with Oswald up with Duffy and friends.

1925
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:38,680
Yeah.

1926
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:42,920
So we will say thank you so much for joining us Brandy Rhodes.

1927
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,920

You guys have anything coming up?

Oh, I have no idea what you could be referring to, but, but obviously yes.

1933
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:07,520
We have a huge show, May 25th at MGM Grand Garden Arena.

1934
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,720
Um, I think it's sold out.

1935
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,040
No, obviously definitely sold out.

1936
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:15,560
Um, but, uh, you know, it's going to be a super great time.

1937
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:18,280
Um, check out all elite wrestling on Twitter and Instagram.

And if you want to check me out, I'm the Brandy Rhodes on both Twitter and Instagram.

1939
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:23,600
Awesome.

1940
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:23,880
Yeah.

1941
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,680
Uh, I will be at double or nothing.

1942
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:26,600
It's going to be very fun.

1943
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,800
I have a, I have a feeling it's going to be fun.

1944
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,480
Uh, I was at all in as well.

1945
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:31,600
Uh, very, very fun.

1946
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:36,960
So I implore everyone, every Duffy fan to attend if they can or watch on TV or a

1947
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,320
streaming service of some kind.

1948
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:39,000
Yeah.

1949
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:39,960
Oh, absolutely.

1950
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:45,840
So yeah, again, thank you so much for doing this and we will, uh, uh, mute

1951
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,800
your husband and also yell at Zach Ryder for you.

1952
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:49,640
Please.

1953
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:51,040
Oh, you guys made my day.

1954
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:52,040
Thank you so much.

1955
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:58,800
Well, thanks to Brandy, uh, Brandy Rhodes for just talking to us about

1956
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:05,560
Duffy the Disney bear and honestly, like, I was so happy to hear about like the

1957
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:08,320
narratives about her Duffy's and stuff.

1958
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:14,120
Like I, I couldn't, our dog, our dog is having a nightmare on Lindsey's lap.

1959
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,960
Oh, and now he's surprised and embarrassed just like me.

1960
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:22,480
Uh, yeah, I think Brandy's, uh, relationship with Duffy is like a lot of us.

1961
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,120
We all have our boundaries.

1962
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:28,240
We all have our like, uh, tastes with popular culture.

1963
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:31,800
Like, uh, but I think honestly, and it's a thing that you see on these message

1964
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:36,000
boards is that the fact that Duffy and his friends don't have such a specific

1965
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:41,440
personality is fun because I've created my own narrative in my head about Duffy

1966
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,080
and his friends and obviously she has as well.

1967
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:46,400
And I think that is a very common thing among, uh, Duffy, Duffy

1968
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:47,720
collectors around the world.

1969
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:48,360
You have.

1970
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:49,920
You always do with your dolls.

1971
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:51,120
Yes, it is.

1972
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:51,760
It is true.

1973
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:55,080
I mean, one always does with one.

1974
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:56,320
No, me specifically.

1975
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,280
I heard what you said.

1976
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,360
We, let's read back the copy.

1977
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:02,360
My dolls had very complicated relationships.

1978
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:09,440
My, uh, Duffy was in ED, he liked to dance music and he would regularly dance to EDM.

1979
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:12,160
Um, I used to do that as a kid.

1980
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:15,120
My sister and I would take the dolls and they would, we would give them like

1981
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:18,440
different weird person at like bar or bar and her Barney doll would be like, uh,

1982
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:19,280
I guess we thought it was funny.

1983
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:22,120
Like he'd be a drunk or whatever, but that's, we were kids.

1984
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:25,320
We didn't know that was a weird thing to do.

1985
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,160
Like we go in like her, uh, Fisher price kitchen and like, I give them like a

1986
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:34,920
non, like a nonspecific bottle and you'd be like, oh, like that would be funny for

1987
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:38,960
us to do a regular game of mine as a kid was pretending that I was showing up to a

1988
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:43,680
bar and getting drunk because my husband was sleeping with his secretary.

1989
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:45,640
How old were you?

1990
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:47,640
11.

1991
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:48,720
My goodness.

1992
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:51,080
You weren't familiar with this dynamic.

1993
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:58,200
Me and my friend would basically perform a dramatic improv scene of me showing up

1994
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:03,720
to their bar to complain about my horrible husband cheating on me.

1995
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:06,280
Geez.

1996
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:08,880
Lydia and I were both big Turner classic movies.

1997
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:14,400
In the fourth grade, apparently I told my mom that my favorite movie was sunset

1998
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,040
Boulevard.

1999
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:16,240
Oh my God.

2000
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:16,720
Oh wow.

2001
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:17,360
Third grade.

2002
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,480
That's like Jason said that third grade too.

2003
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:24,120
I remember watching that at a very young age on TV and being excited because I

2004
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:27,960
knew it was like a big thing because of the great movie ride.

2005
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:32,880
It was like in the queue or in the montage or something.

2006
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,720
I knew I'm ready for my closeup.

2007
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:35,040
Mr.

2008
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:35,400
DeVille.

2009
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:39,560
And you dreamed about coming out to LA and ending up face down in Norman

2010
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:40,320
Desmond's pool.

2011
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:46,000
I wanted to go to the poker game with all of the ancient silent film stars playing

2012
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:46,160
it.

2013
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:47,800
And then yes, ending up in the pool.

2014
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:50,360
So we'll talk a little.

2015
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:55,040
So anyway, so there are now how many totals Duffy characters.

2016
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:55,800
There's Duffy.

2017
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:56,640
There's Shelley Mae.

2018
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:58,080
There's Jelitoni.

2019
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,440
The Italian painter cat.

2020
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:01,640
There's Cookie the dog chef.

2021
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:04,400
There's Tippie Blue the bird brain to mailman.

2022
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,080
Olu the turtle.

2023
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,200
Turtle loves to play his ukulele.

2024
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:10,040
Turtle who loves to play his ukulele.

2025
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:12,600
And Jelitoni uses melted ice cream.

2026
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:14,200
Uses his tail to paint with.

2027
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:14,960
That's right.

2028
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:16,120
Dips it in melted ice cream.

2029
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:18,320
And then Stella Liu, who's a rabbit.

2030
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:19,240
She's a dancer.

2031
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:20,800
She's also a ballet dancer.

2032
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:24,280
Well, I think it's kind of neat that they're releasing them.

2033
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:24,680
So many artists.

2034
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:25,560
Yes.

2035
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:25,920
Yeah.

2036
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,760
Encourages artistic expression.

2037
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:32,640
I think it's neat that these characters are in different.

2038
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:37,920
Some of them are like park exclusives to Hong Kong or out Lani or whatever that you

2039
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:41,600
have to go travel to meet them or to get them.

2040
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:43,560
Now is that a little crass?

2041
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:45,960
Like what's a way we can trick people into coming to the parks?

2042
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:46,600
Potentially.

2043
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:48,200
But also, like, I think we.

2044
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:49,800
People love exclusivity.

2045
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:50,520
Yeah.

2046
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:54,440
And we keep coming back to this, whether it's it's Rex or whatever.

2047
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:58,760
Like somebody you have to go to a place to say I think that's why we love park

2048
01:39:58,760 --> 01:39:59,800
specific characters.

2049
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:03,840
Botanica is like you can only meet this person in this place.

2050
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:09,720
So there's this collect them all type mythology to the Duffy characters.

2051
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,920
It's not unlike the sea.

2052
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:17,320
I feel like the mythology of see these these Disney explorers is like encouraging

2053
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:19,320
people to travel the world.

2054
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:21,200
Don't just stick to the American parks.

2055
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:22,200
Go to all of them.

2056
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:23,480
Is that more money for us?

2057
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:23,920
Yes.

2058
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:26,480
But you could also view it as like as we both went.

2059
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:31,080
We went to Japan and experienced lots of other cool stuff like perhaps lured by Disney.

2060
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:35,360
It's like encouraging people to be world travelers in general.

2061
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:35,880
Yeah.

2062
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:39,360
Sail the seas as Mickey did with Duffy.

2063
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:41,160
They tricked us into getting culture.

2064
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:42,000
Yeah.

2065
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:42,560
Yeah.

2066
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:43,520
All right.

2067
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:45,720
We better do some culture while we're there a little bit.

2068
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,160
It's going to have like robots in it, though.

2069
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:48,040
Yeah, for sure.

2070
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:53,760
So look, if I don't there's no way to post all of these screenshots.

2071
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,520
I'm just going to find one of our favorites.

2072
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:59,840
One of the old favorites Lindsay and I had was when greatest hits.

2073
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:05,160
And I mentioned this a little bit with Brandy talking about Duffy and Shelly May's

2074
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:06,040
relationship.

2075
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:09,600
This might be my favorite.

2076
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:10,080
Oh, boy.

2077
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:13,720
And I'm having trouble finding the exact quote I know that's in your head right now.

2078
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:15,960
And there it's a boyfriend girlfriend scenario.

2079
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,800
Well, it's funny you should ask that.

2080
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:24,400
OK, so because insert phrase that's in my head right now.

2081
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:30,200
Well, all I know is the phrase is that somebody a lot of people are very adamant that

2082
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:34,720
Duffy and Shelly May are not lovers, that they are just it's platonic.

2083
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,520
They have their perfect love.

2084
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:39,440
Their love is a perfect love.

2085
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,160
Is a perfect love, but it's platonic.

2086
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:43,120
It is nothing romantic or sexual.

2087
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:48,880
There's a poll on the message board of OK, Duffy's relationship to Shelly May.

2088
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:49,600
What do you think?

2089
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:52,520
And there were four different choices.

2090
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:56,480
And I will go around the room and we'll all decide what we think each.

2091
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:01,680
Sweethearts, brother, sister, which that's I didn't even.

2092
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:05,520
Anyway, just friends or other.

2093
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,400
This is like the Jack and Meg White debate.

2094
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:09,360
Yes, it is.

2095
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:10,320
It's exactly the same.

2096
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,560
Oh, just as cool as that.

2097
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:19,480
So, Jason, I'll start with you in your mind, in your narrative of Duffy

2098
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:21,880
and Shelly May, what is their relationship?

2099
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:26,200
Well, I I think it's all very wholesome.

2100
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:31,320
So I think sweethearts like that sounds right to me.

2101
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:33,800
Imagining them sharing a milkshake.

2102
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,160
But sweethearts can lead to sex.

2103
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,440
Well, look, wherever that milk starts with a milkshake,

2104
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,800
who knows where it goes from there?

2105
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,280
Wherever that milk leads boys to the yard.

2106
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:47,520
I'm just saying wherever that milk, where that milk, you know,

2107
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:52,200
look at Archie, look at how Archie started in the early 20th century.

2108
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:54,400
And look at fucking Riverdale now.

2109
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:59,840
I mean, my God, they're singing milkshake on the top of the fucking Pops

2110
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,040
chocolate shop. You can't watch it.

2111
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:03,280
It's too unwholesome for me.

2112
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,360
Duffy Dale. Duffy Dale.

2113
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,240
Soon they're going to be fucking teens and fucking.

2114
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:11,480
You know, I got to say, because I when they first introduced Stella Liu,

2115
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:13,960
I had a bad feeling about her.

2116
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:16,520
Seems like a little bit of a home record.

2117
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,480
Wow. I got to say.

2118
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,360
So slut shaming.

2119
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,280
Stella Liu.

2120
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:22,360
Not slut shaming.

2121
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:24,960
I'm saying like, I don't know.

2122
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:29,400
I feel like I feel like Shelly May was going to, you know,

2123
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:33,480
their friend who hasn't been introduced yet, who's a private investigator.

2124
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,880
Like, can you poke her like nothing official?

2125
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:37,520
But can you ask around?

2126
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:40,280
She just showed up.

2127
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:42,120
She showed up in town.

2128
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:43,560
She just showed up in town.

2129
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:45,560
Who shows up in town in Riverdale?

2130
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:46,560
Huh?

2131
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:49,520
Stella Liu shows up in Riverdale.

2132
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:52,200
No, this is like this is like a mystery story.

2133
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:52,720
Oh, OK.

2134
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:55,240
I think it was a direct line to Riverdale.

2135
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:57,560
There is lots of mystery elements to Riverdale.

2136
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:58,840
So that probably happened.

2137
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:01,000
Like Sherry Blossom shows up with Cheryl Blossom.

2138
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,760
Cheryl Blossom, excuse me,

2139
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,800
probably shows up with like a briefcase full of cash at some point.

2140
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:06,880
Sure.

2141
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:10,520
So your answer is really other sweethearts that could lead to more.

2142
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:14,720
Sweethearts and what people do on their own time is their own business.

2143
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:15,280
I'll say this.

2144
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:17,160
The thing that keeps me up at night is Cookie.

2145
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:22,000
The dog is a dog who makes waffles, but her name is Cookie.

2146
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:23,600
I don't know about that.

2147
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,920
She can probably make waffles and cookies.

2148
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:28,200
I feel like the emphasize, though, that she makes cookies.

2149
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:33,480
Well, I do feel like a lot of like diners back in the day

2150
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:38,760
or in prison or at camp or whatever you call the cook Cookie.

2151
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:40,720
Interesting.

2152
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:43,080
That's it's a nickname for a chef.

2153
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:45,080
Sure. I guess I guess I could see that.

2154
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:46,840
Yeah. OK.

2155
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:49,760
Well, Lindsay, what is your preference?

2156
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,000
What are my options again?

2157
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,720
Sweethearts, brother and sister, just friends or other sweethearts.

2158
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:56,600
So sweethearts. OK.

2159
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:59,360
But it only goes as far as chased kisses.

2160
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:01,240
Oh, I like that's nice.

2161
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:03,400
I like that's nice. Yeah, Scott.

2162
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:07,560
Realize we're talking about teddy bears here, but this there's sweethearts.

2163
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:11,520
It is not an option for sweethearts to go beyond being sweethearts.

2164
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,880
Well, it's not OK.

2165
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,760
I think that's what other would be.

2166
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:16,880
Other would be day fucking.

2167
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:22,320
I guess these teddy bears are not currently fucking,

2168
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:26,400
but if there's a possibility that they will fuck, they can't be sweethearts.

2169
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:30,920
I well, I would say they're all hearts to me, especially on this message board.

2170
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:34,280
They probably meant like, oh, they're going steady and they're just, you know,

2171
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:36,880
they kiss a little bit, but it's not like they're not.

2172
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,160
Mary doesn't say lovers.

2173
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:40,880
It doesn't say Mary, because of Mary, they have to have a boyfriend.

2174
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,560
Girlfriend. But you just eliminated.

2175
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:46,360
You put up a wall between if they one day consummate,

2176
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:48,360
that can't mean sweethearts now.

2177
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:50,360
Oh, I just think so. You told Jason.

2178
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:51,440
I think the mission.

2179
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:55,920
Think you were just asking Jason his definition of sweethearts.

2180
01:45:56,440 --> 01:46:01,640
Well, I think sweethearts itself on this does omit a strong sexual relationship

2181
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:04,680
in the current state, given what that I know about them,

2182
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:08,520
which is I'm gleaning from them being stuffed animals sitting on your couch right now

2183
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:12,760
and teaching some and holding hands, I might add, holding hands.

2184
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:15,680
They are, in fact, Mike made them all dance.

2185
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:19,200
I also saw them in the Easter show at Disney Sea, where they teach some.

2186
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:23,600
Oh, now, Jelatoni is holding hands with. Oh, this changes everything.

2187
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:25,080
Are they sweethearts now?

2188
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:27,520
Their love is a perfect love.

2189
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:30,160
Yeah, it's not at all like they're popular in a country

2190
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:32,720
where they have things called love hotels.

2191
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:36,800
Japan's love is a perfect love.

2192
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:39,560
Sweethearts is the answer.

2193
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:42,120
They're sweethearts. We're all sweethearts.

2194
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:44,560
I think they're just friends.

2195
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,840
So you're on the their love is a perfect love.

2196
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:49,000
Perfect love, just friends.

2197
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,280
I don't think there's anything romantic going on.

2198
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:55,560
Now, if you were to ask me about Jelatoni, do I think?

2199
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:56,760
Jelatoni fucks.

2200
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:59,680
He's a tomcat for sure. Jelatoni fucks.

2201
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:01,360
I mean, you look at these two, what are they?

2202
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:03,040
What could they do? Jelatoni can get it.

2203
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:06,320
Yeah, Jelatoni can get it is really what I'm trying to say.

2204
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:07,240
With who?

2205
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:09,840
If you're backpacking through Europe,

2206
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:13,800
if you are a cat undergrad who is backpacking through Europe

2207
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:15,640
and you meet Jelatoni. He's a Italian.

2208
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:17,960
He's got a cool beret. He's him.

2209
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,440
Yeah, he is.

2210
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,880
He is. And someone says, how was your backpacking trip?

2211
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:24,760
Well, let me start by telling you about Jelatoni.

2212
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:26,600
We know who's backpacking.

2213
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:28,240
It's that bird.

2214
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:30,040
Well, I know he's sure.

2215
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:30,880
He's delivering mail.

2216
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:31,720
I, yeah.

2217
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:32,560
Oh, that's a boy.

2218
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:35,520
Well, Dave, on vacation is a good time to experiment.

2219
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:38,800
You know, Tippi Blue, as I alluded before,

2220
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:41,360
I think Tippi Blue is really getting buried.

2221
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:44,360
And I wish they would kind of bring Tippi Blue back to the fold

2222
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:45,200
a little more.

2223
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:47,640
Let's do that with the backstory that they're lovers.

2224
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:50,000
Tippi Blue and Jelatoni are together.

2225
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,320
The Tippi, yeah, the Tippi Blue.

2226
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:52,480
I vote other for them.

2227
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:56,720
I'm getting a real sense that Scott hates the relationship

2228
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,760
talk about these characters.

2229
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:01,680
It's like, sure, why don't we pair these two up?

2230
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:02,800
No, no, no.

2231
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,200
No, now that you've, no, actually,

2232
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:07,240
Mike empowered me to create my own stories.

2233
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:08,080
Right.

2234
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:10,120
Now I'm playing like you in the Barney as a kid.

2235
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:11,240
No, I'm enjoying it.

2236
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:12,400
I'll say this.

2237
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:15,440
Jelatoni and the bird have fun together, guys.

2238
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:20,440
The Disney Sea show, live show,

2239
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:23,200
the Tippi Blue always rings twice,

2240
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:24,760
did not run for very long.

2241
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:27,800
That was a very erotic show.

2242
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:28,920
What a reach.

2243
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:30,360
What a reach.

2244
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:33,400
That is a film noir reference, everybody.

2245
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:35,360
Yeah, it's been remade a couple times.

2246
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:36,760
That's true.

2247
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:41,760
So look, I've gotten to about 25% of material I have.

2248
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,760
We have to obviously end the show.

2249
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:45,320
Let's just final thoughts of all the characters.

2250
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:47,880
I thought you were gonna read a definitive answer

2251
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:48,720
of the couple.

2252
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:51,200
Oh, let me read what the definitive answer

2253
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:52,040
from the board is, you're right.

2254
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:54,120
I guess I get that, thank you.

2255
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:59,120
So with 4% of the vote, other.

2256
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:03,280
With 8% of the vote, brother and sister.

2257
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:04,120
No, that's wrong.

2258
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:04,960
Freaks.

2259
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:08,480
32% of the vote, just friends.

2260
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:11,640
And 56% say sweethearts.

2261
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:12,480
Yes, correct.

2262
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:13,480
Absolutely.

2263
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:15,560
Something about the suggestion

2264
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:17,280
that they are brother and sister

2265
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:20,160
does make me think that they're fucking.

2266
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:22,440
But only if they're brother and sister.

2267
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:25,080
Sweethearts, nothing but chased kisses.

2268
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:28,760
But brother and sister, that's not right.

2269
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:30,000
Brother and step sister.

2270
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,280
It doesn't feel right to me.

2271
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:33,080
They look so similar.

2272
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:33,920
They do look very similar.

2273
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:35,360
It's weird about them being sweethearts to me.

2274
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,120
They both have Mickey faces.

2275
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:39,720
They have the same birthmark,

2276
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:42,080
a giant Mickey Mouse face on their face.

2277
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:43,400
And they have Mickey on their feet.

2278
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:44,240
We forgot to bring that up.

2279
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:46,040
All of them have Mickey on their feet.

2280
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:46,880
Or Mickey feet.

2281
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,760
Oh yeah, tippy blue as well.

2282
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:50,400
Wow, still on the tiny little bird legs.

2283
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:51,760
On the tiny bird legs.

2284
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:52,600
So yeah, look.

2285
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:54,200
They're all related, so any pairing

2286
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:56,920
between any of them is against God's will.

2287
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:59,320
And God in this case is Minnie against Minnie's will.

2288
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:00,800
And God in this case is me

2289
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:03,200
because I am the final judge of quality.

2290
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:04,800
I am the final judge of quality.

2291
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:09,800
I do think though that with Duffy based shopping seasons,

2292
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:12,600
if they did a wedding season,

2293
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:14,280
Duffy and Shelly May are getting married.

2294
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:17,480
I think that would be the biggest money maker.

2295
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:19,440
We'd have to go get those closed.

2296
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:21,160
We'd have to fly there.

2297
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:24,160
Who's the best man, who's the maid of honor?

2298
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:27,440
Oh well, Geletoni is coming solo to the wedding

2299
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:28,960
and he doesn't have a new job.

2300
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,280
He doesn't have a new job.

2301
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:32,680
They aren't even sure he's gonna make it.

2302
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:33,520
Yeah, right.

2303
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:35,480
We'll give him a seat, but he's probably not gonna show.

2304
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:37,920
Is Mickey the best man or is tippy blue the best man?

2305
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:39,160
I think Mickey is the best man.

2306
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:40,000
I think so too.

2307
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:40,840
I think he has to be.

2308
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:41,660
I thought tippy blue is pissed.

2309
01:50:41,660 --> 01:50:42,880
And then Minnie is maid of honor.

2310
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:43,720
Minnie maid of honor.

2311
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:44,560
Minnie of honor.

2312
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:45,520
Minnie of honor.

2313
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:48,000
The tippy blue is the ring bearer.

2314
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:48,840
Yeah.

2315
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:49,680
Oh, he's flying the ring.

2316
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:50,520
He's delivering it.

2317
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:51,360
Yeah.

2318
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:52,200
And then.

2319
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:54,200
What's that bunny doing?

2320
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:57,400
Stella Lou obviously flower girl.

2321
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:58,240
She got the tutu,

2322
01:50:58,240 --> 01:50:59,760
which I don't know why that makes any sense.

2323
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:00,960
Cookie is catering.

2324
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:01,800
Cookie is catering.

2325
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:02,640
Did the cake.

2326
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:03,480
Right.

2327
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:04,680
Olu is the entertainment.

2328
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:06,640
Olu plays his ukulele.

2329
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:07,480
There you go.

2330
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:08,320
This is a grand.

2331
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:09,800
Grand affair.

2332
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:10,640
We did it.

2333
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:12,560
And then like in the audience,

2334
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:14,240
Mike Leisner, Bob Iger,

2335
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:16,040
all the different heads.

2336
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:16,880
Paul Pressler.

2337
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:18,280
Paul Pressler, Bob Chapek,

2338
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:19,840
all the different people that worked.

2339
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,880
That K-pop band that I wish I could pull

2340
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:24,160
out of my hat right now.

2341
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,160
That Mickey dance with.

2342
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:27,120
That is his birthday.

2343
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:27,960
Oh, U571.

2344
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:31,720
That's not right.

2345
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:34,760
Like BTX, I think they were just here.

2346
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:35,600
Something.

2347
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:37,440
Anyway, wouldn't that have been nice?

2348
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:38,280
So.

2349
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:40,120
I don't remember that.

2350
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:41,800
So yeah, this is really,

2351
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:43,680
we're coming to the end of obviously part one

2352
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:46,600
of a multi-part Duffy saga.

2353
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,600
So yeah, we can't sum up our thoughts.

2354
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:52,600
I will just say that the gelatoni,

2355
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:53,440
there's a whole other section

2356
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:54,880
where people were upset that gelatoni

2357
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:57,720
brought a vibe to this dynamic.

2358
01:51:57,720 --> 01:52:01,200
People were thinking that he was a little lascivious

2359
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:04,720
and they didn't care for it because these two are so like.

2360
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:05,560
Their love is a perfect love.

2361
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:06,400
The perfect love,

2362
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:09,320
but they're also very like low key feeling.

2363
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:10,320
He's aggressive.

2364
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,920
He's a painter and a dancer.

2365
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:15,760
Like him and Stella Lu are bringing some mood.

2366
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:16,840
He brought. Big mood.

2367
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:18,880
Gelatoni brought an energy to the group

2368
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:20,880
that was not comfortable to a lot of the message.

2369
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:22,000
I forgot about that.

2370
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:22,840
I like it.

2371
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:24,320
I like the expansion of this universe.

2372
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:27,480
I think Disney Plus, let's do it.

2373
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:28,320
Let's make it happen.

2374
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:29,560
It's crazy they haven't tried

2375
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:30,760
because it could help.

2376
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:33,240
You know, expand the brand in America.

2377
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:36,200
But it's also, isn't it sort of Hello Kitty-esque

2378
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:41,000
in that huge in Japan exists primarily as merchandise.

2379
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,320
There are Hello Kitty cartoons and shows,

2380
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:44,880
but there isn't like the famous one.

2381
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:46,320
There isn't the movie.

2382
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:47,160
Right.

2383
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:48,000
It does.

2384
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,000
It also, in addition to initially being

2385
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,040
them trying to do Build-A-Bear,

2386
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:52,360
it feels like them trying to do Hello Kitty.

2387
01:52:52,360 --> 01:52:53,200
Yeah, I think. Yeah.

2388
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:54,480
Yeah, that's a good point.

2389
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:55,760
Valiant, Ted.

2390
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:57,280
Boy, it's working there.

2391
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:01,000
They sit nicely next to each other in Japan.

2392
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,840
So. And on our couch.

2393
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:04,480
And on our couch.

2394
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:07,480
And usually upstairs by my like toy shelves.

2395
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:11,840
You know, it's in just stray Duffy thoughts.

2396
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:14,440
The, when I was in Japan,

2397
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:16,080
I went to a, the first Disney store I went to,

2398
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:18,920
I was like, oh, look, it's Duffy's.

2399
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:20,600
Because up on the shelves,

2400
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:24,400
there were like teddy bears of Chip and Dale,

2401
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:28,400
dressed like the beast you helped me decipher.

2402
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:30,400
Cause it's in a red, in a purple cape

2403
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:32,760
and a kind of a goatee.

2404
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:35,200
And I was like, oh, okay, so these are Duffy's.

2405
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:36,400
That is not correct.

2406
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:40,560
What I was looking at was something called Unibarsity.

2407
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,520
And Unibarsity is, okay, let's be very clear.

2408
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:44,760
These are not Duffy's.

2409
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:46,960
These are Disney's.

2410
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:49,520
These are Disney bears who dress like the characters.

2411
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:54,520
Not like you have a costume of Duffy as Lightning McQueen.

2412
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:56,280
So this is a whole other.

2413
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:59,040
So like, we not only have Duffy to do,

2414
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:02,400
Unibarsity is an entire other thing we have to grapple with.

2415
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:04,360
Were you familiar with Unibarsity before?

2416
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:06,240
I obviously knew cause you sent me those pictures,

2417
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:07,600
but I did not know that was the name of it.

2418
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:10,440
I didn't actually, I don't know the scope of the merchandise.

2419
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:11,920
This is a second Disney bit.

2420
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:12,800
There's a whole other.

2421
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:13,780
Now are they friends?

2422
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:15,440
What vibe do they bring to the group?

2423
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:18,320
And then there's the Soom Sooms.

2424
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:19,920
That was very, that was short term.

2425
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:23,000
And then I saw someone, God, I can't remember the name now.

2426
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,080
Somewhat like there was a bunch of Soom Sooms

2427
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:27,280
on like Clearance or at the outlets and stuff.

2428
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:29,800
It's like, oh, they've already been replaced

2429
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:31,760
by the Cuddles or something.

2430
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:34,720
Like there's another Disney cute thing.

2431
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:37,840
And there's a lot of the characters specifically

2432
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:42,400
on their tummies sleeping, like kind of in baby form.

2433
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:46,040
Like you'll see like Peter Pan or Pluto or whatever

2434
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:48,120
in baby form taking a nap.

2435
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:49,480
So there's that too.

2436
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:50,960
So we got to deal with Unibarsity,

2437
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:54,440
we got to deal with Naps, the Nap Crew.

2438
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:56,440
It's overwhelming how much there is.

2439
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:59,820
There's so much, but I think Disney Plus is the place

2440
01:54:59,820 --> 01:55:01,980
to do an Avengers of Bears.

2441
01:55:01,980 --> 01:55:04,700
Yeah, because I mean in like downtown Disney,

2442
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:07,420
like they've already, we've already seen multiple,

2443
01:55:07,420 --> 01:55:09,500
like Duffy's been pushed out,

2444
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:11,180
the Build-A-Bear's even been pushed out

2445
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:13,900
for like craft burgers and beer.

2446
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:18,300
And then upstairs it's fucking, or craft shakes downstairs,

2447
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:20,220
craft beer upstairs.

2448
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:23,220
Like the trends have already turned over under 10 years.

2449
01:55:23,220 --> 01:55:24,580
I'm liking what it's turning into.

2450
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:25,420
What's that?

2451
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:26,540
I'm liking what it's turning into

2452
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:28,100
because it was definitely in need

2453
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:31,140
of what people are into now update.

2454
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:32,300
Yeah.

2455
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:33,740
Eating okay food.

2456
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:34,780
Yeah.

2457
01:55:34,780 --> 01:55:36,420
That's a trend of 2019.

2458
01:55:36,420 --> 01:55:38,260
Reasonably good $50 burgers.

2459
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:39,860
Yeah.

2460
01:55:39,860 --> 01:55:44,060
I also, I mean, my other big takeaway from Disney Sea was,

2461
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:44,940
well, so I got lucky,

2462
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:48,740
I got to see the Duffy side of the Easter show.

2463
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:52,060
Like it's a show where three barges are coming for you.

2464
01:55:52,060 --> 01:55:53,540
And are you gonna get Mickey and Minnie?

2465
01:55:53,540 --> 01:55:54,700
Are you gonna get Chip and Dale?

2466
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:55,700
Are you gonna get Duffy Crew?

2467
01:55:55,700 --> 01:55:56,880
I got Duffy Crew.

2468
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,880
I didn't end up seeing a separate Duffy show

2469
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:01,440
because that felt like the Duffy show to me.

2470
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:03,320
So I feel like I got to spend a lot of good time with them.

2471
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:04,720
That helped me understand them more,

2472
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:05,840
seeing them in action,

2473
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:08,000
teaching chicken creatures how to dance.

2474
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:10,400
But in waiting for that,

2475
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:15,400
I saw a gelatoni dressed as the female aristocat.

2476
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:20,480
The white fur.

2477
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:23,560
And this is the cutest thing I've ever,

2478
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:25,160
like this made me fall.

2479
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:26,120
Oh wow.

2480
01:56:26,120 --> 01:56:26,960
Great.

2481
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:30,440
80% did my heart for Duffy and Friends jump.

2482
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:32,720
I think gelatoni is my favorite.

2483
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:35,600
Another, like right next to another pal playing

2484
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:37,720
with gelatoni right next to, oh, and oh, I'm sorry.

2485
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:42,000
And she is also wearing a little beret and ears.

2486
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,400
So she is dressed like gelatoni with a gelatoni

2487
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:47,600
in a costume.

2488
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:53,280
I just, I'm like, every character combo, please.

2489
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:55,200
You just said Avengers of Duffy?

2490
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:58,960
Like every Marvel character available as a costume

2491
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:02,800
for these cats and bears would be wondrous.

2492
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:07,000
Yeah, I do think going to Tokyo changes

2493
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,120
because he is a character in that park

2494
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:11,040
and not at all in ours.

2495
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:14,600
Like seeing the Duffy show at the place we ate.

2496
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:16,280
Oh yeah, I mean we rarely talk about that.

2497
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:19,680
Yeah, we saw the Duffy show and his origin story.

2498
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:22,520
I loved, I'll just steal the percentage from you.

2499
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:24,960
I don't know how much of a percent it was though.

2500
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:27,080
Like I loved Duffy 80% more

2501
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:30,360
when he was an adorable Japanese bear.

2502
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:31,200
Yeah, sure.

2503
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:32,240
Speaking in Japanese.

2504
01:57:32,240 --> 01:57:33,080
Yeah, oh sure.

2505
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:37,240
I was like, oh, I am very much behind Duffy being Japanese.

2506
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:38,800
Oh, now how did that change things?

2507
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:41,120
No, we haven't talked about how Duffy sounds.

2508
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:42,520
What kind of character is Duffy?

2509
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:45,720
Yeah, I've never heard Duffy except in Japan

2510
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:49,280
and I was like, he better only sound like this ever.

2511
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:50,120
He sounds cute.

2512
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:52,640
He just sounds fucking cute.

2513
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:53,480
He's real cute.

2514
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:55,200
If it was a more complicated answer than that,

2515
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:57,800
that'd be a bummer, so I'm glad.

2516
01:57:57,800 --> 01:57:59,680
I also forgot to mention earlier in the episode,

2517
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:03,840
Lindsay did eBay Shelly Mae for me.

2518
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:04,680
Yes, that Shelly Mae I got for you.

2519
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:06,880
That is how eventually I got Shelly Mae

2520
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:10,000
and my sister eBayed Gelatoni for me.

2521
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,320
Oh, so they're all gifts.

2522
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:12,840
None of them were just bought for you.

2523
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:13,680
These are gifts.

2524
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:14,520
That's true.

2525
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:17,320
Marissa Strickland got me, Jason and I tippy blue

2526
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:19,480
like five years ago from Japan.

2527
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:21,280
And then a listener cookie.

2528
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:23,400
And then a listener says cookie.

2529
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:25,680
So the mini spirit is alive.

2530
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:26,520
That's really nice.

2531
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:27,360
So mini spirit.

2532
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:28,200
That's true.

2533
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:29,020
These are all gifts really.

2534
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:30,880
So yes, I have all of these.

2535
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:33,040
So I'm waiting for someone to give to me,

2536
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:36,280
Stella Liu and Olu, but it would be good if we went.

2537
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:38,480
We should go to buy them.

2538
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:40,520
But one of you has to give it as a gift to the brother.

2539
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:42,400
Yes, that's true, in the spirit of it.

2540
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:44,640
Yeah, you will hand me the money to buy it

2541
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:46,080
and then I will hand it to you

2542
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:47,360
as though I'm giving it to you.

2543
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:49,640
And I will sell it like I'm,

2544
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:52,160
that's how it happened that you were just giving it to me

2545
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:53,040
for an occasion.

2546
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:54,520
Let me ask you this.

2547
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:55,480
Did someone give you what appears to be

2548
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:59,760
a four inch Unkar plot, which is down at ankle level?

2549
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:01,440
Wow, funny story.

2550
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:04,400
Jason is referencing a toy down there

2551
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:06,360
that I bought when I was buying a gift

2552
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:08,160
for a friend's birthday the other day.

2553
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:10,400
He is incorrectly identified

2554
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:12,240
that Star Wars character's Unkar plot.

2555
01:59:12,240 --> 01:59:13,640
It is not Unkar plot.

2556
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:17,480
It is Dexter Jekster, the space diner owner

2557
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:19,320
from Attack of the Clones.

2558
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:20,800
We were in a riot once.

2559
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:21,960
You fucking idiot.

2560
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:24,720
Oh no, we're wrapping up the show

2561
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:26,560
with me being owned just like we started.

2562
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:27,400
You are wrong.

2563
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:31,200
That said, we were in a riot once

2564
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:32,960
and there was a rack of Star Wars toys

2565
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:34,720
of just Unkar plots.

2566
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:35,920
Yeah, I think that's right.

2567
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:36,760
Yeah.

2568
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:37,600
So anyway, if anyone wants to know.

2569
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:40,040
It's a good serial, just plots.

2570
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:41,400
Yeah.

2571
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:43,120
Have you talked about the Mickey

2572
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:44,760
that I got you from Japan?

2573
01:59:46,240 --> 01:59:49,040
No, well, we talked about that on the show.

2574
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:49,880
We did talk about that.

2575
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:50,720
Yeah, I think so.

2576
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:51,560
Yeah, we did talk about that.

2577
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:53,920
The best gifts I've ever gotten.

2578
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:57,040
Crazy exclusive Mickey from Tokyo.

2579
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:59,160
Oh, it looks like a mascot

2580
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:01,080
or it looks like the walk around character.

2581
02:00:01,080 --> 02:00:05,000
Yes, and it's only available to special Disney,

2582
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:09,280
like Tokyo Disney club members that pay a fee.

2583
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:11,280
They have to have an address in Japan

2584
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:12,640
and then they have to go to the park

2585
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:14,200
in a certain couple of weeks

2586
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:16,760
to get the exclusive merchandise.

2587
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:18,720
So all of this stuff is on eBay.

2588
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:19,960
And yeah, anyway.

2589
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:22,880
That's a scheme worthy of the message boards

2590
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:27,880
who got the 20% uptick convenience fee, whatever it was.

2591
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:32,200
So yes, that was a very good gift, the best gift.

2592
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:33,840
So Duffy is a very cute character.

2593
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:35,440
Yeah, yeah it was.

2594
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:37,040
Who is very complicated to get

2595
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:39,440
and complicates people's lives.

2596
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:40,280
Drives them insane.

2597
02:00:40,280 --> 02:00:43,120
Duffy does have a rich backstory with us.

2598
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:44,600
That is personal to us.

2599
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:47,160
Here's a picture of him that's very coy.

2600
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:48,000
That also kind of looks like a headshot.

2601
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:49,720
That was the Duffy we saw everywhere

2602
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:51,640
and we were like who the fuck is this?

2603
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:52,480
Yeah, yeah.

2604
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:54,560
It changes things.

2605
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:57,760
That Duffy is not as cute as Japan Duffy.

2606
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:02,560
That Duffy is a hastily thrown together

2607
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:04,560
the initial thing that we all,

2608
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:06,760
the initial impression we all got from it.

2609
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:09,080
That Duffy was like third supporting lead

2610
02:01:09,080 --> 02:01:11,560
in like the second Dabney Coleman sitcom

2611
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:14,040
where America was like no thank you,

2612
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:16,440
no more Dabney please.

2613
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:17,920
Don't need four more please.

2614
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:20,560
Now that I have said such horrible things

2615
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:21,960
about that photo I feel very,

2616
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:26,960
I feel like very bad about saying all those mean things

2617
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:28,920
about that Duffy.

2618
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:30,080
Really, immediately?

2619
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:30,920
Yeah.

2620
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:31,760
But that Duffy's not as good.

2621
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:33,000
He's too coy, he's too coy.

2622
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:38,000
I got really sad throwing away my loofah, my shower poof.

2623
02:01:41,640 --> 02:01:43,520
Does it have eyes and a face or anything?

2624
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:44,360
No.

2625
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:46,440
Oh, that's enough of a character to you?

2626
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:47,280
Yeah.

2627
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:49,160
I'm sorry.

2628
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:52,640
I don't know why I didn't, you're pretty new.

2629
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:54,520
I didn't really need to go and buy a new one.

2630
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:56,040
You served me well.

2631
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:56,880
I get that.

2632
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:57,700
I feel bad.

2633
02:01:57,700 --> 02:02:00,880
I feel bad when I sell things or throw things away.

2634
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:02,440
I once made my sister,

2635
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:04,920
I had my, right before we went on vacation to Disney World,

2636
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:06,680
I made all of her stuffed animals talk and say,

2637
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:08,720
we're gonna miss you, we wanna go with you.

2638
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:11,360
So she stuffed them all into the suitcase

2639
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:12,880
without my mom knowing.

2640
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:14,120
And then my mom opened the suitcase

2641
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:16,240
and there were like 10 stuffed animals in there.

2642
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:17,840
And she's like, what is this?

2643
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:21,600
She's like, Mike made me feel bad.

2644
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:23,080
But like, obviously I felt bad.

2645
02:02:23,080 --> 02:02:24,360
Like I wanted to take them.

2646
02:02:24,360 --> 02:02:26,800
I felt like they were gonna be left behind.

2647
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:27,640
Yeah.

2648
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:28,960
So what's wrong with me?

2649
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:33,920
You took the queen mattress that I got

2650
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:36,520
for my first apartment back in LA.

2651
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:38,760
We were already planning on replacing it

2652
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:40,200
and you already took it off the bed

2653
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:42,360
and hauled it down to the dumpster.

2654
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:44,480
So that when I came home and I was like,

2655
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:48,680
I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye to it.

2656
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:53,400
I felt really sad.

2657
02:02:54,760 --> 02:02:58,360
You're living in Pixar worlds where everything is alive

2658
02:02:58,360 --> 02:02:59,600
and might be mad that you're.

2659
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:00,440
Yeah.

2660
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:01,280
What are you?

2661
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:04,000
It's like a nightmare of Marie Kondo,

2662
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,840
like having to thank everything for what it's done for me.

2663
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:10,600
I was gonna ask what your thoughts were on her.

2664
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:13,200
Like, does it help or are you just like, no, absolutely not.

2665
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:14,320
It's what I already thought.

2666
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:16,000
It's how I already felt.

2667
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:16,840
Yeah.

2668
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:17,680
All right, well, let's end the episode

2669
02:03:17,680 --> 02:03:19,800
on a sad note of a melancholy.

2670
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:21,960
What else does Jason do?

2671
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:25,040
Jason does a lot of weird shit.

2672
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:25,880
Well, I'm a sea captain,

2673
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:29,000
so naturally I spent a lot of time on the ocean.

2674
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,160
Naturally.

2675
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:31,000
Aw.

2676
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,720
We'll salute you on your next voyage.

2677
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:36,480
Edwin is a part of the Demi family now.

2678
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:37,840
Some weight.

2679
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:40,800
Someone take a picture of this while it's before he.

2680
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:44,040
Someone do the end of show roundup.

2681
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:45,040
You take care of photos.

2682
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:45,880
Oh my God.

2683
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:46,720
I will.

2684
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:47,560
Oh my God.

2685
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:49,840
I will say, Lindsay K. Tell you Survived podcast is the ride.

2686
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:50,680
Did I though?

2687
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:51,520
For the second time.

2688
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:53,240
I think so.

2689
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:55,680
If you can make it out a little easier

2690
02:03:55,680 --> 02:03:59,000
than saying goodbye to your mattress or your loofah.

2691
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,320
Thanks for being here.

2692
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:02,640
Hey, let's, we said your stuff at the top,

2693
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:04,440
but let's exit through the gift shop too.

2694
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:07,160
What's the way to, where people find you and your stuff.

2695
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:10,560
You can find my podcast, Teen Creeps,

2696
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:13,440
wherever you typically listen to podcasts.

2697
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:16,600
We talk about YA pulp fiction of the 80s and 90s.

2698
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:19,560
And then we also throw in like a fun cult classic movie

2699
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:23,760
every now and then like The Craft or Lost Boys.

2700
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:26,280
I host that with my friend, Kelly Nugent

2701
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:31,280
and keep on looking out for Infinity Train.

2702
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:34,400
Just Google Infinity Train once every month or so.

2703
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:38,240
Yeah, hopefully we get to talk about it soon.

2704
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:42,080
But that will be premiering this year.

2705
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:43,640
It will be this year.

2706
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:47,000
Yeah, it's a show on Cartoon Network

2707
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,080
about a girl who gets on a mystical train

2708
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:51,000
with an endless number of cars.

2709
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,600
Each one its own pocket universe.

2710
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:54,680
You can find the short on YouTube.

2711
02:04:54,680 --> 02:04:57,120
Does one of the cars have like a bear though?

2712
02:04:57,120 --> 02:04:59,400
I can't fucking say, Scott.

2713
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:00,240
Oh, all right.

2714
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:01,080
How many times?

2715
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:04,800
I just don't want her to be alone on her journey.

2716
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:06,560
She might make a couple of friends.

2717
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:07,400
Oh, okay.

2718
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:08,240
Hopefully.

2719
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:12,800
As for us, check us out at the second gate

2720
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:14,760
at patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2721
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:17,680
Check us out at podcast the ride on Twitter, Instagram.

2722
02:05:17,680 --> 02:05:19,680
We got a Facebook group, there's Reddit.

2723
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:22,400
You can buy our shirts on T public

2724
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:27,280
and there will be no 20% uptick service charge for.

2725
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:28,100
What was that?

2726
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:29,760
I still don't understand the math.

2727
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:32,280
There's no smuggling involved if you wanna buy our shirts.

2728
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:33,120
That's what I can tell you.

2729
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:35,160
Yeah, there's no smuggling fee.

2730
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:36,240
Additional smuggling fee.

2731
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:37,400
Yeah, it's just straight.

2732
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:39,760
You see is what you're paying for.

2733
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:40,760
No extra shipping and handling.

2734
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:44,000
Unless somebody's making rare podcast ride shirts in Japan.

2735
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:44,960
Oh yeah, maybe.

2736
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:45,920
Which case, cool.

2737
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:47,760
Yeah, that would be cool.

2738
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:49,600
I would buy one of those.

2739
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:50,440
I'm not so obsessed.

2740
02:05:50,440 --> 02:05:52,960
And $118 on my shirt for your show.

2741
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:55,160
A bootleg botanica shirt.

2742
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:58,240
A bootleg of a bootleg looking shirt would be.

2743
02:05:58,240 --> 02:05:59,520
That's a good idea.

2744
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:01,320
Yes, the ripoff of the ripoff.

2745
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:02,800
Oh, yes.

2746
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:04,600
All right, well, and there were a lot of good

2747
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:05,800
arts and crafts opportunities.

2748
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:07,640
I think we presented during this episode.

2749
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:10,960
Go back and listen to them and send them back to us.

2750
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:13,040
Lots of homework, get to it.

2751
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:14,240
Bye. Bye.

2752
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:15,080
Forever.

2753
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:17,520
