1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,680
Welcome, welcome, one and all to Podcast the Ride the Second Gate. Mike immediately has

3
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,600
to turn down the levels because he didn't know I was going to...

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,600
Actually, I turned them up.

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,760
Turn them up? What? Oh, oh, geez. So do I need to do it louder then?

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,560
No, well, if you want to.

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:42,160
Welcome. I'm coming in with that 70s Mouseketeer energy to podcast the Ride the Second Gate

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,400
to talk about the Mouseketeers, go to Disney World. Let's just all say our names, just

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,040
the first name Mouseketeers style. Scott.

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,040
Mike.

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,040
Michael.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,040
Jason.

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:00,120
That's great. It saves you a lot of work to not say the second name. And as the Mouseketeers

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,440
teach us, who cares? We say them every week. People don't want to know. I don't know Cubby's

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,120
last name. I just know Cubby.

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
Yeah.

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
I don't know.

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,120
I don't know Nita's last name.

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,520
I don't know Nita's. Actually, I did look up Nita's last name. I don't know. No one

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,240
knows Annette's last name. There's no way to know. No one knows.

21
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,160
Yeah. A lot of people have been hunting for it for years, but no one's found it yet.

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,920
It's a very pre-internet thing and nobody's bothered to put it on in the intervening years,

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,920
so we can't know.

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,840
What's important to mention is that this is another installment of our semi-regular series

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,160
plus us up.

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,160
Semi-regular.

27
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,320
And of course, the plus, as we learned in today's special, plus usually means pudding.

28
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,720
Yes. Yes. In this case, it's not just Disney. Well, yeah, we've got more pluses today.

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,960
Was pudding the element in the commercial?

30
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,920
Yes. Pudding is the element. It is the plus.

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,880
I know what you meant. I wrote it down, but I actually missed that it was pudding.

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,280
It is a good, yeah, if you add pudding to cake, it makes it smoother and creamier.

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,880
Great tease for later for the episode.

34
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,240
Yeah. What are the high points of the episode? That secret in general.

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
Yeah.

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,720
Yeah. Oh, and the repartee between the mother and daughter.

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
Oh, yes.

38
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
No, that's a blast.

39
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,640
Yeah. And we went to the audience to see what the audience wanted us to watch. And as usual,

40
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,600
the audience decided to punish us. They decided to make us watch something that I guess I

41
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,600
shouldn't say punish, but they didn't give us an easy. It wasn't like, hey, watch, watch

42
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,960
Phantom Menace, which is something I would do weekly if I could.

43
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,560
It says you.

44
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,040
Yeah.

45
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,640
This is. I know. Jason would watch Phantom Menace once a week. He doesn't care.

46
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,760
I don't know about once a week. I think once a month.

47
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,600
Once a month. That's fine. Yeah. But that's a little more of an easy assignment.

48
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,040
How are we going to we're so out of step with this scene of comedy podcasters. We're part of

50
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,480
Do Watch Phantom Menace.

51
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,960
Weekly.

52
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,480
Probably twice a week. Yeah. Yeah.

53
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:58,640
Right.

54
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,200
Every day they protest watch it instead of Mandalorian.

55
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,440
Right.

56
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,880
When Mandalorian's airing.

57
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,360
Yeah, that's true. I mean, we're not completely in that zone yet, but.

58
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,720
Not quite. But you're right. That is. I forget that that's on Disney Plus. There's so much that

59
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,160
you forget is on Disney Plus. Yes. As we said, we put out the assignment on Twitter is just find

60
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,560
something bizarre for us to watch on Disney Plus. Not that it has to be. People could say

61
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,280
watch something fun and nice. Yeah. What would be the fun in that?

62
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,160
Yes. I get it. That it's more fun to make us watch something weird like this. But yeah,

63
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,720
you could one of these days just like we could watch, I don't know, Little Mermaid or something.

64
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,560
Just watch. Yeah. And you know what I liked about it is that it was good.

65
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,120
Yeah. Did you know the songs are really good in the Little Mermaid? Like, and then we'll just talk.

66
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,480
I remember when I saw it when I was a kid, I thought it was so good.

67
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,720
And it's like still good. That's what is nice about it. We've said this before,

68
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,240
though, if the podcast was that we'd be like 10 times more popular, I think.

69
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,160
I don't know. We went on this ride and it was good.

70
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,840
That is. But don't you think that's what makes us the counter to maybe a lot of.

71
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,040
Yeah, but the people who listen now wouldn't be listening. And then a whole larger audience

72
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,200
would be listening. So like these positive boys are so nice. Yes. Don't curse. And they just love

73
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,000
going to the parks. Yeah. But we would also have there be one thing we would have to say that is

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,120
not good, which is PC culture and vaults vision. We would have to hit that well so often to retain

75
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,880
the other audience. That's true. Would it be we'd have to change who we are? We would be.

76
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,720
We would be multimillionaires at this point if we had gone that route, I think.

77
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,280
But we had to be ourselves. We're just being ourselves. So authentic and too real. We're

78
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,760
too real is really the problem. Yeah. So that you say this is unpleasant, but remember that the

79
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,280
last week, there's only the second time we've we've done this, told the audience to make us

80
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,720
watch something on Disney Plus. And the first time was fuzz. But yes, yes. Which both of these are

81
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,000
from magical world or wonderful world of Disney, sort of like not full length presentations,

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,920
not full length movies and fuzz bucket, which if you missed that episode, he's like just like a

83
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:23,520
weird gnome creature. A little turd. Yes, that's right. A little hairy turd who and I didn't bother

84
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:31,440
to look up what it was. But in my head, the things that he says are like, what's up? Let's let's suck

85
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,240
party boy. It is part first book. It wants to suck my party boy man. I don't think the first part is

86
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:46,160
correct. I believe like that, though it is close. I think he says it wants that good love from boys.

87
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,600
I swear one of the things I said is what fuzz bucket says that is certainly the energy.

88
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,400
And I'm not even going to say it's like not the right like it's not the right message. It just

89
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,080
might not be verbatim. The words. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. There's something that made physical that

90
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,720
made me uncomfortable. He wants. I mean, he fuzz bucket makes the kid kiss him a couple times. I

91
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,240
feel like. Yeah, see, we're getting close. Give me a kiss. Like, and then he does call him party boy.

92
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,760
I think. Yeah, he definitely calls him party boy. Give me long kiss party boy. Those parts don't go

93
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,200
together and maybe he doesn't say long. Yeah, I don't think. Yeah, exactly. But fuzz buckets

94
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,200
always the character I point to when you accuse me of trolling about a character I think is cute

95
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,640
because I go, I did not like fuzz bucket, so I'm not blanket trolling. Yeah. You know. Yeah. There

96
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:46,320
are pieces of it. He's so unpleasant. Yeah. Again, being yourself. We are. I'm being authentic. Yeah.

97
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:53,120
Fuzz bucket and his gang of perverts, his little turd pervert. Yeah. When you meet his friends,

98
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,880
they're horrible. Oh my God. But this is so much better than. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

99
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,840
since America sings, like I said on a previous episode, everything seems like a blessing.

100
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,760
I got it. I think though you hated America sings more than you've hated, like anything we've ever

101
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,680
talked about on the show. You were given. I mean, we don't have us liked it, but you were like,

102
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,680
you just, you just had red eyes. I feel I was really, yeah, I was mad at that. I, cause I just

103
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,120
thought I thought going in, I would at least be like pleasantly bemused. I just found it so

104
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,640
like. Betrayed. Yeah. Unpleasant from the start. I, this, this one, the, the Mascoteers go to

105
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:39,040
Walt Disney World. I did watch last year. When it came out. Yeah. Yeah. I voluntarily watched this.

106
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:45,120
Yes. Kind of sleepily like watch it. So I didn't really like remember a ton about it. And there

107
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,280
is like the very first thing you see them, you go like, Oh, okay. Well, that's a product of it's time,

108
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,520
but then it kind of quickly redeems itself. Wait, there's something up. There's a problem.

109
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,880
What's the problem? It's immediately singing Zip-a-dee-doo. Oh, God. Oh, God. Yeah. That's

110
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,520
just everything up until five years ago. And I saw, I read one review of this special where it was

111
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,200
like, uh, the film around this time period, the film would go on to be rereleased in theaters twice

112
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:17,200
after this came out. So it was on in South. You mean? Yes. Yeah. Cause it's 77. Yeah. It's 77.

113
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,320
Yeah. That was getting around. Sure. Sure. Um, but, uh, yeah. Okay. Well, at least they don't,

114
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,080
they didn't sing a lot of the lyrics though. That is that help that they're going like,

115
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,480
dude, dude, dude, boy, is that a weird part? Yeah. Why boy is that unnerving? I think Lindsay wanted

116
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,520
in the room for that and she goes, what, what is why? Yeah. They're like, just like, yeah,

117
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:46,960
they're like scatting over it. It's strange. Um, yeah, let's, to say some, some basics about this.

118
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:56,400
So this was a special from the wonderful world of Disney. Uh, it aired November 20th, 1977,

119
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:02,960
a little bit of a pop culture context for that week, that very week that this aired, uh, was the

120
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:09,200
release of the Saturday night fever soundtrack. Wow. The release of close encounters of the third

121
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:19,040
kind. Uh, and the most importantly, the final Al Cap written edition of little Abner. Yeah. Yeah.

122
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:26,560
This is a historical week. So much happened November 77. Um, and yeah, well, we'll judge,

123
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,680
does this hold up against the other iconic pop culture of the time? Um, the, so all right,

124
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:41,120
it's the Mouseketeers going to Disney world. And when the special begins, my first question is,

125
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,240
who are you Mouseketeers? I don't know any of you. I don't know about this version of the Mouseketeers

126
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,640
whatsoever. So this version of Mouseketeers aired in syndication for like two years. Okay. And this

127
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,240
special is the oddball that aired on like, you know, on broadcast on the wonderful world at Disney.

128
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,480
Okay. Okay. Sure. Otherwise. So that's not being kept up in the vault. Like maybe there's no clean

129
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,120
copies of that thing. That's sort of being cranked out and it's a weird local stations and nobody

130
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,440
cares. Yeah. There's gotta be something. It's gotta exist somewhere. It's on YouTube a little

131
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,000
bit. I flipped through and didn't really retain anything enough to bring it to the table here.

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,040
But yeah, it's, uh, it's, it's, it's odd because now that brings it to three Mickey Mouse clubs

133
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,000
all told in the fifties. One is extremely iconic and the nineties one produced all the biggest

134
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,920
stars in the world. Um, so the 77 one is really, uh, pulling up the rear in that like it did not

135
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,520
really have a lot of pop culture. It would be something if it was like, oh, you know what?

136
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,200
We did the Mouseketeers in the seventies and it kind of faded out and that was it. Obviously

137
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,040
nothing was going to capture the magic, like the original group, but then there was another

138
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,320
successful group and then you would be real. I feel like you would be really like, God damn it.

139
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,000
If you were one of the seventies ones. Yeah, exactly. Like you were like, well, there was no

140
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
way it would ever work again. And then it worked and produced pop worldwide. Star, bigger stars,

141
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
bigger stars, Cubby and Annette decades long relevant. And that has a great singing career

142
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,760
that we will go out of our last name is we'll get to. I promise. But this, this club did produce

143
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,560
one notable, some of the kids went on to act in other things. They did stuff. The most notable

144
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:34,080
being Lisa Welchel, who was Blair on the facts of life. Yes. So there's that facts of life

145
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,240
person, but then you compare it. If that's the biggest star, right? You know, we are not, uh,

146
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:47,200
currently this year, uh, super obsessed with every detail of a crooked legal conservatorship

147
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,480
of a Lisa Welchel. That's true. Quite the same level of fame. Right. Um, but I mean, that's

148
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,280
obviously the people had careers. I'm just saying the less people in crooked legal conservatorships.

149
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,240
Yeah. As far as we know. Yeah. Yeah. You don't know. Honestly, I didn't look that hard. Yeah.

150
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,800
Yeah. Um, I'm not sure there could be tons more of those. I didn't realize I wasn't on the lookout

151
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,520
for that word, but that's exactly what was up with Brian Wilson as Dan Eugene Landy and right.

152
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,080
Yes. In that movie. And it all fell apart because Landy put himself as the, like,

153
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,880
he gets everything in the will. And that was finally the point where it became legal. All right.

154
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,240
That one you can't do. This guy's gone. Songwriting credit too. Yeah. Well, he did just write

155
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,120
songs that he wrote. Yeah. Like horrendous songs. Yeah. I was the rap song with the lyric,

156
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,640
my name is Brian and I'm the man. I hit songs with the wave of my hand. Oh my God.

157
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:48,080
I really like, I think not written by him because why else would he rap if this mean doctor wasn't

158
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,880
peeling him up to make him do it? Is there like an, is there a beach boys podcast you could do?

159
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,720
I mean, I could think it was the one thing you guys, I think for you guys, it's Marvel or maybe

160
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,760
a bunch of other things. I'm like, I think I could just kind of improvise the beach boys podcast.

161
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,400
It would probably be a good outlet to do it so that I'm not just doing it out loud to my wife,

162
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,200
who does not like them and does not want to hear these facts ever. Like you should record it like

163
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:18,720
3 a.m. alone. It should just be you an hour alone. Yeah. Rambling, whatever like new thing you learned

164
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,960
that week. This is Aaron's dream. It's not a bad idea. There's a lot of beach boys fans out there.

165
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:31,520
I bet you could even get like slots on like classic rock radio at like three a.m. Like not for you.

166
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,280
You wouldn't, you could still record it at home. You could just syndicate it with them.

167
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:40,080
Little Steven, little Steven would like pick the show up or something. Yeah. Put it on underground.

168
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,680
I'm not even joking. I mean, maybe not little Steven. Beach boy, boy. Yeah.

169
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:51,760
The beach boy, boy coming up next art bell, a 30 year old art bell episode. I would be,

170
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,160
I'd be so honored. Yeah. To be in the same league. I do remember like when I first got my driver's

171
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,440
license, like driving home from a very late movie and like just kind of scrolling through the radio

172
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,680
and discovering like an old art bell episode. I was like, what is this? This feels like.

173
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,360
They're old ones. He's still around, right? He like hosts concerts and stuff. Yeah. I think so.

174
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,160
Um, but, uh, yeah, beach boy, boy will be its own thing. We will silo that into, into something else.

175
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,320
And maybe five current listeners will follow me to it. I'll come over. Yeah. Classic rock

176
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,280
audience. There'll be people who were like, can't sleep. People who were having, uh, like the aches

177
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:38,240
and pains in the evening and wake up and put on the radio. The problem is, is that the age of the

178
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,840
average audience member who would be interested, they don't know how to work a phone. They don't

179
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,800
know how to get a podcast. Yeah. There's a little barrier of entry, which is why Jason's idea of

180
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,080
putting it on a maybe terrestrial, terrestrial radio or satellite would be, would be the way to

181
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,160
go to. Yeah. Yeah. That's probably where you're pretty good. We'll get a lot of truckers, a lot

182
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:02,560
of truckers can't fit all of their beach boys CDs in there. Right. And you have to go in, you know

183
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,640
what? You won't be able to record it. You all have to go into a studio and do it at 2 AM somewhere.

184
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,720
Okay. Yeah. It's one of those. Yeah. For some reason it's still happening. Yeah. It's like right

185
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:18,160
after Rodney on the Rock. Rodney's going long again. Rodney shuffles out. He's playing a B side

186
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,040
with go-gos or something and you have to wait for him. He passed away, didn't he? Rodney? No.

187
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,840
I don't think so. Rodney on the Rock died, I believe. No, Rodney's alive. But I, I'm taking,

188
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,880
it's Scotty on the Rock now. All beach boys all the time. If Rodney died and I didn't know,

189
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,240
it would be shocking. I am pretty sure. What? Oh wait, no, I know I am wrong. I'm incorrect. Wow.

190
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,680
Rodney's alive. Was it just that the show went off the air? I think the show went off. Wow.

191
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,760
It was like a slow bleed off the air that he was, he was on nightly. Then they put him on Sunday

192
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:52,160
nights for like an hour. Okay. And then maybe it's fully gone. Um, well I feel ashamed then.

193
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,240
This is one thing I can't say my trivia about. Yeah. But I can say my trivia about this. The

194
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,800
other one that's a little notable, the one of the Masketeers is Mindy Feldman, who's Corey Feldman's

195
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:12,960
sister. Right. The fellow Feldman. And then the other ones are notable for, actually,

196
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,000
well I was trying to find out information about some of the other, these other Masketeers and I

197
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,160
ended up on the website, the track specifically, the 70s Masketeers, which is of course, discomice.com.

198
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:31,200
Yes, I saw discomice. And it points out all of them and I'm on a page that you click on the tab

199
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:37,440
mice and then you click on a few of them and nothing comes up. And like what's happening here

200
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,920
and then you go to the bottom and see the caption on this website. Someday each mouse will have

201
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:51,520
their own page on this site. Someday. And the website I assume was not made yesterday.

202
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,080
I don't know. It seems like it migrated over from a GeoCities if I'm tracking the last

203
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:04,080
20 years of developments of discomice. I don't know. I don't know what you're waiting for,

204
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:11,200
guys. Now's the time. People need to know about Pop. That's the most unusually named one in this

205
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,640
group, Pop. It's kind of confusing when you hear his name in the special. You hear like

206
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:24,000
Poppin Todd and you're like, is his name Poppin Todd? Is it a Poppin Fresh situation? Right.

207
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,720
You don't expect some kid to be Pop. I love the name Pop though. That is a really good kid show

208
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:39,760
nickname. And then before we get into the events of the special, I felt like pretty popular. It got

209
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:50,240
like a pretty good Pop when it came out. I think largely off of the strength of there being period

210
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,480
commercials included on Disney Plus. Is that an accident? I don't know. I don't know. That's never

211
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,520
the case. How are they allowed to do it? Some of them are big brands. How are they allowed to show

212
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,880
this Coke commercial? I think it's an accident. Maybe. But I could be wrong. But how could there

213
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,640
be an accident on Disney Plus? It's maybe the one streamer that is curated because they're making

214
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,720
a point of getting rid of like when somebody smokes or says the word gay or something. They're

215
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,160
specifically eliminating all kinds of things. They have to blur out Fuzzbucket's penis.

216
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,560
They're very careful. It was a choice clearly to leave it in. I also used to work at a place that

217
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:38,240
had a lot of old tape archives and stuff. And most of those masters just had what are called

218
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:44,400
commercial blacks, which are like 10 seconds of black that you just like, that's where you on

219
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:53,680
another player would play the commercials. And then you go back to your player for the broadcast.

220
00:18:53,680 --> 00:19:01,360
So they must have dug out a master that had the commercials in it. Why would they be baked in?

221
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,880
Right. Interesting. Shake and baked in. I think that Jason's right. The master, whatever recording

222
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,480
had the whole thing and someone just went, put it up. They knew about it, putting it up, I think.

223
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,120
But I think there was like, we don't want to edit. Which I am interested in that there's a

224
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,520
YouTube account I started following that has like full blocks of program, like Saturday morning Fox

225
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:32,080
kids, Saturday morning W kids WB or like four hours of Nickelodeon with shows and commercials.

226
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,720
And I'm like, oh, this is, this is kind of more fun. 100% more fun. Yeah. If that exists,

227
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,240
you find your old tape where, you know, like I specifically think of it with like the rank

228
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,360
and best specials, Frosty the snowman, how the commercials that were part of that are as much

229
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:56,560
part of the experience as the special itself. Yeah, for sure. Did you guys have like a handful

230
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,760
of tapes that you would use to tape everything you were obsessed with or? Oh yeah. I had like

231
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,360
tapes that said like Simpsons, then it was crossed out and it was said Power Rangers on it or X-Men.

232
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,400
And I would tape this and then eventually like they all have just like 1995 SNLs on them. Yeah,

233
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,560
I do have some VHSs with SNL for sure. It was like we used to tape the sim, like we would tape

234
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,120
everything and then I've taped over these tapes like a hundred times. Oh, even in high school,

235
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,360
I would tape the daily show. Like I just had like a blurry daily show tape because I would just

236
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:34,240
record it like so much. Yeah. Well, I would hit, I'd have, I'd do SNL overnight and then try to

237
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,360
wake up before church and watch as much of it as I could. Oh sure. And then the rest of church,

238
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,240
I'd just be thinking about like, but what was the, I mean, they look, they have to have done

239
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,360
mango again. That was a big hit the last time Garth Brooks was on.

240
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:55,600
Not focusing on your religious studies and your, yeah. No, I admit it. I will confess this sin.

241
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,560
You were fantasizing about mango like what happened in the sketch.

242
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:03,920
I miss you. You're in church, you're a little boy in church and there's a mango in the,

243
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,440
like the thought bubble. Monsignor Loftus is morphing into

244
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,280
mango. He's shaking his butt at you and you're like zoned out of church.

245
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,440
Like, yeah, the way, hey, Scott, when the whole church said, amen, why'd you just, just you say

246
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:28,160
mango. Yeah. How? No, it's not that I'm attracted to him. It's that I like it for comedic purposes.

247
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:37,360
Yeah. Wow. Great. Sketch craft. I love this. Deacon Zebly turned to shake your hand and he said,

248
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:45,040
peace be with you. And you said, what is love? You're so, I think that also bumped him. You,

249
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:52,960
me, you, you mean. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well this, I mean, it makes this special so fantastic that it's,

250
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,840
it's like hurricanes to that. I mean, I wish there was more on Disney plus in this area.

251
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,000
I wish there was more. It's still we've Disney plus has been with us for a while now. And I

252
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,440
don't think that the parks content has gotten significantly better. Now there's the show

253
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,400
coming. I forget the details of the show or what it's called. I believe Padgett Brewster is the

254
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,600
narrator. The rock is involved. Oh, that's right. Okay. Yeah. Um, I mean, that'll be good. But again,

255
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,520
as I said on Twitter, I mean, they're just going to blow through all the, they're just going to do

256
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,440
space mountain. They're just going to do pirates, but when are they going to, they're not going to

257
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:34,880
take a week. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're not going to do any other fun. Yeah. They're not

258
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,160
going to, what are you, what are you talking about? Yeah. Right. So they're blow. Yeah. They're

259
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,200
going to blow this opportunity. I guess we'll talk about that when it comes out. We'll see,

260
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,680
we'll see how much content we, I mean, we could, could get a lot of content out of it, but

261
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:57,360
maybe we'll do an episode. If we give our feelings, it feels, yeah, it feels quicker thrown to get

262
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,560
like the imaginary story felt like it took years to make. That was just such a massive, yeah. Yeah.

263
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,120
A massive undertaking. So if you're comparing that, I mean, yes, it's quicker than that, but right.

264
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,600
But you can, they can pull something together. Oh, sure. I don't know how long the production

265
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,920
is last. Jason's bailing on it now. This slap dash effort. They, well, it does the announcements.

266
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:23,040
I feel like they built up the imaginary story so much. And this, I feel like there, we don't

267
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,800
know when they started making it. They could have started making it three years ago. Yeah. Yeah.

268
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:32,800
They've been making that joke. I'm not going to judge the makers of, uh, uh, the pageant

269
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:39,920
Brewster didn't even get out of bed. Oh, I like her a lot. She does a lot of great, uh, great parts

270
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:46,160
on the thrilling adventure hour. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The rock, how many cheat meals did the rock eat

271
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:55,440
during the production of this? Oh, sure. His big location scouting. So we'll see. So this let's, uh,

272
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,680
the things that happen in this. And are we going to mostly talk about the commercials? Very

273
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,320
possibly. Very possibly. I have a lot about the adults, but, uh, we can circle back around to them

274
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,760
later. Well, let's wait, Eddie, I don't think we have to tell the story of the special, but over here,

275
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,360
I'll say it really fast. Yeah. The musketeers go to Disney world to perform and they get sad and mad

276
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:22,000
at each other. That's this. They've got so sad. This is a commercial for Disney world and this

277
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:29,520
amount of tears in this sadness is, is crazy. Mixed with the lack of focus on the, the attractions,

278
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,240
like they're certainly in the mix. You see stuff, but it's like, Oh, Disney world, finally a place

279
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:42,160
to go play pinball and tennis and camp. You ruined it. You ruined camping. Now we're too upset to play

280
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:49,040
tennis. So sad. Very odd. So you would Disney world. They are behaving like actual children

281
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,200
though. I have to give them credit for that kind of like bite it back, bite it and calling each

282
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,720
other turkey and stupid, stupid. Yeah. You can tell there's a part where they just have to improvise

283
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,640
and just call each other Turkey and stupid. And they just kind of exchange like you Turkey. No,

284
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,080
you're stupid. Well, you're you stupid Turkey. Yeah. Well, you're the Turkey. You're the stupid.

285
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,920
It's probably, yeah, that's probably a good idea. Like kids improvise insults against each other.

286
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,720
Yeah. That's probably good for everyone. Self-esteem. Now do the not profane take.

287
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,120
It is. So I mean it was 77. So you look at the marketing material at that time,

288
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:30,080
they really were pushing like come to this resort, do resort activities. There is a theme park. Yes.

289
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,520
But there's, there is a sailing, there's, you know, paragliding or whatever. There's little

290
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,840
camp. This is vacation kingdom. Yeah. See a supper club show, see a cabaret show at the California

291
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:51,680
grill. You know, shopping shop, talk to boys, talk to much older boys, much older boys. Yeah.

292
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:58,240
Yeah. That was, yeah. That's weird. Yeah. Yeah. Twice your age bull cut boys that when they played

293
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,920
like some weird, like sexy music too. And then Lindsay was in the kitchen. She goes, are they

294
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,640
playing sexy music? I go, yeah, it's something weird going on. You don't even want to see. Yeah.

295
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,880
Older boy that these 12 year olds are talking to these. Mascot tears are also, uh, do much

296
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,360
bigger hair, very big hair on most of them. Uh, it is the seventies and these children, uh,

297
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,600
the appeared all be using SPF to suntan lotion. Cause they're all very tanned. Uh, I feel like,

298
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,640
yeah, that's a very seventies. Yeah. You're supposed to be outside. Yeah. You gotta be outside. And,

299
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:37,760
yeah, it's, and yeah, they're, they're talking to much, much older boys. Also the one goes into like

300
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,720
their manager's hotel room and like a towel and has like a full conversation with him.

301
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,240
That's a really strange. Yeah. Really strange as well. Yeah. Very upsetting part. Um, the, so the,

302
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:55,040
yeah, we know the, the, the Mascot tears, it's all like going to culminate in a big performance, but

303
00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:01,440
various, uh, riffs and rouse form between the Mascot tears. So will they make the big performance

304
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,640
and the people kind of keeping them on track, I guess, are their, their handlers for this episode

305
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:13,600
who are not typically part of the mic, the, the, this Mickey Mouse club show. Um, so the, I don't,

306
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,280
I don't think I have the character names. I have them. Okay. Okay. So their manager is named Mr.

307
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:26,160
Brown and he's played by an actor named Ronnie show. And then there's a reporter, uh, I believe

308
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:32,480
it is from, uh, Everglades monthly Everglades magazine, Everglades magazine. Yeah. Um,

309
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,360
initially kind of confrontational that kind of goes away in about five minutes. That character's

310
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,280
name is miss Osborne and she's played by Joanne Worley famous, uh, for her role on a Martin and

311
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,800
Rowan's laugh. Then yes, I don't know why you switched the names, but yes, what is it? A Rowan

312
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,360
and Martin, right? I always thought it was Martin and Rowan's. No, I think it's Rowan and Martin.

313
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,480
Cause I think you're thinking Martin and Lewis maybe, but I could be wrong in this one too,

314
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,360
just like Ronnie on the rock. Uh, anyway, but basically,

315
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,080
yeah, Scott's right. Oh, okay. All right. I made up for the last one. I think you're thinking of

316
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,640
Martin and Lewis. I'm probably thinking now. Yeah. Um, basically if you were on laughing,

317
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:15,200
you could just work forever. You know, you're not as big a star as necessarily as like a Goldie

318
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,120
Hawn per se, but I, a lot of them went on to very successful careers. Somebody's on Sesame street,

319
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,400
right? Was Ruth Buzzi on Sesame street? Oh, she was on yes. She's on Twitter now.

320
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,920
Follow Ruth on Twitter. How about that? The, uh, the other guy, uh, Ronnie shell, um, is on,

321
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,440
I was like, what's his deal? What's he from? He's a Gomer pile is one of them. Yes. And, uh,

322
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,120
he's still around and he is on cameo. If you want to cameo, wait, here's a little, here's a little,

323
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:52,880
the mini, uh, sooner smack down, uh, uh, cameo, uh, cock fight. Great. Uh, it's a cameo cock

324
00:28:52,880 --> 00:29:02,160
fight. How much do you think Ronnie shells going for? Uh, uh, $65 Jason. Um, I will say

325
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:11,040
$50. Uh, Mike takes it 95. 95. Really? Um, only one review though. So you don't really know what

326
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,080
you're getting. I don't know how many people have, uh, done the Ronnie shell reach out.

327
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,000
It's like, I can't, uh, exhibit, I can't endorse it, but any big mask, it's here's the Disney

328
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,120
world fans out there. Hit them up. Yeah. Here's what I found out. Uh, Ronnie shell had his own

329
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:34,400
sitcom for a season called a good morning world. Okay. Um, this, uh, like a lot of things free to

330
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:40,320
watch this whole season on the Roku channel. Good morning world. Uh, in the supporting role,

331
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:48,720
already mentioned, um, Goldie Hawn is a character in this show. Uh, uh, co-creator credit,

332
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:58,720
Carl Reiner, and a writing credit, uh, from James L. Brooks, James L. Brooks, Ronnie shell also,

333
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:07,360
uh, he is the voice of the mayor on recess, ABCs, Disney ABCs recess. Really? And, uh,

334
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,120
the weirdest credit I could find for him. This is on his Wikipedia. It was listed shell was the

335
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,600
comedy advisor to Richard Dreyfus in the 2019 Netflix movie, the last laugh, which is about

336
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:28,160
Richard Dreyfus and Chevy chase doing one last tour. Uh, uh, drug chase is Dreyfus is manager.

337
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:34,320
Dreyfus is an agent comedian. And I did not, I'm still not a hundred percent sure this movie is

338
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:41,120
real. Yeah, I had never heard of this. Um, it wasn't last laugh mania out there necessarily.

339
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,640
Yeah. Hmm. Uh, Joe, they had a comedy advisor though. That'd be the first call you should make

340
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,680
if you're making the last laugh. Oh, sure. That's interesting. Cause he has the Disney career,

341
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:55,200
but then Joanne also has some Disney credits. Yeah. Movie and she's a wardrobe in beauty and

342
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,360
the beast. Yeah. I never knew that one. Yeah. I didn't know that was that person. So they kept

343
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,720
them in the family. Her big, her like wall. That's her thing. Right. She would kind of,

344
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,720
yeah, she's cause she kicks ass. Uh, yes. Like beats the shit out of guys. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

345
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,640
That's a pretty aggressive character. Does that, that big, big dive. Um, we'll get the wardrobe,

346
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,160
wardrobe murdering off people in beauty and the beast kind of swallows them. Like she's like,

347
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:27,920
she has a second way to eat. Yeah, she can, she can eat men and she can jump on them and

348
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,640
destroy them with her weight. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I don't know the amount of oxygen that's in

349
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,680
there when she traps a person, but if there isn't much, they're dead in three days. Yeah.

350
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,760
If you, she can trap you in there, she can kill you in there or she can just redress you in there

351
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,720
too. So there's a lot of, that's right. She spits out people in different clothes, but she might

352
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:54,320
turn you into clothes. She could turn your body secretes material fabric turns you into fabric

353
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,360
and wigs. Yeah, right. She's yeah. Terrifying character. Yeah. This character was the worst

354
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,640
monster. There's a beast in that castle. Yeah, it's true.

355
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:13,040
Much bigger sins to be punished for. It turned into a worse thing. Um, so these are our players,

356
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:21,760
the stage set for the grand production. Um, yeah. So what they, all right. They, they sing on a,

357
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:28,000
the monorail, they sing a zippity doo-dah without a lot of words. Um, they're excited to be at

358
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,040
Disney world. And then, you know, the big attraction of this, and I think what makes it

359
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,360
pleasant is that you get to see a snapshot of Disney world at a really particular time.

360
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,720
Yes. Vacation kingdom time, uh, contemporary looking fantastic when it pulled, when the

361
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:47,440
monorail pulls in there and you're just looking at carpet like crazy, weird olive green, busy

362
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:55,040
ass carpet that monorail landing. That's fantastic. Um, it's, I mean, this is part of a genre that I

363
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:01,680
like a lot, which is like thin plot disguising that the thing is just a hotel commercial. Yes.

364
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:07,440
Cause these are great. There's a, like, there's such a good, say by the bell that's in a Palm

365
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,640
desert Marriott, just showing you how it has a boat that pulls into the hotel and the scene,

366
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:18,480
scene just stops cold. So you can watch a boat slowly pull up. Everyone gets safely out of the

367
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,840
boat, wait for them. Now the cast goes in just the most dead air I've ever seen on anything.

368
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,400
Um, I need to, I mean, that's why I love part of why I love the Disney world episodes of any of the

369
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,000
TGI. Yeah. If you're just getting like big hotel ads, they're like, all right, and this one,

370
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,920
we have to remind people about vacation club, step-by-step is a big family. So they need a

371
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,840
vacation club house and this one, you know, family matters. Maybe they camp, maybe they want a

372
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,080
different vibe. So they camp like they always have to like assign the different shows. What do we

373
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,840
highlight? And that's sort of what's happening. Disney world's small enough at this point that

374
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,960
they kind of showed everything. They showed the marketplace. They showed the camp zone. Um,

375
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,760
it's a good thing they added more stuff is my takeaway. I think Disney world's like a two day

376
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,960
trip at this point in time. Oh yeah. Yeah. I think my parents went down in the seventies and they

377
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,560
were like, yeah, there was a match to do when the park closed at night. Yeah. Yeah. You went to

378
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:16,080
dinner and then to bed like, or you found a bar gelatin. Yeah. Yeah. You chased your chicken

379
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:21,680
out of king with gelatin and you bought a crate of citrus because that was still very novel to

380
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,480
send fresh citrus home. This is a multi you've talked about citrus on this one of your favorite

381
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,520
guys. One of my favorite details that the contemporary resort, one of the marketing was like,

382
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:37,120
and our gifts are we have a menswear store and you can buy a crate of fresh citrus to send home.

383
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,600
It's neck and neck with bicentennial of like when Jason, when we, all right, it's in the cell,

384
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:47,200
like the balls coming in. It's, I think I can catch this one. Yeah. Yeah. It's citrus. When

385
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,720
did they stop the citrus? When did they stop giving you a crate of citrus? Do we know?

386
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,600
I don't know. Somebody snuck a bunch of orange bombs on the plane. Oh,

387
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,640
is there a yesterland? Has Kevin Perger done an episode on like a crate of citrus yet?

388
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:11,040
Defunct land? Yeah. You said yesterland? I said them both. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. I was just doing

389
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,360
both. Either one. Yeah. All right. All right. I know which one is which. All right. Yesterland.

390
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,920
I know Kevin Perger is defunct land. I was saying them both. I look at them both.

391
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:25,440
No, he'll explain. Yeah. There was some like, you know, look at told in 1982

392
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:32,800
hair disaster and a pilot got blinded by citrus in the eye. It's not entirely accurate. I feel

393
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,800
like he didn't used to pitch himself down and now he does. He just, he does have a deep voice

394
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,520
though. Sure. Yeah. He's joked about that before. Yeah. Well, he's, we're giving him an idea and

395
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:48,000
maybe it'll be another documentary about the crate of citrus from the contemporary. Six years go by.

396
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,240
No one's done, I mean, no one's done it, Jason. Look into this. Let's do an episode on the crate

397
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,520
of citrus. Let's stop fucking around here. I'm sure it's just refrigeration got a lot more sustainable.

398
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,080
I think you're gonna, I think you can get to the heart of it. Transportation,

399
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:04,320
refrigerated trucks and train cars. I'd like to promise the audience right now, a Patreon,

400
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:13,680
90 minutes long about the contemporary citrus crates, Jason and someone who's researching it.

401
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,680
Jason does the work. He just got a thick notebook.

402
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,200
The book is full of pages.

403
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:30,960
Citrus. Okay. Back to the musketeers. Yeah. Okay. So what's going on? Where things are,

404
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,200
get fraught, I think pretty fast. I don't like, what's the first, the instigating thing

405
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,360
where they just like, one of them is taking a picture of the other ones and then just makes

406
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:48,640
them go like, Hey, keep stepping back and back and back. And they're on a dock. So all the kids

407
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,200
are like three kids fall off. And then the rest of them just start pushing each other or

408
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,000
jumping willingly. I don't know. There's some dock incident that just ruins the trip for everybody.

409
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,640
But seven minutes in, they never get it together. So the fractured and it's weird because I don't

410
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,760
know them as friends. I don't know what it's like when there's harmony. So why are you, why are you

411
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,680
fighting so fast? And then what are we preserving? What's like, what's nice when the musketeers are

412
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,960
together? Right. It's like Avengers one and two, they're together in those. And then civil war

413
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,600
happens, Avengers civil war. And then you, they break up and then it's more tragic that way. But

414
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,960
this justice, they break, this is the start. Now the Avengers have a restaurant on the cruise ship

415
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,240
and now things are better because they're all serving us quality dining options. What the hell

416
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:43,440
is that thing? Yeah. It's their party down arc. You know what I mean though? There's like, they

417
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:50,000
just announced the encounter. There's an ant man dinner. Ant man is responsible for this food

418
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:57,120
too. Avengers is in the, I think it is mostly an ant man. I think it's like the, the, the new restaurant.

419
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:04,160
Yeah. But it's, it's, but it's called Avengers quantum encounter. Okay. Wait, wait. So, so it's

420
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,720
the same gimmick of like the same food, small and big food, I think, but it's Avengers. No,

421
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,840
I think maybe they make, I think there's some like sleight of hand where it's like a regular

422
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:20,080
something happens at a regular cupcake. It's suddenly a big cupcake. Okay. Can we get it?

423
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,240
Can we look at a menu for this? I don't think that's out yet. Oh, it's coming. I don't think

424
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,440
this ship is sailing until 2022. No, there'll be, there'll be a countdown to the menu.

425
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,440
Unveil. Well, that's 90 minutes. That's the, that's the normie us podcast is like, all right,

426
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,840
the quantum encounter menu is landing in five days. Let's make some predictions.

427
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,880
Like 20, 10 minutes of 10 minutes, 10 seconds of like ambience.

428
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,200
Yes. So much music. Why? And then get a load of the frosting on this one.

429
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:02,640
Yeah. And then it's multi-millionaires. We're so rich. We all dress. You're in bright yellow.

430
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:10,240
Jason's in lime green and I'm in a, I'm in citrus orange. Wait, we have to dress like the

431
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:18,080
polymonyx free. That's what I think about Disney YouTubers. It's bright as colors. They are,

432
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:23,760
they're, they're a power rangers. Yeah. Tommy, Bahama. It's a lot of Tommy Bahama. Let's be

433
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,720
honest with you. Yeah. Jason, one of these days is just going to have to switch permanently too.

434
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,080
As far as look, although Scott actually honestly wears more close to Tommy Bahama stuff. It's like

435
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:39,280
I currently have the three of us. Yeah. But I like, I like the floral stuff too, but I don't have,

436
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,680
yeah. Tommy Bahama is like half Hawaiian shirt, half bowling shirt. I feel like it's like bowling

437
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:51,120
thick, you know, like those like nicer nineties bowling shirts people were. I, yeah. I, my dad

438
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,760
is more of the Hawaiian kind of Tommy Bahama stuff, but if you don't buy it at an outlet, like if you

439
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,920
buy it at a time, Bahamas, it's cost of fortune. Oh, I know. Yeah. So anyway, we'll be there soon.

440
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:09,680
That'll be a 30 minute video too. Tommy Bahama too pricey. Let's break down the 12 rings.

441
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,560
And pricey like Jason's face, like, like holding up like a, or no, he's pulling his pockets out

442
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:22,320
too pricey. Oh God. There's nothing better than YouTube preview. Uh, you know, little, uh, thumbnails.

443
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:29,920
What the fuck is up with them? I'm sorry. I was making YouTube videos in 2007 and I was like,

444
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,720
starting to see that happen. Like wait, wait, what, what's going on? Like now I have a popular

445
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,840
video. You have to be looking like a goon and making cross eyes and like it never went away.

446
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:45,600
It's decades of this crap. Like how can people handle that being their base aesthetic of what

447
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,440
they watch? Yeah. People like making little face like, did I just toot?

448
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:58,080
If you're, yeah, you really, everyone could just have the, did I just toot face?

449
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,120
And that would pretty much like read like whatever you want for whatever your title or your video

450
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:09,200
was. This might be a ham fisted segue, but truly I like as though we're finding every opportunity

451
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,960
to get away from the special, the general venue, the slow, like, uh, sort of, uh, um,

452
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,960
is it kind of still slow pace veneer, like, uh, a non flashy veneer of as nice seventies thing

453
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,720
as opposed to like hyperactive too much edited. Uh, it is nice to just take a little trip into

454
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,800
like dull Brown 77. Yeah. Yeah. That's something pleasant about it. Very flat, but in a better way.

455
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I like some of the Disney YouTubers, but it is funny that it's all in the

456
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:46,800
same genre. It's all in the same vibe. YouTube rewards you making the stretching your eyeballs

457
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,640
out as far as they can go outside of your face without falling out. You look like the mask without

458
00:41:52,640 --> 00:42:01,760
the mask. And when you're doing a picture for YouTube thumbnail, that's the YouTube mask reviews.

459
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:07,440
Yeah. The mask maniacs. If you can get your eyes out a little bit out of your head,

460
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,280
your views go up so much more significantly than the algorithm. You can get like pop your eyeballs

461
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,680
out of your sockets. Let's, I think we should talk about some commercials because I think we're going

462
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,480
to be more excited to talk commercial. I think that's what's going to keep us magnetized to the

463
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,080
special. Um, I mean, cause you don't know what you're going to, when you hear that, that there's

464
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:30,240
going to be seventies commercials, you know, you sort of know what seventies commercials are, but

465
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,480
famous ones. And I don't know any of these, like just call out ones that you like. I, I like the,

466
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:44,400
the, the Tonka toy van. It's just like the custom van, custom van, custom van, custom van. And they're

467
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,720
like, you can put action figures in it. And it's literally just like, it's a brown van. You're

468
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,920
getting some of your like stoner buddies into a brown van to drive across the country with like

469
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,520
to get away from your old lady or something. Like it's so dazed and confused. Yes. A hundred percent

470
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:05,760
weird thing. It's just not a vibe of van you expect to see done as a toy for children. And

471
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,720
it doesn't have like, you know, a weapon, like a GI Joe thing. It has just like, it's got a rug.

472
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,000
Yeah. And Tonka is all like trucks, like it's from historically. I'm sure there are other Tonka

473
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,120
vehicles that are not trucks, but Tonka, when we were growing up, Tonka Thomas, the popular

474
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:29,760
YouTuber, 10 million followers is going to nail your ass on that one. Here's why podcast or Mike

475
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:38,400
Carlson is wrong. Just trucks. All right. So in this July episode of podcast, Rensen and Gain,

476
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:45,280
Michael says, um, pretty weird stuff. Yeah. So I, you know, well, did you have a Tonka truck?

477
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,640
Did anybody have a Tonka truck? Yeah, of course. Yeah. I definitely had a truck phase. Yeah. But

478
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,920
yeah, they were making like hippie vans in the seventies. Yeah, that is kind of what it is.

479
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,560
Yeah, for sure. Which I was, I was not like, I was like, where are they going with this commercial?

480
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,280
And then it was like Tonka. And I was like, wow. Um, it's great. You gotta, you gotta get shake and

481
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,480
bake and shake and bake was very satisfying. That seems very seventies to me. I mean, I ate shake and

482
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,520
bake a lot. We had shake and bake a lot growing up and so much shake out far too much. I'm not

483
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:20,240
gonna complain. I never complained about shaking, but I was always this weird kind of baked kind of

484
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,400
fried, but I was like, yeah, it's fine with me. Yeah. When was the last time you had it?

485
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,040
I don't know. A few years ago, maybe once when I was home visiting, my mom made a shake and bake

486
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,600
thing. I don't know that we ever had it. I mean, we had all like versions of it, but I don't think

487
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:42,240
we actually had shake and bake brand. So, uh, Gainsburgers, Gainsburgers dog food. That is so

488
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:48,720
weird. That's early in the show. Set up on that one of like, we left our dog, uh, we're going on

489
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,800
vacation. We left our dog with his other family had a dog so they could make puppies.

490
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,880
And so Gainsburgers dog food. If you want them to rut, feed them Gainsburgers.

491
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,040
Yeah. Weird. This, uh, Gainsburgers makes your dog horny. Kind of a, kind of a pre adopt don't shop

492
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:17,040
era, you know, in terms of pets. Uh, yeah. Weird. Um, I, yeah. What else you got in there?

493
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:25,840
Litten meal in one microwave. Oh yeah. That's, that's such a weird product. It appears to be

494
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:32,400
a countertop convection oven. They say microwave and I think microwave were very, very buzzy

495
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:39,280
in the seventies and, um, it looks more like a convection oven to be like a quick oven sort

496
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,080
of thing, but like it was a whole roast and vegetables. They stuck in at the same time.

497
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:50,160
Yeah. This is like big, thick asparagus and a big thing. I like rosemary potatoes and then a full

498
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,120
pot roast all going in the same microwave. Are you sure?

499
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,360
And like all food for the seventies, it looks like shit, man. It looks awful.

500
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:10,080
Everyone must've felt so bad all the time. Every day. Um, uh, I really like the, it's a really

501
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:19,360
inexplicable ad. The, the, it's a Coke ad where two girls rent a boat. There's a sign on a boat

502
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:26,560
that says tug for rent and then it cuts to them sloppily painting it while a, uh, an old sailor

503
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:32,720
laughs like he's the guy who rented it, I guess. And he points and smiles and laughs and they,

504
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,920
they paint the word Sue Ann on the boat and I don't know why maybe that's one of their names

505
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:44,240
or both of their names together, but just like, you know, cute girls having fun and then a sailor

506
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,720
cackling. And I'm like, I don't trust that way. If this thing ever gets away from the dock,

507
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,360
I think this sailor's killing Sue and Ann. Oh yeah. Don't turn about Sue and Ann.

508
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:58,400
Do not trust that sailor for sure. No matter how much she's laughing. Yeah,

509
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,040
no laughing could be malicious. No matter how much Coke he drinks, that doesn't make him a friend.

510
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,360
No brand loyalty does not make someone trustworthy.

511
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:14,720
And that's the boats, the tug boats just spew and smoke at the end. Oh yeah. This is a mistake.

512
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:21,280
I think it's the beginning of the sinking. Yeah, yeah, for sure.

513
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,040
They had to get this, they're like, we're going to get this shot real quick here.

514
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,800
This thing's going down. It's the Reno and when making the commercial, the sailor actor started,

515
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:40,480
he like unmoored the boat. Oh yeah. You're coming with me sailing this commercial boat to Mexico.

516
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:47,120
So these are nice breaks and you need them because like, again, the show is extremely

517
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:53,600
melancholy. You're excited because you're seeing like an arcade and it's great to see. I love

518
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:59,120
seeing that arcade. It's all pinball and yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's great. Clanky machines. What's

519
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:03,280
the special we taught? Was it a Christmas special that like when we did this Christmas special

520
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,320
episode where one of them was like this, I think it was a seventies one was really melancholy.

521
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:12,160
Was this just maybe the vibe in the late seventies with all of these specials

522
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:17,520
where like we need to make them sad? That just might have been. Everything was just so

523
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:24,320
heartfelt and drippy and kind of like, I believe I was looking up in my looking up 1977 stuff. I

524
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:29,040
believe you light up my life was the number one song at this point in time, if I'm not incorrect.

525
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,240
And that's like, everything felt kind of like that. Yeah. Like that's like a sad song. That's

526
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:40,400
a bummer. You don't willingly put that on. So every commercial is just these soaring,

527
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,160
extremely sincere anthems. Yeah. So that was just the vibe going. That was the advertising vibe,

528
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:51,120
which is why they wanted to make sure there were plenty of child's tears in the special to make

529
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,760
families attracted to Disney world. Well, it's like, you know, we don't exactly have to

530
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,960
super recap this. I mean, the thing that the, oh, go ahead. I was just going to say very quickly,

531
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,840
I think my favorite part of the special is that there's a basically a commercial for river country

532
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:11,200
and it's my favorite thing. I think I'm a whole, oh no, tied for my favorite thing. I think we know

533
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,520
what probably my favorite thing is, even though it's dumb as hell. I think that song is in

534
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,080
something else because that came on the special. We first time we watched it and Jane knew all the

535
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:24,160
words and I was like, why do you know all the words? We need to look into that because I like

536
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:29,600
the song is fun and kind of jaunty. Yeah. They just show clips of people going down a slide,

537
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:35,440
a river country, which is the first water park at Disney. A big traffic jam on that slide. Like a

538
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,720
lot of kids messing around, goofing around. And they keep reusing this shot of like an older man

539
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,800
in shorts. That's like thrown off of an inner tube. It's like he's reaching for the intertube

540
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,120
and they use it a multiple times and they don't even do a good job in like the clip show way of

541
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:55,040
like zooming in this time or flipping, flopping the shot. It's literally the same thing. River

542
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:04,320
country. Big river country is a blast. It's a drive. It's a, you can swim and splash and dive.

543
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:09,120
I thought that, okay, this is what the most of the special is going to be like songs about the things

544
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:13,760
you can do. Well, you were a little bit right. Cause that tune is very similar to the poo

545
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,920
polka later in the show. Speaking of my other thing, the other thing, my other favorite thing,

546
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:26,960
of course, is the poo polka, which is, I don't think is that clipped somewhere? Cause I looked

547
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,720
at it and all I could find was other people breaking down this special on YouTube. Okay.

548
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:36,560
I'm not sure how many people know about the poo polka is what I'm saying. We can pull it. We can

549
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:45,280
highlight the moment. Yeah. Yeah. So like, yeah, the group is fracturing on their trip and they're

550
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:52,560
consulting with each other and towels and hotel rooms and Corey Feldman's sister pretends to be

551
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:58,160
sick to get her friends to come visit her and give her ice cream and cookies and candy. Oh, yes.

552
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,920
That line, maybe the line of the show for me, cookies, candy and ice cream will do it to you

553
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:11,280
every time. Can't disagree with that. That's your yearbook quote. That's my back tattoo. Full back.

554
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:22,480
But I like, so I don't know. They like, they're having trouble finding each other. I feel like a

555
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,800
lot of times, but then they all, they all end up together on, on like a camping trip. They go to the

556
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:34,000
the camping area, which I feel very disconnected from that you could camp at Disney world and not

557
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,120
just like a camping themed hotel, but that you would just legit camping. Yeah. Well, they're,

558
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:44,800
they're dropped off in an empty field and then they appear to camp on a beach. I don't know if

559
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:50,400
you could ever camp right on the beach. Maybe I'm wrong. I've been at my, it was like in the early

560
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:56,080
days, it was probably really lawless. Oh yeah. I mean, the early days are like, come to our beaches,

561
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:01,200
swim in Bay Lake, just walk right in. They were doing that as we know a couple of years ago. Yeah.

562
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,840
But yeah, so there was still like, it was pretty loose. I mean, there was like, we were

563
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,360
a couple of years ago when we went, when Lindsay and I went, we were driving the boat, driving the

564
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,560
boat around and I was like, I think we could just get out and get into river country because it would

565
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,720
it was still there. They hadn't demolished it yet and people had snuck in before. So it's like,

566
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,760
you can still do a lot of stuff you shouldn't be doing on those on the ground. We probably could

567
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,720
have gotten off at discovery Island. They do in the special. Well, Jason and I took a nice little

568
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:34,320
boat ride last night when we were there. Yeah. And this was a big thing in your family. Yes. We would

569
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:39,520
ride the boats. Yeah. We would drive the boats and my mom was like, you're not old enough to do it.

570
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,480
So she had to drive the boat. And then my dad let my three years younger sister drive the boat.

571
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,920
With him in it. And I was so upset. It's like, my mom was like, we got, must follow the rules.

572
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,800
But then my dad didn't give a shit. And he let my little sister drive three years younger. Also,

573
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,720
I mean, we were adults, but they really didn't ask us very many questions. Those boats are pretty

574
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,160
much bumper car based controls. You know, they're pretty simple. What do you mean? You wanted them

575
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:07,360
to like question us. I think we had to sign one waiver and they were just like, that's, that's go.

576
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:14,400
That's reverse. Yeah. Avoid a wake, avoid the wakes of large boats. Yeah. No, we didn't get

577
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,120
like a boat safety course or anything. No, not at all. We were just, yeah. It's too bad. You want

578
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:24,080
like a something hosted by a character. Oh my gosh. Yeah. At least it'd be a little video.

579
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,400
Goofy's sinking his boat. One of Goofy how to videos where he's bad at whatever he's trying

580
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,440
to teach you. Yeah. Yeah. That would be great. But yeah, obviously I don't think it's too lazy to

581
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:39,680
make a video. So popular of a thing to do there. Yeah, not anymore at the time seemingly.

582
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:46,000
But they go, they go camping and then the whole kind of the crux is that there's this girl,

583
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:53,440
Nita, who gets picked on a lot, seemingly is kind of a more timid seeming character.

584
00:53:53,440 --> 00:54:01,520
And she's told to tie the rope that holds the tent up to something solid. And she goes off and

585
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,960
sees a car bumper and that's pretty solid. A car is pretty solid. So she ties the rope and ties a

586
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:12,800
second rope to the same thing. And then, but they didn't know, she didn't know whose car it was. And

587
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:20,880
the car pulls away, says just married on it. Wasn't with them. So the whole tent comes unraveled.

588
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:26,720
And that's a bummer. That's right. Cause if you're camping overnight, that kind of messes it up.

589
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:33,040
Everybody, everybody kind of takes it like she got one of the Mouseketeers killed. Yes.

590
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:41,200
Yeah. Very sorted scene. Everyone is so mad. One of them yells, what kind of a scramble brain idiot

591
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:49,760
are you? It's a little intense. Yeah. It's a little intense. And Nita is, or Nita is very little.

592
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:56,160
Yeah. Like she is not one of the older ones. Yeah. Absolutely. Um, she,

593
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:02,240
the, the, I think the saddest part of the whole thing is when a girl very seriously says,

594
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:10,960
you ruined our camping trip. And then Nita just sobs. She just sobs and sobs. And it's a very like

595
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:22,160
squealy like, ah, it's such tears of sorrow again. And this is everyone's ad for vacation. Nightmare

596
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,080
is when the kid is crying. You don't want that. The kids upset, the kids are fighting. The siblings

597
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:31,760
are fighting and like it's unpleasant. Why remind parents that this is of course, what's going to

598
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:37,600
happen? Well, Ms. Osborne is impressed. Like she, like I said, the reporter is confrontational. Joanne

599
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:42,480
Worley is confrontational initially. And then she goes shopping with the girls for like three

600
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:49,280
minutes and she's like, Oh, they actually do like each other. And they kissed and made up. Okay.

601
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:54,880
Like that. Any of her doubt is like immediately cleansed. And then she like mildly flirts with

602
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:00,480
the manager at some point it's, but they don't really dig in on that. At some point she's like,

603
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:06,320
we could go on my favorite ride, the sky ride, or if that's too much, the teacup ride. And that would

604
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,960
never fly nowadays. Just calling it the sky ride or the teacup or whatever. You know what it is.

605
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,960
Two wrong names. Right. It's the laziness with which this is, this is being done.

606
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:23,680
That did predict though, forcing their like child actor employees of like, okay, so you're coming

607
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,200
and you're getting this perk, but we need you to post. We need you to take a lot of pictures.

608
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,520
Although I don't know if she ever got the pictures. She was mostly getting them to fall off the dock.

609
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:37,840
So yeah, who knows? I don't, we don't know how the Everglades magazine story ended up. Yeah. A little

610
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:43,840
too chummy PR and journalism for me. Well, I think it's weird. Yeah. If this is essentially,

611
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:49,200
if the guy is her, is the Mascoteers publicist and then there's an unrelated photographer who's

612
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:55,760
trying to dig up dirt about, do the Mascoteers get along or not? Then what, like these, some random

613
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,560
photographer and a publicist all end up camping with them. And that was, and suddenly like the,

614
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:07,360
your publicist is in like, okay, now tie up the rope. But like, how is that the job of a publicist?

615
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:12,800
Yeah. They didn't want to add another actor to the call sheet. Mr. Harrison is the third adult. He

616
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:18,960
is not really developed. He's more of the hard ass executive and a funny beat in the camping

617
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,920
is that they're just kind of camping. And then from out of the darkness, Mr. Harrison just comes

618
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:29,920
out in a full suit, just comes out of the darkness. It was like, you'd better have these Mascoteers

619
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:40,640
together. He helicoptered in. Very strange. Yeah. This, this Nita sobbing. And then I was like,

620
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,560
who's this actress? Cause she's pretty good in this. She sells it. She seems genuinely

621
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:51,200
sad. And then I looked up her IMDB and there's a personal quote on her IMDB. And the quote is,

622
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:56,560
I don't know if I would recommend show business for a child. It's very stressful. Yeah.

623
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,200
I mean, where's the lie?

624
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,880
I guess this may have been a genuinely morose experience. Yeah. The director like yelling

625
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:14,240
or like, you're not making me sad enough. I don't feel that you're sad. You're ruining our film.

626
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:21,920
We're here. What kind of a, what was the phrase? What did the idiot scramble brain?

627
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,280
And what kind of a scramble brain idiot are you child actor?

628
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:32,160
Meanwhile, Todd and pop are just calling each other turkeys for hours. Just driving everyone

629
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,760
insane. And then that's this part. I know if I've brought up this special before,

630
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:42,560
cause that's such a weird moment in the, uh, how there were, there used to be the lap seating and

631
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:47,680
more attractions. And it was, I saw this special a long time ago when they would show weird old

632
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:52,960
specials on the Disney channel. And I remember how weird it struck me at the time. Like these,

633
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:59,040
these two guys who were having this argument, they're calling each other stupid and Turkey.

634
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:05,520
And then they get on to space mountain and was sitting in each other's laps and keep arguing.

635
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:10,320
It's just the strangest scenario to be in a fight with somebody who's in your lap.

636
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:16,240
Yeah. That's sort of like the Larry bird basketball shorts too. It's just an extremely

637
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,320
awkward little, little moment. It is that they were on space one before I knew it.

638
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,960
All of a sudden I was like, Oh, Oh, it's space mountain. Yeah. And they play a lot of the good

639
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:30,960
space mountain like sounds that twinkling kind of sounds. And then afterwards they're like,

640
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:37,040
the rest of the crew is in tomorrow land and you know, their managers like we're a pop and Todd.

641
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:42,000
And it's like, Oh, this is going to be, Oh no. Then they just run in a frame. And most conflicts

642
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,000
initially are resolved before the Nito, you know, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Hers is the one that goes the

643
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,800
longest and that kind of leads to, you know, everybody starts looking for her and they aren't

644
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:58,080
going to perform without her. They immediately the next morning, clearly in the light of day,

645
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:05,200
they regret being insanely mean to her and they there's mascots here camaraderie. We got to find

646
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:10,240
her, but she's kind of off in every possible corner, avoiding everybody. And she has this,

647
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,560
the context of this little musical number is really funny where she's kind of, is it like she's,

648
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:22,000
she's like imagining something better happening with her Mouseketeer friends.

649
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:26,880
Is that what, is that what the polka is? She's like, yeah, I guess they're really

650
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:32,560
fucked with the Mouseketeers. Boy, I wish something fun was going on. And then she drifts away.

651
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:37,360
It's like under the sea, maybe like, yeah, better if I was doing the polka with poo.

652
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:43,760
If only I was in a little indoor stage doing the poo polka with the big weird honey pot poo.

653
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:51,680
Yes. Who wakes her up? I think she dreams him and then wakes her up. She probably is just like

654
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:56,960
delirious because children aren't supposed to like stay awake all night and then get into a theme park

655
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:02,960
before it opens. Like a pre-opening magic kingdom, the sun is still coming up. It's who's down.

656
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:08,320
It's still very wet. I think she snuck out. I think she like swam for it. Yes. She just jumped

657
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:15,280
in the lake and then crawled out a part where she crossed the train tracks. She smuggled her way into

658
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:21,680
the kingdom. And then honey pot poo gives her some reassurances and then doesn't narc on her.

659
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:30,160
She goes like, don't tell my friends where I am. And he plays dumb. Yeah, which is easy because he

660
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:36,160
can't speak. Right. Yeah. So that works out okay. I don't know if I like that honey pot poo or not.

661
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:41,040
I kind of do, but I don't like when he like wiggles his mouth around. He's odd. I mean,

662
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:47,040
I have affection for him because we did see footage of him when we were kids. I don't think,

663
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,440
what was, do I have a picture with him? I don't think so. I'm pretty sure I don't. Yeah. But I

664
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:58,720
definitely, he was on specials on Disney channel. So I have nostalgia affection for him, but yes,

665
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:06,160
there's a hundred better poo bears, I think, than this one. It's an aggressive mouth. He looks kind

666
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:12,000
of crazed. He almost looks a little rabid. I'm looking at one where his, he's got like,

667
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:20,240
the whites of his eyes are actually like, they're brown, which looks really, I mean,

668
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:25,120
it's like, it's how you represent a cartoon character on acid or something. It's pretty freaky.

669
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,880
Yeah. The honey, it's like, I'm trying to bring up a picture. There is like a,

670
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:36,720
not HR puff and stuff, but maybe like Sid and Marty Croft elements to it, but that might've

671
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,600
just been like seventies costumed mascots that's in my head. Yeah. Just the vibe in general. Yeah.

672
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:49,520
It's just this weird here. I got to look, here's a little, a little jiff of him. Like just like his

673
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:55,040
mouth is caving in on itself. Yeah. And he'd wiggle in this weird way. I don't know. I think

674
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:00,320
he's a, I think he's a creep. There's, you know what they haven't, I would say that none of the poo

675
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:08,080
mascot walk around characters have completely nailed like the perfect Disney poo. Like I'm

676
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:13,200
looking at all of them now and they're not, there's something lacking in it. I feel like

677
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:19,840
they've really gotten Mickey and Minnie down goofy, but poo still even, he kind of looks strange.

678
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:25,840
Who is animated in a very fluid fashion and that's kind of hard to do with a stiff, you know,

679
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:32,240
because like, this is modern poo in the parks and he's not, he's cute. Something off though,

680
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:37,040
but there's something off about it. And there's nothing like poo is a drawing. The classic Disney

681
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:45,280
poo is so like delightful and cute, but like they have not been able to completely capture that.

682
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:50,720
Yeah. They at least finally captured that he doesn't have brown eyes. I don't know what's,

683
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:58,640
Google this audience. If you're 70s poo costume. No, I don't. Well, does he have brown eyes? I can't

684
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:03,440
tell from here. Yes, he does. It looks like he's like high out of his mind. He looks really baked.

685
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:11,120
I'm coming around on him. There's something to appreciate about this character, but it doesn't

686
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:17,280
like he's not Winnie the Pooh. Yeah. Some weird maniac who stole his shirt. Yeah. The way the poo

687
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,840
around this time would have a shirt that says poo on it. Right. And it's almost like he's wearing

688
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:28,240
that to convince you that he is poo. Right. Right. Is it like, he's like, clear. How could I not be?

689
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:35,520
So on my shirt, I'll say this about this poo in the poker scene, he does some dance and he like

690
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:41,280
kind of keeps up. And I have to say those kids are good dancers. Like they are dancing laps around

691
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:48,080
the damn Brady bunch variety. Well, but this is the lowest bar. Yeah. That's a pretty low bar.

692
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:56,480
They're just like waving their arms better than Robert Reed and a high Susan. Yeah. Yeah.

693
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:04,480
But this is a better seventies kind of variety sort of vibe. Yeah. Things sort of, you know,

694
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:10,240
get resolved. There's like a very low speed chase. The boat shows off all of the, yeah, they show

695
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:15,600
off that there are boats. They show off that there is discovery Island, that there is a place to see

696
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:25,120
animals. And it's the energy is not so much. It's all very casual, but it works out. There's like

697
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:31,680
10 minutes to go before the show is going on. It's still unclear if need is going to be part of it.

698
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:38,560
And they cut it so down to the wire that she ends up performing in plain clothes. She is not in her

699
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:45,760
seventies, Mouseketeer, aggressive rainbow jumpsuit. This is what they're all wearing.

700
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:53,680
And you sort of, this is this kind of, the finale sort of puts the puzzle together because you are

701
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:58,080
like, okay, so what, so what are they good at? Are you kind of get it with the poop polka? You

702
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:02,400
hear them sing, but the singing is just kind of shouting. You get this big musical number and it's

703
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:08,560
a big musical number about friends in front of the castle. Do you think, do we think that this number

704
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:13,920
lives up to the expectations that we might have for the, for these Mouseketeers?

705
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:20,000
The expectations we have for the Mouseketeers may be of the special after we've seen the river

706
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,840
country song with the man, the repeated footage and then the poop polka. I would say no, I don't

707
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:32,080
think this is, this doesn't top the poop polka for me or, or the, even the river country montage.

708
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:38,800
Yeah, poop polka I think is the highest of their abilities in this special. The river country one

709
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:44,400
is probably the most fun. But it does, I mean, yeah, the final, final number definitely, it doesn't

710
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:50,400
sound like the Simpsons Hooray for everything, but it's got the vibe of it. Yeah. Yeah.

711
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,840
Which I appreciate that. But as far as like holding my interest, the other two, I liked better.

712
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:01,280
It's definitely riding on the fact that it's in front of the castle. Yes. Like that's the,

713
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:08,320
that's the spectacle. Yeah. I kind of like the lyrics of the song about that, how friends are

714
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:14,000
like jewels in a ring. That's fun. That's good. Yeah. I'm not saying there's nothing redeeming.

715
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:20,240
Jewels in a ring. Friends are like money in the bank and the same line of it's gotta be a good

716
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:28,480
situation. I, it's extremely seventies. It's extremely just like Coca-Cola ad company

717
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:36,320
seventies. I think it maybe doesn't stand out from the rest of it. It's so just all

718
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:41,840
seventies theme parky entertainment. Yeah. It maybe doesn't set itself apart like other mouse,

719
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:45,760
Mickey Mouse clubs did. Right. And they maybe, yeah, they weren't, they were just trying to,

720
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,880
they were trying to, you know, chase trends here. They weren't trying to innovate.

721
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:55,040
Yeah. We're doing their own thing. We do get a preview on next week's wide world.

722
01:07:55,040 --> 01:08:01,600
Yes. Whenever we're out of Disney, the, I think it's from, it's from the late sixties, Bullwhip

723
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:08,720
Griffin starring Suzanne Plachette. Oh yes. Roddy McDowell and Carl Malden. Also I looked up in

724
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:17,440
this movie is an actor named Joby Baker, who was the co-star on Good Morning World with Ronnie

725
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:24,320
Shell. Wow. Yeah. Wow. We also left out the ad for the movie Run Cougar Run. Yes. Run Cougar

726
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:31,520
won one of their nature ones or is it a scripted one? It's in Utah. The idyllic existence of a

727
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:36,640
mountain lion family is threatened when tourists bent on sport hunting Cougars make their appearance.

728
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:42,480
This is such a rough and tumble trailer and you can tell this is the kind of movie where,

729
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:49,120
all right, it's time for the Cougar to jump the crevasse. All right. Who's throwing the Cougar

730
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:57,920
this time? Who draws the short straw? All right. All right, Billy, go for it. There's, there's a

731
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:03,920
whole like swath of people who wrangled animals in the seventies who were like,

732
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:12,000
curse that ASPCA warning. I know we, there's no animals were harmed in the making. We can't do

733
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,760
anything good anymore. All our tricks are out the window. Did you see? I can't drop a bunch of

734
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:24,160
foxes from an airplane. Yeah. They couldn't get us a flying squirrel. So put this regular squirrel

735
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:31,360
on a lawn dart and just throw a horse. Can't jump off a diving board no more.

736
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:40,080
What happened to this country? Uh, this is why we lost the war. Give a bunch of booze to a bunch of

737
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:49,760
chimpanzees. Tell them to start swinging. See what happens. Give them real guns. Dress them as a

738
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:56,640
baseball team and have them play a game. Chimmy Carter's America. Did you see the clip of,

739
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:00,720
I forget which James Bond movie that was going around like last week or two weeks ago? No. From

740
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:06,080
the making of one of the movies, James Bond jumps on the back of five crocodiles and I,

741
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:11,680
unless it's alligators, crocodiles are alligators. And they showed the guy who did it for real was

742
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:18,320
like a wrangler, like a crocodile. And he missed four times. He fell in and the thing is like biting

743
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:23,760
his foot. Like you can see it gets like one of the takes he gets his, the alligator or crocodile

744
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:29,200
gets a tooth into his boot and he's pulling at it. And he, from the fifth time he finally jumped

745
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:34,800
like a cartoon on the backs of all of these, uh, real life animals. I'm sorry. This is like,

746
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:40,320
this is a guy, this is a James Bond stunt double. So is he dressed as, yes, he's dressed as James

747
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:47,680
Bond. He was like a tuxedo. Uh, yeah. Suit, not a tuxedo, a suit of some kind. Nice suit.

748
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:52,000
He's all slicked back and keeps falling into a crocodile. He keeps falling into water

749
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,800
with crocodiles. I'll, I'll show it to you probably later, but if you haven't seen it,

750
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:04,560
find it somewhere. Um, yeah, very funny. A crocodile's journey next week on the

751
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:14,880
wonderful world of just stepping on crocodiles. All right. So somebody, we need somebody to

752
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:20,720
toss the crocodile out of the building right before the implosion starts. Throw the crocodile

753
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:26,000
and you jump out the other side. There's a, uh, there's a cushion for you. There's a big inflatable

754
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,000
thing for you. The crocodile. I can't promise if we have one leftover, we'll do it. Okay. Here we go.

755
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,600
Implosion starts at 30 seconds. Uh, I, I could do this. I could do this for a whole episode. Uh,

756
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:43,040
yeah. And that has to surf on two turtles. She's got to use two turtles as ski, uh, water skis. Uh,

757
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,880
your boat's going to pull her. Uh, can you glue two turtles to a net of high heels?

758
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:53,840
You know, the water is going to be splashing. Do we, are we even going to see the turtles face?

759
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:58,960
Can we just use a prop shell? No, no, it gotta be real turtle. I paid for these turtles. We're

760
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:05,920
using the turtles. Okay. You got to see the Lapa goes, we got to, they're imported. You want to

761
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:10,560
explain to Roy Disney while we're racking up turtle money and we don't use them.

762
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:17,280
Uh, he can tell. He knows that the plastic shows, you could tell them to be authentic.

763
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:24,480
Some good commercials in the second half too. Uh, the foul weather driving book from shell

764
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:30,160
just, oh yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. This is weird little scenario of if you get caught in the snow,

765
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:36,000
uh, like stay inside, it's your shell and don't leave the heat on for more than 10 minutes,

766
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:44,080
10 minutes, an hour. Uh, yes, we're a little, a little like, uh, fear-mongering. Yeah. Uh,

767
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:49,920
Pillsbury plus, which is boxed cake mix that also includes pudding to mix into the mix.

768
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:56,160
Pillsbury plus. The mother is unconvinced that she thinks her adult daughter is full of shit,

769
01:12:56,160 --> 01:13:03,040
that she like used a box mix. It can't be a box mix. It can't, it's from scratch. It's not a box.

770
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:08,320
What's it's a weird, if you were arguing that about something that was brought to you from a

771
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:14,320
kitchen elsewhere and you don't know the cook, but like, why are you arguing that she knows what she

772
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:20,880
did? She knows that she didn't bake a full cake from scratch. Yeah. I, this is not an argument.

773
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:27,920
This mother could possibly win. Yeah, I know for sure. And plus that Pillsbury plus looks fantastic.

774
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:34,320
Oh yeah. It looks great. Box mix takes the cake. Do we know when is the cake? Do we know when

775
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:41,040
Pillsbury plus stopped? Discontinued. Yeah. Great. I got to look at another default Pillsbury plus

776
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:49,600
episode. Uh, the Chevy diesel pickup truck, a pickup truck that runs on diesel. I think it said

777
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:57,760
it had 27 highway, 20 city miles. And that made me go, Oh no. Um, car mileage did not get very

778
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:04,720
good in the decades, in the decades following until hybrids came along. It's like, Oh, that's not as,

779
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:09,760
I feel like nineties and two thousands cars almost had the same mileage to a certain extent.

780
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:14,240
This is where I'm going to go blank on you here. Cause I don't know. I don't know nothing about

781
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:18,480
mileage. I'm no Jay Leno. I don't know. I don't know what things get. People have asked me that

782
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:23,200
about my cars. What's the mileage? Well, yeah, now you're talking. Do we talk about anything else?

783
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,400
I'll be at so bad with the cars. Yeah. I'll be at the dealer and they'll go, how many miles are on it?

784
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:36,000
And they go, uh, and then they go about how, and I go about how much and I go, uh, and then they go,

785
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,880
all right, well I'll look in the car for you. I know where it is. I just, it's not a thing I have

786
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:47,280
in my head a lot. Listen, you scramble brain idiot. How many times a mechanic has said that to me?

787
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:51,840
You turkey. It's happened to me many times and the right to do it.

788
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:57,280
But probably one of the best details is the very last thing on this special. You see a commercial

789
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:04,480
for payroll savings plan by savings bonds. And that's the last thing you see before the video

790
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:10,560
ends and goes back to the menu and it's the most boring ad. Really strange. Yeah. Yeah. It's an ad

791
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:16,320
about a beaver needed a savings bond. It's like a, it's like a moment of Zen. It kind of just

792
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:22,240
happens and you don't like, did it happen? It's, it's, it's really surreal. It's a good transition.

793
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:26,640
It's like that pirates of the Caribbean transition back to the real world. And it is, you know,

794
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:32,080
nice little palette cleanser, but like you have to imagine everything else on Disney plus ends with

795
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:37,120
a, you know, the castle logo or something distributed by Walt Disney pictures. Well,

796
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:41,440
this ends with a savings. That's why I think whoever put this up was just like, yeah,

797
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:45,680
well I'll put the whole thing up. Like we're not going to do any work to this. It's just the,

798
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:51,440
shape it was in was what they were going to put up. I'm working from home. I'm not coming in to

799
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:56,560
cut the commercials out, upload whatever file you have. Yeah. No one's going to watch this.

800
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:01,440
Anyway, we just need to meet a quota of an amount of content that is on the streaming service.

801
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:07,520
Found something. No one's going to spend content like pigs looking for truffles.

802
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:14,480
Found something to get up. Who cares? Spending 75 minutes on a podcast talking about this special.

803
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:19,520
It's not going to happen. You're wrong. The savings bond commercial is more relaxing than most

804
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:26,240
Disney Disney plus originals, which end with a good five minutes of deathly silent,

805
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:33,200
localization credits of like, who are the voices in France and whatever in Lithuania?

806
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:39,280
Yeah. And you're like, it's a Marvel. Is there, is there a scene after the localization or was

807
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:44,720
it just the one before the full station? They should put a bond to the bonds commercial

808
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:49,840
after credits from one of the marvels just to throw us off. Oh, sure. I mean, yeah. Did Disney

809
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:53,840
ever get into savings bond? They have that credit card. They have the credit card that everyone's

810
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:57,920
like, don't get the Disney credit card. Get a regular credit card. Cause it's not, it doesn't

811
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:02,080
give you enough travel points. Yeah. No, I will get it. We tried the Disney credit card.

812
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:07,040
Try the Disney credit card. All right guys. My last video, my camera is being repossessed

813
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:14,400
because I have not been paying my Disney credit card. Did I toot?

814
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:28,560
Banks repossessing my toots. A bummer. Oh well. A repo man. Um, I, well, but you know what? Um,

815
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:33,920
more pleasant to watch than some of the other things. Uh, I believe in some of the other

816
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:40,080
fuzz bucket. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, much more. I, I thank the audience for sending us down at least

817
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:46,480
at, you know, like w w was watching these children sob upsetting. Sure. But was it nice to watch

818
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:53,680
just the, the nice, the greenery, the resort vibe of that, like the sparkling, uh, lake with the

819
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:59,920
boat going by and space mountain there and the nice clean monitor. I mean, it's, uh, if you just,

820
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:04,800
if you cut all the parts with the acting and the songs and the people and the things,

821
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:11,600
this is a great, it's perfect. If you do that, it's perfect. Uh, for sure. Establishing and

822
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:16,160
everything. I mean, now we're talking. If we could just find the raw footage for these specials,

823
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:23,840
just complete, you know, like 60 hours of just B roll. Oh, like the B roll from the Disney quest.

824
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:28,240
Yeah. Commercial. Oh, that's so great. Yeah. The ultimate. Or Ed Randell,

825
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:34,800
all your favorites. Yeah. Oh, that's great. Um, so I did enjoy this. I mean, a bunch of,

826
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,040
I think has been suggested, uh, over here, but in the poll we just did, uh, Ted and it's key

827
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:45,600
suggested. Thanks, Ted. Um, and, uh, so I guess once again, we'll pose it. I mean, we'll do a,

828
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:52,480
we'll do a poll at some point and just be ready to go. Um, I, I, I, there's things that I, um,

829
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:58,160
so we've done this twice and I think, uh, meet the Deedles as quickly as turning into the Susan

830
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:04,160
Luchi of this endeavor. I feel like it's going to be the Deedles day. I don't know anything about

831
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:11,760
that, but that poster or like art they use on this is, I don't know. It's glued in my mind.

832
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:16,080
I remember from when I was a kid, but I never learned anything more about the Deedles.

833
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,960
Was it one of you guys, do we talk about this in the show? Is it one of you guys or another

834
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,560
friend of mine who was like, is that the show with the guys with the big, the movie with the

835
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:29,440
guys with the big hair? And that's not what it is. It's, it's, yeah, we went over this. Yeah.

836
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:33,280
And that's a different thing though. That's a different thing. And it's not the stupid,

837
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:37,680
is Tom Marlowe's the stupid? Certainly not the stupid. Yeah. And it's not the coneheads. Of

838
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:43,760
course. Of course. No, it's not. Yeah. We get your big heads straight. Um, but I think it's,

839
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:48,160
you know, Deedles will get in there at some point. Um, I, I was really intrigued by the,

840
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:55,040
I was starting to pull later in the day for, uh, the 2008 Disney channel games. Um, I just

841
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:59,200
want to put in a vote for that. If, if people, if we do this again, I just want to like endorse

842
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:04,800
a couple of candidates in the primaries here or whatever that is. I don't know any details really

843
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:10,320
about it. I just skimmed through Wikipedia and like, all right, well it's probably Ali and AJ

844
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:16,640
run with the spoons and eggs in their mouths. Uh, there's a three legged race with the, the

845
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:21,680
Sprouses. All right. Sounds like fun. Yeah. Um, there was some that I was like, oh yeah,

846
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:26,480
this is right up my alley. It offered me afterwards, which I, I'm sure I've put it on

847
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:33,360
the background before the is a Disneyland through the seasons. Just a sixties one, I think.

848
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:38,320
Walter a special people want returned Oz. Yeah. I've of course seen a couple of times. You guys,

849
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:42,800
neither of you've seen it. I've never seen it. I've seen that one unpleasant scene in the subway

850
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:48,080
station. Did we post that or that was just going around Twitter one day or it just looks

851
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:53,760
shockingly horrifying. That movie is also long, right? No, that's not that long. Oh, okay. Well,

852
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:58,000
it was longer than this, which is why we were excited. This one. So mainly thank you for

853
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:03,200
recommending, uh, for picking a shorter thing. And I'll just, just one more thing. I just want

854
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:09,440
to shout out, uh, Matt eager for making, and I, we already went a little back and forth with him on

855
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:14,480
Twitter. When we say what is like the strangest, most bizarre, potentially most unpleasant thing

856
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:22,720
on Disney plus Matt found it. This is it. It is the Simpsons episode that gets into the underground

857
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:29,840
world of jockeys of horse jockeys who are typically are, are small. And that was the justification

858
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:34,640
for the Simpsons to turn them into like munchkins that they're always, they're hiding fangs and

859
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:42,000
pointy ears. And there's the song that I, I truly, and I mean, this is a compliment that I cannot

860
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,280
think of it. There's no way there's something more unpleasant on Disney plus that's it. He figured it

861
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:52,000
out. They have a, so it's called saddle sore Galactica. Um, and I know, we know, I mean,

862
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,440
we've seen it Jason. You've seen it. I mean, it was, it was not so what is the season 13? I,

863
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:01,920
the more I thought about it, 11, I think. Yeah. Yeah. I think I saw it when it aired. Yeah,

864
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:06,480
for sure. I did too. And now it just like, it takes me back to that, it takes me to that sinking

865
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:11,600
feeling of like, uh, oh, it's not coming back. Is it? We lost it. It's are we losing it? It was

866
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:18,080
like, like feeling like, like the relative is not going to get off life support. It was a real,

867
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:25,200
for two decades for Simpsons kids. It was a real, it was a real, like life lesson. It was a hard

868
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:31,040
life lesson to learn. Yeah. Yeah. Things don't last forever. I'm afraid to rewatch one that I

869
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:36,000
remember fondly as a kid, I think because it was an early premiere that summer of the grease

870
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:42,880
bandits episode of like, does that hold up? Cause I rewatched this. No, they go to no, no, no, no,

871
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:48,400
but I hated that one when it like, I was feeling the betrayal by the grease. I don't think I was

872
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:53,600
that far advanced to my thinking. I think it was just happy for not rebounds, but I remember

873
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:59,040
watching spring break this where they go to spring break on the fan boat a couple of years ago. And

874
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:06,320
I was like, Oh, Oh no. It's all Edison for me, baby. Oh, that is a, I remember it dark day in

875
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:13,840
history. I remember it so well. It was the season premiere and I was sitting so excited for it.

876
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:19,280
And I remember just going, something's wrong. Yeah. Didn't it, didn't you like carry it with you?

877
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:23,840
Like a month, you're just like, you sort of like, like what's wrong, honey? You're not going to

878
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:30,000
finish dinner? No, I'm not hungry. It's three weeks later. I didn't know it was possible for

879
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:38,720
things that good to change. I, there, the, I think I, I just got so bummed out remembering the jockeys

880
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:44,000
I like later in the day, I was like making tea or something and just like I'd moved on and then just

881
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:50,640
like the jockeys flashed in my head and I'm like, God, God, it like the jockeys were truly were

882
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:55,600
haunting me all day. We were doing this poll. So that was a big one for me. And then I remember

883
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:01,120
the final nail, the very final nail with Simpsons was when they went to Brazil and there is a part

884
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:08,240
where Bart says, boy, they sure do love soccer here. And then they, and then the bellhops at the

885
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:12,480
hotel were all kicking suitcases around like a soccer ball. Right. Right. Remember this. And

886
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:18,720
that moment I was like, we're done. We are done. This is done. This is the final. That's like

887
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:23,840
beyond I've, that's like the worst joke I've seen on any show, much less

888
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:30,640
that's my former favorite show. Well, we'll get, we'll get to these episodes

889
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:37,280
eventually if we keep doing plus us up. Yes, we'll have to, but thanks for sending us a pretty

890
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:45,040
pleasant thing. You survived podcast ride plus us up addition. Please plus us up again and stay

891
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:49,840
tuned here to pockets. The second gate for three bonus episodes every month. That is,

892
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:58,240
unless of course you're a scramble brain idiot, only they, but sure not would on so sharp. So

893
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,120
don't buy.
