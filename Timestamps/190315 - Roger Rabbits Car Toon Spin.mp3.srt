1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Warning. This episode contains claustrophobic cues,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
dad embarrassment, and just when you feel deep in a film noir nightmare,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
a tropical light at the end of the tunnel.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is Roger Rabbit's Cartoon Spin on Podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the podcast where, if you know exactly where to freeze frame it,

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
you can see us without underwear.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm Scott Geer, here.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's my Carlson and Jason Sheridan.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You had to remember why that joke exists, because the topic is Roger Rabbit.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Also real creepy if you don't know. My name is Mike Carlson, by the way.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And impossible in a podcast.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I just wanted to talk about it.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You know, there's that freeze frame thing, and then I really like the other one,

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
the one in the short where there's the poster for rigid tools.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's a Jessica Rabbit looking character straddling a chainsaw or something,

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and it says rigid too. It's such a strange phrase.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Before everyone turns the podcast off, because they think we've turned into perverts,

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
we're talking about some of the classic weird pornographic Disney secrets, I guess.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Actually, if you listen to every episode of this podcast, at some point you can hear me whisper,

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
take off your clothes.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Like in Aladdin, the magic carpet.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's an Easter egg. It's in every one of them.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Send us all the time codes and we'll give you a prize.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And like the Little Mermaid cover, our logos have the drawn boner.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Erin hides a boner in our artwork.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Look for the secret in our abstract Epcotty symbol. Yes, you'll see it.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm trying to think of all the different ones.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay, so there's that, but then there's also supposedly a secret boner in Little Mermaid itself.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The priest.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The priest, right? Yeah, we've talked about this many times.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I know this shit's like a side shot.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's kind of a profile shot and this is where Little Mermaid like rise in his priest garment.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And that people say, maybe it's a knee or something, but it is a pretty like just thin, straightforward,

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
you know, the way boners go straight out.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
They don't like rise up.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No character, no change at all.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Like Pinocchio's nose, I guess.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Just straight ahead.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Bloop, straight ahead.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Can I ask for context, not just for the audience, but also for myself?

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What is the under, so Jess, there's a shot in Jessica.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When they're spinning out in the car, right?

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
There's supposedly that's what it is.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I think it's, I'm not sure the scene.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I just like, cause I thought I could only remember the rigid tools.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I actually forgot there was one in the movie and I think it was like corrected long ago.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm not sure.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And you have to like brighten it up to see that it's, I don't know if it's no underwear or if it's,

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
or it could have been a mistake too.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's like you see up Jessica Reyes dress.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I feel like this is something like on E-bombs world that I watched 10 years ago or something.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
They were like, here's the clip of it.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And I think I remember watching it and just like, okay, okay.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Well, that was it.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't know.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's kind of, if it's just passing by, it's sort of a let down.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If you see it in some scandalous slideshow, it seems like a lot more risquÃ© than it is.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Cause someone's like lightened the image and really made it a whole thing.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Presented it for you.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I see.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This is an interesting way into a thing I learned today.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Roger Rabbit is based on a fucking book.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Uh huh.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Uh huh.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Who censored Roger Rabbit?

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And a much grimier, like, like it's a parody of like Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe, kind of Noire detective stuff.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And like there is no judge doom.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Roger is a lot more conniving and addition to being mischievous and Jessica's a full on like retired adult film star.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh, really?

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Oh, that's apparently I don't think, I don't know that it's in print.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And I think, but I think you can find on like eight books or like used book.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Websites.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And then there's two, two sequels to it too.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Who whacked Roger Rabbit and there's another one who discovered maybe that was that one of the unmade sequels was or prequels.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That might've been one of the seat.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But yeah, I had no idea there was a book involved and the off offer.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think it's Gary K. Wolf has sued Disney before.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I think ended up winning a few hundred thousand dollars for like, he said he was owed for gross receipts and they said he was and they actually owed him.

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And so eventually I think he was rewarded legal costs.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But oh, gotcha.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But it was, it's funny.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The Disneyfication of thing where this was like a, like a noir book playing within the world of forties cartoons and to see them take it all the way to Roger Rabbit's cartoon spin.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
New Disney.

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, Disney and Amblin.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh yeah.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Career co-production.

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Is it so did they buy out the rights completely or did they just like option at like a movie?

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I mean, obviously they own Roger Rabbit now, but was like his dispute was like he just was owed more because he created a character.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah, I think he was claiming he was owed more because they've made so much off the character and DVD sales and stuff and everything else over the years.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And now Rod, now as you're saying the Disneyfication, but I think like now that wouldn't be made because Robert Zemeckis is saying that like Disney doesn't like Jessica Rabbit anymore.

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Like the other very means the lack of use of the property on them not wanting such a sultry.

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't know if it's completely that, but I think he's mentioned that he's done a lot of interviews with people ask him about it.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But I think he said something about like Disney is not a fan of Jessica Rabbit anymore.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It seems like it was a fallout to with Disney and Amblin couldn't come to terms for like a full theme theme park land, but did come to terms for one single ride.

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And that is why this ride exists.

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh, gotcha.

101
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Like there was yes, because and we'll talk about it.

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There were a number of alternate Roger Rabbit attractions.

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah, which could have happened.

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It could have been like, I really wish it would have happened.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Sometimes you hear about rides that didn't get built and you go, well, how would that have worked?

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
These all sounded really cool.

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Really cool.

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And really in the spirit of the original MGM studios, the first decade of that.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah. Yeah.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And would have been a killer expansion for that.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And I believe if I'm if I'm remembering correctly, Jim Hill was talking on one of his 25 different podcasts that I listened to about how they're going to reuse one of these ride systems for the Roger Rabbit ride.

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
On the Zootopia ride.

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What?

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Really?

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The trolley.

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah.

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh, OK.

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Well, because we're you know, we can jump all around.

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
There was going to be a ride called the Toontown Trolley.

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah.

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
There was a little trolley that you might the Jolly Trolley that's still sort of around in Toontown and Disneyland, but not functional.

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But it's a little trolley car that dipped, you know, kind of tipped back and forth.

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But there was going to be a concerted ride that was a lot more of a Star Tours simulator that I don't really know the plot of it, but just, you know, you're you're in a trolley car.

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Trolley, I'll get told, driven by Roger and wrapped around a little more screens.

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh, like through the windows?

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah.

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, that's cool.

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
OK, OK.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So this was potentially Zootopia.

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So that's yeah, that's what Jim Hill said.

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm trying to think of which podcast it was.

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't know if it was his one with Len or it was somebody different.

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But yeah, he said that there it's going to be like a bus and you're going to be on like some police chase through Zootopia.

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I mean, that makes a lot of sense.

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The other thing was because there's there are wires on the Sunset Boulevard area of Hollywood Studios and those were going to be for red car trolleys.

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
An idea that they also have reused in DCA.

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But you were going to take the red car trolley down Sunset Boulevard, you know, which ends with Tower of Terror.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And now Rock and Roller Coaster.

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But the Rock and Roller Coaster plot was where they were going to put the Roger Rabbit stuff.

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It was called either Roger Rabbit's Hollywood or Maroon Studios.

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And there is still a Maroon Studios billboard and Hollywood.

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah, right. Oh, gotcha.

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So it's always there's like little Easter eggs of what was potentially to come and kind of follows what is popular the last decade or so of a fully themed land.

149
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So it's like multiple attractions, a bar, the terminal bar that like Bob Hoskins goes to like that would have been so great.

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You hop off the trolley, go to the bar.

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Well, and this all sounds because it all sounds cool because that Sunset Boulevard area of MGM Studios like pretty neat and a very like it just made so much sense as an expansion.

152
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Like we've got you go you go down Hollywood Boulevard.

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So a like attached Sunset Boulevard, but the things are a little like seedier, creepier down.

154
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's where the scary rides are.

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah. And that culminating in the world of Roger Rabbit, which is sort of seedy and creepy and sexy as we determined.

156
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So I guess what I'm saying is that's a better end for that area than a warehouse with a guitar on the outside playing pink all day.

157
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It feels very copacetic if it had been sitting next to the Hollywood Tower Hotel.

158
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yeah, like that. Right.

159
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Roger Rabbit's Hollywood and the hotel like that makes sense.

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But those obviously would have fit the best next to the Hotel Mel.

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh, of course.

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You know about the original Tower of Terror?

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh, the Mel Brooks one.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes. When there was going for any listeners who don't know, there was the notion of a hotel drop ride before the Twilight Zone entered the picture.

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But it was going to be a wacky madcap thing involving Mel Brooks.

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Was it just like Mel? I forget it.

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Was it original characters or was it like Mel's classic characters on the whole?

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No, I think it was him.

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Was he like, we'll look to more.

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Was it him like showing up? Was that a robot Mel on the ride?

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Or was it what if that was going to be a screen ride like it is now with Guardians?

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But every floor there's a different he's a bellhop, but he's also like an overall wearing like repairman.

173
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Or he's like both a man and a woman having an affair together.

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Like one door opens and like like my word and they cover themselves with the sheets.

175
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Him and Carl Reiner eating dinner out of their TV trays watching like Jeopardy or something.

176
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I would love a writer cameo also back there was going to be I think it's still an unused expansion pad.

177
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The David Copperfield restaurant.

178
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Oh, yeah.

179
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That never got built.

180
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I want that's the thing.

181
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'd love to do an episode about and yet I don't think there's like any info about it to hang an episode on.

182
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But it was like a outside of Disney and GM Studios.

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
There was a sign there was like Copperfield making a plate levitate or something.

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
They got that far into we're committed to building a Copperfield restaurant and then didn't didn't end up happening.

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We need to get more like OG Hollywood Studios imagineers on here so they can give us the scoops.

186
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We need to get more insiders.

187
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I think to get scoops like that because there's a lot of stuff like that where it's fascinating, but there's not a ton of stuff online about it.

188
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah. So we got to dig them up ourselves.

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And you're right to say MGM Studios, but like it does seem like it has the most weird and then what was going to happen and what was going to happen.

190
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I think the nature of like odd briefly popular properties being able to slide in and out of there made it so a lot of really cockamamie ideas.

191
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, Dinosaurs, Ace Ventura.

192
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's still the weirdest one.

193
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And the end as we talked about a little while ago, the many different Muppet attractions that didn't happen.

194
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah.

195
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
How do we get started looking at names?

196
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Let's name names.

197
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If you have a name at home of somebody to talk to about the Disney MGM Studios history.

198
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
We're starting to get emails of people like kind of giving us some little tidbits of information that might not be public.

199
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So let's keep that going.

200
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Let's get the stuff going.

201
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
How many characters was Mel Brooks going to play?

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Was he going to be a dowdy woman offended that you caught him in his underwear?

203
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Right.

204
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Or underwear.

205
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Like turns like rude or no look.

206
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That was oh, look, a man was a genie does that or something.

207
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I think like he's got in the shower.

208
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Isn't Genie in the shower at one point?

209
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Sounds right.

210
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't know what I'm saying.

211
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And does a like, oh man.

212
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

213
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Like that old trope.

214
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah. So that would have been one of them.

215
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah, I guess so.

216
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm stuck on this a man.

217
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's really in my head.

218
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I know somebody says a man in a movie.

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Maybe that's not the genie.

220
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't think I kind of don't think it is.

221
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What is it then?

222
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So one of the listeners will tell me.

223
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's another trickster, shape shifting character.

224
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Is it the mask?

225
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Does the mask say a man?

226
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Does the mask say a man?

227
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Who says a man?

228
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Is it a Joker?

229
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Is there a Joker that ever says that?

230
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Is it a Looney Tune?

231
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Is it Bugs Bunny?

232
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Which kooky character is it?

233
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah.

234
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's a kooky character.

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Who's excited to see a man?

236
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Hmm.

237
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't know.

238
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Somebody's script.

239
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Like this is the kind of thing where there's those lapses in our knowledge where someone

240
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
has tweeted at us by the time we wake up on the day that the episode is released.

241
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And this will certainly be one of those.

242
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And they're mad at us.

243
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah.

244
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah.

245
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
How could you not remember?

246
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
As you have every right to be.

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Look, I mean, they could be at a different time zone, but look, doing shift work sucks.

248
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So it was drop dead Fred.

249
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You're not remembering.

250
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Doing that third shift is raw.

251
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I've done that before.

252
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That or swig shift.

253
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You know, you start to crack a little.

254
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Drop dead Fred.

255
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Take your anger out on your favorite podcast.

256
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
We understand.

257
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Well, you want to stay in the zone of Roger Rabbit.

258
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
We have some big news, but maybe we save some time at the end of the episode.

259
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh, you want to do it at the end?

260
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Why don't we tease our big news?

261
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's very big news.

262
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It is very big.

263
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You're right.

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's been, it's been, you know, let's talk about the ride.

265
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Let's be selfless before we talk about our giant accomplishment.

266
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But for now, Roger Rabbit's cartoon spin.

267
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So a little bit of Roger Rabbit did make their way into, especially MGM studios.

268
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And the big one that I believe is still there is the stunt car.

269
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Like the car that was Benny the cab, the actual car that Bob Hoskins would ride in and a stunt driver would drive it like there was a seat for him behind it.

270
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That is in the back lot express restaurant or at least used to.

271
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I believe it is still there.

272
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The restaurant is still operating at Hollywood studios.

273
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Is that right?

274
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah. And that that you can see the pictures of him like riding down the bridge that connects the Atwater Village neighborhood to the Silver Lake or Los Feliz neighborhood.

275
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah.

276
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Bridge. If yeah, that we're frequently on and that a lot of people we know live around there.

277
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Sure.

278
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You forget that you've probably driven on it a ton of times without realizing, oh yeah, this is where the Roger Rabbit car chase culminates.

279
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yeah, I know it almost to the Atwater Dunkin Donuts.

280
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You do that weird U-turn before the Starbucks and you have a view of the Dunkin Donuts.

281
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yes.

282
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You probably just go straight to it, but you crashed your car through the window.

283
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And I'm on the lower street and then I the car goes up above the bridge to get onto it.

284
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And then you eat as many like donuts as Homer did when he was in hell.

285
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah, every day.

286
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That was the second Dunkin Donuts to come here, right?

287
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
There was one in Santa Monica.

288
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And then I think that was like the second one.

289
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Something like that.

290
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah, there's still building.

291
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
There's still not a ton.

292
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
There's one right here.

293
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Obviously, no one say where.

294
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yeah, yeah.

295
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Don't don't dox yourself.

296
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Santa Clarita, California, where we record, go start marching on, go start knocking on every door in Santa Clarita.

297
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You'll find that's where we record.

298
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And then so that my faith, I was very happy to discover.

299
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I did not imagine this as a child.

300
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You either used to be a bunch of photo ops at the end of the the backlog tour at MGM Studios.

301
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You would get off and there was the cars from Roger Rabbit and the dip machine and you could get your pictures taken.

302
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
With all of this stuff.

303
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But I have a very clear memory of as a child going like I did not care for the dip.

304
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I do not like I'm scared of the dip.

305
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I am scared of the dip.

306
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah, the machine was like very well done because it scared me as a child.

307
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah. So you didn't take a photo.

308
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Do you have a photo with you?

309
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm sure I have photo.

310
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Well, I think there was like a Benny the cab that you could get a photo into.

311
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So I must have a photo in front of that stuff somewhere.

312
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But I remember that it felt like and I don't know if they said there's Roger Rabbit stuff coming.

313
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But like I feel like as a kid, I was like, well, I bet they'll make a Roger Rabbit ride at some point.

314
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Like I just kind of was like, well, everyone knows Roger.

315
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
He's in the giant inflatable Mardi Gras parade.

316
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It was really heavy presence at the parks around.

317
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
We've talked about how he was essentially like all like kind of the big six.

318
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
He was almost in there.

319
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And yeah, they were the giant pres.

320
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I strongly associate him with early Disney MGM studios, despite there being no attraction there.

321
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I thought the backlot tour was so full of Roger Rabbit pushing.

322
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
He was like Stitch or Pooh Bear.

323
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Like they recycle in and out of this like sixth character where you're like, why so much Stitch stuff around?

324
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Although I think probably he was maybe I know people do like Stitch, but it does feel a little bit forced.

325
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
We've talked about that before, but I definitely.

326
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Sure to be excellent live action version.

327
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yeah, when is that action film?

328
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's so fun to see these movies rendered and live action.

329
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Is that real people and 3D joyless.

330
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That's the thing I know from my memory, but now it's different now.

331
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I don't think I can get into the head of the person who's excited about.

332
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I don't know.

333
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Some of I don't know.

334
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I shouldn't be such a grump about some of these movies are better than others.

335
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But man, like like Aladdin.

336
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Dear God, what are we?

337
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah, I don't.

338
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I like Jungle Book a lot.

339
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I was I was expecting like it so much, but I really, really liked it.

340
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And that's I haven't seen Cinderella, but that's the only one I've really been into.

341
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But yeah, I don't know.

342
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's hard to take a movie that everyone loves and then put in a totally different media like in a different type of media.

343
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's not the word.

344
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Another medium.

345
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Excuse me.

346
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yeah.

347
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And then make it as good.

348
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It seems almost impossible.

349
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It seems like especially with the Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast.

350
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It would be one thing to do like Oliver and Company, which is not even though we all have fondness for it.

351
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What you want with Oliver and Company may have it memorized.

352
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I feel like lately we're in the territory now of films that we have committed absolutely to memory.

353
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And in the case of Aladdin, it's like, you know, then the genie shifts shapes and there's a giant guy becomes a snake.

354
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And you're like, how is this going to be more visually appealing?

355
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah, yeah.

356
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
With CGI, the musical, I believe, is very well reviewed, the Broadway musical.

357
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But I don't that one.

358
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm like, why don't you just make a live movie of the musical?

359
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Because there are new there's additional songs, too.

360
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
OK, maybe that's obviously we would be on board if at every screening Will Smith or all right.

361
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
A Will Smith sound alike was broadcasting live in the theater, updated topical jokes.

362
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Well, that's every script responding to short tweets as they occur.

363
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If Trump tweeted something at five p.m., I want the seven thirty show to have a new genie joke about it.

364
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That genie is going to dab, right?

365
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The genie has to dab.

366
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Has to dab because he can't really floss because he's got or no, he can floss.

367
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He can make legs.

368
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah, he can make legs so he can floss.

369
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The later genie, when he was like more, I mean, he has legs in the movie before he's freed, but I think he can make legs.

370
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's just like he's generally float when he's floating, he has no legs.

371
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Will Smith will have legs and we'll walk around.

372
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
But I bet he'll float. Yeah.

373
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So for sure, I think Genie flosses.

374
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I think like what is this?

375
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I mean, he has to because now it's built in that Genie makes topical jokes like as much as we were talking about how like, oh, yeah, this is weird that the California venture Genie is doing that.

376
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That was Rob Williams did that.

377
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
There's tons of topical jokes.

378
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Jack Nicholson impressions like stuff that should not have been in a movie that was set a couple hundred years ago.

379
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So like it is built now into the Disney Genie.

380
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So you're right.

381
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
He has to dab or do the floss or transform into Pete Davidson.

382
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Sure. Or the Casio Cortez.

383
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
He has to reflect the culture.

384
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah, I think that that's right.

385
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I think we're in for hopefully a very pop culture reference Genie.

386
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
This Genie will be doing the sarcastic clap.

387
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I think Jafar is going to do something bad and then Genie is going to be like, and then like it'll pause on it.

388
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And I think everyone will go nuts on the Internet.

389
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And then people will like that in the theater.

390
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Now they think about it.

391
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Yeah.

392
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
If they really have to like get it exactly right for people to get the reference, although people have probably forgotten about it in three months.

393
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So maybe.

394
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So how would they?

395
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm thinking about like making a Roger Rabbit, a live live, a more live action Roger Rabbit.

396
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
We have to see realistic hair audiences today want to see hair that gets wet.

397
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
They want to see every follicle with crystal clear clarity.

398
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yeah.

399
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
To correct myself from earlier, the photo op for the backlots where you could get a photo next to the Weasels car.

400
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
OK.

401
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Or you could get like green screened with Benny or Jessica Rabbit.

402
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But you could get a photo.

403
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I forget what blog I pull this from under the under the wheel pose like you were getting rolled over like Judge Doom.

404
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Like you were getting smashed.

405
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Yes.

406
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
That was probably what I was like.

407
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I don't know.

408
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
That was upsetting to me because I saw the movie not when in the theater, but I saw it on video and it disturbed a lot of things disturbed me about it.

409
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And I think one of them for sure was him getting crushed by that at the end.

410
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I think I would have been a much different person if I'd seen this when it came out in the theater, because at least on VHS I could like close my eyes or like sink into the couch.

411
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I saw it like at a friend's house and I think I like ran in and out of the room because I was during a lot of the scenes because I was freaked out by a lot of the elements of it.

412
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I do think Jessica Rabbit freaked me out as well.

413
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I think keeping with my game on the show, I think Jessica Rabbit sexuality in real life.

414
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm very comfortable with everything.

415
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But in the show, my persona on the show is someone who's very repressed and is someone who's not comfortable with things like this.

416
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
But I do think I was like just too much.

417
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I don't know what's going on here.

418
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Well, it's more aggressive sexuality than probably any.

419
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
There's other sexy cartoon characters.

420
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Yes, it's pretty cartoon.

421
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:39,000
As I said, sexy cartoon characters, I ended up looking right up at your the bear from Swing and Teddy Bear over here on my other sexy cartoon characters like swinging Teddy Bear.

422
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yeah, it was like a Maywest flustered to it threw me off.

423
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I am purposely put in the seat where I can't see her because I would never get any episodes done.

424
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Can I move my chair for future episodes?

425
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Just kind of want to just different kind of fung shui.

426
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It has nothing to do with not wanting to stare the sexiest bear in the face.

427
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Swing and Teddy Bear.

428
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I but yeah, more aggressive sexuality certainly.

429
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah, and I was not ready for that.

430
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I'm trying to think is this the earliest like crime detective thing I would have seen?

431
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And because I liked even as a kid, I liked all that.

432
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I remember step by step doing like a detective parody episode.

433
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Oh, God, I see a battery.

434
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So a full they did a lot of like the genre.

435
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It turns into a movie for the entire.

436
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Yeah, that was like a go to genre parody for sitcoms, kids, cartoons, like anything and then eventually voice for actresses.

437
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Is like, hello, Mr. Spade.

438
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But like, that's a good.

439
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:56,000
That's a great part to give to like a person in a play without a lot of range.

440
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
That's a voice anybody can do with that.

441
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And then the this is a classic.

442
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
This is a go to in improv.

443
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
This is one of my go tos.

444
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And it probably is the heavy, the heavier, the like, hey, Mac, all right, get out of here.

445
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Like I was in a sketch show where I played a bouncer at a jazz club, but I was like, well, there's no question in my mind that I am.

446
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
All right, you're out of here.

447
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Come on, Bob.

448
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And like a dozen characters do that voice in this movie.

449
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's nothing but yes, it's nothing.

450
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
There's a weasel.

451
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah.

452
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And then one of the weasels is like, I'm going to ram him.

453
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
There's a very funny in the car chase scene.

454
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I was laughing, listening at the driving weasel going like, I'm going to ram him.

455
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
There was I did.

456
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I was UCB has things called spank shows, which is like you're putting up a show.

457
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Oh, you don't need to explain this at all.

458
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I know you guys know.

459
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But that means that you're trying out a show to see if it gets a run.

460
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And I was in a show that was written by a guy named Josh, a friend of ours, Josh Weiner, and it's called Retired Baby.

461
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And I believe it was me and past guest Jack Allison and everyone was wearing diapers in the show.

462
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And I believe I did the weasel.

463
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I had like a sucker.

464
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I said, I did that voice like this, like the high gangstery voice like that.

465
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So it is so that movie and these types of characters are everywhere.

466
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Yeah.

467
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You're either high voiced, heavy or gravelly voiced heavy.

468
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Yeah. This guy.

469
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh, this guy.

470
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I used to be a Golden Gloves champ.

471
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And then they kicked me out because I didn't throw the fight.

472
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
This sounds like the cab to you're right.

473
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Everyone in this movie is baby Herman.

474
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Yeah. Yeah.

475
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
That's oh my God.

476
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Baby Herman is a deep one.

477
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Wow. There are 10 heavies in so many.

478
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Have they?

479
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I think I like I think I liked that as a kid.

480
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It was more just like when they would go into Toon Town and like I think they do a great job in the movie and also in the attract in the ride we're talking about like of Toon Town is unnerving.

481
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It's unnerving to be a person in in this world in the Roger Rabbit world.

482
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I think you feel like an outsider.

483
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
There is a culture here.

484
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Yes. They all adhere to and we and we're on the outside of it.

485
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:29,000
But the you know if we want to start getting into the ride the when you say unnerving maybe this this may be the reason why this is not a ride that I frequent and I'm going to toss this out.

486
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And I'm curious how you guys feel but I think you might feel the same way.

487
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
There's something about that ride where it's all the way in the back of the park.

488
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It's like the furthest away.

489
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It's like it's if you were going to walk from this ride to Midway Mania.

490
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's like two miles.

491
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Yeah.

492
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Yeah.

493
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:59,000
But that feels like still part of this vibrant exciting area and Toon Town is kind of ducked ducked back there.

494
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah.

495
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It's sort of an area that's mainly photo ops and for children.

496
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
So maybe it feels weird to go back there.

497
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:13,000
But once you're in this ride that line is so upsetting and claustrophobic.

498
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah.

499
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It's like a ride that's so unneedlessly long seemingly and boring.

500
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It's like being trapped in a sewer for 45 minutes.

501
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Yeah.

502
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
The queue is very claustrophobic.

503
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You're right.

504
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Yeah.

505
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And the rides fun the rides fun.

506
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I do like the ride.

507
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I feel like I don't.

508
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yeah.

509
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I don't go back to Toon Town a lot.

510
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,000
For some reason we you and I were down there once Mike and I had gotten down there early and you were meeting me down there.

511
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And then you came and met me.

512
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I think I had a fast pass for Roger Rabbit and I just remember you getting a hot dog and like hosing a hot dog and two or three bites.

513
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Hosing meaning eating fast.

514
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Eating really fast outside of Toon Town.

515
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I've eaten a very fast hot dog outside of Toon Town a few times I think.

516
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But yeah that seems right.

517
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Yeah.

518
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Because you go up to the little window there.

519
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Yeah.

520
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
There's a little there's a little spot.

521
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It's yeah.

522
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Did you have more to the store?

523
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You just wanted to know.

524
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I was just like I have a very specific memory of like by the trolley or by like.

525
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
That's fair.

526
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I think that's I've done that a few times.

527
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Did I miss hear a detail.

528
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Was this in the morning.

529
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Well I think it may be 11am or 11.30am.

530
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I was there a little early and he was there around lunch.

531
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Jason's more of a breakfast hot dog man.

532
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I try to eat more hot dog around lunch and I generally only eat it when I'm out.

533
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I don't have a pack of them.

534
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Do you have by the way just an update for the hot dogs.

535
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Do you have a fresh pack of hot dogs in the fridge right now at this moment.

536
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
No but I have a little salami I need to finish.

537
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
All right.

538
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
That's something Jason's to do list.

539
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Yeah.

540
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Salami.

541
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Any other meats we should know about pizza rolls.

542
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And that's not what I've looked for.

543
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
What it's not did not meet as liver sausage or something like that.

544
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
No.

545
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
OK.

546
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Well anyway back to Ryder Rabbit.

547
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Yeah.

548
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
The Roger.

549
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So I think because of its proximity to nothing that like small world is right there back in the back area of Disneyland and Toontown is.

550
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So there's nothing that would trick us to go back there regularly.

551
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's not on the way to anything.

552
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It's not on the way to anything.

553
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It'll be less of a dead end soon with Star Wars.

554
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Although that's not true.

555
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
That still won't connect.

556
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Yeah that won't connect.

557
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So that's well isn't there technically someday maybe some frozen thing bridges the gap and then it's not a dead end anymore.

558
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Well there's a lot of rumors that are floating around.

559
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:44,000
The most recent rumor is that Mickey and Minnie's runaway railway will come to Toontown backstage.

560
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So but yeah it'll go back.

561
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So I'm not sure.

562
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I forget where the frozen expansion.

563
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I think the frozen expansion might have if they were because they were talking about frozen and they were talking about putting a be our guest back there.

564
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Oh wow.

565
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:03,000
But I think there's like a plot in between sort of Toontown and Star Wars land but they could use that for Star Wars ride.

566
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
They could use that for the fantasy land expansion.

567
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You can also bulldoze the fantasy land theater.

568
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
They've talked about that too.

569
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I mean for a while Toontown was seemingly on the chopping block.

570
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
That was for a long time the rumor that that's where Star Wars was going to go.

571
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Right.

572
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Pretty amazing when they made that announcement and like oh we're not even lose that they're putting it where and we're not even losing Toontown.

573
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And it's a best case scenario.

574
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'd be fine losing Toontown but I'm not a little child.

575
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Sure.

576
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Easy for me to say.

577
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Now that is the big thing.

578
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Little children and out of town visitors or people who don't go to the parks that often.

579
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:47,000
That is when I found myself back there because people want to get they want to go to Mickey Mouse's house and get their picture with him and meet the characters.

580
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
It's fun.

581
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It is fun.

582
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I like it.

583
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
But it's like it's never.

584
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Yeah.

585
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
For us who go quite frequently.

586
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Yeah.

587
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Yeah.

588
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It's not something you do every week.

589
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Childless also.

590
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Childless men in their 30s.

591
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Sure.

592
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
But I do think Runaway Railway is a very good idea to drive traffic back there because that's supposedly a very impressive ride.

593
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I'm sure it's family friendly and like we'll all go back there very regularly to do that.

594
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So yeah.

595
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
That's kind of liven up the area big time.

596
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
If that indeed is truly because that's the most recent rumor I've read that's happening in that zone.

597
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I feel like there's not been a ton of chatter about Frozen or whatever.

598
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Not that it's not going to happen.

599
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
But sure.

600
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Most recent stuff is about Runaway Railway just moving into one of those buildings essentially like they're going to gut the building.

601
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
But the building will still stand like a backstage building.

602
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Yeah.

603
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Which like it's the entertainment department.

604
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So you know costumes parades all of that.

605
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
We'll lose a massive facility.

606
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's going to get worse and worse to work at Disneyland.

607
00:33:45,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Pushing farther out on the outskirts of the land Disney owns to like different to the point probably where like Tony Baxter was saying on our episode that we don't know when even really knows exactly how much land there is still to expand Disneyland with.

608
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Which is we were all blown away by that tease.

609
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,000
But in the in the months since I've done a lot and I think we all have looked at the Google Maps a lot to go like OK looks like.

610
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah.

611
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You can get the you can get like this much land up until the freeway up until the five.

612
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So I feel like they're just going to keep pushing buildings out in that backstage area to the point where like all of those buildings will be like across town.

613
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And they'll all be bused in and it'll just be this giant disk because it doesn't seem like they're going to build a third park anytime soon.

614
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:38,000
If you're a Disney employee you're going to have to park at the Citadel Outlet Mall right up the five freeway half an hour away.

615
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You know get a good hour and take a gun on your cost.

616
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
A gondola will take you down to Anaheim.

617
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It's a fun hour and a half gondola.

618
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Yeah that's what's going to end up happening for each ride on.

619
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Yeah you have to pay for it.

620
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
The genie comes alive on a screen and says a dollar twenty five please.

621
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:17,000
At this point Disney and the Anaheim offices have more like city planners and crowd specialists than like costume character performers like just to figure out like how do we manage this theme park in the middle of an actual city.

622
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Yeah.

623
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Yeah.

624
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
But as it yes it keeps encroaching on the city limits.

625
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It's an organism.

626
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It's a living organism.

627
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Talking about unused land.

628
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I mean the Roger Rabbit stuff that was going to go in Disneyland was going to go behind Main Street in a new area called Hollywoodland.

629
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And one of our favorite specials the Disneyland story with Harry Anderson.

630
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
He says coming in 1993 I think like baby Herman's.

631
00:35:47,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Run away run away baby carrot bumper baby yeah bug no buggy run God baby buggy ride run away baby buggy ride to explain one of the many lies in that run of what's coming in the Disney decade this list where I don't think a single one of them happen which is heartbreaking to watch and I watched as a kid and like oh I can't wait for all of that and not a not a one of them happened.

632
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Little mermaid ride eventually happened 20 years later.

633
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
What a yeah yeah yeah.

634
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Which that ride.

635
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:32,000
In keeping with your sketch experience you would have all guests would have dressed up like a baby to go on the ride.

636
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
This is sort of a unique facet of it.

637
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:42,000
This is all Jim Hill info that you were the do you guys read this that what the plot of the baby Herman ride was a little of the broad.

638
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Strokes yeah that it's not because it's Hollywoodland there has to be the you're on a set.

639
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Oh yeah.

640
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Little I really but it's sort of fun funny that in the line you pass by baby Herman's trailer and he's cantankerous and cigar chewing and he's refusing to come out of his trailer and to do the scene and he's saying it's too dangerous.

641
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Get a stunt double and so when you get to the front of the line an employee says hey would you guys be willing to be the stunt double for the baby and then you are outfitted with baby bonnets.

642
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Let's go in the written the perhaps the only is bizarre park use of the only theme park instance of clothing being shoved upon you that is not besides 3D glasses.

643
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You are given a prop.

644
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Which I guess maybe that's like paper so that's that's akin to like a paper hat or something so they can afford to print those cheap and give them out but maybe there was a cleaning station very cleaning station that would have had installed and you were there was just people back there cleaning bonnets all day.

645
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Yet another measles outbreak as an unvaccinated child is sullied baby bonnets.

646
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Soaked baby bonnet.

647
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Measles soaked baby bonnet.

648
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Measles soaked baby bonnets.

649
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Not an actual baby a seven year old dressed as a baby.

650
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:19,000
There was an outbreak but that but so there would be your photo taken a la space man or splash man or whatever but everybody would everybody in the car would be wearing a ridiculous baby bonnet.

651
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But you could see how does that like that's an interesting idea that they should deploy for something.

652
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Everybody looks silly you would see those on social media.

653
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,000
That's true. Yeah I mean it is a good idea because like the joke of course would be everyone humiliating their father.

654
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah that's what they're looking for.

655
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Is that everyone's father with a baby bonnet on would look absurd and then everyone would want to buy the photo because then it would be like how look at your asshole dad who's an asshole all the time.

656
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
So much stuff is just based on like dad's being cranky and assholes all the merch.

657
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Yeah.

658
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
We know dad's not happy to be here.

659
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Buy him a shirt to call him an asshole and then buy a picture where he looks like an asshole to stick it to him for not being happy to be here.

660
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I can't tell if that's embracing toxic masculinity or really giving it to him.

661
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I think it's straddling the line.

662
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's taking him down a peg. Remember you were just a baby once.

663
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Yeah.

664
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
You think you're so big.

665
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
The.

666
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Oh god what was I gonna say.

667
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I lost it.

668
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You're just imagining we're all imagining our dads.

669
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
We're all about to.

670
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I think my dad gets worried about it when he's gotten pulled up to do.

671
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I'm not sure I've seen my dad wear a costume.

672
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
This is a rare event in the world.

673
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Like I've been watching King of the Hill lately and like my dad's not like Hank Hill but I think probably a lot of dads have shades of Hank Hill and I my dad's probably more the type like I don't know I look ridiculous.

674
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Right.

675
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I think my dad wore like a little costume once but it was not he would not dress up.

676
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Yeah tiny was my dad did the did the ceremony where you had to worship the totem god at the adventurous club.

677
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Oh right.

678
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
What did that make you wear.

679
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
You just had to like kneel on the ground and bow to the giant animatronic head.

680
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
No.

681
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Because I was like I know they give out a pin that you can't buy in the store.

682
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Can you.

683
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Oh yeah.

684
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I mean you made him go up and get it for you.

685
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Would you volunteer.

686
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Oh that's right.

687
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
He was a great sport of valid.

688
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Yeah.

689
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
This is an interesting question for all our listeners to ponder.

690
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Has your dad worn a costume.

691
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
And improve your life.

692
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Did it like make you a more open free thinking person to have a costume wearing dad even just like one time.

693
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Send us photos of your dad in costume I think.

694
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Tweet us photos.

695
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Oh I remember what I was going to say.

696
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So that if if that if the Hollywood land stuff and the baby Herman ride had come to fruition in modern day they would have had to shut that ride down for a few weeks to take out all the cigars to take out all the like child smoking reference because like oh yeah.

697
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Because like yes.

698
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
That's not OK.

699
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Today.

700
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Good point.

701
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:11,000
You can't smoke in like I don't think anyone smokes in any Disney stuff period like Wolverine I guess in the Fox movies Wolverine smoked but like Nick Fury usually chopping on a cigar in the comics.

702
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Not so in the Avengers has Wolverine smoked lately in movies though.

703
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I don't know.

704
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Yeah I'm sure though I'm sure drinking and popping pills and Logan but that's our rated.

705
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Right.

706
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
That's true.

707
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So yet another if we were if Zemeckis is declaring that Disney's uncomfortable with Jessica Rabbit and clearly they would not want baby Herman around a baby smoking a cigar.

708
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
There's a lot maybe preventing Roger Abbott's presence from being bigger these days.

709
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Yeah probably.

710
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It's the most offensive film of all time.

711
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Right.

712
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
That's what I'm determining.

713
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
What were the did you guys read about the the sequels or prequels.

714
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
A little bit I've read a little bit like I said I think I think I'm correct that it's who discovered Roger Abbott.

715
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Yeah that was like the killed Roger Abbott.

716
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
That was the I'm trying to remember because there's been several different ideas.

717
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
There's been like recent ones.

718
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I think there's been a recent script.

719
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
When I say recent I mean like in the last seven years and there was stuff that was like an immediately happened after it.

720
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And I'm a little fuzzy on the chronology here which was going to make our listeners like yell at us.

721
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
It seems like well look it's about the we're talking about the ride.

722
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:28,000
We don't have to care about the movies but we that we can be mumbly and tangential in our vague knowledge of the films.

723
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I mean clearly they wanted to do a lot with the movie does not land like who framed Roger Abbott and without making a big attempt at being a franchise.

724
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Yeah.

725
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And clearly they tried and they kept the characters alive with these shorts.

726
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And I think there were it seems to me like there were still murmurs of a of a Roger Abbott sequel as late as the late 90s.

727
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Yeah.

728
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And then the towel was not thrown in till you know over a decade later.

729
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I think they've still talked about a couple of years ago.

730
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:10,000
They were Zemeckis was talking about they had an idea where it would be like the Pixar characters too essentially like you would get all of it like so they're they've been floating stuff lately.

731
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,000
We've heard the rumor from years ago about the Hope and Crosby remake starring Mickey Mouse and Roger Abbott.

732
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:25,000
What they were going to remake do an old road comedy remake that would make Roger if that's what the kids want.

733
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Well it's what this kid on the come pointing to Jason Sheridan once.

734
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I love it.

735
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
If you did Roger Abbott now if you did a new Roger Abbott you have to have the minions right.

736
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
The minions have to show up.

737
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I hear what you're saying.

738
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I don't disagree.

739
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Yeah.

740
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Or Shrek.

741
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I guess it could be Shrek.

742
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I think that I would be fine with Shrek.

743
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I think that's probably unlikely now because of the companies being at war kind of with each other.

744
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Yeah.

745
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,000
The peace pipe that is the Mickey bugs scene I'm not sure occurs today.

746
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Yeah.

747
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Like our politics.

748
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Yeah.

749
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Like our politics.

750
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
There was once a time when Democrats and Republicans could reach across the aisle.

751
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Our and Disney and Warner Disney and the other any other company could get along.

752
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Now things are awfully divisive.

753
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:21,000
The Roger Rabbit is an impressive creation of like looks kind of Disney but has like the Bugs Bunny sort of like mischievousness.

754
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Yeah.

755
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Yeah.

756
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Because it's definitely a little bit more edgy too.

757
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Yeah.

758
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I think maybe there's probably a different set of characters like maybe the Hannah Barbera characters are more up for grabs right now than the Looney Tunes even though they're owned by the same company.

759
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
But you know who knows.

760
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I maybe like if characters are sort of in flux are the characters that they would have like let license out to Disney to use.

761
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So there's a whole set.

762
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
So Mickey and Top Cat could be.

763
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Mickey and Top Cat.

764
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Mickey and the Harvey comics characters.

765
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Casper the ghost.

766
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Hot Stuff the Little Devil.

767
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Little Lada.

768
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You know all the classic comics characters but just the TV series ones just like the Troll Hunters.

769
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
OK.

770
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Yeah sure.

771
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Mickey can meet a Troll Hunter.

772
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Mickey can't meet the real Calvin from the comics but he can meet a ripoff Calvin peeing on a logo of a truck.

773
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Right.

774
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
The bootleg Calvin.

775
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Yeah.

776
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Yeah.

777
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
That bootleg Calvin obviously Mickey can talk to any show.

778
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So yeah there's ways around it.

779
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
But yeah who knows.

780
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
So yeah they've been talking.

781
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
There's many options on the table.

782
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I still think every time they ask Robertson Mecha about it he doesn't like close the door completely.

783
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
It seems like he's wanted to do it forever.

784
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
And I also think he wants to do like motion capture.

785
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I think he's you know we know he's high on that motion capture.

786
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It's like a weird it's like like the relative you know is going to bring up that interest he has that you don't want like he's going to get into this again.

787
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Yeah.

788
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:02,000
It's also weird with his motion capture because I feel like his specific motion capture has a thing to it that most people go oh yeah.

789
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
OK he's doing one of these movies again.

790
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Whereas like say what you will about Avengers Infinity War like but Thanos is a motion capture character and I thought he looks great.

791
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I like he's kind of seamless.

792
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Yeah.

793
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Seamless.

794
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It's just Josh Brolin.

795
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
You get the performance from him.

796
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
People have you know like what's the planet of the apes.

797
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Yeah there's great motion capture.

798
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
So it is weird.

799
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Whatever the way.

800
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Yeah I don't know what it is.

801
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Marwin the fact that he stepped aside for a while and then did Welcome to Marwin and like right in the back exactly where we were before.

802
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
But it's like secret like the movie is a lot of just regular footage right.

803
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Yeah.

804
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
It's a mocap.

805
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
They snuck me into a mocap.

806
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
But there's still something about it that feels like he's like it's like a Sega Dreamcast game.

807
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Yeah.

808
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Yeah.

809
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
That's how he likes it.

810
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I think Zemeckis likes the uncanny valley.

811
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Yeah he owns the property in the uncanny valley.

812
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Uh huh.

813
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
The polar.

814
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
It's spacious.

815
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
There's no neighbors.

816
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Nobody else wants to live here.

817
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:14,000
But it's not a throwback like I feel like and I'm sure like in the indie video game world that you I bet you're starting to see if not now I'm sure you will.

818
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:26,000
At some point like PlayStation one kind of poly gone sort of design like virtual fighter level design because you can do that on like a fucking laptop.

819
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Now you can design that.

820
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Uh huh.

821
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Yeah.

822
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It's interesting.

823
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,000
The Zemeckis one is not really referencing anything besides reality kind of.

824
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
It's referencing creepiness.

825
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Yes.

826
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It's referencing looking very strange.

827
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Very strange.

828
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I saw the film.

829
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It's a very strange film.

830
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
But I'd rather talk about the fun spinning ride.

831
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah.

832
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yeah.

833
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Talk about Zemeckis's own real life wife being naked in his film.

834
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Oh wow.

835
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Maybe we do want to talk about that.

836
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
No wait that's not.

837
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
That's Zemeckis.

838
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
We'll do that on the Welcome to Marwen cartoon spin episode.

839
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
And we spin out our Welcome to Marwen theme part.

840
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Marwen land.

841
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Welcome to Marwen land.

842
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Dubai.

843
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Marwen land Dubai.

844
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
That's what's moving into that Fox space.

845
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Oh yeah yeah.

846
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,000
That's the only buy Zemeckis is going to buy it and make it a Marwen theme park.

847
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
You heard it here first.

848
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Trestworthy rumors from podcast The Ride.

849
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Let's talk about the fun spinning ride.

850
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
So the line is a bit claustrophobic.

851
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Yeah.

852
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I was just going to jump to back what you were saying about it.

853
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
It is sort of not a fun.

854
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It's hot in there too.

855
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I feel like.

856
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Very warm.

857
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And dark.

858
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And then you'll look.

859
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
It's mainly you're just like looking at doors and trash cans.

860
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:53,000
But then you'll look in the little slat while open and the big scary gorilla eyes of the bouncer will be there.

861
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
And that's the most entertainment you have.

862
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
It's like being in jail.

863
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
You're in solitary confinement in this line.

864
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
There's something weird about this ride too that is not memorable.

865
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Like the line isn't particularly memorable.

866
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Whereas like Toad's line is so tiny.

867
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And I guess maybe that's but I know the lines for all of those dark rides and fantasy land so well.

868
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I guess it's just because I go on and more.

869
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Especially there's that statue of Toad that everyone stops to take a picture with.

870
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
No one's ever.

871
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
That is one of the most oddly photographed locations in Disney.

872
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
You have to take a picture.

873
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
You can see the wear and tear.

874
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
It's like the wood is faded a little or whatever is faded where people put their hands.

875
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I'll just say my plus up for this ride right now.

876
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Take the line.

877
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Just take the roof off.

878
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Just remove the roof.

879
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Make it like a nice little park.

880
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
We don't need to get into the story.

881
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Just give me a garden to walk through because that I think is what's up with Mr. Toad.

882
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
You end up in his house.

883
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
But a lot of it.

884
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Yeah, it's just like nice shrubs.

885
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Hey, it's a nice day out.

886
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
It's a great line.

887
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I don't need any more shrubs.

888
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I'd rather have a couple of trees and some oxygen.

889
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Yeah, I don't know what I'm trying to remember.

890
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
There's nothing like there's crates, right?

891
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
There are crates.

892
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
There's like crates.

893
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I think you hear the weasels talking.

894
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
You hear people talking.

895
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,000
You hear creeps murmuring, talking about plans for what they're going to do to the character you like.

896
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I feel so.

897
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
You hear the creeps murmuring.

898
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Yeah.

899
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So, uh, I think that's the thing.

900
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I think the line is the problem.

901
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
The line is why I don't go back there.

902
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
If I can fast pass it.

903
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Sure.

904
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And it's a good way to fill a little gap in your in your Max Pass hopping around day.

905
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Right.

906
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
But if you like, you literally can't do that line.

907
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Like I don't like I'll never do it again.

908
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I hate that line.

909
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Yeah, I get it.

910
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I hate that line.

911
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I hate that line.

912
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I hate that line.

913
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I hate that line.

914
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I hate that line.

915
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I hate that line.

916
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I hate that line.

917
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Huh?

918
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Yeah, I get I would guess now that I'm thinking about it and I've been to Disneyland in over

919
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I guess 12 for 12 years now and I've been over 100 times because the annual pass keeps

920
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
track and it was over 100 at one point and then it reset because I there was a couple

921
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
of times reset.

922
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I don't know.

923
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I don't know.

924
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I've lost track.

925
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I'm upset about that because I was like, oh cool.

926
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
It's really tracking it.

927
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And then I let it lapse for a couple of months and now it's back to why you don't let it

928
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
lapse.

929
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Don't ever take a break.

930
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Yeah.

931
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I'm like 20 or something.

932
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:28,000
So I bet I've only been on this ride five times.

933
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I bet it's five in 12 years.

934
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
In 12 years.

935
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I bet I've been on it five, six times.

936
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I can't be much more.

937
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
It's about where I'm at.

938
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Jason.

939
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
No, I'm trying to think like, yeah, it might be around there.

940
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I've been on, you know, big thunder 50, I bet 50 or more times on a mansion, 50 or more

941
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
times.

942
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
All the big pirates, 50 or more times.

943
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Roger Abbott's five to seven.

944
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Yeah.

945
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
And think about where you are in those lines.

946
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
You're weaving in and out of a fun little mine town.

947
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:08,000
You're, you're, you're in a nicely manicured courtyard outside of a stately mansion.

948
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Sure.

949
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
And you're in like a nice little fountain area in a new Orleans square.

950
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I like, I think there's something about, I like, I like gardens.

951
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I think I'm a garden guy.

952
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
The land opened in 93, the ride opened in 94.

953
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
They don't have an excuse.

954
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
They built it off from scratch.

955
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
They could have made the line big.

956
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Yeah.

957
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Like probably nobody's going to want to go on this.

958
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I guess they were thinking, cause it is like, it is a little bit of a bigger and scope dark

959
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
ride, like the fantasy land rides.

960
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
So were they thinking like, we'll make the line as short as those lines?

961
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Maybe they didn't have the room.

962
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Like, maybe they, yeah, maybe that's it.

963
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Still, you could have pushed back.

964
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I don't know.

965
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It seems weird.

966
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
It seems weird that the line isn't a little bit bigger.

967
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Is there, is this the worst line?

968
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Oh, that's good.

969
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
That's a good question.

970
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Worst line.

971
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I don't have any at my disposal.

972
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Fun line.

973
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Astro orbiter is bad.

974
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Cause it's nothing.

975
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
It's really tight.

976
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
You're stuck.

977
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
But does that even count?

978
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Cause it's nothing.

979
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Does the Pixar, Pixar around account?

980
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Cause that's nothing.

981
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
That's nothing as well.

982
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
You can't load a first wheel.

983
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
There's no way to load a Ferris wheel fast.

984
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I think the question now should be changed to of all the lines that are something.

985
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Is this the worst line?

986
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Okay.

987
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
That's a good one.

988
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Because the Astro Orbiter is nothing.

989
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
The fun wheel is going to call it.

990
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Of course, that's not right.

991
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
It's the Pixar pal around.

992
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
That thing we do with our friends.

993
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
A normal phrase we all know and love.

994
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I didn't even recognize it when you said it.

995
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Oh, it's the Ferris wheel.

996
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I'm the host of this.

997
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
You know, it's next to the years long broken fountain show.

998
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It's next to the scrap yard that used to be a fun nighttime extravaganza.

999
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I think you got to go to maybe to like Epcot.

1000
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I feel like there's bad Epcot lines.

1001
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Spatial birth is outside mostly.

1002
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
You kind of get on right when you're inside the building.

1003
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I almost consider that almost nothing.

1004
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I'd almost consider that line.

1005
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Nothing.

1006
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Beautiful mural to the beautiful seventies kind of mural.

1007
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
But it's a by the way, let's not to wrap it up.

1008
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Let's put it to listeners.

1009
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Yeah.

1010
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Worst line.

1011
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
That is something that is something because like Buzz Lightyear, a lot of his outside,

1012
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
but there is an inside line and I'm trying to think, do I, I like that line better.

1013
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
It's still a little dated looking now, but you got that big Buzz Lightyear animatronic

1014
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
there and that's still fun to see him.

1015
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:37,000
There's no that Disney term with the weenie, the thing like, well, even this part's a slog,

1016
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
but I'm going to get this.

1017
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:45,000
You know, it's a bad line, not star tours, obviously, but the pre star tours, if you

1018
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
end up in that other room, that's a dragon.

1019
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Yeah.

1020
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Yeah.

1021
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Once you're past, you know, Toy Story Midway Mania lures you in with Mr. Potato Head, which

1022
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
is great.

1023
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yes.

1024
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
But once you're past that, that room is awful.

1025
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Yeah.

1026
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Just the back and forth with only four posters to look at.

1027
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Yeah, it's nothing.

1028
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
That's a thing that makes you have to get a fast pass for the, like you can't get stuck

1029
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
in there.

1030
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Right.

1031
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
But he's still, that's, I'd rather.

1032
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
It's not as bad though.

1033
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I'd rather be in there.

1034
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
It's a brighter room at least.

1035
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Yeah.

1036
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I'm like, I'm getting ready for the carnival.

1037
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
It's the most theming, it's the most theming worst line.

1038
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
You know what I mean?

1039
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Like it's cause it is a, it is themed the whole way and it is a decent amount, but it

1040
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
is, yeah.

1041
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Huh.

1042
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I think, I think it probably wins these parameters in my mind.

1043
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I think this is the answer.

1044
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I can't think of anything where a line was specifically made with decisions and it's

1045
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
not good.

1046
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,320
It does feel like every now and then you hear about like, well, this was a story decision

1047
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,480
or an imagineering decision.

1048
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,760
They really should have checked in with operations more because I feel like they're the department

1049
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,960
to go like, Oh, that's actually unpleasant for a human to do that for more than five

1050
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,960
minutes.

1051
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:07,800
Can we plus it up though as it is, cause there's like certain parts of the Indiana Jones line,

1052
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,800
which are claustrophobic, but you're constantly moving, especially now, which I think I've

1053
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,320
never said that somebody corrected me.

1054
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:18,280
I said this a while ago that there must be a fire issue with the line, how they move

1055
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,280
us through.

1056
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,280
That is not the case.

1057
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,240
So somebody corrected me online.

1058
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:27,240
I said, cause now there's no, you never really get backed up until you get to sort of the

1059
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,640
end of the Indiana Jones line.

1060
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,560
Cause you don't get to see all the great details in it because you zoom through it so fast,

1061
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,680
but it's not because of some fire issue that's changed.

1062
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:41,360
It's because the way they've had to do fast pass, cause it was not built for fast pass.

1063
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:46,400
So they have to keep most of it clear in order to actually send you to the front for the

1064
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,280
fast pass to skip anything.

1065
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,280
Exactly.

1066
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,840
So that's why it does that now, which is a bummer.

1067
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,840
Now we know.

1068
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,240
So yeah, somebody corrected me.

1069
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,800
Well, it's good to skip parts of the line, but then you don't get to enjoy one of the

1070
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,320
best lines and a good claustrophobic line.

1071
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:07,280
In terms of how to plus it up, some lights, lamp.

1072
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,280
Sure.

1073
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,280
Okay.

1074
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,280
Lights, lamp, ceiling off.

1075
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,280
Fans.

1076
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,280
Yeah.

1077
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,280
Is there something you would want to see?

1078
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,800
Do we want to see a character?

1079
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,720
Oh, I mean, if there was an animatronic Roger talking to you.

1080
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:27,840
So yeah, can we just put a very expensive talking Roger Rabbit, like the potato head,

1081
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,680
and would that make us go in the line?

1082
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,720
Be like, well, that robot is good.

1083
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,200
We're hot as shit by the time we get on the line.

1084
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,760
Baby Herman roasting you.

1085
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,080
That would be good.

1086
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,280
Borscht Belt jokes.

1087
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,960
Cause then we would want to go into the line.

1088
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,080
I feel like if there was a really good baby Herman.

1089
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,080
Let's go see Herman.

1090
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,520
Let's go see Herman, see what he's going to say.

1091
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,200
Or Jessica Rabbit.

1092
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,600
Well, that I wouldn't.

1093
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,600
I could handle myself.

1094
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,600
I couldn't do that.

1095
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,160
I forgot there was a Jessica Rabbit animatronic in this ride.

1096
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:01,280
So I might have to change my leota girlfriend choice.

1097
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,280
Oh yeah.

1098
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,280
Well, we all forgot.

1099
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,280
To Jessica Rabbit.

1100
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,680
Because we all forget about this.

1101
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,440
And she's got a giant mallet.

1102
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,880
So kill me queen.

1103
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,160
Smash my head in like Gallagher's watermelon with that mallet.

1104
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,680
Hashtag kill me queen.

1105
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,680
Hashtag kill me queen.

1106
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,920
By the way, is that a thing people say?

1107
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,080
Or did you just compile things that people say into kill me queen?

1108
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,400
Or have you seen that?

1109
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,120
There is like a running joke on Twitter.

1110
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:34,640
I feel like I've seen articles about it now of people saying like, yes, murder me.

1111
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,240
Murder me, Ariana.

1112
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,240
Murder me.

1113
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,360
Oh, OK.

1114
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,040
Hemsworth brothers.

1115
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:43,560
It's a jokey way to say, I love you.

1116
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,680
You're great.

1117
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,440
Gotcha.

1118
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,600
Murder me with a gun.

1119
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,920
But in this case, she has the literal capacity.

1120
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,880
Yeah, she does.

1121
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,440
She can kill you.

1122
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,520
But you know what?

1123
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,080
Let me say this.

1124
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:03,080
I feel like it's, hey, this has been like the line itself.

1125
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:06,040
It's been a dark, dreary journey.

1126
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,280
We're talking about how much we don't like this line.

1127
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,560
And I think it had to be addressed.

1128
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,600
We're talking about rides that never got built.

1129
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:17,440
And you know, then scandalous pornography in these films.

1130
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,160
For all that said, I do like the ride.

1131
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,640
And I'll say another thing.

1132
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:29,320
I'll amend that a little bit to say, I did really like the ride.

1133
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:33,720
And in my memory, when this came out, so I don't know when you guys went on it

1134
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:40,320
the first time, but I went when I went as a kid, when it opened closer to 94, 95,

1135
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,520
it was great.

1136
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,840
I might have listed this as in my top five.

1137
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,320
Really?

1138
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,120
Oh, sure.

1139
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:52,040
And what I think is that the quality has dipped.

1140
00:59:52,040 --> 01:00:00,560
I think it like, maybe this is a case of my childhood memory being brighter

1141
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,320
than what something is.

1142
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,760
I had rose-colored glasses because I was a kid.

1143
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,720
But in my memory, the spinning worked better.

1144
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,960
It was just generally better kept up.

1145
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,000
I feel like it came out of the gate, shiny and glossy and a lot of fun

1146
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,600
and all the effects work.

1147
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,920
And it was a new type of ride.

1148
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:24,960
It was before there was Trackless, which is kind of the new dark ride innovation.

1149
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,920
It was sort of the first new type of dark ride in a long time

1150
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,760
to invent a ride vehicle, which is very fun.

1151
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,160
And I think it worked better in the 90s.

1152
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:38,960
I think maybe they've sort of just let it not.

1153
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,280
I just feel like it's not at operating at peak quality.

1154
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,160
But I think the people who made the ride did a great job.

1155
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,120
I think it's a great notion of a ride and a ride vehicle.

1156
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:54,120
Well, what if I told you that there's a place where you could go back

1157
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:57,040
to where everything looks shiny and new?

1158
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,920
And it is in the land of the rising sun.

1159
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:04,760
Because the only other place this was ever cloned was Tokyo Disney.

1160
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:09,440
And I watched back to back a couple of times the Anaheim version

1161
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,520
and the Tokyo version.

1162
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,200
And I'm like, are these different?

1163
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,160
And they're kind of not.

1164
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,880
All of the set pieces, all the show scenes are the same.

1165
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,040
So I'm not spoiling anything for you.

1166
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,720
But kind of a conclusion we hit on the Tokyo one,

1167
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,920
and I forget whether you would scurried away or not,

1168
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:28,480
is everything, everything seems the lighting seems better.

1169
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,800
The paint seems better.

1170
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,480
The effects seem everything seems to be working.

1171
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,800
Shiny ride specifically on this ride from the video.

1172
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:43,280
So I know there's going to be a lot of you got to cram a lot into your time

1173
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,000
in Japan.

1174
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,280
But if you are thinking, well, I did really like this,

1175
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,520
you guys don't know how long I'm going for.

1176
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,200
No, we don't.

1177
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,240
Oh, I got to bring that.

1178
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,200
We'll see.

1179
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,560
I'm not even sure I know.

1180
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,200
That's a good.

1181
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:55,720
That's good.

1182
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,960
That's a great.

1183
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:57,640
I will say this.

1184
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,200
We were there for three and a half days.

1185
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,800
We did not do this ride.

1186
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,200
OK, I think I got to do it.

1187
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,440
I think for a second, you should try it.

1188
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,200
I'm not going to tell you which language it's in.

1189
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,000
I know it's a 50-50 chance.

1190
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,320
It's in Spanish.

1191
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,040
Didn't see that one coming.

1192
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,640
You know, that thought across my mind, and I will definitely

1193
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:21,720
make time to do it unless I can only wait in the line.

1194
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:22,880
And maybe I'll do the line.

1195
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,160
And like, the line was great.

1196
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,360
The line's fine.

1197
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,360
I don't know what the line is.

1198
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,040
I might need to do it.

1199
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,800
I might need to devote an hour and a half of my time to it.

1200
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,680
It's probably that long, because everything's

1201
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,600
such a long wait.

1202
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,400
OK, there it is.

1203
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,640
Well, so I'm hopeful about that.

1204
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:47,920
Because I do, in my memory, this happens.

1205
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,720
And I think Toontown in general came out of the gate so strong.

1206
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,440
That's what I was going to ask.

1207
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,440
It was a fantastic land.

1208
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,960
What are your memories of Toontown?

1209
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,960
Loved it.

1210
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,360
Loved it so much.

1211
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,480
I'm sure there's a full Toontown episode down the road.

1212
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,360
So I don't want to get into it too much.

1213
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:11,080
But I think you guys have all commented on,

1214
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:14,880
it seems like the paint literally fades.

1215
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,960
I feel like it opened, and it was so bright and vibrant.

1216
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,240
And to see a land where every structure

1217
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:28,120
is bending and twisting, it was super dynamic to walk around in.

1218
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:33,360
And also keep in mind, Bounce House open.

1219
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:37,680
The Chippendale ball pit and slide open.

1220
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,040
You could actually do the things in the land.

1221
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:45,720
I can't go in that ball pit, even if I wanted to.

1222
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,640
If I wanted to go take a piss in that ball pit,

1223
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,000
it couldn't be done.

1224
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,840
Did you do all of that when you were little?

1225
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:52,600
Yeah.

1226
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,280
It was great.

1227
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,600
It was all so great.

1228
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,080
The Bounce House wore me out, I remember.

1229
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:00,000
I remember getting exhausted.

1230
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,880
You imagine that you're just like your tigger jumping around.

1231
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,640
This will be super easy.

1232
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:10,240
I'll be bounding across the room.

1233
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,880
But in fact, it was a tremendous amount of physical exertion.

1234
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,480
And other kids are mean, and you're getting stomped on.

1235
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,560
But yeah, still, Toontown was fantastic when it opened.

1236
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:24,440
That was, though, we've talked about this, I'm sure,

1237
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,400
was when I saw pictures of it.

1238
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,960
Because we didn't have it in Florida.

1239
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,320
Oh, yeah.

1240
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:33,480
We had Mickey's birthday land, and then that kind of evolved.

1241
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,320
But it was not a true Toontown.

1242
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,240
I can't wait to talk.

1243
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,400
That's the topic I'm looking forward to very much.

1244
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,960
Mickey's birthday land slash Mickey's Starland.

1245
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,440
Obviously separate.

1246
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:45,960
Two different episodes.

1247
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,040
Two totally different than Starland.

1248
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:51,680
Two and a half hour episodes on their own.

1249
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:55,640
But I was so envious of it, because as a kid, especially,

1250
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:59,280
it's living and seeing Mickey where Mickey lives.

1251
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:03,120
And I don't know why it's hanging out in Mickey's house

1252
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,400
is the thing I wanted to do.

1253
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,880
But I did, I guess.

1254
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,240
You gotta see the den.

1255
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,640
Yeah.

1256
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,520
We gotta try and get a call and response going the next time

1257
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,360
we do a live show.

1258
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:19,680
We say, if I want to make a call, you say, I use the den.

1259
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,640
What do I use?

1260
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,880
The den.

1261
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,480
My dream.

1262
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,880
That's my rock.

1263
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,480
I'm like Mark Wahlberg in the movie Rockstar.

1264
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:35,600
What if I was the leader of my favorite band in the world?

1265
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,280
And then it came true.

1266
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,240
Hey, everybody.

1267
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,640
Where are my calls made?

1268
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,840
I think we'll have this dream realized this year.

1269
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,320
I think so.

1270
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,160
Somewhere that'll happen.

1271
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,480
We gotta do it.

1272
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,120
Start practicing, everybody.

1273
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,280
So just jealous, envious, so imagining

1274
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,760
how amazing this must be.

1275
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,520
I was very excited about seeing that Indiana Jones ride in,

1276
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,160
but more for sure, more so about Toontown.

1277
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,120
And of course, as I've said many times, I thought,

1278
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,640
oh, man, that sucks.

1279
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:12,040
I'll never, ever go there.

1280
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,760
I will never go to California.

1281
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,080
Why would I ever go?

1282
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:19,120
I go to two places, Illinois and Florida.

1283
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:19,960
That's it.

1284
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:22,800
That will be it for the rest of my life.

1285
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:26,120
Ricky and Lucy and Fred and Ethel drove to California,

1286
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,680
but it was a whole ordeal.

1287
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:31,600
Yeah, and I was on one airplane when I was 15,

1288
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,560
and that was it.

1289
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,960
Before that, I was like, I'm scared to fly.

1290
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:35,680
You'll crash.

1291
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:36,680
I don't want to do that.

1292
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,320
If somebody came to you and said,

1293
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:43,240
not only will you live in Los Angeles for many years,

1294
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:47,000
but about a decade in, Dunkin' Donuts

1295
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,480
will migrate to Los Angeles.

1296
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,960
I would have been somewhat excited,

1297
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,880
but I'm not the Dunkin' man that Jason is.

1298
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:57,200
I go to Dunkin', but we had a donut place

1299
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,720
called Family Donuts.

1300
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,680
Family Donuts?

1301
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,320
Am I losing my mind now?

1302
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,640
Not family, that was a family video.

1303
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,640
Country Donuts, thank you.

1304
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,240
Country Donuts that we liked better.

1305
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,800
We thought was a better quality than Dunkin',

1306
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,480
and I think they probably were.

1307
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,640
So my hypothetical figure from the future says,

1308
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:16,360
what if I told you one day Dunkin' Donuts will be,

1309
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,720
well, actually, well, that's all right,

1310
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,080
but there's this one that's better.

1311
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,840
And I would explain to him that it's not really

1312
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:21,680
one of my favorites.

1313
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,760
I would be real pithy about it.

1314
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,520
All right, oh well, all right.

1315
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,560
I'll go tell Jason about the,

1316
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,440
I'll go tell your eventual friend Jason

1317
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,040
about the Dunkin' Donuts instead.

1318
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,080
He'll like it better.

1319
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,600
So, yeah.

1320
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,840
What I did, I made it.

1321
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:36,960
I made it to California though.

1322
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,040
You made it, and you did go on Roger Rabbit's cartoon spin.

1323
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:43,720
You answered all of the trivia questions correctly

1324
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,800
at Lucia Tribute, and you got to California.

1325
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,200
Sure.

1326
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,920
My future two and a half hour.

1327
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,280
Oh, I'm ready for two and a half hours on the Lucy.

1328
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,120
Oh, that's right.

1329
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,160
We had the discussion in text about

1330
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,760
what would be a C ticket, and there was the declaration,

1331
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,600
no, no, no, Lucy, a tribute is a full episode.

1332
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,440
Yeah, in case you don't.

1333
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,200
If you don't know, yeah, there, where, Mike.

1334
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,600
I was gonna say, on our Patreon,

1335
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,320
which is our exclusive episodes for the subscribers,

1336
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:13,080
like we have little shorter episodes for stuff that,

1337
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,640
maybe that doesn't warrant a two hour discussion.

1338
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:17,720
Only an hour. Not that much shorter.

1339
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,760
Not that much shorter, yeah,

1340
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,680
about a 45 minutes to an hour or something,

1341
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:22,320
and I think, yeah, Scott was like,

1342
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,880
you know, we could do Lucy, the Experience on the C ticket.

1343
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,080
I think Jason and I were like, no, full episode.

1344
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,040
Hang on a minute.

1345
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,240
We've got Gail Gordon to get through.

1346
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:37,240
Yeah, so there will be a full Lucy, the Experience episode.

1347
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,560
Okay, let me talk about something big

1348
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,960
so that I don't forget it.

1349
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:47,120
As I said, a successful part of this ride,

1350
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,760
and I think what is neat about this ride,

1351
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:52,040
is that it is a spinning ride, like the teacups,

1352
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,680
mixed with a dark ride.

1353
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:55,160
Very cool idea.

1354
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,920
I wish the spinning worked better.

1355
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,200
It's pretty arduous to do it,

1356
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,480
and I found there's something where,

1357
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:06,600
if you're turning left, then if you spin left, it's great,

1358
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,000
or vice versa, but if you're spinning against the grain,

1359
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,360
the thing kinda struggles.

1360
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,880
Which children love to do.

1361
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,800
There's gotta be a new version of this.

1362
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,960
I don't know if it exists yet,

1363
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,120
but there's gotta be a new version of this

1364
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,840
where you're just hitting buttons,

1365
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,800
and you're not actually, with your strength,

1366
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,240
spinning the ride, because that is what,

1367
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,680
I think, is happening there.

1368
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:29,880
You are literally using all of your might

1369
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,440
to switch the ride to a different direction.

1370
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,080
Like an actual old car, no power steering,

1371
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,000
no power assisted steering.

1372
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:37,840
Yes, exactly.

1373
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,360
A kind of car will never have to drive.

1374
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:43,080
Yeah, and it's not like Buzz Lightyear either,

1375
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,640
which is just kind of a joystick.

1376
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,880
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

1377
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,320
Oh no, you're right, there it is.

1378
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:48,160
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1379
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,720
That's the way to do it.

1380
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,520
But that's not really an out of control spin.

1381
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:55,560
Right, but I'm sure there's a way to just do that

1382
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,960
that's a little bit wilder,

1383
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,320
because you don't wanna be wild

1384
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,480
when you're trying to shoot at Emperor Zerg.

1385
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,280
You want aim and precision.

1386
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,640
Yeah, right, but that's exactly what you're saying.

1387
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,120
I was like, I don't know if this exists.

1388
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,160
So this ties exactly into what I wanted to talk about,

1389
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:15,160
which is that they knew they wanted to do a spinning ride,

1390
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:20,160
and there was the talk of what is our ride vehicle

1391
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,760
going to be.

1392
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,840
Maybe it is an OmniMover,

1393
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,600
which is what the Haunted Mansion most famously is,

1394
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,320
and also what Buzz Lightyear is,

1395
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,160
where it's a track that is nothing but cars

1396
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,480
that is always going

1397
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,880
unless somebody needs assistance getting in the car.

1398
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:39,920
And so there was discussion of, well, is it that?

1399
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:41,960
Is it an OmniMover,

1400
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:45,440
or is it something where you're launching individual cars

1401
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,640
a la Pinocchio's Daring Journey,

1402
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,600
or the other Disneyland, or the other Fantasyland dark rides?

1403
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,280
And to solve this issue,

1404
01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:00,800
apparently Imagineers got to take a teacup

1405
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:05,800
and put it on the Haunted Mansion and Pinocchio's Daring Journey.

1406
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:11,320
This is a story that has resonated in my head since childhood.

1407
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:16,360
I had to go back into my physical copy of Disney News

1408
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,280
that I subscribed to from the 90s,

1409
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:23,080
and I looked it up to make sure I wasn't crazy.

1410
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,640
I couldn't find this online anywhere.

1411
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,280
This is lost to the sands of time.

1412
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:29,360
You just remembered this from 20 years ago.

1413
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,440
And I think it factors into how much I liked the ride,

1414
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,240
that I maybe liked the ride more than you guys.

1415
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:35,200
It's possible that I've had this in my head for so long.

1416
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:38,960
The idea that this fantasy

1417
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,440
of taking a different ride vehicle,

1418
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,440
like the power of these Disney people,

1419
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,680
they took a teacup onto the Haunted Mansion

1420
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,240
and they spun it around the entire ride.

1421
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,000
That's interesting.

1422
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,680
That you talk about Disneyland fantasies or whatever,

1423
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:58,080
that is upon remembering it immediately on there.

1424
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,240
Yeah, wow, that's like, I'm trying to think

1425
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:03,640
what else you could fit onto the Haunted Mansion track.

1426
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:08,520
Like, cause it's a perfect, I guess, like a toad vehicle.

1427
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,240
You could pull like a toad motor car

1428
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,800
on the Haunted Mansion track.

1429
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,440
But I guess there's no other,

1430
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:17,880
what you'd wanna do is drive a car yourself around.

1431
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,400
Yes, that's true.

1432
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,400
You wanna take an Autopia car through the Haunted Mansion

1433
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,240
is what you wanna do.

1434
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,080
Yes, but that's-

1435
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,280
Crash into all the tombstones and the ghosts.

1436
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,440
Right.

1437
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,560
You may as well just take a golf cart though at that point.

1438
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,240
Or like a- Yes, great.

1439
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,040
Ford Focus or a smart car.

1440
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,320
Or send the Haunted Mansion, or send,

1441
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:39,160
sorry, send a Space Mountain bug going through there.

1442
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,880
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that would be good.

1443
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:41,720
Or flood it with water.

1444
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,920
And let me take a log through the Haunted Mansion.

1445
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,760
Sure.

1446
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,440
This is the Disneyland in the future.

1447
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,720
What about the Cars ride from the Meteor Springs?

1448
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:49,680
Absolutely.

1449
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,680
Yeah, that'd be good too.

1450
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,040
Maybe too wide.

1451
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:55,360
I wanna take a Main Street Electrical Parade bug.

1452
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,600
Oh, I mean, this is decadent.

1453
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,840
Just imagining this.

1454
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:01,240
You won't even allow yourself such a fantasy.

1455
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,520
Yeah.

1456
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,760
It's too good.

1457
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,200
Wait, wait, wait.

1458
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:09,280
Put the Star Speeder on the Haunted Mansion track

1459
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,720
and ride Star Tours while you're going

1460
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,680
through the Haunted Mansion.

1461
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:17,920
So with like windows, you can also look into the cemetery?

1462
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:18,760
No.

1463
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,480
You just know you're there.

1464
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,560
You just know.

1465
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,520
If you're showing a security video,

1466
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,720
you know you're taking a Star Tours

1467
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,440
through the Haunted Mansion.

1468
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,280
You'll just know it.

1469
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,160
It'll be a thing, you'll a little secret.

1470
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,800
And Mike, yours would be just a regular Doom buggy,

1471
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,200
but Teddy Barrow would be a company.

1472
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,080
You know, room for one more.

1473
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,720
Like she's the animatronic, pats the seat.

1474
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,280
If you could take an entire,

1475
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:45,120
if you could do a swing ride all the way

1476
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,640
through the Haunted Mansion,

1477
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,200
and you're sitting on a swing with Teddy Barrow.

1478
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,480
And Michael's just covered in flop sweat by the end of it.

1479
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:53,200
What about Silly Symphony swings

1480
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,320
and Teddy Barrow's in the swing next to you

1481
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:56,800
at California Adventure?

1482
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,840
Cause she swings, she's swinging Teddy Barrow.

1483
01:13:58,840 --> 01:13:59,680
Yeah, that's true.

1484
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,800
So every other one, there's like a robot bear or something.

1485
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,160
Like your childhood,

1486
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:07,600
you are withholding your own satisfaction.

1487
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,160
Put yourself in the swing.

1488
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:12,240
No, I'm too uncomfortable.

1489
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,080
I can't.

1490
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,960
I can't have that much happiness.

1491
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,640
I want her close, but not touching me.

1492
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:18,760
I would prefer that.

1493
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,320
You want her to be able to like,

1494
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,000
cheekily wave from afar and wink.

1495
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,440
This is what I wanted in junior high,

1496
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,920
in high school.

1497
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:30,320
And I want it when we're doing this weird bear fantasy.

1498
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:31,600
The only thing that would be better

1499
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,320
than taking a teacup through the haunted mansion.

1500
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,400
So apparently this was done.

1501
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,240
They did it.

1502
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:37,080
Wow.

1503
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:41,080
And they said, and Pinocchio, let's not discount that.

1504
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,840
They took a teacup through Pinocchio.

1505
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:44,200
That's so crazy.

1506
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,480
How does this happen?

1507
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:48,240
How does it, like mechanics have to like,

1508
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:51,080
wheel a teacup around and they have to drop it onto a,

1509
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,040
how does it even function on those other?

1510
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,920
Tight clearances in Pinocchio too.

1511
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,480
Yeah, can it even make it through?

1512
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:58,320
It's so straight.

1513
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,440
It almost makes me wonder if this is like a made up story.

1514
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,200
Did you find the magazine?

1515
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,120
Oh yeah, I read it.

1516
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:03,960
Oh, okay, great.

1517
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:04,800
Oh yes, with quotes.

1518
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,080
I forgot, I didn't write down their names,

1519
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:09,040
but Imagineers are quoted who say that they did this.

1520
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:12,960
They said that the haunted mansion was cool,

1521
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:17,040
especially because they got to go down the hill

1522
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:20,080
into the cemetery, like, you know,

1523
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,720
where you were down by the shaking leg guy.

1524
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,600
They got to do that hill spinning the entire way.

1525
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,280
And that was super cool.

1526
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,120
However,

1527
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,880
the public could not be trusted with that ability.

1528
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,480
Once you fall out of the teacup

1529
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,080
when you're going down to the cemetery.

1530
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,240
It is kind of steep.

1531
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,280
Or everybody would like spin down to the side.

1532
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,160
You could never like stay up on top.

1533
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,000
But I feel like you could fall out.

1534
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:43,840
Yeah.

1535
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,680
At the angle.

1536
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,840
Absolutely, yeah.

1537
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,360
Maybe they were like belted around like,

1538
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,840
when you're sawing a tree down at the top.

1539
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:51,680
You know what I'm saying?

1540
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1541
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,880
Or they were strapped in like a rapid ride or something.

1542
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,800
Jason gave me that.

1543
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,000
When I said that Jason gave me the eyes like,

1544
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,240
I know.

1545
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,600
I know what that tree chopping down is.

1546
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,320
Your log in days.

1547
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,200
So they did this.

1548
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,720
And then, but actually,

1549
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,120
so it's something like, well, that was very cool.

1550
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,360
Do we do an Omni-Mover?

1551
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,680
Then they did Pinocchio.

1552
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:13,720
What they found was, oh, this is so cool.

1553
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,960
There's doors smashing open,

1554
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,400
something that you couldn't do in the haunted mansion.

1555
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,280
Like the haunted mansion, there's no obstacles

1556
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:23,640
because there has to be constant cars going through.

1557
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,560
But when you're crashing through doors,

1558
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,680
and like, or if you, you know,

1559
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,840
clearly there's a part in Roger Rabbit

1560
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,720
that's very much like Mr. Toe,

1561
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:35,680
kind of a tribute to Mr. Toe,

1562
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,400
to like the explosion goes off and now like,

1563
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,480
and it's, and you're spinning while doing it.

1564
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,640
So you're disoriented and everything.

1565
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,080
So you could do effects like that.

1566
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,400
And the coolest thing they found was that

1567
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,400
they're spinning towards Monstro at the end.

1568
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:53,360
And they're approaching and Monstro is starting to rise.

1569
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,800
Then they do a rotation.

1570
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,160
And now Monstro's right in your face.

1571
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:58,000
Right.

1572
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:58,960
So it's as if he's, you know,

1573
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,440
he's three times bigger in the space of a second.

1574
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,320
So they said, that's what it has to be.

1575
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,640
It has to be a fantasy land dark ride combined

1576
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,360
with the teacups as opposed to the Omni-Mover.

1577
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,200
Yeah.

1578
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,680
And this experiment, that's the kind of thing

1579
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,600
that makes you like, you'd go,

1580
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,840
I'd kill to be an Imagineer.

1581
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:16,680
That's so fun.

1582
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,560
So, so neat.

1583
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:21,640
So, it's interesting they went with the full,

1584
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:24,400
like you can decide where you're turning though,

1585
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,720
because that specific effect you're talking about

1586
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:29,360
with like all of a sudden coming upon Monstro,

1587
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:33,160
when the guest is doing that, it's like, that's random.

1588
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,520
So it is weird that they didn't just make it a spinning ride

1589
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,520
that was pre-programmed.

1590
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,360
Sure.

1591
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,200
Cause it does seem like that way.

1592
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1593
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:43,440
Where they could like make things happen

1594
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,600
to their liking.

1595
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,200
But I guess, but hey, it's up to you.

1596
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,040
It's up to the guest.

1597
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,400
I think probably interactive rides are becoming in vogue

1598
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,440
because that was in the biggest way gonna happen

1599
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,440
with Indiana Jones very soon.

1600
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,480
So they're probably thinking,

1601
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,640
who guests wanna customize the experience?

1602
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,360
And I think they also thought, maybe you don't wanna spin.

1603
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,200
Maybe you're not-

1604
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,520
Or you mean random ride, like randomized.

1605
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,440
Yeah, what did I say?

1606
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,280
Customized.

1607
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:09,640
Oh yeah, it's not, yeah, it's not gonna make

1608
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,600
your own experience, but like, yeah,

1609
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,400
I guess rides that are different every time.

1610
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,640
Yeah, that switch between things.

1611
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,480
Yeah, yeah, that makes some sense.

1612
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,120
But yeah, it does seem like that would be a cool,

1613
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,000
cause it seems like with Humpoo's Honey Hunt,

1614
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,520
which I apologies again to you for not being able

1615
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,440
to do this when you're in Japan.

1616
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,400
But like, there's a lot of, I don't know,

1617
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,440
there's nothing as big as that reveal you're talking about,

1618
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:32,480
but it is like spins and stuff and you can really

1619
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,440
all of a sudden spring something on you

1620
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:38,640
because the audience is not controlling it obviously.

1621
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,960
So it does feel like it's a missed opportunity

1622
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,080
to do some of that fun stuff.

1623
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:42,920
Well, I get the idea.

1624
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,240
I think in retrospect, I think this Roger Rabbit ride

1625
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:48,960
is maybe like a step in the direction of stuff

1626
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,280
like Pooh's Honey Hunt.

1627
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,600
It's like even more dynamic and that's like

1628
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,000
a Fantasyland Dark Ride, but five times longer

1629
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,760
and crazier animatronics.

1630
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:01,080
But I do, you know, I think it's a type of ride

1631
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:04,040
that I like, that's all of those Fantasyland rides

1632
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,360
are pretty claustrophobic.

1633
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,200
They're done very quickly.

1634
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,560
You don't cover a lot of space.

1635
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,360
And I like that this Roger Rabbit ride is, you know,

1636
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,640
two times bigger.

1637
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,040
I kind of wish there were more of these.

1638
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,480
It's like Little Mermaid, which I enjoy.

1639
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:19,800
It's like Monster Zink, I don't go on a lot,

1640
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:22,360
but I like that it's there, like kind of a two times,

1641
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,680
three times bigger Dark Ride.

1642
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:28,440
Yeah, I, Little Mermaid obviously is a good example

1643
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,600
of what this kind of feels like.

1644
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,400
I do think this one's better than Little Mermaid,

1645
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:34,920
even though like the robots are better

1646
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,440
and there's some like better show scenes.

1647
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,160
And, but like we were talking like the,

1648
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,000
there's a couple more memorable things to me,

1649
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,160
like the buildings at the end is a very fun, cool effect.

1650
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,160
Yes, great scene.

1651
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,680
Yeah, absolutely.

1652
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:49,880
But I do feel like the first half

1653
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:52,600
is a little bit unmemorable to me.

1654
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,600
Well, like I said, like it feels like

1655
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,400
it's much more memorable in Pinocchio.

1656
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,720
Some of the same kind of themes and tricks

1657
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:03,720
and very similar settings kind of are like in Pinocchio

1658
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:06,720
and Toad and they just stick out in my brain more.

1659
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:09,920
And maybe this is my problem for just going on it five times

1660
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,560
and not 20 times like, or 30 times,

1661
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,320
like I've probably done Toad or Pinocchio.

1662
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,640
But I do feel like it's, I don't know what it is.

1663
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,880
I don't know if it's like, since it's got a bigger space

1664
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,200
and it's not like knocking me out like Pooh's Honey Hunt,

1665
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,520
like maybe, I don't know.

1666
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:29,360
It doesn't resonate with me as much.

1667
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,720
Doesn't feel iconic maybe?

1668
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,080
Yeah, I guess it doesn't feel iconic.

1669
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,080
It doesn't feel like it has like these big,

1670
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,440
like the biggest, the best thing in the ride

1671
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,240
is the buildings, right?

1672
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:41,760
Yeah, you explode, you are exploded out of the building

1673
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:45,560
and you fall from the sky essentially.

1674
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,760
You're just going down a hallway,

1675
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:47,920
but because of perspective,

1676
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,000
it looks like you are falling.

1677
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,760
A trick that I really only associate otherwise with,

1678
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:55,760
I guess isn't too right,

1679
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,320
but mostly the amazing adventures of Spider-Man

1680
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:01,840
has a great, like when Dr. Doom is levitating you

1681
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,920
and then unlevitates you and you fall

1682
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,480
and there's falling buildings on the screen

1683
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,640
and like sets around you

1684
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,920
and then Spider-Man catches you in his web.

1685
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,000
And I think they do it again in Transformers too

1686
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:15,960
because it's got some similar beats.

1687
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:16,800
It's very similar, yeah.

1688
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,640
Yeah.

1689
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,160
Sort of a visual drop.

1690
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:22,320
Yeah, but I can't think of like a practical dark ride

1691
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,840
that really does it,

1692
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,520
and at least doesn't do it as effectively

1693
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,920
as Roger Rabbit does.

1694
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,440
Yeah, it's very clever

1695
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,640
and to like shift your perspective on a ride

1696
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:36,080
that is just going flat.

1697
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,920
Now there was gonna be something

1698
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,920
that would spice the thing up

1699
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,000
and give it like a boost over other rides,

1700
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,040
which is that in the original plans,

1701
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:51,040
you were gonna go up to a second floor and go outside

1702
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,320
and that the entire top level

1703
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:57,560
of like the not the residential half of Toontown,

1704
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:02,000
but the city half with the gag factory and the fire station,

1705
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,600
that that second level was gonna have the kinetic energy

1706
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,480
of the cabs spinning around up top.

1707
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,320
Yeah, sure.

1708
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,720
And if you were able to spin around outside

1709
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:13,760
and get a different perspective on the land.

1710
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,040
Like that would have done it for me.

1711
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:18,240
Cause it's like most of those rides,

1712
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,240
you can pick out three to five things.

1713
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,080
That's usually what I say,

1714
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,880
like three to five moves or big things where you go,

1715
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,760
I love that, that, that.

1716
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,040
And then that leads up to a ride.

1717
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,320
But like this one, it's like, I like that building thing.

1718
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,840
I like that end scene.

1719
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,080
Portable hole.

1720
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,480
The port, yeah, the portable hole.

1721
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:36,240
The stretching arm is very, very neat.

1722
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,720
But those are the two things I think I go,

1723
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,440
those two things are great.

1724
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,600
And Roger Rabbit, like kind of,

1725
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,000
cause you fall through like the roof of the building.

1726
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,160
And like, after you fall through the city,

1727
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:51,920
you fall through a building, like with a staircase.

1728
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,840
And Roger Rabbit is sort of like up in the one corner

1729
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,880
going like, I'll help you, I'll get you down.

1730
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,880
It doesn't really stick the landing and the transition

1731
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:04,880
from the stairway to the other factory you go into

1732
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,640
or the other warehouse.

1733
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:09,560
Like that's kind of a weird in between hallway.

1734
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,560
And like the Jessica, there's Jessica Rabbit,

1735
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,320
but it's like, she's kind of an afterthought

1736
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,200
in the scene in a way.

1737
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:18,320
And not in the ride elsewhere, not teased.

1738
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,160
You're gonna see Jessica Rabbit in this ride.

1739
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:21,720
It's not like you go into a club and it's dark

1740
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:24,040
and there's Jessica Rabbit and she's singing or something,

1741
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:26,280
which seems like that would have been the time,

1742
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,400
that would have been such a showcase kind of scene.

1743
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:31,200
And like a concert is going haywire.

1744
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,040
Sure.

1745
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,960
Like she's being chased around

1746
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,680
or the angels have taken it over.

1747
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,160
It feels like it's missing stuff like that

1748
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:40,240
or something like where you really kind of get.

1749
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,120
Is baby Herman in the ride?

1750
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:42,960
It's a good question.

1751
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,160
I don't know the answer to it, right?

1752
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:47,360
They said, what I read was that the Imagineers

1753
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:51,080
were attempting to capture the essence of Roger Rabbit.

1754
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:54,800
And I think that is a more interesting point of view

1755
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:58,000
than Little Mermaid, which is like, I guess.

1756
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
The telling the story.

1757
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,160
The book report as Tony sometimes says,

1758
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,240
the book report version of the story.

1759
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,080
That's true, yeah.

1760
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,680
But then you end up like missing big things

1761
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:08,520
you like from the movie.

1762
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,360
You misspeak them.

1763
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,640
I mean, there's no mention of Bob Hoskins characters

1764
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,640
or other humans and stuff.

1765
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:16,440
Weird thing that always kind of rubbed me the wrong way

1766
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:20,080
that bumped for me is like in the opening scene,

1767
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:23,320
like the first time you spin,

1768
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:26,480
it's because like they dumped the dip on the ground.

1769
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:31,480
But like Roger and Benny are in the middle of the dip

1770
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,480
and they're just kind of like, whoa.

1771
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,480
And it's like, shouldn't Benny be dead?

1772
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,320
Like shouldn't he be dead?

1773
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:39,120
You are of course in Lenny the Cab.

1774
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,520
That was the thing I learned about.

1775
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:44,480
You ride in Lenny the Cab, his relative.

1776
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,520
Why in the world are you not,

1777
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,240
I guess it's because they wanted Benny to be,

1778
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,440
you wanna be able to see Benny.

1779
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,560
So you're in Lenny.

1780
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:54,520
But who cares?

1781
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:55,640
What do you mean?

1782
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:57,400
I don't think I would care.

1783
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,520
I think just, I'm in the,

1784
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,440
why create an identical brother?

1785
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,280
Yeah.

1786
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:04,960
It's very confusing.

1787
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:05,800
Prestige-esque.

1788
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,440
The prestige really ripped off

1789
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,200
the Roger Ebbett cartoon spin, right?

1790
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,720
We didn't really talk about loading into the ride.

1791
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:15,040
I didn't remember this is what the cars looked like.

1792
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,960
That it's like two people to a car,

1793
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:19,920
but each car, but there's two cars.

1794
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,560
It's like a pair of cars every time.

1795
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:22,600
So if you have a party of four,

1796
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,360
you can all kind of ride together.

1797
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:27,160
And I guess it's split up so if some people wanna spin

1798
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:29,600
and some people don't, you can do that.

1799
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,800
But it's a weird shrunk midi cars.

1800
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,960
Okay, so what you just reminded me,

1801
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,720
obviously you can't be in Benny.

1802
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,840
You have to be in Lenny so you can see Benny.

1803
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,600
But you're next to another Lenny.

1804
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,680
So why are we okay with two Lenny's?

1805
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:47,680
Why can't we just be,

1806
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:50,800
if we're already breaking car math.

1807
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,600
Are they all, like how did the taxi,

1808
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,960
cause there are other cabs in Toontown, right?

1809
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,360
It's not just Benny.

1810
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,600
Clearly Lenny is also pulling some of the weight.

1811
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,080
Lenny is not in the movie, right?

1812
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,800
Lenny is totally ride specific.

1813
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,640
So Lenny is like Botanicus.

1814
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,520
Lenny is a created for, well no, no,

1815
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,120
that's not different cause he was created in a book first.

1816
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,280
So it's not Botanicus, but it's a,

1817
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,120
who's a ride specific character.

1818
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,680
Well we'd have to go to who censored Roger Rabbit

1819
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:16,040
and figure out how many taxi cabs are in that.

1820
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,600
Okay, but we haven't done that.

1821
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,840
Oh yeah, so Lenny the cab could be in the book,

1822
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,400
which is why Gary Wolf is owed money.

1823
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,240
Right.

1824
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,560
Maybe he is in canon.

1825
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:27,840
He is like just out of the clink.

1826
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,280
He was doing some time.

1827
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,560
And then the ride is post movie.

1828
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:35,600
So he is back on his feet, turned his life around.

1829
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,440
Okay, yeah.

1830
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:37,920
So there's multiple Lenny's.

1831
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:38,760
There's multiple Lenny's.

1832
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:42,160
But I guess in the narrative of most rides,

1833
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,240
the other cars don't exist.

1834
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,120
Even though some, a lot of rides,

1835
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,400
car vehicles are different and named differently,

1836
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:53,400
but I think you're not supposed to see the other people.

1837
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,600
It's supposed to be just you're during this happening once.

1838
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,280
In Alice in Wonderland, you're in the caterpillar

1839
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:59,840
and then you see the caterpillar.

1840
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,680
That's true.

1841
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:01,520
Yeah, who gives a shit?

1842
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,360
Why are we starting to break this apart now?

1843
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,200
You know, it was the 60s man.

1844
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:05,040
And suddenly in the 90s.

1845
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,280
It was the 60s.

1846
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:10,840
The 90s was just, everyone was having their lattes.

1847
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:13,520
They were too logical in the 90s.

1848
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,760
I guess probably it's like the Cars Ride 2

1849
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,280
where it's like you're in very similar

1850
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:21,000
to Lightning McQueen's, but they're not Lightning McQueen.

1851
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,320
They're different colors.

1852
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,800
They don't have names.

1853
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,920
I think it's just naming it Lenny

1854
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:26,760
is the thing that's throwing us off.

1855
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,640
All of them are Lenny.

1856
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:30,400
That is an issue for me.

1857
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,000
You're inside a Lenny that's next to another Lenny.

1858
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,160
Should have just not named it Lenny.

1859
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:36,000
No.

1860
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,640
It should just be Citizens.

1861
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:38,480
That's a-

1862
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,520
Lenny and Kenny, it's another one.

1863
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:42,040
A thing that's always rubbed me the wrong way

1864
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:45,400
about Toontown though is Mickey's Toontown.

1865
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:47,040
It's Roger Rabbit's Toontown.

1866
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,120
Mickey is a resident.

1867
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,280
Roger's the king.

1868
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:53,560
This is a different, I think it's a different Toontown.

1869
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,880
I think it's like there's multiple Springfields

1870
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:56,880
in the world.

1871
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,720
But isn't that Toontown like the bad Toontown?

1872
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:02,280
Mickey's Toontown is Disney Toontown.

1873
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:04,080
It's a little wacky, but it's friendly.

1874
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,160
But they're splitting the difference.

1875
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:06,680
And they're just splitting.

1876
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,240
But I'm saying once you go on the ride,

1877
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,680
it's like the bad part of town or something.

1878
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:11,920
Like that's the Roger Toontown.

1879
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,360
But that's just Los Angeles.

1880
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,400
Sure.

1881
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,840
I'm just saying, I think that's probably the difference

1882
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,120
they make in their heads.

1883
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:21,160
Outside it's Mickey's Toontown, inside the Roger Rabbit.

1884
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:22,240
Obviously it's Roger's.

1885
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:25,000
But then wouldn't that just be downtown LA?

1886
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,480
Because that's where all the warehouses and the judge

1887
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:28,320
and stuff are, right?

1888
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,120
But it's still a different, you have to take the tunnel

1889
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:31,240
to get to Toontown.

1890
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,160
It's still a separate place.

1891
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:34,000
That's true.

1892
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,440
It's sort of a north side, south side Chicago situation.

1893
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:40,120
There's friendlier parts and there's less friendly parts.

1894
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:40,960
Sure.

1895
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,880
That's what's happening.

1896
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:43,400
You don't really go through a tunnel

1897
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:44,920
to get to this Toontown either.

1898
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:48,840
I guess you de facto go under the Disneyland Railroad.

1899
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:50,880
But they don't make it look like

1900
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:51,720
like they're gonna make.

1901
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,960
The graphic 110 exit that was used for.

1902
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:57,960
They're gonna have the frightening tunnel.

1903
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:58,760
Frightening tunnel, yeah.

1904
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:01,040
For Nintendo Land you're gonna go through a pipe.

1905
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:01,880
I mean that's great.

1906
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:03,200
Which is very exciting, yes.

1907
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,120
Oh man.

1908
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,440
There's like a big start button outside supposedly

1909
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,680
and then there's like a big green pipe you go through

1910
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:09,880
to get into Nintendo Land.

1911
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,000
And if the rides are broken they just blow on them.

1912
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Sure.

1913
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:13,840
Hey.

1914
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:14,680
Wish I could press that.

1915
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,800
I knew I had to couch that in an annoying voice.

1916
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,640
The cat scale comedian voice.

1917
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:18,520
I knew it was a little bad.

1918
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:19,920
Wish I could press that start button

1919
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:23,640
to pause the people coming into the land.

1920
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:24,480
Cause it would be so crowded.

1921
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,720
It's gonna be so crowded.

1922
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,680
It's starting to get scary.

1923
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:30,520
All right.

1924
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,600
Crowd control is not great, no.

1925
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,760
We'll write all these jokes down and put it in a set.

1926
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:34,760
A standup set.

1927
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:35,600
Yeah, sure.

1928
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:36,800
The most successful set of all time.

1929
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,680
And then obviously close with,

1930
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,440
what, where do I, here's the phone.

1931
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:45,560
So, what, okay.

1932
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:48,240
I mean you're right that scenes are not super memorable.

1933
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:49,080
But fun.

1934
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:50,360
I don't wanna be like a hater.

1935
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,200
I don't hate this ride or anything.

1936
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,040
I know, I feel like this episode's been more negative

1937
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,360
than it needs to be.

1938
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:55,200
I don't think so.

1939
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,760
I like it, but I think we could like it more.

1940
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,600
It could be bright.

1941
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,600
I'm hoping that I find what I'm looking for

1942
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,760
in the Tokyo version.

1943
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:05,360
You know, there's some cynicism and some brightness

1944
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:06,520
in the movie itself.

1945
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:09,320
It feels like a fitting tribute to this world,

1946
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:12,600
to the characters, to the late Bob Hoskins,

1947
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:13,800
which so great.

1948
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,480
Bob Hoskins is so great in that movie.

1949
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:17,320
Well I don't think the ride's a fitting tribute

1950
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:18,320
to the late Bob Hoskins.

1951
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,280
No, I mean our episode is a fitting tribute.

1952
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,120
It is?

1953
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:21,960
Isn't it?

1954
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:22,800
Why?

1955
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,040
Well, a fitting tribute to the spirit of the movie.

1956
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:24,880
You've talked about him for like two minutes.

1957
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:25,800
And he's a part of the movie.

1958
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,440
I don't, come on.

1959
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,520
I like him, I just don't think we tributed him.

1960
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,640
Yeah, I don't think we said barely anything about him.

1961
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:35,120
I certainly have not said the name Bob Hoskins

1962
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,120
the whole time. Okay.

1963
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:38,240
I guess the movie in general.

1964
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,480
His memory will always remain.

1965
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:41,320
He's a great actor.

1966
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:42,160
He's a great actor.

1967
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:45,480
It's a wily, the spinning,

1968
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:46,680
with hard to spin movie.

1969
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,040
We were monitoring Nintendo Land.

1970
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:49,880
Oh yeah.

1971
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:52,440
Of course he was famously Mario after.

1972
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:54,640
There'll be a start button and then there'll also be a sign

1973
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:56,880
that says in memory of Bob Hoskins.

1974
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,840
Yeah, like kind of like a little shrine,

1975
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:01,840
like a Catholic shrine or something to Bob Hoskins outside.

1976
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:02,840
He was very good.

1977
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:06,080
He was, he like Christopher Lloyd also in this film,

1978
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,520
so blew my mind as a child.

1979
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:10,520
That's all the same guy.

1980
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:11,360
Yeah.

1981
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:15,200
Doc Brown and Judge Doom and Fester are all the same guy.

1982
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:20,200
Eddie and Smee and Mario are all the same guy.

1983
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:21,760
Crazy.

1984
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,640
These guys were so goddamn good.

1985
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:26,120
Yeah, Christopher Lloyd, Rick Moran,

1986
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:29,800
it's like early comedy, comedy heroes.

1987
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:30,920
Early comedy.

1988
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:32,560
I really liked Camp Nowhere.

1989
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,160
Like Christopher Lloyd's really funny.

1990
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:37,600
It's like this like weirdo who helps these kids

1991
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,600
have a camp with no other adult supervision.

1992
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:42,760
Yeah.

1993
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:45,440
This episode is a fitting tribute to Camp Nowhere.

1994
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:46,280
Okay, all right.

1995
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:49,280
That is just about enough.

1996
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:51,480
It's really fed up.

1997
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:53,560
Pumkin' holes.

1998
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:55,280
Well, what else do we got?

1999
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:58,200
Because we have a little bit of other stuff to talk about.

2000
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:00,720
Our outro, our tribute to ourselves.

2001
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:04,040
I mean, yeah, we like it.

2002
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:07,200
Just like I wish there had been more Roger Rabbit,

2003
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:11,080
I wish they had come to terms to make a full land

2004
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:15,160
or continue making movies and stuff with the characters.

2005
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:18,880
I wish they would like figure out solutions to like the line

2006
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,640
or like gussy up the paint and the lights and stuff like that.

2007
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:24,400
And I think if there had been more Roger Rabbit

2008
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,720
in the parks, I think that might have encouraged

2009
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:28,000
there to be more films.

2010
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,400
It might have kept him alive a little more.

2011
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:33,800
It's like, is there a bigger missed opportunity

2012
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,120
franchise-wise than who friend Roger Rabbit?

2013
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:39,600
But isn't Jessica Rabbit merch a thing that does sell?

2014
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:41,400
Yeah, but there's not that much of it anymore.

2015
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:41,760
Right.

2016
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,240
There used to be a lot more, I think.

2017
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:46,920
But now I don't even know if I can remember

2018
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,040
seeing something recently.

2019
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:51,280
Back to Betty Boop now.

2020
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:55,240
If you're sexy and into the 40s, you

2021
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:58,520
want to represent that with a purse, turn to Betty Boop.

2022
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:00,680
I mean, one of the things that's stuck around

2023
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:03,680
since opening of Islands of Adventure, no shortage

2024
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,440
of Betty Boop merchandise.

2025
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,360
Yeah, and then that Simon Cowell-produced Betty Boop

2026
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,800
movie, which is true.

2027
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:10,680
That's a real thing.

2028
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:11,840
What?

2029
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:12,840
Did that happen?

2030
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:15,840
No, but I think like a year ago it was like Simon Cowell

2031
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,080
to produce Betty Boop movie.

2032
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:19,880
That's not made up.

2033
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:20,400
That's real.

2034
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,040
You want him to produce movies now?

2035
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:23,560
I guess so.

2036
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:25,120
Yeah, so maybe Betty Boop will.

2037
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,920
Paula Abdul's family circus.

2038
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:36,400
I could pick of no way to top that.

2039
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,080
With that Roger Aveds cartoon spin,

2040
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:41,840
and if we missed anything, please let us know,

2041
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,360
because we jumped around a lot.

2042
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:47,560
But we need to jump to something else, something else big.

2043
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:48,840
Oh, yeah.

2044
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:50,640
You know, I hope I didn't build it up too much.

2045
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:52,600
And yet, there's no way to build it up too much,

2046
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:55,080
because this is major news.

2047
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:58,200
If you are an avid listener to the podcast,

2048
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:01,240
then you know that we have been tracking for a long time

2049
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:05,160
since before the podcast began the opening of Jimmy Buffett's

2050
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:10,520
Margaritaville, the resort in Orlando,

2051
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:15,560
which is not just a hotel, but also a timeshare situation,

2052
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:16,680
like a condo.

2053
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:19,400
But you can live in the Margaritaville Resort.

2054
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,720
Yeah, it's a village, right?

2055
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:24,400
Well, it's unclear exactly what the terminology is.

2056
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:27,240
It was announced as Margaritaville Village,

2057
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:27,920
which is good.

2058
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:31,160
But then it became Margaritaville Village,

2059
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:32,200
which is not good.

2060
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:33,080
It was clunky.

2061
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,680
On the website, it just says Margaritaville Resort now.

2062
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:38,480
So I don't think the village is being used anymore.

2063
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,480
Which is different than Latitude's Margaritaville,

2064
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,880
which is like a 55 and older residential neighborhood.

2065
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,400
It's not a retirement community.

2066
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:52,080
It is a water park slash hotel slash place you can live slash,

2067
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,400
I don't know.

2068
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,120
Mud pits?

2069
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:57,040
Have they fixed the mud pits?

2070
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,400
I don't know about them.

2071
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:01,240
They're just keeping the houses out of there.

2072
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:04,480
Let nature solve the mud pits, and then we'll build a house.

2073
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:08,200
Let the gas station deal with it, the adjacent gas station.

2074
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:12,960
But what is clear is that we don't even know the name of it.

2075
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,000
Let's you know that they have had some trouble

2076
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,840
with the names in this place.

2077
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:23,400
And in fact, they put it out to any potential condo buyers,

2078
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:28,400
which we pretended to be, to say, please help us name

2079
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,320
our streets.

2080
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:33,480
This is a year and a half before we start doing this podcast,

2081
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:34,480
I think.

2082
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,760
And I think I got the email first,

2083
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:39,600
and it was like, hey, Parrot Heads,

2084
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,000
we're creating a Margarita Village in Orlando.

2085
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:47,520
Send us some ideas for fun Jimmy Buffett inspired street names.

2086
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,440
And they gave us all the different like,

2087
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,560
avenue, street, circle.

2088
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:53,440
You can do anything you want.

2089
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:56,360
So we got on a text chain with, I

2090
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,280
don't know if we were all in the same text chain,

2091
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:04,320
but three of us and then Anthony Geo, past guest Anthony Geo.

2092
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,520
We got to have him on.

2093
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,040
I know, he has to have him on.

2094
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,200
Yeah, we've only been on that singular episode.

2095
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,000
It's kind of short changed him by only having him the once.

2096
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,760
Right, he's certainly not been on a ton of times.

2097
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:16,000
So yeah, the four of us just made up

2098
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,440
a bunch of names for streets.

2099
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:19,280
How many?

2100
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:20,400
100.

2101
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,320
100.

2102
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:22,520
100 in total.

2103
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:23,800
We all separately.

2104
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:27,800
And I remember, I was more unemployed at that moment

2105
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,560
than I have been in a while.

2106
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:33,280
And I was like, oh god, something to work on.

2107
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,320
I treated it like an assignment.

2108
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:37,160
I worked really hard on my names.

2109
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:38,840
Something to do, purpose.

2110
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:42,000
So I'm very fond of these street names for that reason.

2111
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:46,040
My contribution is to the list of 100.

2112
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:49,640
And we sent this list and we heard nothing.

2113
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,040
They didn't even go, that's funny.

2114
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,680
You sent 100 names.

2115
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:55,480
I have the email here.

2116
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:57,960
Hold on one second.

2117
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:00,920
I just don't think it's weird that they didn't go.

2118
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:02,920
They acknowledged it, but I think

2119
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:05,200
they didn't go like, oh my god.

2120
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:07,760
That's what I think I was expecting.

2121
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,560
So yeah, so here, I won't say the name

2122
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:12,040
of the person who sent it to me, but it was like, hi Mike.

2123
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:13,880
It's time for us to begin submitting names

2124
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:16,360
for the streets in Margaritaville Resort Orlando.

2125
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:18,600
I would love to have your creative help in naming

2126
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:20,240
our streets for the resort.

2127
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:24,240
Feel free to use song lyrics, sea, sun, and ocean themes,

2128
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:27,520
or anything that screams Margaritaville lifestyle.

2129
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,160
Below are some street suffixes

2130
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:30,680
to help you complete the names.

2131
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:34,040
I really appreciate your participation and input

2132
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:37,200
as we create a truly unique destination in Orlando.

2133
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:40,960
Finn's Up, and this is from, this is Tuesday,

2134
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:44,040
January 26, 2016.

2135
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:46,200
This is three years ago.

2136
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:48,240
Over three years ago.

2137
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:50,040
Predating the podcast.

2138
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:53,280
We came together cosmically with the magic of Buffett.

2139
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:58,320
And when you say suffixes, it's just words like road,

2140
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:02,080
way, lane, circle, alley.

2141
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:05,040
Boulevard, circle, cove, drive, garden,

2142
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:08,440
parentheses S, gardens, lane, loop, parkway,

2143
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:11,560
path, place, road, street, trace, trail, and way.

2144
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:12,400
Yeah.

2145
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,240
Now we posted about this and we talked about it

2146
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:18,160
in the Margaritaville sector of the City Walk Saga,

2147
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:19,760
and we tweeted all of the names.

2148
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,520
I just remembered that we did that.

2149
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,280
So you may have read the names.

2150
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,240
Perhaps we'll retweet them to remind you.

2151
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:26,080
Sure.

2152
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,720
We sent them 100 names.

2153
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:33,720
And lo and behold, a video is released very recently

2154
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:38,560
by the YouTube user, The Tim Tracker.

2155
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,960
Clearly there are some people who follow us

2156
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,360
who also follow him.

2157
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:46,160
He goes and tours construction sites and theme parks

2158
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:49,200
and makes these very exhaustive videos.

2159
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:54,240
Somebody on our Facebook group found a screenshot.

2160
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:58,240
Let me credit that person if I can find it in time.

2161
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:03,240
Amanda Hasaka noticed a freeze frame in this video

2162
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:09,920
saying with the address of the particular location,

2163
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:13,320
the timeshare condo that this guy toured.

2164
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:18,320
This condo is at 8029 Dreamsicle Drive.

2165
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:20,680
Dreamsicle Drive.

2166
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:25,000
Now I'm looking at the master list on the email.

2167
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Number three submitted is Dreamsicle Drive.

2168
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:32,360
I mean.

2169
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:37,360
Ladies and gentlemen, the quest to name a Margaritaville street.

2170
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:43,040
You know, if you throw out a hundred darts,

2171
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:44,480
one of them's gotta land.

2172
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:47,440
A thousand monkeys at a thousand typewriters.

2173
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:49,600
One of them will eventually type the words,

2174
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:50,440
Dreamsicle Drive.

2175
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:51,280
Dreamsicle Drive.

2176
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:56,280
Ladies and gentlemen, you may now live on Dreamsicle Drive

2177
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:59,440
thanks to your friends at Podcast The Ride.

2178
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:00,280
Wow, I mean it is.

2179
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:01,120
We did it.

2180
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:04,200
I was gonna say, ladies and gentlemen, we got him.

2181
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:09,200
Mission accomplished.

2182
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:15,080
Yeah, so Dreamsicle is a song of Jimmy's.

2183
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:17,080
Yes, no, tell me, cause I don't know this.

2184
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:18,560
I don't know what Dreamsicle is.

2185
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,000
I know with Saturday Night Live,

2186
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,520
you're not supposed to take credit for yourself.

2187
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:22,360
They do more now.

2188
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:24,160
You take your credit for your sketches maybe.

2189
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:27,560
But like in the old days, I think Dreamsicle Drive is mine.

2190
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:28,400
I'm pretty sure.

2191
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:29,680
That's a deeper level.

2192
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:31,840
Mine was a lot of nonsense because I don't know

2193
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:33,800
the actual songs as much.

2194
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,480
But yeah, yours, this is right at the top of the list.

2195
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:39,680
As far as they read, I think they saw this list and said,

2196
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:40,680
we gotta throw one of these,

2197
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:42,480
we gotta throw these guys a bone.

2198
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:45,440
What's like, please, let's not have to read

2199
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,600
this entire thing.

2200
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,560
Third one's fine, great, let's go with it.

2201
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:50,040
Yeah, you'd think it'd be mine

2202
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:52,240
cause it's pretty close to Creamsicle.

2203
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:54,800
Pretty close to the delicious orange flavored treat.

2204
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,200
A Dreamsicle is a Creamsicle.

2205
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:58,040
Oh yes.

2206
01:40:58,040 --> 01:40:58,880
It's a brand.

2207
01:40:58,880 --> 01:40:59,720
You're right, it's a different brand.

2208
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:01,760
It's a brand name basically.

2209
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:04,160
Dreamsicle is on the album Volcano,

2210
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:05,640
which you may know that song.

2211
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:07,840
It's like, do do do do do do.

2212
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:11,880
I don't know where I'm gonna go when the volcano blows.

2213
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:12,720
You know that one.

2214
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:13,880
I don't know.

2215
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:14,720
We know that one.

2216
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:15,920
Usually at Margaritaville restaurants,

2217
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:17,800
there's a volcano that erupts.

2218
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:18,640
I don't know.

2219
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:19,640
Green, like a margarito.

2220
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:21,840
Yeah, anyway.

2221
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:24,640
So the song Dreamsicle is on that album

2222
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:26,120
and I won't read all the lyrics,

2223
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:29,000
but I'll read the four lines

2224
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,080
where the word Dreamsicle appears.

2225
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:34,800
I shot myself in the foot by condemning myself

2226
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,120
to have to hear lyrics.

2227
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:37,640
You have to, although you know what,

2228
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:39,640
I'm gonna go back now, four lines.

2229
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:41,840
No, you're punishing me.

2230
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:45,640
Okay, I got house pets, leer jets,

2231
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:48,320
trying to learn about bassinets.

2232
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,760
Oh, Miss Piggy, dance with me.

2233
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:53,280
Let me take you to the sea.

2234
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,640
And then that's the first floor.

2235
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:56,480
And then he goes,

2236
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:58,680
I'm no longer proud of this accomplishment.

2237
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:03,200
Then he goes, Dreamsicle, Big Dill Pickle,

2238
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,960
high school honeys sure were fickle.

2239
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:08,400
I'll be damned, country ham,

2240
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:11,320
take me back to Alabama.

2241
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:12,480
So that's the-

2242
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,320
It's okay.

2243
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:14,560
Is Lindsay laughing upstairs

2244
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,160
because she's hearing this?

2245
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:17,640
She knows Dreamsicle.

2246
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:20,560
Because Edwin is also running up and down the hallway.

2247
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:22,640
Oh, okay.

2248
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:26,080
She clarified she is not laughing at the song lyrics.

2249
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:29,360
The dog is running up and down the stairs.

2250
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:32,480
I for sure tortured her with Dreamsicle before.

2251
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:34,680
Most days in this apartment,

2252
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:37,760
Mike is reading the lyrics of Dreamsicle out loud.

2253
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:40,880
Those lyrics are all over the place,

2254
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,320
even for Jimmy Buffett.

2255
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:46,200
Like Big Dill Pickle, I feel like is a reuse

2256
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:50,240
from the Cheeseburger in Paradise universe

2257
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:53,320
from like hamburger fixings details.

2258
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:56,280
I don't want to pickle anywhere near a Dreamsicle.

2259
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:57,920
Do you want to hear the rest of the lyrics?

2260
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,760
Was he talking about bassinettes?

2261
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,360
We'll make that a Patreon, that's the second game.

2262
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:02,520
Did he just have a kid?

2263
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,160
Is that why he was talking about bassinettes?

2264
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:06,840
I don't actually know the history of Dreamsicle.

2265
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,080
I should look into it.

2266
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:09,560
All right, back to the lyrics.

2267
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,640
And they're not as good as those eight lines,

2268
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,160
but I mean, he goes, let me tell you now,

2269
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:19,160
he sips, he quips, dreams a lot about sailing ships,

2270
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:24,480
wants to throw it all away, wants to have it back someday,

2271
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:29,480
loves fool, seers tool, wants to win that football pool,

2272
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:33,360
span it on some real good grass,

2273
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,960
disappear in oh so fast.

2274
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:38,440
That's not as good as the other,

2275
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:41,760
now sailing a ship is just him going back to the well,

2276
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:44,120
or in the case of Jimmy, the bay.

2277
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:44,960
Sure.

2278
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:46,000
Going back to the bay.

2279
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,520
Yeah, I think that's, yeah, he, he, look,

2280
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:50,280
he writes a lot about boats, he writes a lot about,

2281
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:52,440
he writes about food more than Weird Al.

2282
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:54,960
That's a thing.

2283
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:57,560
Weird Al doesn't make as many albums,

2284
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:59,440
because Weird Al has quality control.

2285
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,760
You take that back.

2286
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:04,840
So yeah, so Dreamsicle Drive is real.

2287
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:07,080
We don't, I was looking and trying to figure out

2288
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:09,480
if this is on Google Maps yet, it is not.

2289
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:13,000
No, none of the streets are, and it's only via this video,

2290
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,280
so thank you Amanda for bringing this to our attention.

2291
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:19,440
We wouldn't have known to take this victory lap,

2292
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,480
if not for this screenshot, and also thank you

2293
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:24,960
to the Tim Trekker for exploring an empty condo.

2294
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:27,080
Which by the way, did you guys watch the video?

2295
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:31,320
I did, I like Tim, Tim is not backpack man,

2296
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:33,040
I will say this, Tim seems like a nice man.

2297
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:35,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, he seems good and thorough

2298
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:39,520
and informative, this place looks like garbage.

2299
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,560
The garbage patch.

2300
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:45,440
I will say that Tim seemed very excited about it,

2301
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:48,120
and I was like, this all looks like this is gonna fall apart

2302
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:49,680
in six months, this doesn't look.

2303
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:53,800
It looks like the town where the Cat in the Hat movie is set,

2304
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:55,600
where the live action Cat in the Hat.

2305
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,360
Well I didn't, I actually, Margaritaville Enterprises

2306
01:44:58,360 --> 01:44:59,560
didn't have much to do with it,

2307
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:02,560
we teamed up with a Mercurial Casino owner,

2308
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:05,320
and we're just kind of licensing partners.

2309
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:08,240
These guys named Fuck Jerry built the houses.

2310
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:12,560
You'll learn about it all soon in two documentaries.

2311
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:15,320
We got three cardboard boxes stacked them on top

2312
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:18,280
of each other, you can live there for 300 grand.

2313
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:20,000
Luxury VIP villas.

2314
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,120
I was ready to suck dick for Margarita.

2315
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:22,960
Wait, what?

2316
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,480
Maybe they didn't have one Firefest documentary

2317
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:27,320
with the guys.

2318
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,600
That is a very topical joke.

2319
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:32,560
Hey, I haven't watched any of these documentaries,

2320
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:33,400
I'm sorry.

2321
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:36,320
You haven't caught the Dicksuck Man?

2322
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,840
I haven't caught the Dicksuck Man.

2323
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,880
Unfollow hashtag fuck fuck Jerry,

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Sorry, sorry.

2327
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:45,600
That was a good joke, I can tell now.

2328
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:46,440
Yeah.

2329
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:49,840
Unfollow Fuck Jerry, follow the Tim Tracker

2331
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:54,600
Yeah.

2332
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:57,240
My favorite thing about this video,

2333
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:59,640
and we'll post this, is that Tim is so excited

2334
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:03,760
about a strip mall that's being built nearby.

2335
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:06,200
Well, to be fair, we talked about the strip mall

2336
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:07,360
for about half an hour.

2337
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:08,960
That's why Tim is one of us, is what I'm saying,

2338
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:09,800
and he's very excited, he's like,

2339
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:12,200
oh my God, there's gonna be so many stores here.

2340
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:13,040
There's gonna be a restaurant.

2341
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:14,080
Wow, a Lidz.

2342
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:14,920
Wow.

2343
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:16,520
You also keep multiple times,

2344
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,120
the last few months have been like,

2345
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:21,680
this place where I live, this town, Santa Clarita,

2346
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:23,040
is really coming up.

2347
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,760
Like the next five, 10 years,

2348
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:27,040
it's really shaping up nicely here in Santa Clarita.

2349
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:28,320
I'm not saying I'm not embarrassing, too,

2350
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:29,600
I'm just saying I think it's so funny

2351
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,400
because he's walking around empty buildings

2352
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:33,640
and he's like, wow, there's gonna be restaurants.

2353
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:34,480
Oh, sure.

2354
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:37,560
He points out that, imagine that you could live

2355
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:40,920
next to a spa, like a day spa.

2356
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:42,920
That's your house, and then that's a day spa

2357
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:43,840
right next to it.

2358
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,680
I have the names.

2359
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:46,720
And it's all on Creamsicle Drive.

2360
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:47,760
Creamsicle, what's it?

2361
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:48,600
There's a Creamsicle Drive.

2362
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:49,440
There's a Creamsicle Drive.

2363
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,280
I have some of them.

2364
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:51,120
I don't even know.

2365
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:52,640
Like Peter Parker, easy to remember.

2366
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,720
So they didn't forget.

2367
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:57,480
There's Parrot Perch, there's Surf's Up Fitness,

2368
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:02,240
which looks like a pretty standard hotel gym.

2369
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:03,080
Yeah, yes.

2370
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:04,160
Which is on the site.

2371
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:05,600
There's the Saint Somewhere Spa.

2372
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,440
He's like, wow, can you believe it?

2373
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:07,840
Like you go to a spa right here.

2374
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:09,360
It's the Saint Somewhere Spa.

2375
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:12,560
There's the Parakeet's Kids Club, not done yet.

2376
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:14,440
It's just an empty room at this point.

2377
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:16,840
Why don't they keep, why does this guy

2378
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:18,400
run around filming videos?

2379
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,240
I don't know.

2380
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:20,720
Nobody should be allowed in here.

2381
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:23,600
Did you catch, though, what will make this

2382
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:26,480
a lot more attractive for Scott Garner to move in?

2383
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:28,360
No, I don't know what you're,

2384
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:30,040
I didn't watch all 18 minutes.

2385
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:32,320
There is a winery across the street.

2386
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,360
Well, well, well.

2387
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:36,040
What would Jimmy Buffett name a winery?

2388
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:36,880
Is there a-

2389
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:37,720
It's not his, though.

2390
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:38,540
It's just a cupcake.

2391
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:39,380
It's the cupcake one.

2392
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:43,360
Obviously, but obviously, no, it would be called,

2393
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:45,960
it would be named after his song, The Why No I Know.

2394
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:47,840
That's a real song.

2395
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:48,680
I didn't make that up.

2396
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:50,920
Which is how you describe me in conversation.

2397
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:53,520
Yes, that is what I say.

2398
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,240
The Why No I Know.

2399
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:56,200
Who's Scott Garner?

2400
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:57,040
I don't know him.

2401
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:59,600
He's the Why No I Know.

2402
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,600
Now, Lindsay's laughing at Jimmy Buffett content

2403
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:03,440
from upstairs.

2404
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:07,080
There is a Margaritaville wine subscription club, right?

2405
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:07,920
Am I imagining-

2406
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:08,740
Oh, is that right?

2407
01:48:08,740 --> 01:48:11,440
I think that's, is that true?

2408
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:14,000
The brightest, bluest wine in town.

2409
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,000
I don't know.

2410
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:17,800
It tastes like salt.

2411
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:21,360
It's a lost, hints of lost shaker.

2412
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:22,640
Tastes of lost shaker.

2413
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:24,120
Hints of pickle.

2414
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:26,920
A lot of tannins and also pickle.

2415
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:29,260
Do I detect Heinz 57?

2416
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:33,040
On the back of the tug.

2417
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:36,360
There's a little aftertaste.

2418
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:38,960
Did you look into what was there before?

2419
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:40,040
This like China?

2420
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:44,520
Splendid China, which was like owned by China.

2421
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:45,360
It was criticized-

2422
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:48,040
It was a Chinese owned area in Orlando?

2423
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:49,520
We have to do a lot more research into this,

2424
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:51,240
but Splendid China was criticized for being owned

2425
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:53,880
by the government of the People's Republic of China

2426
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:55,760
and that officers of the corporation that owned,

2427
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:58,160
controlled and operated Florida Splendid China

2428
01:48:58,160 --> 01:48:59,560
were appointed by the State Council

2429
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:01,240
of the People's Republic of China.

2430
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:03,400
The critics cited the following specific allegations

2431
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:06,040
about the inclusion of minority exhibits.

2432
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:07,160
They were protesting.

2433
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:10,960
It's a lot to read, but it was Tibet stuff.

2434
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:11,800
Oh my God.

2435
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:12,640
Oh.

2436
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:14,040
Yeah, it was, yeah.

2437
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:17,100
So the People's Republic of China made a land deal

2438
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:19,360
with Margaritaville holding CLC.

2439
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:20,200
Right.

2440
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:22,440
But like look at this.

2441
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:23,920
It's a beautiful Chinese garden.

2442
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:25,560
That is really insane.

2443
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:29,720
And now it is a bunch of tin boxes.

2444
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:30,680
Yeah.

2445
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:33,440
Like they all look like 50s track homes,

2446
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:35,880
but like three stacked on top of each other.

2447
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:37,800
Yeah, you gotta have multiple stories.

2448
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:40,680
This is like a demented Tim Burton town.

2449
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:42,760
Margaritaville.

2450
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:45,360
We have to do, I have an email address too

2451
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:50,000
for if you wanted to audition to be a performer,

2452
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,240
like their whatever, like their performance space.

2453
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:55,040
And it was-

2454
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:57,000
So acoustic guitar, steel drums,

2455
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,560
a second set of steel drums.

2456
01:49:58,560 --> 01:49:59,920
Right.

2457
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:00,760
Where'd it go?

2458
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:01,580
I'll find it's for something.

2459
01:50:01,580 --> 01:50:02,920
Just a toucan sitting around.

2460
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,880
So if you're a toucan, apply today.

2461
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:06,600
You know, like that China story,

2462
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,880
we got some flack recently

2463
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:09,440
because we were revealed we are owned

2464
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:12,680
by the Shen Yun people who put them on this billboard.

2465
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:15,880
We're on the Shen Yun.

2466
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:18,480
We're switching to the Shen Yun podcast network.

2467
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,840
There's gonna be a lot more acrobatics on the show.

2468
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:27,680
I know it's tough to do acrobatics audio-wise.

2469
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:30,120
But it is thousands of years of history.

2470
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:32,760
It's a proud tradition.

2471
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:35,720
You'll hear the fabric flopping around.

2472
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:37,400
It'll work as a podcast.

2473
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:40,640
I do think before this place gets blown away by a hurricane,

2474
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:45,000
we should try to do a live show in the town square maybe

2475
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:45,840
with no amplification.

2476
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:49,280
By the weakest hurricane Florida's seen in 20 years.

2477
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:51,680
Just a strong wind might take these houses away

2478
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:53,640
from the look of this video.

2479
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:56,160
Yes, it turns out you cannot,

2480
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:59,720
the parade floats cannot fit down the street

2481
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:03,400
when people are on it and there are no emergency exits.

2482
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,720
So again, that's what happens when you partner

2483
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:08,240
with a mercurial casino owner.

2484
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:10,000
I feel like Jimmy Buffett,

2485
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,760
much like Lyle Landley on the Simpsons.

2486
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:14,480
I got a suitcase full of money.

2487
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,320
I'm outta here.

2488
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:17,760
See you later Orlando.

2489
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:20,840
Like, and this thing will just like fall apart

2490
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:21,680
as fast as the Monterey.

2491
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:23,720
I got a hiding hole in China.

2492
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:29,320
Thanks to my thanks new Chinese friends.

2493
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:32,480
I've bought all those little castles

2494
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:35,160
in the mountains in Turkey that are uninhabited.

2495
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:38,440
All of these buildings are all gonna get picked up

2496
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:41,960
by the wind and carried over to the vacant pool

2497
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:45,000
in the Queen of Versailles mansion.

2498
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:50,200
That's gonna be a big stack of pink and teal,

2499
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:51,280
cheap roofing.

2500
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:53,960
Now I hear they have great views

2501
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:57,480
of the Disney World fireworks at the Queen of Versailles

2502
01:51:57,480 --> 01:52:00,800
mansion so I guess we have to do a second episode

2503
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:03,640
about the Queen of Versailles mansion.

2504
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:06,960
And there's a Queen of Versailles themed casino wing.

2505
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:10,840
That's what the part of the Star Trek experience became

2506
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:13,440
because the Queen of Versailles company Westgate bought,

2507
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:15,240
so it's very theme park tied in.

2508
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:16,400
It absolutely is.

2509
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:17,960
We do have to say though,

2510
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:22,560
Westgate vacation time shares are a great value

2511
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:26,680
because you're only on vacation a few weeks of the year

2512
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:28,840
so why would you pay for the whole year?

2513
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:30,760
People don't get to see their families.

2514
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:32,120
Families being torn apart,

2515
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:34,840
vacation's more important now in the recession than ever.

2516
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:39,400
Yeah, we are partially owed Westgate vacations.

2517
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:42,280
Yeah, we took the Westgate money and the Shen Yun money

2518
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:43,760
and we're doing great.

2519
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:46,240
We're joining Buffett in that hiding hole

2520
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:48,680
and of course all the royalties that we're going to get

2521
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:51,360
from having named Dreamsicle Drive.

2522
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:52,200
Yeah, exactly.

2523
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:54,520
We're in the money, gentlemen, for sure.

2524
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:59,200
I have preemptively burned off my fingerprints

2525
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:00,800
just to be safe.

2526
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:04,240
Here's my final question.

2527
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:08,560
Do we have a lawsuit on our hands?

2528
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:12,160
Can we sue now for not being compensated

2529
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:13,000
for naming this street?

2530
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,680
No, we gave that on our own volition, I believe.

2531
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:17,680
But maybe we didn't kind of know the scope

2532
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:18,600
of what we were doing.

2533
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:20,680
Maybe we just thought it was a fun thing

2534
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:22,120
and now it is a real thing

2535
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:24,720
and people are living on this street.

2536
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:27,640
They actually are using our idea.

2537
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:28,880
I think we may have a case.

2538
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:31,040
Yeah, living in your ideas,

2539
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:35,200
but our idea is what if you named this song

2540
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:38,760
that is a trademark of a popsicle company.

2541
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:41,880
That's true, but we have documented proof

2542
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:43,240
that it was our idea.

2543
01:53:43,240 --> 01:53:45,760
We do, unfortunately, all of the cash reserves

2544
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:48,080
for this company is Confederate money.

2545
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:51,640
Sorry, it's half Confederate money

2546
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:53,240
and half Iraqi dinar.

2547
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:56,960
I use a shell company to build all this stuff.

2548
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:59,200
Mr. Trump, I've been reading on Twitter,

2549
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:01,560
Mr. Trump's gonna adjust the Iraqi dinar

2550
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:03,520
and it's gonna be worth a lot of money.

2551
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:06,160
Suddenly I'm pro-Trump.

2552
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:07,000
Yeah.

2553
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:07,840
Sorry.

2554
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:10,000
Mr. Trump, fix the dinar.

2555
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,160
It is possible that the people in this place

2556
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:15,680
wake up one morning and they're just on land

2557
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:16,760
and all the houses are gone

2558
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:18,560
because they were picked up in the middle of the night

2559
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:21,080
and they just move them to another country

2560
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:23,080
and we're gonna pull the same grift

2561
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:24,640
on another set of people.

2562
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:26,920
He was like, what the hell?

2563
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:30,600
It's a good way to dispose of dumb people from this.

2564
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:32,440
Because the house is so thin,

2565
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:33,320
the walls are so thick.

2566
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:36,480
Like the sting, like a full fake business.

2567
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:37,920
Yeah, it's a fake resort

2568
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:41,000
and then he has like 30 helicopters come in

2569
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,760
and pull the houses up and the people,

2570
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:45,080
just they put them out

2571
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:46,440
and they're just sleeping on the grass.

2572
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:50,160
I'm taking these to Margaritaville, Abu Dhabi.

2573
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:53,000
You guys didn't get the hint when we played the theme

2574
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,200
from the sting on all our playlists, like a lot.

2575
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:57,680
We tried to give you a warning.

2576
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:00,240
One of my favorite things is that in all the houses

2577
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:02,400
they have the concoction machine

2578
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:06,040
and he's like a $30 margarita maker.

2579
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:08,120
30, no, that's like $300.

2580
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:08,960
Oh, is it that much?

2581
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:09,800
Yeah.

2582
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:10,960
Well, I apologize.

2583
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:12,920
It cost 30 to make.

2584
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:13,840
Oh yeah.

2585
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:18,840
But if they, okay, if they gave us each a blender

2586
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:22,280
and like filled it with dreamsicles,

2587
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:23,480
would that shut you up?

2588
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:24,320
Yes.

2589
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:25,160
Now we don't, now we are in owed money.

2590
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:26,000
That is what I want.

2591
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,200
I think that they owe us something, I guess.

2592
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:31,520
Maybe a lawsuit's not the situation,

2593
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:35,160
but I think that they certainly owe us

2594
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:37,520
at least one concoction maker to split

2595
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:39,520
between the three of us, the four of us.

2596
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:41,200
Sure, yeah.

2597
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:44,120
And also we don't know if there are more streets.

2598
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:46,280
Here's what I know.

2599
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:48,120
I know there are more streets we've seen.

2600
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:52,920
I've looked at the Airbnb listings

2601
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:54,040
or one of the real estate.

2602
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:56,880
I was like, let me see every street name.

2603
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:59,200
You got your flip-flop way, sandbar drive,

2604
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:01,240
shaker street, key lime loop.

2605
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:03,480
None of these were on our list.

2606
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:07,600
Now we did submit to them Seaplane Avenue,

2607
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:09,680
one word, seaplane.

2608
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:13,120
They have seaplane spaced out lane.

2609
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:15,360
So does that count as one of ours?

2610
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:16,840
Fuck yeah it does.

2611
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:18,000
Pay up Margarita.

2612
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,920
That is a better punch up, seaplane lane.

2613
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:24,080
But the core of the idea was us.

2614
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,880
I mean the real base of the con,

2615
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:29,800
anybody can punch up a good idea

2616
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:31,120
and put a little ribbon on it.

2617
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:32,840
But we gave them the raw meat.

2618
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:35,280
We need to look at like WGA bylaws

2619
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:36,840
and use some of the legalese in there.

2620
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:38,720
Yeah and we need to get Jack Allison

2621
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:40,320
and Seth Simons involved.

2622
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:44,640
We need to, we'll get a big Twitter rouse going on.

2623
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:46,600
And this'll end up going our way.

2624
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:49,440
All I'm saying is that maybe there are little like

2625
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:52,400
sort of courts or cul-de-sacs or like utility entrance

2626
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:54,680
for the hotels or something that's named after

2627
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:59,680
one of our streets like Ribbs Lane or Dill Drive.

2628
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:03,720
Or Lobster Lane.

2629
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:08,680
Yes, so look like trucks need to get back and forth

2630
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:11,640
and make deliveries and why can that not happen

2631
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:13,680
on Pelicans Beak Bay?

2632
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:16,240
Or my favorite, Shorts Street.

2633
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:17,400
I believe that is yours Scott.

2634
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:18,360
Hey all right.

2635
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:19,200
Shorts Street.

2636
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:21,400
Shorts Street can be a gutter.

2637
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:22,680
That's fine.

2638
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:24,680
As long as it's getting anybody,

2639
01:57:24,680 --> 01:57:26,400
anything from one place to another.

2640
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:30,480
Be that dirty water or several rats or termites

2641
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:34,520
as high as if it's being used to get from place to place,

2642
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:36,280
it's a street, name it.

2643
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:38,840
Shorts Street is deceptively simple

2644
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:43,840
and that is such a hard thing to do in common.

2645
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:46,080
Like everything where it's like, oh that was so funny.

2646
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:47,360
It was so simple.

2647
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:50,040
Has had so much work to it and I feel like

2648
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:52,680
it's a gold standard like Shorts Street.

2649
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:56,120
Well yeah, you know when I thought of Shorts Street,

2650
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:01,960
I felt like in a pretty top creative time in my life,

2651
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:05,960
I felt like all the gears were turning

2652
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:09,760
and I was just open to,

2653
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:12,280
but you always just gotta be open to divine intervention

2654
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:14,640
because I don't have the ideas really it's from the Lord

2655
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:15,920
and the Lord gifted me,

2656
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:18,280
but I was open to receiving Shorts Street.

2657
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:19,480
Mm-hmm.

2658
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:20,320
I hear you.

2659
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:21,560
That's gotta be the type of wisdom

2660
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:25,920
on your vanity pseudo-religious website, GRIFT.

2661
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:27,720
You start soon.

2662
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:29,160
When I get to my.

2663
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:31,440
Yeah, when you get to your level.

Learn the secrets of succinct funny street names

2665
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:38,840

Scott Gardner School of Street Naming.

2667
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:44,400
We're not gonna tell you what kind of God,

2668
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:47,640
but like there's a spirituality aspect.

2669
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:48,640
Whatever it is for you,

2670
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:52,240
any spirit in this universe can bequeath to you

2671
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:53,280
a funny street name.

2672
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:55,240

This place don't run for free.

2675
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:01,160
Yeah.

2676
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:03,920
So we're feeling great.

2677
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:04,760
Yeah.

2678
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:07,640
And I think it'd be the ultimate trip if,

2679
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:10,320
I mean we're gonna plug the regular stuff.

2680
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:14,880
Check us out at patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2681
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:18,000
Go to Twitter, Instagram and Facebook,

2682
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,600
Facebook where you can get great info

2683
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:21,960
like screenshots of Dreamsicle Drive.

2684
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:22,800
Yeah.

2685
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:24,040
But really the best thing you could do for us

2686
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:28,600
would be to buy a condo on Dreamsicle Drive.

2687
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:29,440
Yes.

2688
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:31,120
The best way to honor this podcast.

2689
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:34,160
I was gonna also say we did this on our Hanna Barbera episode

2690
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:36,600
and I think this is a perfect time to do it again.

2691
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:39,240
If you wouldn't mind rating and reviewing us on iTunes,

2692
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:41,000
but when you're commenting,

2693
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,600
you don't have to say like how great of a podcast.

2694
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:45,320
Just name a fictional,

2695
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:47,480
like name a Margaritaville Street for us.

2696
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:49,480
What would you have named a Margaritaville Street?

2697
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:52,160
So flood our Apple Podcasts.

2698
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:53,960
So it's Hanna Barbera characters.

2699
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:55,720
Well they're Thai.

2700
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:56,560
Like what neck wear they would have.

2701
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:57,600
Oh sorry, yeah what neck wear they would have.

2702
01:59:57,600 --> 01:59:58,720
And then now when you're-

2703
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:03,200
Well for example, this podcast gave me so much joy

2704
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:06,880
and relaxed me so I felt like I was driving down

2705
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:08,120
gumbo gardens.

2706
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:09,080
Yes, exactly.

2707
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:13,800
Or like yeah, I was hanging out on Skippin' Work Circle.

2708
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:16,200
You know, that's the type of thing.

2709
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:17,440
So yeah, you would come up,

2710
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:19,200
obviously read through our 100

2711
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,920
and make sure you don't have any duplicates.

2712
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:24,800
A flash flood washed away cars on gumbo gardens

2713
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:27,160
after a faulty drainage,

2714
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:30,160
poorly constructed, cheaply constructed drainage ditch

2715
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:31,800
failed to work properly.

2716
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:34,680
A tall man leaned on a building and knocked it over.

2717
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:38,720
The Orlando Margarita Resort.

2718
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:45,440
Exposing a woman taking a shower and she went,

2719
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:47,360
oh a man.

2720
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:48,480
A man.

2721
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:53,080
