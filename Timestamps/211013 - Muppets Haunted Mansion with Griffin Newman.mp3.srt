1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
["The Muppets Are Dead"]

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,720
Extra, extra, the Muppets are dead.

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,280
Welcome to Haunt Cast the Fright, The Cemetery Gate.

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,160
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Scare-It-In.

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,560
I added it in there.

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,520
Kermit has been compromised to a permanent end.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,680
Uh, Scott, uh, Scare-Gerdner is here.

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,360
I forgot about that.

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,880
No, we did. I was even like not wanting to bring it up.

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,320
I'm like, do we have to remember the names again?

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,200
Yeah, Scott Scare-Gerdner.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,080
Yeah, yeah, that might have been what it was before.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,080
But yeah, that's my, the main point is they're gone.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,200
We're rid of them finally.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,160
Right, they have died.

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,120
They have to celebrate it.

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,200
This is special about their ghosts.

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,960
Just like Bugs Bunny.

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,120
Well, Bugs Bunny didn't stay permanently dead.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,640
No, he didn't.

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,840
From a great film.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,480
It was like one scene and he was alive again.

23
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,000
Less, less, less, less.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,440
Okay, fair enough.

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,960
Was it akin to the Chewbacca amount in episode nine?

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,200
Who was dead longer, Chewbacca or Kermit?

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,480
Okay, or Kermit.

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,040
Wait a minute.

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,540
Yeah.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,800
Bugs Bunny.

31
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,480
Bugs is essentially revived in the crossfade between the scene where he dies and the scene

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,440
where he comes back.

33
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,480
Right, right, right, right.

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,640
They're directly next to each other with nothing in between.

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,240
Chewbacca at least has five minutes.

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,440
Kermit stays dead for a long chunk of this in theory.

37
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,640
Yeah, in theory.

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,840
I mean, people just drew them.

39
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,160
It was weird that it was a firing squad, but people had had it.

40
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,800
They're just like, the voices have just gotten too weird.

41
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,720
It's just not right.

42
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,640
Many thoughts already.

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,520
This is the voice of, of course, Griffin Evil Stew Man.

44
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,040
I mean, I was going to say, I think Boo Man is...

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,600
No, Evil Stew is the way to go, I think.

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,360
It's an evil stew.

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,480
It's a dish, a delicacy that is evil.

48
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,840
Eye of Newton.

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Yeah, all of that's...

50
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,600
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

51
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,640
I was struggling on Griffin, but Boo Man felt like an alley-oop.

52
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,440
But if we want Evil Stew, then sure, it's Griffin Evil Stew Man.

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,160
I think it's Evil Stew.

54
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,560
And accidental haunt cast the Fright legend.

55
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,060
What?

56
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,800
Evil Stew Man.

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,480
Did that just happen by accident?

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,240
Really? Well, it has to.

59
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,360
We had no choice, I think.

60
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,480
The credits transfer.

61
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,840
I'm grandfathered.

62
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,720
A new credit.

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,680
And also, I want to say with this, because you've fulfilled everything that you promised in 2021.

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,200
Many appearances, and it's been great.

65
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,440
And in doing so, in this episode, you were, I believe, unless I have my facts wrong,

66
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,640
you were tying the all-time guest record.

67
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,320
You are now exactly in league with Eva Anderson.

68
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,200
Oh, man.

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,320
Your bitter feud canon will continue.

70
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,280
No, no, not at all.

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,320
But you've got the throne.

72
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,440
You're sharing the throne right now.

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,640
Has she done...

74
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,800
She's done more Second Gate because of sensitive material, is that right?

75
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,680
Some of it sensitive material, some of it bizarre, not related to the premise of the podcast.

76
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,180
Yeah.

77
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,780
Precents.

78
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:28,740
This is an example of the way you guys in this show and then Eva, by extension, have broken my brain.

79
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,660
Because there are a lot of things that we share in common.

80
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,540
It's why we've become friends and whatever.

81
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,180
But there are things that you guys have activated me onto that I previously did not give a shit about

82
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,900
or certainly did not feel that obsessive about.

83
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,820
I admitted to you guys in a moment of real vulnerability recently that I watched characters

84
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:50,900
Oh, yes.

85
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:57,060
With no audience, and some of you do, but do people remember what characters is?

86
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,420
And if not, I'll give you the opportunity to remind the audience.

87
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,060
It's the movie directed by the man who created Hard Rock Park

88
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:11,220
about kids, teenagers who work as mascot characters at a shitty theme park for a summer.

89
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,260
Yeah.

90
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,300
And there is crossover with Hard Rock Park because some of the characters,

91
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,540
like Winston the punk rock dog...

92
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,060
He gets a fair amount of screen time.

93
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,380
Yeah.

94
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,580
Hard Rock Park characters are now, were later included in this film, quote unquote.

95
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,820
But I watched the movie only because you guys put me onto it and you guys hadn't even watched.

96
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,460
It's terrible.

97
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,820
I want to stake my claim right now.

98
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:39,860
If you ever do an episode on it, I demand to be the guest because I've already wasted the time.

99
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,580
There's sort of like a sunk cost fallacy at this point that I might as well watch it a second time.

100
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,140
But the other thing I was going to say was I was at a hotel when I was in LA and they have like

101
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,860
the books just sort of like sitting around the lobby, I guess, partly for people to read,

102
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,860
probably more for decor or whatever.

103
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,420
And I was just sort of like idly looking at all the spines.

104
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,020
And then I freaked out because I saw they had a hardcover Dick Tracy volume.

105
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,300
And I was like, is this the fucking moon made edition?

106
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,340
Like I lost my mind.

107
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,420
And I was doing the math in my head of like, if this is that edition that she's talking about,

108
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,700
do I steal it?

109
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,700
Do I see if I can barter with them to buy it from the hotel because they don't know

110
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,980
it's apparently worth two thousand dollars or whatever price they know they might not.

111
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,860
They would if I was just like, hey, can I give you like forty bucks for this book?

112
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:31,940
I would lie.

113
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,940
I'd say like my kid really likes moon made.

114
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,340
Can I?

115
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,260
Did you do was it the moon one for sure?

116
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:38,740
It wasn't.

117
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,220
It wasn't.

118
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,620
It wasn't.

119
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,900
But I had like the amount of like full body adrenaline that kicked in when I went,

120
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,060
is this the moon made edition?

121
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,380
Yeah.

122
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,820
Is I thank you and Eva for breaking my brain in that way.

123
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,340
I brain breaker to that.

124
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,460
She's got good to hear.

125
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,980
We're all we're all breaking brains.

126
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,940
She's a brain breaker.

127
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,660
You were you were saying, you know, Muppet Muppet fans are very intense.

128
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,300
Passionate.

129
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,740
Passionate.

130
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,980
And I count myself among them.

131
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,940
The first time I was on main feed was the Muppet Vision 3D,

132
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,860
my favorite, one of the best American films ever made.

133
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,020
And I remember that like an hour after that episode dropped,

134
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,780
there was maybe three hours because the episode was too fucking long.

135
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:34,020
But someone had written up like a four page document of all the factual errors I had made.

136
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,700
And number by number.

137
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,780
Yeah, like upwards of 40.

138
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,980
Not really rivaled until the I the great I love Lucy correction.

139
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,220
Right.

140
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,500
On the gripes episode later.

141
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,540
It was very similar to that.

142
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,060
And like that guy came to some live show I was doing after that and was like,

143
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,420
hey, I'm the guy.

144
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:54,900
I'm sorry.

145
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,660
I hope that didn't like freak you out.

146
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,460
It's just like I have all this stuff in my head.

147
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,060
You know, I mean, I was impressed in both cases.

148
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,980
I was very impressed that they had it.

149
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,340
Yeah, and I don't like I don't mind being corrected,

150
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,580
especially when you're sort of like, you know,

151
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,140
speaking off the top of your head and just flowing whatever.

152
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,980
I preface all this by saying I think this special

153
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,820
might become something of a surprise lightning rod within the Muppet community.

154
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,540
Interesting.

155
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,980
Why do you have a quick, quick, short version of why?

156
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,620
I think that, uh, let's say, you know,

157
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:40,020
the the Seagull, uh, Boban, um, movies were divisive in their own way.

158
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,260
Right.

159
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,580
And then I think all the stuff that's been done since those until now,

160
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:53,860
Muppets now, uh, YouTube videos, you know, any sort of use of the character since then

161
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,380
has been, uh, the ABC series.

162
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:57,940
Certainly.

163
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,060
Mm hmm.

164
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,940
It's been like, this didn't work.

165
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,660
The general public did not like this.

166
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,780
It did not connect.

167
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,060
It did not bring them back.

168
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,020
And you have people who are like, just Muppet fans who I think now have just become died in

169
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,300
the wool purists like, uh, uh, Connor Ratliff, my dear friend who I do the George Lucas talk show

170
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,940
with, he's a guy where he's like, I don't really like anything after Jim died.

171
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,700
Oh, yeah.

172
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,460
You know, it really, for me is like, that's a pretty firm line.

173
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:34,180
And I feel like now part of it's generationally, uh, you know, we're all younger than,

174
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:40,100
than he is by some years, um, uh, not to make him sound old, uh, but I feel like our,

175
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,060
60 years old.

176
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,420
Our generation is like pretty accepting of, I would say at least like Christmas Carol.

177
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,460
Yeah.

178
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,620
I think that's, that to me is like, uh, what's the equivalent with wall, like haunted mansion,

179
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,420
like it's still the magic still there, even though it's a few years later.

180
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:54,820
Yeah.

181
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:54,980
Right.

182
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,060
Right.

183
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,060
That's like high watermark for me.

184
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,460
Watch it every year, uh, Christmas seat with that.

185
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,180
Totally.

186
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,500
And I think like treasure islands being reclaimed a little bit now, you know?

187
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,940
Um, but, but for him, it's like, there's a real firm line there.

188
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:13,460
And I think you have people who the last 10, 15 years of Disney weirdness of not

189
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,140
figuring out what to do with these characters have gotten pushed more to that direction of

190
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,020
like, you know what?

191
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,580
In my mind's eye, these characters are kind of dead to me.

192
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,020
The new stuff is whatever it is, you know, it's Disney star wars.

193
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,660
There's that sort of attitude of just like, I have my stuff I care about and this stuff I ignore.

194
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,340
And then I think you have the people who are so protective of these characters that they

195
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:37,380
really want to find something to like about anything new, you know?

196
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:37,620
Sure.

197
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,940
They're going to, yeah, they will try every time because it is still the company and there's

198
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,740
still some people in comm or like, like still some of the quote unquote old timers are there.

199
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,580
So like, why not give it a shot?

200
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:48,820
Right.

201
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,500
And, and it's like, there's not a muppet mythology, right?

202
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,420
There's not a canon in terms of a dense narrative that's being betrayed where people

203
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,940
have in their mind's eye the same way.

204
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,980
Like I wanted to see Luke Skywalker do this, you know?

205
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,060
So I think there's enough flexibility with these characters that people go like,

206
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,300
look, I prefer this, but I think the ABC series gave me some of that.

207
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,100
And I liked that.

208
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,980
This is good for this good showcase for that character.

209
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,420
The jokes are better in this one.

210
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,580
The songs are better in this one, whatever it is.

211
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,620
And they're sort of like, really try to find the best quality of any property, right?

212
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,780
But I think it's more and more become divided in that way where it's the people who are like,

213
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,980
I like the muppets and I'm going to view everything on a scale of muppets,

214
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,420
which is varying levels of enjoyment to me versus the people who are like,

215
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,340
I'm fundamentally kind of out.

216
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:39,460
I have been surprised to hear a lot of people who I know who are fundamentally kind of out

217
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,940
watch this within three days of it coming out and went like,

218
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,420
this is kind of the closest anyone's gotten in a while.

219
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,500
I think I might include myself in that.

220
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,740
I think this is the most I've liked a muppet thing in a minute.

221
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,820
It's certainly since the two movies, I like the movies, I defend them.

222
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,740
But I feel like a lot of people I know who don't like the two recent Disney movies,

223
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,540
recent as in 10 years ago now, do like this.

224
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:13,620
And I wonder how the muppet purists or let's say this, the people who are sort of generally

225
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:20,660
accepting of muppet material feel about this one being disproportionately more well-liked

226
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,740
and I feel seems to already be more successful.

227
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,900
It seems to be more widely watched than Muppets Now, which came out last year and

228
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,380
feels like it made no impact whatsoever.

229
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,580
If you tell people in the middle of the pandemic, there was a 10 episode muppet sketch star

230
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:44,660
with a sketch show with famous guest stars on it, I think most people would not believe you,

231
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,700
especially considering the fact that Disney Plus does not have that much original content.

232
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,860
Sure, sure. Yeah. Did anybody do? I didn't really do it.

233
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,220
We watched one, I think.

234
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,820
I kind of forgot. I watched Earth to Ned. I think the first Jason Segal Muppets.

235
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:07,140
And Earth to Ned have been the muppet things I've liked the most in recent years.

236
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:13,060
I have to say, I think a lot of people's, I'm wondering how much you guys, maybe you agree,

237
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,820
maybe a discrepancy. I think a lot of people's excitement for this was the fact that it's muppets.

238
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,420
People have very warm feelings towards the muppets and people have very warm feelings

239
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:30,500
towards the Haunted Mansion. Like I, I'm giving you get an extra head start in my book.

240
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,980
I think if you're coming with the muppets, you're coming with the Haunted Mansion.

241
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:41,620
I think it's a very canny combination. And I think they've tapped into something,

242
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:47,140
which is there's maybe a pretty perfect circle in terms of Venn diagram of people who really

243
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,300
love the muppets and people who really love Imagineering and theme park lore.

244
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:58,020
They're like cults within Disney fandom. As much as something can be a cult and still owned by the

245
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,260
Walt Disney Company, I think they are. I think, yeah, they're very well matched.

246
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,700
They're the nerdier corners. They have very similar aesthetics and senses of humor and this and that.

247
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,260
And it's like, maybe instead of trying to make the thing where you're working really hard to

248
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,820
modernize the muppets and put them in some new context and make them more like some other

249
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:22,900
thing in popular culture that the kids like or that the adults like or both, maybe just kind of

250
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:29,780
double down and have muppets be your sort of like friendly, you know, family friendly nerd ambassadors.

251
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,860
Yeah, I mean, this thing is like, I feel like this is not trying to do nearly as much as these

252
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,500
other things you're talking about. So I think that's what helps it a lot because it's a lighter,

253
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,500
it's a quicker, you're not doing like big relationship swings with the characters.

254
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,580
You're just like, remember your care, your favorites. Now they're like the other

255
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,980
favorites you have on that ride and you're just enjoying it's a short watch.

256
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,500
Like there's not much to get upset about, I would think.

257
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,260
Yeah, yeah. Look, I'm gonna, I'm gonna have some petty gripes. There will be a little gripes

258
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:09,060
department in this and I, you know, I will explain them with the asterisks of I like this thing.

259
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:15,060
I generally like this thing. I think it's good. It made me sort of, I continue to struggle with

260
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:21,220
what is the best application for these characters creatively. But I do think in terms of just

261
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:31,780
strategy, this seems smart. Yeah, I was talking with, after mention Connor Ratliff and Patrick

262
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:36,020
Kotner who produces the George Lucas talk show and they're like two of the biggest

263
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,900
Muppet fans I know. So we tend to geek out about this shit together. And this observation I had is

264
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:50,900
this weird recent spate of Simpson's Disney crossover shit. What they've been to Star War

265
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:56,500
shorts and a Marvel shorts. Yeah. Right. Going straight to Disney. Plus it feels like they're

266
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:05,300
using the Simpsons now the way the Muppets used to be used. It's like a fundamental misunderstanding

267
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:11,140
of all of those properties. Agreed. Agreed. It's a weird flip. And it's like that's both how Disney

268
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,220
used to use the Muppets a little, but also how the Muppets used to react to pop culture a little,

269
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:21,300
where you could have them cross over with the earnest versions of these things, not do parodies,

270
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:27,060
but like riff on them from the inside. You know, they like, they serve as a little like sketch

271
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:33,060
troop. Essentially, he like kind of taking the piss out of these things, but in a loving way,

272
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,020
which Scott, that's my fundamental thing. It's, you know, if I have an overarching gripe with this,

273
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:44,740
with this special, which I do generally like, it is just my favorite application of the Muppets is

274
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:51,860
as a sketch troop. And this feels like a weird neither here nor there special in, is this the

275
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:59,780
Muppets who are actors going on what is a real adventure in their life? Or is this the Muppets

276
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:06,500
putting on a special for us? Yeah, it splits the difference in a few ways. And I think that's

277
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:12,980
one of the weak parts of it. It's like, yes, I want it. Is this going to sound crazy to say,

278
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:21,300
I want it more Haunted Mansion. Agreed. They're not playing with, there's so much setup, like in both

279
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:27,140
Haunted Mansion and also in the initial conceit at the top of this, that the Muppets are having a big

280
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:33,460
Halloween party. It's like, if you see a bad improv show, this is a common mistake where it's like,

281
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,820
you set up a really interesting idea, like a Muppets having a giant Halloween party.

282
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:44,100
And now we're going to move the show to us somewhere else. Like, all right, that's enough of that. We

283
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,860
haven't explored it at all, but we're going somewhere else right now. You are going to a

284
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:56,980
Haunted Mansion. You are going to the Haunted Mansion. But you are also taking so long,

285
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:03,940
the Haunted Mansion filled with great music. And it takes a while to get, I mean, I guess it only

286
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:09,540
takes like six minutes to get to some chunk of Grim Grin and Ghosts, but it's like, I think the

287
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,940
Muppet Haunted Mansion, I thought the first song I would hear would be Grim Grin and Ghosts or The

288
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:19,860
Organ. And I was not expecting the first song I heard was a cover of Dancing in the Moonlight,

289
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,260
which I did like is a song I like. And I like the Muppets singing it, but it's.

290
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:29,620
But it has to open with Grim Grin. I think that's a weird gripe. That's kind of a fun little thing.

291
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,420
Why do they have to get it in in minute one? I would have maybe liked a little overture,

292
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:39,860
you know, with, with little notes of it. See, I have a completely different thing. I wish there

293
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:44,660
was more stuff like Dancing in the Moonlight. Yeah, I like this. I was like, oh, this is a good

294
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:51,140
choice. I like this song. Well, I'll remind you, it's the special. You get it to the music video

295
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:56,180
at the end. And I was like, OK, good. Not don't just completely do paint by the numbers Haunted

296
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,740
Mansion, which is kind of what the special is anyway. I go, we're going to get like interest.

297
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:06,020
We're going to get the Guardians of the Galaxy style needle drops. Sure. Let's do that. Why not?

298
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:13,380
We get original song. Yes, which were. Yeah, they're bad. But yeah, I was like, oh, OK.

299
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:19,700
Yeah, the original. And and and the Grinning Ghost is so much disproportionately better than the songs

300
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,540
written for this, where you're like the bar is high, you know, yeah, giving us genuine sort of

301
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:32,660
minted pop songs. You're giving us a classic Disney, you know, song in the middle. And then

302
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:38,340
there are some OK Muppets songs on either side. This if I could just like reestablish the silo of

303
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,060
thought, because I think this is what we're going to get into it like I think this thing works and I

304
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:48,980
find it pretty exciting as a largely successful experiment in them testing some different ways to

305
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,860
use these characters and recontextualize them, especially within Disney Plus, which I think is

306
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:59,940
maybe a great place for the Muppets to be doing a couple of things like this a year. And it takes

307
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,740
the pressure off of it needing to be a fucking blockbuster movie or a network show.

308
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,940
A reset. I think what I like about it, like I think I kind of disagree on that setup point,

309
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:16,660
because I like that you're like in the beginning, like Gonzo's, Gonzo and Pepe are heading on an

310
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,660
adventure and then there's a Halloween party and then you're on the adventure. You don't have to do

311
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,900
it's just like you probably wouldn't disagree with this, but I think it's vastly preferable to like,

312
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:30,820
All right, you're here watching the Muppets new movie and prepare to relearn who the Muppets are

313
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,940
for half an hour. I know, I know. I really like that you're just like, it's the Muppets, here they go,

314
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,620
and they're going to do this and great. You take it as a given. The lack of pressure,

315
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:46,660
a movie I think naturally causes pressure that this thing doesn't have. I mean, I believe I went

316
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,020
into the weeds on this when we did the Muppet Vision episode, but like there's the school of

317
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:59,460
thought that I follow. Not that I take this super seriously because once again, it's never meant to

318
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:05,140
have a dense mythology or anything, right? But like the Muppets are essentially a troupe, right? They

319
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:10,820
are actors, they are comedians, they're musicians, they are like a performance group and the origins

320
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:15,380
of these characters, you know, appearing on talk shows and whatever performing for us, that is the

321
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,620
context. Hello, I'm Kermit the Frog. I am an entertainer. My existence is to entertain you.

322
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:25,060
I exist in show business. That, you know, heightens to the Muppet show where we're putting on the show

323
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,660
for you. We control this. This is our theater. You're getting to peek behind the curtain and

324
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,380
see the backstage stuff, but like the idea is they exist to entertain you. They aren't just Mickey

325
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,820
Mouse and Pluto and Goofy walking around in their own universe living their life, right? And you're

326
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:46,660
happening to see their misadventures. This is what they do for a living. And I think it's important

327
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:53,460
because it is the unifying force between these characters is they're all fucking broken show

328
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:59,460
business people. I think that's a core thing that sometimes gets lost where in in shittier

329
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,860
Muppet projects, it's just like, this is just a bunch of fun looking puppets, right? Like what do

330
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:10,100
any of these people have things have to do with each other? And it's like the firmament of the

331
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:16,180
bond between them has to be they all just are broken and need to perform for people or work

332
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,180
backstage or be in show business or whatever. And that's what unifies all these like broken hot

333
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:24,980
balls, right? On the fringes of society. That's what keeps them together is they are this true

334
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:31,540
ball in it together. I bring this all up because the first Muppet movie, which is the telling of

335
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,580
how the Muppets met each other. It's very much what I'm saying. They all have their own weird

336
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,620
performance ambitions and they group together and find the strength in numbers. And then it ends

337
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:46,900
with them getting this standard rich and famous contract from Orson Welles where they get to make

338
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:54,180
movies. And then the Muppet movie ends with them making the movie that is the story you just saw

339
00:21:54,180 --> 00:22:00,100
of how they met, except the movie is also bookended by them arriving to a screening room on a back lot

340
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:05,940
where they're watching the movie they made. I forgot all that how many layers it is. It's

341
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:11,940
really dense and bizarrely dense for the Muppet movie. But like Kermit, Robin says the current

342
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,260
right before the movie starts. So is this really how things happen? And Kermit's like kind of pretty

343
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:22,180
much. Now I bring all this up because I've always fallen into the camp that Great Muppet Caper and

344
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:29,220
Muppet Stake Manhattan, which both have like different chronologies, right? In Great Muppet

345
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,900
Caper, Kermit and Fozzie are brothers. In Muppet Stake Manhattan, they all meet in college and then

346
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:40,580
move to New York together. Like there's always a reset of what's happening, like who they are and

347
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,140
why. And yeah, there's no like straight line. But that's because I do believe this was intentional

348
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:51,540
on their part. We're now seeing the movies that the Muppets make. Right. The Muppets are like

349
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,220
Hopin Crosby or whatever. Like they have their established personas and they're going to the

350
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,420
studio and going for this next movie. We want to go to New York. And then why they're allowed to

351
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:07,620
like turn to the camera any time and comment on how the movie's going. It's not Muppet movie and

352
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,500
Muppet show or maybe their reality and the other ones like Christmas Carol is not. They're putting

353
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,380
on a Christmas movie. It's OK. I think the Disney stuff is still getting a little bit wrong.

354
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:22,660
Is they think the point is that they're Deadpool and the point isn't that they're Deadpool. The

355
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:28,740
point is we're watching things that they made for us. But yes, I don't think that the com the

356
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,260
comments to camera are egregious in this. I don't even strike me as like inappropriate. I don't

357
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:39,300
either. Like out of line with the rest of them. I don't either. I just think it's a little bit off.

358
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:45,860
It's a little bit off from the sort of weird, vague, internalized rules of the thing for when

359
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:52,420
I think it works best. But when Henson dies and Jim Bryan Henson takes over and they do Christmas

360
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,460
Carol and Treasure Island and people are like, I don't want to see them playing these other

361
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,620
characters. It makes a lot of sense to me strategically in that moment because it's like,

362
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,660
well, we lost our captain. No one knows where to creatively steer these characters. We can map them

363
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:08,500
onto other stuff and it works because they're an acting troupe. This is just they're doing their

364
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:16,100
production of Dickens of Robert Louis Stevenson. Right. Yeah. Let's not forget Muppets Wizard of

365
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:22,420
Oz. Right. With the Quentin Tarantino cameo. Is that right? Am I right? I believe it's a third

366
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:28,100
build cameo as himself. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. In keeping with the that's something Muppets

367
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:35,300
Haunted Mansion kept up, I think is the the bizarre unsorted array of celebrities like these are not

368
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:42,580
all the same type of celebrity remotely. Not exactly a who's who in Hollywood, more of a who cares.

369
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,900
I mean, that's a real Muppet. That's a style.

370
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:54,500
Or world. But then like Muppets Tonight is the same thing like, oh, that's real world logic.

371
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:01,140
They're doing a show on ABC. Right. Right. Yeah. Muppets from Space, I think, is a weird like that's

372
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:06,340
ostensibly presenting the home life of the Muppets. That's my least favorite Muppet movie by like a

373
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:13,220
good margin. The Seagull movies were trying to reset it back to this is their reality.

374
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:18,580
They're a sketch troop. We're now seeing movies about them trying to perform. Right. So that was

375
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:24,020
sort of once again, none of this. I don't want people to think I'm too hyper serious about this

376
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:29,940
shit. Right. But it's a thing I analyze in long emails. Absolutely. It's a thing I analyze in

377
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,580
terms of why I think sometimes the humor works better or doesn't. Right. Like you can play fast

378
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:39,620
and loose with these roles, however you want. But I think by and large, the Muppets work best if you

379
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:45,780
make that decision of are we seeing their reality or are they putting on a show or a production or

380
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:52,340
a movie for us? And this falls into that camp where it's kind of doing both at the same time.

381
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:58,900
Like it's half doing this is the Muppets playing Haunted Mansion. Right. We're treating Haunted

382
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:04,340
Mansion like it's Christmas Carol. We're going to go through many of the beats of the ride,

383
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:09,380
many of the characters. Fozzie gets to be Hatbox Goat. What's the internal logic of that? I don't

384
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:14,180
know. That's good casting. Whatever. Right. But then half of it is this like this is the Muppets

385
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,980
reality. This is what they do in their downtime. They're throwing a Halloween party. Gonzo and

386
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:26,100
Pepe go off on this side adventure. I think it works. But there is part of me that wonders.

387
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,380
And once again, I'm all for them just experimenting at this point and trying shit,

388
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,060
you know, and taking big swings or whatever. But there's a part of me that's like,

389
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,900
I could have watched an hour of this that was just them doing Haunted Mansion. That was just

390
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,820
the reality of Haunted Mansion going like beat for beat through the ride, treating it like

391
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:51,140
that's the classic text that these characters are playing. Which loses what? What do you think comes

392
00:26:51,140 --> 00:27:00,980
out in that version? I think what comes out in that version is more of the sort of, how would I put it?

393
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:10,420
Like, I guess, I guess this is the thing for me. OK, the alternate, I guess, to this is you do the

394
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:17,540
Muppets do a Halloween themed special that takes place in the Haunted Mansion. And whatever happens

395
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:23,380
in whatever room is whatever happens. And you do more like the Muppets singing contemporary songs.

396
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,500
And it's not as much about having a narrative over the course of an hour.

397
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:33,140
You just do what's the funniest thing that could happen now? How do we build around these guest

398
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:38,420
stars we have? Develop things to their talents, whatever. And it's just like, that's the theming

399
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:44,340
of what is a variety special. They were like doing the Muppet show, but instead of their theater,

400
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:53,300
it's the mansion. Right, right. Versus this, which is sort of trying to do a mini truncated emotional

401
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:59,460
arc. Yeah, that's thrown away, I feel like. Which I think the problem is it just doesn't have enough

402
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,540
time to do it because they're not dealing with a movie length amount of time. And they're also

403
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,580
throwing in 30 minutes of like, let's get as many celebrities as we can in here. Let's do

404
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,820
dancing in the moonlight twice. Like, you know, this the balance of the things which I think

405
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,740
pretty much everything that happens in this is entertaining. Well, yeah, like how do you get

406
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:25,380
invested in like Gonzo's fears truly when like there's not that much time real estate? Yeah.

407
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,580
Yeah. And it's got a lot of different masters it wants to serve. Like you want to do this Gonzo

408
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:35,460
arc, you want to hit all the Haunted Mansion beats, you want to make sure you get all the big Muppets

409
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:40,660
in there for at least one sort of standout moment. You want original songs, you want them doing pop

410
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:45,860
covers, you want them doing grin and ghosts, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's the big three.

411
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:51,140
That I wrote that it's trying to do the Great MacGuffin story. It's trying to do

412
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:57,860
Haunted Mansion business, trying to do Muppet business. Right. And I don't think I could have

413
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:04,820
done without the Great MacGuffin story entirely. I thought it was funny when that even that there

414
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,820
was even the realization like, wait a minute, he's the Great MacGuffin. I was like, oh, you didn't

415
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:14,180
know that? I actually thought the characters did know that already. Why wouldn't they? Yeah. On the

416
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:19,780
poster. Yeah, pretty clearly. Yeah, not a huge success. But I guess, yeah, it's just that thing

417
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,260
of like, do you want the Muppets to put on a show for you or do you want the Muppets to tell you a

418
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,060
story? Right. That distinction makes any sense. Yeah. And this one's jumping back and forth

419
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:35,780
between the two. And it does both of them pretty well. But like, and it gets into personal

420
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,860
preference. Mike, you're saying I wish there was more dancing in the moonlight. Right. For you,

421
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:46,820
you'd probably like it more if they had more guests come on and do just like weird, spooky covers of

422
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:52,340
popular music. Well, yeah, I mean, it doesn't have to just be I guess I also mean, like, I just thought

423
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,180
it would be opened up a little more where it's like, maybe it's just a three minute sketch with

424
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:02,100
like Fozzie is the Hatbox ghost. And the head keeps popping into different spots. And they're like,

425
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,740
just like it is just a different pacing. And you can do whatever you want playing with it as opposed

426
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,980
to just going beat by beat of the ride. Right. That's them putting on a show for you. Yeah,

427
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,380
exactly. We're just going to give you maximum entertainment value. And that's the format in

428
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:22,500
which they have always used celebrities the best. Like, like play Jenny Lewis's head's gonna roll

429
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,620
or something. Right. And then it's a Hatbox ghost with the head rolling out. Perfect. Get her in

430
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:34,260
there. We everyone likes her. What an insane failure to not get gosling in this, right? I wonder

431
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:41,460
what's what happens to big of a star to be in a Muppet thing, though, I think like they're not

432
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,540
getting that level, like in any way, I would say yes, in general. But I also wonder,

433
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:53,140
did they talk themselves out of going to him and going like it's Muppet haunted mansion?

434
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:59,860
Like, I think that would be hard for him to turn down emotionally. Hmm. Yeah, I don't know status

435
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,100
is too big for it. Is he still he's not in the they're not they have not announced him for the

436
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:10,900
real movie. No, he's not in that. So it's not like he was holding out for that. No. I don't know.

437
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:18,820
It's odd. I mean, it's just the devil's advocate thing, which is like, maybe we say we say it as

438
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:28,100
if it's like obvious that you kind of like what am I saying? Like the like there isn't a story

439
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:35,220
per se to the the haunted mansion there kind of is there's there's the bride and on constant

440
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,540
stature way and all that. But it's all still like mythology. That's like, if you know it and you

441
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:43,540
read about it, you know that there's there's kind of a story in a through line there. So maybe they

442
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:49,460
feel the pressure to make it turn into a little story because unlike Christmas Carol, it's not

443
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:56,740
like this is a famous clear story that we know very well. So we need to like provide our own

444
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:04,580
thing more just to give it momentum. I think, Scott, you're right that they did feel like,

445
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:15,140
oh, OK, we need some more firm story here, a to b story here. I think at times they may have

446
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:19,460
over complicated, like swung too far in the other direction where I was like, this is kind of a

447
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:25,460
complicated story for a 50 minute special. Yeah, I mean, Muppet Christmas Carol is like

448
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:33,620
a platonic ideal because you have a story that like everyone knows the fucking beats of so well

449
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:39,620
is so cleanly organized. Even if you are a small child, you've probably already seen three versions

450
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:46,020
of a Christmas Carol, you know? And so you don't have to be doing the story math. It's the fun of

451
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:52,100
watching how the Muppets map into that work their spin on things. Whereas this is a story that is

452
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:59,060
like pretty oblique that you have to be, say, a podcast that spends two hours every year only

453
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:05,940
covering one room of the ride. Correct. Right. To be having having done that, I'm still not even

454
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,900
confident what the story of the Haunted Mansion is. I also think there's this part of like,

455
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:19,140
not only do does Disney want the parks to be as much IP that people already love from movies and

456
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:26,180
TV and what have you, but they want to make the classic attractions into more standard IP at the

457
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:32,260
same time. I think so that when people go on the Jungle Cruise ride, it's now like the movie

458
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,420
rather than the movie necessarily being a thing that people love because of the ride.

459
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,980
They want people to come at it from both ends. I think. Right. So I think this is also like,

460
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:47,460
oh, this is mutually beneficial. We're like Haunted Mansion boosts Muppets, Muppets boosts

461
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,420
Haunted Mansion. We try to get people a little more invested in the lore of this thing,

462
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:56,980
probably trying to tee things up for the new movie that they're getting ready to do,

463
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:03,060
just like getting Haunted Mansion iconography and beats and things back into like bigger

464
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:09,060
public consciousness. But it's an odd mesh of things, especially when you don't really know

465
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:14,580
where the story is going. Gonzo's arc is pretty separate from that. Like Pepe just gets caught

466
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:20,820
up in the Madame Liotta stuff. Right. So it's like he's playing to the sort of Haunted Mansion lore.

467
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:26,980
And then Gonzo's thing is sort of removed from the Haunted Mansion, which is I felt like I needed

468
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:31,940
to go to the Haunted Mansion to prove that I'm this like daredevil. And what I realized at the

469
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:37,860
end of the day is what I actually my friends will like me no matter what. And I shouldn't spend this

470
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:42,100
much energy trying to impress them. And what I'm really scared of more than spending a night in a

471
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:46,100
haunted house is losing them. Which then gets back to it. Which then gets back to it. Which then gets back to it.

472
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,780
Right. I mean, fuck. Highlighted the whole special for me. Old Gonzo puppets. Incredible.

473
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:58,260
I think the fucking design of old Gonzo rules. It is so upsetting. It's so weird.

474
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,940
Oh, God. That's what happens to him. He gets a shrivel up thin nose.

475
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,940
His nose like shrills up.

476
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,140
It's so weird.

477
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,460
It's very impressive on a craft level. But yeah, it is upsetting. It worked. What they were trying

478
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:15,540
to do for me where I'm like, oh, no, my friend. Yeah, yeah, it did bother me. Yeah.

479
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,420
This is what happened to Gonzo.

480
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:24,740
It does work and it's intended purpose. But like, Scott, your your zoom background right now is the

481
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:32,500
Vincent Price Muppet Show episode. Which is one of the best in my mind. It's top three probably of

482
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:37,300
the Muppet Show. And that's one where they really go like Vincent Price is our host.

483
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:43,940
Every sketch should be spooky. You know, we will do our classic like three minute like sketches.

484
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,860
We will do some musical numbers with him. But everything should be through the Vincent Price

485
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:56,100
lens. And they're not really trying to like take you on a journey. You know, there is a sketch in

486
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:03,060
that that is I believe the setup is no, it's not it's not the this haunting thing or how some

487
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:08,420
haunted hill or whatever. But it is they get sent to a mansion. It's the sketch that's your

488
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:13,940
background picture right now where it's like Kermit and Fozzie are going to this haunted

489
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:18,180
mansion. I think it's because the uncle left it for them or whatever. And then they realize this,

490
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,180
you know, scary vampire man lives there.

491
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:27,140
I recall Vincent Price on the Brady Winsh variety hour is stronger in my brain right now.

492
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,140
I also don't remember the premise of that besides him being scary.

493
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:35,220
It's a great episode. But it's a similar like can we survive spending the night at the spooky

494
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:40,340
house at the type of a hill, but they just do it as a sketch. It's three minutes and they're

495
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:46,020
gags and then it ends and then he comes out and sings. You got a friend, you know.

496
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:55,300
Yeah, it's I mean, everything these days, you know, is arc this arc journey that for the

497
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:01,300
characters, you know, if you've been in these high level meetings with TV executives.

498
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:08,260
And it's like, yeah, sometimes it's like it's just better to goof around. It doesn't even,

499
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:12,340
you're forcing too much when it's like, well, what does Pepe go through in this

500
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,420
Muppets haunted mansion film? Like I can imagine that there were notes like that.

501
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,980
But like the Pepe arc for me is good, which is just Pepe's really fucking horny.

502
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,340
Yes, that's true.

503
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:29,380
He's really horny and he's got a big ego. Like there's no arc. He gets himself into sticky

504
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:35,380
situations, you know, which I think is better for something that's going to be under an hour.

505
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,220
The Gonzo arc only underwhelms for me because there is just not enough time.

506
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:44,180
There's not enough time. If they had done this existential arc, like a Pixar

507
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:48,900
arc is what they're trying in seven minutes. But Pepe, it's like you have multiple beats of like

508
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,380
he wants to find the famous person room, right? He believes there has to be a room for people

509
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:58,260
like him who are more famous. John Stamos is there. John Stamos is a monster. What does he want?

510
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,260
He wants someone to recognize that he's a king prawn and make him feel like a big guy.

511
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:07,460
Leota does that. He almost marries Leo. You know, it's like just get him caught up in in

512
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,140
the trappings of his own hubris.

513
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:16,020
You're talking about the bride, Constance Hatchaway, not Madame Leota.

514
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,540
Oh, yes, I'm sorry. Yeah, not Leota.

515
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,140
I hate to be a Mr. Correction here.

516
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,380
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

517
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,180
Just saying.

518
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,220
Taraji P.

519
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,020
Taraji P.

520
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:24,660
Taraji P.

521
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,700
Taraji P.

522
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,500
Taraji P.

523
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,820
Terrific on Empire. She was on Person of Interest for years.

524
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,300
Didn't you just trash all the guest stars, Jason?

525
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,780
I think she's my favorite. I think she was the one I was like, oh, cool. They got Taraji P. Hinton.

526
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:43,380
She also gets to do like a real thing. You know, she gets to do stuff.

527
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,660
Arnett. Right.

528
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:51,780
Like Ed Asner, Ed Asner shows up. They were touting this as Ed Asner's like maybe his last

529
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,020
role and he's just like in two shots like as a ghost.

530
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,020
He's dead. He's dead.

531
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,060
Yeah, he is a bust, right? He's among the bus.

532
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,380
No, he's one of the great.

533
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,220
Oh, he's a ghost. OK, OK.

534
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,660
In that sequence, Pat Sajak is a bust.

535
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:14,420
The bus are so poorly executed. I don't know what went wrong here.

536
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,940
Because practically, I guess, makeup.

537
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:22,340
Well, but then they're like mapping the faces digitally onto it, because at the end,

538
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,220
when everyone's singing, dancing in the moonlight, you see like

539
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,500
Pat Sajak just sitting in isolation with the makeup on. Right.

540
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,500
Like clearly he went to some studio and they shot him in a close up.

541
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,900
But the way they like whatever it is, like rotoscope them onto the bus,

542
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,380
they all look fucking strange.

543
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,180
Like none of them really look like themselves.

544
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,340
And you know what I think is really making me, you know why I'm given this,

545
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,060
the benefit of the doubt in a lot of ways.

546
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,060
And I don't know if Mike or Jason, if you feel similar,

547
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:59,860
we for the show not too long ago covered the Eddie Murphy movie.

548
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:03,300
And I don't know if you've had the pleasure, Griffin, in the recent past.

549
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,660
But I think with that slightly fresh in my memory, I'm like,

550
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,100
Muppets Haunted Mansion. Love it. Love it. Perfect. Comparatively.

551
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,020
It goes to the rooms. There's the guy.

552
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,140
I know that box goes and that's a better leota to me.

553
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:22,820
I like I think I'm I'm still haunted by the Eddie Murphy movie.

554
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,740
It doesn't how much they got wrong.

555
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,340
And I just keep going like like the you know, I think you're right about the bus,

556
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,340
but I'm like, it's better than other bus.

557
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,020
To share a CGI bus.

558
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,860
They share an ending. They share the ending of driving away from the Haunted Mansion.

559
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,060
That's true.

560
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,980
And that's what you want to do, I guess.

561
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,780
The little nod.

562
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,300
I guess I want to drive away.

563
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,660
Yeah. I mean, I've been focusing on some more of my gripes and I'm more just trying to parse

564
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,460
things. I will say like to shift gears.

565
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,860
This is the root of what I think fundamentally works best about this thing.

566
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,980
The two main characters in this are Pepe and Gonzo.

567
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:08,660
They are the two biggest characters within the Muppets stable

568
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,580
who are still played by the original people who created them.

569
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,980
Yes, it is a very strategic choice.

570
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:23,700
And I'm realizing only now in retrospect that I think that is also why Gonzo and Rizzo

571
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:29,540
became so pivotal in the 90s that you have them as sort of the people carrying you through,

572
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:37,220
you know, not that there were still other Muppet performers alive at that point in time.

573
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:43,060
But Frank Oz was getting less and less involved because he had his own career.

574
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:48,420
And that takes out Fozzie and Piggy.

575
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,700
He's maybe going to work less days or with those movies, he started to just

576
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,660
dub his voices in post a little bit, you know?

577
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,460
Oh, okay.

578
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:55,960
Okay.

579
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:05,060
And so much of the Frank Oz characters were almost always part of a comedy duo with a

580
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,940
Henson character.

581
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,220
Yeah, you know all that out.

582
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,940
That's really how much and on Sesame Street, too.

583
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:19,460
It is like this is a Bert Nerney, a two-hander, literally with hands with these two performers.

584
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,020
Yes.

585
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,940
So I think they created a new two-hander, which is Gonzo and Rizzo will match.

586
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,740
Whitmire does Rizzo.

587
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:33,780
He's now the top guy here, but he's got more agency over his Rizzo than he does his Kermit.

588
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:41,860
And Gonzo is Goles, who's got the seniority and was always sort of his own oddball off

589
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,460
by his lonesome, right?

590
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:49,300
So you can give him a new dynamic that doesn't feel like a pale version of what the old dynamic

591
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,100
was.

592
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,100
And Whitmire's gone now.

593
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,940
So Pepe, who has increasingly been the only new character created over the last

594
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,820
30 years that's stuck, really,

595
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:08,020
really, it keeps on getting upped and upped and upped and was sort of like knocked back down in

596
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:13,860
the Seagull movies because Seagull had no nostalgia for him.

597
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,900
But I think Pepe is funny.

598
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:21,860
And the main reason Pepe is funny is because it is Bill Beretta developed this character

599
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:28,260
in real time over a course of projects, found this voice and like owns it and can improvise

600
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,540
in it and can write jokes for this character, feels comfortable with it.

601
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,140
You know, he's playing with his friends.

602
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:38,340
It doesn't feel there's not the burden of how do I make this feel like what Jim did or what Frank

603
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:41,380
did or what Hunt did or Nelson did, you know?

604
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:44,260
And there's very, yeah, success with all the other characters.

605
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,980
Like I still I'm not used to that Kermit voice.

606
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:47,940
I'm sorry.

607
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,340
It's getting better, but it's still weird.

608
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:55,540
And I think it does not have enough energy to it yet.

609
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:02,260
I think there was the complaint that Whitmire's Kermit got too sad, sacky, which I love sad

610
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:02,660
Muppets.

611
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:05,140
So that was never really a big problem for me.

612
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:11,140
I think they're making a concentrated effort to make him less downtrodden.

613
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:17,220
But when you do that, you have to replace it with what Kermit used to have, which was

614
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:21,940
people think about the sort of status quo like I'm Kermit, I'm just affable sort of

615
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:25,300
mode. But a lot of it is him being so fucking stressed out.

616
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,500
Most of Kermit's comedy comes from him being under the thumb and being so beholden to these

617
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,940
people he loves who are constantly driving him crazy.

618
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:38,100
And he's desperately trying to like retain control of the ship.

619
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,180
And he's Kermit's just a load.

620
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,140
Right. He's just a little too mellow now.

621
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,500
The voice is still off.

622
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:48,180
It's getting better, but they need to get a little more.

623
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:48,900
It's like Mickey.

624
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,860
Like Mickey got so neutered for a while.

625
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,580
And now Mickey's back to being kind of like crazed.

626
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,860
Yeah. Here's what I mean.

627
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,780
Look, this I have the solve for this problem.

628
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,900
And I've said it before.

629
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,180
Change the look of the puppets.

630
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:06,020
Change the face of the puppet because it doesn't make sense to me a different voice

631
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,460
coming out of that head.

632
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,140
It's like if Jimmy Stewart were still acting, but it was a different voice.

633
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,420
And the puppets evolved like a lot over the first 15 years.

634
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:20,660
If you look at the chronology of like Fozzie and Gonzo and Piggy and Kermit all go through

635
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:25,060
like multiple iterations and then they've pretty much been frozen in amber since like

636
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,100
1987.

637
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:28,820
I would say.

638
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,340
It's time to evolve the puppets.

639
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:35,060
Do you like remember when that concept art leaked of like extreme looney tunes?

640
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:35,620
The lunatics.

641
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:36,900
They're all the yes.

642
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,220
Yeah.

643
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:37,380
Yeah.

644
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,020
The lunatics.

645
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:38,580
Yeah.

646
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:39,380
That's what you want.

647
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:43,620
Then I just want to remind you they did two full seasons of that show.

648
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:48,820
I said that as if like that was like it like happened to get out and then they killed the

649
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:49,460
entire thing.

650
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:54,180
That's the cultural memory of it of like, oh, and the feedback was so bad, they killed it.

651
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,180
No, they just did like 30 episodes of it.

652
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:02,500
No, if memory serves visual memory serves after those first pictures leaked, when the

653
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,620
show eventually premiered, they had given them a little more people.

654
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:11,220
So it wasn't just totally like white intense eyes like they saw them in them a little.

655
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:16,740
They soften them a little, but there were there were 26 episodes I'm seeing here of

656
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,100
lunatics unleashed.

657
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:18,600
Yes.

658
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,520
Lunatics unleashed.

659
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,840
So you want you want muppet tics?

660
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,560
The muppets don't have to be unleashed.

661
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,160
I'm not saying they have to be unleashed.

662
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,720
I'm just saying that, you know, like Mickey changes his look over the years, the muppets

663
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,760
have stayed the same.

664
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:37,720
So now when the performers change, your brain just doesn't it doesn't make sense unless

665
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,320
it's a character that was maybe like organically developed by the person that's actually doing

666
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,200
the voice.

667
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,080
I change Kermit's eyes, his nose.

668
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:45,640
I don't care.

669
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,320
Do you mean give him a nose up?

670
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,200
Make him giant.

671
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,720
Grow him twice the size.

672
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,920
Make Kermit huge.

673
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,480
He's as big as what's his what's his name?

674
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,360
Sweetums.

675
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,000
Thank you.

676
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:55,640
Oh, okay.

677
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,880
Big Bird and Sweetums.

678
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,400
I do think this special comes up with a good solution, though, which is like maybe you

679
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,400
give piggy one scene, you give Fozzie one scene, you essentially give Kermit one scene.

680
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,600
But we can't do that forever.

681
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:12,200
No, no, but for the time being, and if you're doing things like this, if you're doing just

682
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:19,400
sort of like sub hour long specials and your job is just to give us a fun time, you know,

683
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,920
maybe let's keep on getting more.

684
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,280
Yeah, don't let the don't give people enough time to notice.

685
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Look, they're they're failing on this point.

686
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,360
Like I was thinking how.

687
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,640
But I'm saying this is a positive that this special I think balances it.

688
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,160
I want to make clear it's not a gripe.

689
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,840
It hides the weaknesses.

690
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:41,960
And it gives us the most of the characters who have the most comedic juice in them right

691
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,200
now, which I think is the right approach.

692
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,320
They get more to do.

693
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,400
The other ones get quick hits like that.

694
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,160
And they're going to like now Fozzie.

695
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:49,560
I don't know.

696
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,480
I don't know the situation with Fozzie.

697
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,160
And I think that voice is pretty great.

698
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:53,880
It's good.

699
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,840
I think he's the best of the of the newer guys.

700
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,920
I want to say his name is Eric Jacobson, who does pretty much all the Oz characters,

701
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,800
does Fozzie and Pimp.

702
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,000
He's been around for a long time.

703
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,040
Yeah, and those are bad.

704
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,280
That doesn't like mess with my brain like Kermit does.

705
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,840
This is I'm having this struggle over on Sesame Street.

706
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,120
This is all reminded me I'm watching a lot of Sesame Street with the kid.

707
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:20,920
And everybody works pretty well for me, even the characters who there's been turnover.

708
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,920
And then Big Bird is a struggle.

709
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,160
And now I have learned that Big Bird is the same as Kermit.

710
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:32,120
So I am I guess my gripes with this person, unfortunately.

711
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,800
And I don't like saying that, but everything we're saying about Kermit being a sad sack.

712
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,760
This is exactly how I've described Big Bird.

713
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:44,520
There is this segment where Big Bird meets different friends across America

714
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,920
with a Dave Grohl penned theme song and song initially.

715
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:55,400
But of course, but there's this like it's just like he's just got this energy now

716
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:00,760
and it's kind of like that Kermit and I like he meets some kid and then says like,

717
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,000
hey, I'm here with Erica.

718
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,120
How so do you live in a house or an apartment?

719
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,440
He's like this like pest.

720
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,320
He's like a love it.

721
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,320
See pest who asks like really dry questions like that.

722
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,280
Like what are the HOA fees on that thing?

723
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,680
You're getting a deal in there.

724
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,720
I think this Big Bird is so sad.

725
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:27,320
Change Big Bird, the look of the puppet, change the look of the suit, make Big Bird smaller now.

726
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,840
Or medium, make him the depressed blue Big Bird from follow.

727
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,640
No, I can't.

728
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,960
The most nightmare symmetry of all time.

729
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,840
I want to so I'm just I was double checking my facts here.

730
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:46,600
Jacobson has been essentially slowly taking over all the Oz characters over the last 20 years.

731
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,160
Right.

732
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:53,720
So he does piggy, Fozzie, animal, Sam the Eagle, the four big Oz characters with improper muppets.

733
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:58,120
He's also now Burton Grover on Sesame Street, who were the two big Oz characters.

734
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:58,600
They are.

735
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,000
They're good.

736
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,520
I don't even I don't notice.

737
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,880
I know it's a different guy, but Grover is exactly what Grover was.

738
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,240
And he's Oscar as well.

739
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,840
I think he does these voice matches very, very well.

740
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,320
And I think he physically performs the character as well.

741
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:16,760
Vogel, I just want to say in his defense, I think as they've been pushing him into the legacy roles

742
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:22,360
and he has to match your sort of mind's eye memory of what the thing is, those ones struggle.

743
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:29,160
But I contend Constantine and Muppets Most Wanted, which he played, who is the fake Kermit,

744
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:36,440
most known now for memes, is the best original character they've created since Jim Henson died.

745
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:41,880
I think that is the funniest performance in any Muppet movie since Henson died.

746
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,960
That's what's encouraging to me about him is I think he has the right spirit.

747
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:51,560
I think maybe he feels a little burdened by taking on these other characters.

748
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,240
Well, how would you do it?

749
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:53,480
Right.

750
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,560
Constantine's an open playing field for him.

751
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,120
And that character is so much fucking fun.

752
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,280
He does, I'm looking, he does Uncle Deadly too, which I've always liked Uncle Deadly a lot.

753
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,600
And he does, I still like Uncle Deadly.

754
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,160
Who is that?

755
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:05,880
There's less, Uncle Deadly is...

756
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,240
He's the guy behind you, Scott.

757
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:07,880
Yeah.

758
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:12,520
Oh, that like creepy, he looks like the SNL Muppet character.

759
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,400
Yeah, he's like blue, yeah.

760
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,440
I never knew his name.

761
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,240
He's like a skeg.

762
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,720
But yes, I think there's...

763
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,360
He's apparently the Count and the Count is good.

764
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,840
The Count is like a voice match, essentially.

765
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,200
Unless I'm wrong about it being the Count.

766
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,240
Oh, Vogel is the Count.

767
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,040
Yeah, no, I think that's it.

768
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:26,120
I believe so.

769
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,320
So that one he nailed, yeah.

770
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:27,560
Okay.

771
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,440
I think it's unfortunate that maybe they...

772
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:36,840
It's like if everybody else changed more, we wouldn't expect it to be a match.

773
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:42,120
We would be like Kermit and Big Bird wouldn't be jumping out in the way that they are to people.

774
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:46,520
I don't even like that I have this opinion and I'm saying it because it feels like kind of a standard...

775
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,200
It feels like I'm saying, I don't like the new one because it's different guys.

776
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:55,880
But again, unfortunately, when you have Erik Jacobson matching, it's so perfect.

777
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,000
It's almost like it needs to be more like the way Mystery Science Theater in the new

778
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,680
iteration has just said, like, all right, totally different.

779
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,040
I'm not even trying to do the same.

780
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,400
It's like they need to decide that or it has to be match and it's either...

781
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,160
Look, the rest of them do not have a substantive part.

782
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:15,160
Some of them are only visual and other ones pretty much get like a quick gag.

783
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,840
But I do think it is interesting.

784
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:23,160
They bring back a lot of Muppets Tonight characters in this who have not really existed

785
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,280
for the last 20 years.

786
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:34,520
Johnny Fiamma, who's got a quick beat as like a couple one liners as one of the bride's ex

787
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,280
husbands.

788
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,640
And he's the sort of Sinatra-y Tony Bennett.

789
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,280
He's funny.

790
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:40,920
I like him.

791
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:41,880
Yeah, he's funny.

792
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:42,920
He's really funny.

793
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,920
And he was like a big breakout on Muppets Tonight in the mid 90s.

794
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,120
And then they kind of never really used him again.

795
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,600
He's got his monkey sidekick, Sal Manila, who is the one

796
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:01,240
character that Brian Henson played in this, who's now sort of, I think, largely stepped back

797
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,520
from doing the Muppets stuff.

798
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,480
Hands on, right.

799
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:03,960
Right.

800
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,040
But Beretta is Pepe.

801
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,560
He's Johnny Fiamma.

802
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:17,080
He is Bobo the Bear, who still gets a lot of play, is another sort of 90s Muppet who stuck around.

803
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,600
And Beretta co-wrote this.

804
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:23,320
It's really kind of him and Kirk Thatcher are like, it seems the two main creative forces

805
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:23,720
behind this.

806
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:29,800
I think Beretta's got the best grasp on Muppet humor right now and is able to create new

807
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,280
characters that feel like they fit into the firmament.

808
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,840
That having been said, they really haven't let him create new characters since the mid 90s.

809
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:42,200
Like, I think his 90s characters are the ones that have remained in rotation and they're

810
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:48,680
even put slightly more in prominence in this, which feels like a correct judgment to me,

811
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:53,960
but also a real argument for maybe let people do this again.

812
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,680
Yeah, I like the 90s show a lot.

813
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,520
I remember watching it when I was on.

814
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,520
I don't think it's on Disney Plus yet.

815
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,320
Is that right?

816
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,120
It's not.

817
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:09,560
We did a whole George Lucas talk show marathon for it, like a charity fundraiser marathon,

818
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:16,120
where we watched all of it and someone uploaded all of the episodes to YouTube.

819
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,600
I don't know if they're still there, but you might be able to find a YouTube account that

820
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,680
has every episode of Muppets Tonight in order in reasonable quality.

821
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:31,880
And we interviewed a lot of them about it and it sounded like much like the Muppet show taking

822
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,400
several years to end up on Disney Plus.

823
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,800
The music rights are just a fucking nightmare.

824
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:40,920
Yeah, Muppets Tonight was lower priority for them, but in theory, they're maybe working on it,

825
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,440
working towards it.

826
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,880
I mean, there's like, have you ever seen the Prince episode of Muppets Tonight?

827
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,320
Oh, yeah, yeah.

828
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:47,880
Yeah.

829
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,920
Yeah, Mike, I'm sure you know that.

830
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,200
That's one character they didn't bring back was Cynthia,

831
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:59,880
technically from the song Starfish and Coffee, who realized as a puppet finally,

832
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:06,520
and a wonderful seek boy is that watching Prince in a psychedelic Muppet music video in the 90s,

833
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:12,200
besides him doing comedy, which obviously in the maybe only setting where he ever did comedy

834
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,240
and played a character and wore a hat, it's unbelievable.

835
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,320
But the music segments are great.

836
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,440
What was he on an episode of the new girl because they love the new girl?

837
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:20,840
He does.

838
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,160
Yes.

839
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:21,400
Okay.

840
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,280
Yeah.

841
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,000
Yeah.

842
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,800
But he's him.

843
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:28,600
He's not doing like a routine, you know, the comedy comes off of him reacting,

844
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,800
everyone reacting off of him.

845
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,720
Muppets Tonight, he's doing bits.

846
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,520
Yeah, that's good.

847
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,480
Yeah, that's why.

848
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:33,800
I don't know.

849
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,400
Does anyone know how that happened?

850
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,840
Did you talk to them about that?

851
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,080
Seems like the most like outside the box.

852
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:39,560
How is that?

853
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,440
How is that the one thing that's ever gotten Prince to do?

854
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,480
I mean, this is like fucking covid brain sieve.

855
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,800
I absolutely heard a 40 minute story about how it happened and I have zero retention.

856
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,480
I have been curious about my entire life.

857
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,040
I got to hear fucking Brian Henson explain to me

858
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,480
and you could tell me anything happened and I have no memory of it.

859
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,600
Is that uploaded?

860
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,000
It is.

861
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,960
Yeah, no, our whole ball was that then and the audience should as well.

862
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:09,640
Prince also showed up at the Today Show dressed like Brian Gumbel when Brian Gumbel left.

863
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,000
Oh, yeah, that's right.

864
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,120
That's Prince in a costume.

865
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:12,600
That was Prince.

866
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,240
I guess I want Prince and he didn't wear it.

867
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,600
Well, you wore a lot of different wardrobe, but you know what I mean?

868
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,320
Costumes.

869
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:25,880
This is another thing I want to quickly throw out in terms of this thing being neither fish nor fowl.

870
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,240
But once again, good.

871
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:32,120
It's just stuck between a couple weird pillars of like representing

872
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,840
where the Muppets are now in the ether of the Disney system.

873
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:42,040
They almost made a movie in the late 90s that I believe was going to be called Muppet Haunted.

874
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:42,680
House.

875
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,880
That was there was sort of a bake off.

876
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:56,120
The Disney deal had ended with Treasure Island and Sony was going to make two Muppet movies

877
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:02,440
at the same time and they were going to make the Elm on Grouchland movie and whatever the

878
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:08,680
proper Muppet movie was because one of the Henson daughters had then become the president

879
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,520
of production at Columbia Pictures.

880
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,200
So there was like a two movie deal that we're going to shoot the two movies in the same city

881
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:19,000
at the same time and it was the bake off between Muppets from Space, which I think originally

882
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,600
started out as Muppets in Space.

883
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:26,440
We send them to space and then they were like cheaper if three Muppets come to Earth.

884
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:33,480
And then the other idea was this haunted house idea that I think would have been plot wise pretty

885
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:40,520
similar to this of the Muppets accept a challenge to they'll get a million dollars if they stay in

886
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,160
a house overnight.

887
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,520
I mean there was like probably they need the money to save the theater, whatever it is.

888
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:49,160
But the idea was Muppets have to spend the night in a haunted house surviving monsters.

889
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:53,880
There was also when Henson died and Brian Henson was trying to figure out what to do

890
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:59,800
with the characters and you know the Disney deal had fallen through but they were still

891
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,000
working with Disney.

892
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,800
He said like I think we're going to do more TV specials while we wait to figure out how

893
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:10,120
to put them back in movies and they announced a Halloween special that never happened.

894
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:14,280
So there's been this like lingering thing and then the early 2000s this is what I was

895
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,120
looking for to make my zoom background.

896
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:20,680
There was a PlayStation game called Muppet Monster Mayhem.

897
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:26,360
I want to say that was a similar thing where all the Muppets get turned into monsters and

898
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:30,520
they go to a haunted house and you play as Robin and you have to like un-game.

899
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:36,600
Convert them and Kermit is like the creature from the Black Lagoon and Fozzie is Frankenstein

900
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,120
and Clifford is Dracula.

901
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:45,240
It's like a fun ass game that most notably I think is maybe the first music credit for

902
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,280
Michael Giacchino.

903
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Wow crazy.

904
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,720
You read the reviews of the game and they're all like what the what this score is bizarrely good.

905
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:59,720
Well hey if anyone's looking for some more angular Muppets I'm assuming

906
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:04,040
direct to PlayStation 1 video game you're going to get some angles on that baby.

907
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,920
I'm gonna have them look like the PlayStation.

908
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,480
Some different Muppets.

909
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,320
Just look at the game and match that design.

910
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,440
That's the solution to the logo problem.

911
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,360
I'm gonna send the image to you guys because this is what I was trying to make my background

912
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,560
but it is bizarre to look at now.

913
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,760
Zoom wouldn't let you.

914
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,880
It was too strange to know projectives.

915
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,360
It's called Muppet Monster Adventure sorry not Mayhem.

916
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,960
I've never seen this.

917
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,320
It's weird right?

918
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,560
Yeah wow that's crazy.

919
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:30,600
I've never heard of this.

920
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,280
I got it wrong.

921
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:38,600
Also the mapping of which Muppet is which monster is different on the cover of the game which is

922
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,720
photos of puppets than it is the actual in-game renders.

923
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,840
But Fozzie is the werewolf.

924
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,600
Gonzo is Dracula.

925
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,640
Kermit's Frankenstein.

926
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,440
Piggy's the Bride.

927
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,320
Clifford is the creature from the Black Lagoon.

928
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:56,440
Wow can I play I'll put this up on the screen for you while you talk to.

929
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:04,280
I've been trying to get a copy of it and it's very expensive on eBay now but they've been

930
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:07,720
toying around with making a Muppet Monster thing.

931
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,360
Oh yes Mike found a playthrough here.

932
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:10,920
Yikes.

933
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:15,320
Whoa baby these are some angular Muppets.

934
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,640
Queen polygons.

935
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,360
Can you scrub ahead to when there's like monsters on screen Mike?

936
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,560
Beaker actually looks perfect.

937
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,120
Beaker does not look that different.

938
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,920
Oh Pepe looks good too.

939
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:32,600
Yeah they're both angular in terms of designs I think to begin with.

940
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:33,560
Yeah.

941
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:34,920
Oh wow.

942
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,440
Very odd.

943
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,200
Detailed gameplay.

944
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:44,440
But the point is internally you know especially people like Beretta and Thatcher who have been

945
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:49,960
doing Muppet stuff for the last 30 years you know have stayed invested in all of this.

946
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:54,200
There was always this internal push of like can we finally do the Muppet Monster thing.

947
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:59,320
So I think this ending up as a haunted mansion thing was like that finally was

948
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:03,960
the hook that got the green light of like what if we take everything we wanted to do

949
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:10,600
with Muppets Monsters staying in a haunted house overnight and map it onto this property

950
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:14,920
you guys already have that you want people to get re-familiarized with before we release

951
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,640
a 200 million dollar movie or whatever.

952
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:23,320
So I think part of the weird like this special is doing eight things at the same time is probably

953
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,800
that we're seeing vestiges of like different ideas that have happened over the course of

954
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,440
three decades.

955
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:32,760
All the other well the director I saw an interview with the Kirk Thatcher is the name of the

956
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,560
director.

957
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:38,600
He said this has been a passion project for him specifically and that this is the

958
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:43,640
fifth iteration of a Muppet Halloween thing that he himself has attempted.

959
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:43,960
Wow.

960
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,240
A little bit before him or concurrent with him.

961
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:47,880
I think he's been.

962
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:51,880
So it took that push of the Disney property I think to and somewhere to put it that being

963
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:56,120
Disney Plus because like where else what would have been the home for this before.

964
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:01,000
I believe he was the main force behind every version I just mentioned that he has been the

965
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,560
one guy pushing this uphill for 30 years and it was always like we're in between doing the

966
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:09,160
monster thing or the other thing and they always go with the other thing.

967
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:14,280
On the directorial front I think this thing looks fantastic.

968
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:19,800
I like that it's so it's all it's all digital sets apparently it's like entirely.

969
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,120
Yeah.

970
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,360
It's like I didn't know what set right.

971
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,160
Is that that that I think it's that thing.

972
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:30,440
Yeah it's crazy screened but but projected in this photo real way.

973
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,800
Is that what I forgot the Dr.

974
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,360
Honeydew is the Phantom of the Opera in this.

975
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,920
Oh yeah yeah I'll play it after but Mike's now pulled up.

976
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,840
Yeah yeah because I think it's the Mandalorian thing which if you haven't seen that feature

977
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:46,120
at it's insane it's this giant like soundstage with this massive screen where you can basically

978
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:52,600
real time render graphics behind you and it doesn't give you the same like weird green

979
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:57,080
screen effect where you can kind of like the shadows aren't as weird because you can actually

980
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:00,520
have depth to like your background and your actor.

981
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,720
You can light it more.

982
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,160
You can light it better and more.

983
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:08,200
By the the room that they're in I mean I don't think I knew that it was all digital and which

984
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:14,280
is it's all like like I'm especially impressed because they are in some cases a lot of it is

985
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:19,080
not meant to look like the Haunted Mansion ride exactly but some of it is and some of it sure

986
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:25,160
does those parts look right on to the point like where I even I didn't really think they filmed it

987
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:31,160
in the the ride because you know that's probably not possible but like I don't know it's just a

988
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:35,320
lot of it looks like real locations to me so I'm impressed by the digital nature of it.

989
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:39,640
I think the locations look good in terms of how they're rendered like I think the mansion looks

990
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,120
great.

991
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:46,440
I do feel like I can always tell when there's a lot of digital shit involved with the Muppets

992
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:52,680
who are obviously so tactile you know and that the Muppets have always been confined to

993
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,880
the practical reality of shooting a thing with both puppets and human beings like

994
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:02,920
having to build these odd sets that have multi-layers you know and how much they can

995
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:07,160
move within any given shot and you can move the camera without revealing that the floor doesn't

996
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:12,680
exist and all that stuff like there's a fluidity to this that I don't want to be a fucking grump

997
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:19,080
about but I can like tell that it's just like well now it's just a bunch of guys standing in front of

998
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,240
a green screen and the Muppets can do whatever they want you know.

999
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,280
You want it to be more of a pain in the ass.

1000
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:29,480
This is the thing I like I'm trying to parse how much of this is me just being

1001
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:35,160
a traditionalist about shit and I should just get over myself but I do think

1002
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:44,040
the problem solving of it being difficult you can kind of feel it sometimes a little bit of this

1003
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:48,280
feels lightweight for me in terms of performance I'm sure everyone slept better

1004
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:54,360
they had much better posture at the end of this shoot you know like I don't want to

1005
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:01,960
argue for back breaking production for Muppet things if they figured a technological breakthrough.

1006
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:06,520
Maybe you don't end up with like the cleverness of I think the sequences where you just you end up

1007
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:11,240
watching and even if you aren't aware that there's some hidden thing or like something

1008
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:17,080
complex about the setup yeah yeah I just saw behind the scenes of Muppets take Manhattan and

1009
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,320
just like all the stuff you're thinking about how to get everybody crouched down and I always

1010
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:28,360
real world locations I talk about this all the time but like as a kid I remember seeing one of

1011
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:34,840
those behind the scenes Muppet take Manhattan things from the time it came out or it was some

1012
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:39,640
larger making Muppet special that had clips from that in it but this is my very distinct memory of

1013
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:46,120
the first time I like understood like filmmaking as a thing and like you know because I watched the

1014
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:50,120
Muppets I'd just be like well they just show up in a theater and everyone comes and sings and dances

1015
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:56,280
with them like I knew they were puppets but I sort of bought the Muppet sales pitch on how show

1016
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:00,760
business works where it's like well you just show up and do it it's fun everyone's like you know

1017
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:06,200
whatever and there's there's it might be the same thing you saw Scott but there's like a clip I

1018
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:11,720
remember vividly of showing a scene where Kermit and Piggy are in an apartment on a couch talking

1019
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:17,800
and then they call cut and they cut from the proper movie footage to like you know the B camera

1020
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:23,960
behind the scenes the camera that was rolling on set and they take out the couch cushions and you

1021
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:30,840
realize oh this is not a real couch it's carved out and essentially the two of them are sitting

1022
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:37,640
sideways in fetal position inside this hollowed out couch sticking their arm up playing this

1023
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:43,800
romantic scene with each other and I had this thought of just like wow like these two guys are

1024
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:49,880
doing what looks like the least comfortable thing in the world so that I a small child can enjoy it

1025
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:55,480
and never think about how difficult it is because the scene is not the Muppets riding bikes it's

1026
01:06:55,480 --> 01:07:01,160
not you know Piggy doing like an Esther Williams swim number like all these things that do feel

1027
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:06,760
like crazy special effects it's the two of them on a couch in a wide shot you know and there's

1028
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:16,680
a little bit of that I think I want people to have less abusive times producing content right and I

1029
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:20,840
hate that I just use the word content there but making movies and tv show without suffering

1030
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:27,800
a horrible psychological and physical pain a thing that is constantly being having to be fought for

1031
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:33,960
in an industry that does not protect people but especially like second class like puppeteers not

1032
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:39,720
often given proper respect are not treated like actors yeah and I think Disney in particular when

1033
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:45,080
Henson himself was producing the thing there's the story I've always heard that's like it's so

1034
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:50,600
telling about Jim Henson where whenever they would do a shoot right and they're working with

1035
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:56,920
a crew who maybe does not usually work with puppets and you have all these like tough six foot five

1036
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:02,920
300 pound like grips and shit right who are like I don't know some fucking puppet movie or whatever

1037
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:06,120
and on the first day he'd go like um can I have everyone's attention

1038
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:14,920
would everyone try just holding your hand above your head for 30 seconds and everyone would do it

1039
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:19,400
and they do it for 30 seconds and by the end of it everyone's arm would be sore and he was like

1040
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:24,760
so that's what the puppeteers are going through all the time all day every scene keep that in

1041
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:29,880
mind let's be really considerate of their time and you know make sure we're ready and that

1042
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:34,840
everything's on point for when they're going to shoot something um I think he was a guy who was

1043
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:41,160
really good at taking care of people uh and then I think there's a little bit of Disney taking over

1044
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:47,480
and being like well do the puppet thing yeah right sure and if the puppet thing is easier by

1045
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:54,840
doing it digitally then then do it that way but I think you miss a little bit of creativity that

1046
01:08:54,840 --> 01:09:00,840
comes out of that I also think and it's like I I'm happy they film this the way they did if

1047
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:05,240
only for COVID reasons right I'm like this seems like this was a pretty safe and easy shoot to do

1048
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:11,000
oh yeah probably yeah you can bubble this thing people have small appearances whatever it is like

1049
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:16,840
that's nice um the fact that you have so many ghosts as well means you have so many muppets

1050
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:24,200
who are like composited on top of an image that's already a virtual set and so you have like muppets

1051
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:29,880
floating around with weird filters on them which starts to make them feel less tangible to me

1052
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:35,320
but it's a very digital feeling I like this special I just keep focusing on my gripes because

1053
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:40,600
I'm but the pain and suffering of the puppet about muppets yeah let's make let's be honest

1054
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:46,040
it makes it better when the puppeteers suffer we get some of their life force I'm not joking

1055
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:51,880
it does it's true it's true it's true it's true it's true I think there's a balance that can be

1056
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:57,720
achieved between the two and I think this is maybe swinging because they got shining technology and

1057
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:03,000
also you're producing this during a pandemic this swung towards the most safe comfortable way of

1058
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,600
doing things and I think the best reality is probably a hybrid of the two yeah I I let me say

1059
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:15,640
some stuff I like about it I like piggy being leota per se I think you want that it's like well

1060
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:21,640
you want to see miss piggy in the book I like rolf playing the organ we don't see him that much

1061
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:26,760
there's also a scooter appearance early on I feel like these guys fall back by the wayside yeah um

1062
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:35,560
what's the I like muppet ghosts like I the the ghosts of Christmas past in muppets Christmas

1063
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:42,600
Carol is such an odd film thing and I like the ghosts in the Darren Criss musical number

1064
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:47,880
the muppet goats that kind of float above everyone the classic sort of muppet like

1065
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:55,160
bed sheet yeah like a bed sheet but I also I like those two muppets who are sort of the lackeys to

1066
01:10:55,960 --> 01:11:02,200
Will Arnett there's like the skeleton and the the other sort of like mummy sort of muppet the ones

1067
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:10,360
who get angry about not going to do dun dun dun right right I think they're fun too I like Walter

1068
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:16,920
being one of the dead groups that was such a weird choice that Walter is in it and never

1069
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:25,240
acknowledged but he is one of the groups back Walter is back I am a rare Walter apologist but

1070
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:32,040
it is funny that Disney is like we're we are never going to admit this didn't work

1071
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:38,760
like no longer at the center of the picture but we're gonna make sure he makes at least one

1072
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:44,120
physical appearance in every production because god damn it we're not apologizing for Walter

1073
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:50,120
never surrender yeah but no Denise I said that before we started that's my background

1074
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:57,080
Kermit's girlfriend on the muppets ABC Big Bang show the one in which he was

1075
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:03,400
piggy break up Denise is not you know a ghost did that Denise can go fuck herself for all I'm

1076
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:08,600
concerned okay I feel like almost nothing ever needs to be acknowledged from that series

1077
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:17,560
there's like there's like one person who you've angered with that exactly one yeah yeah they are

1078
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:25,000
or soon yeah they're subscribers absolutely probably I'm with you they did Denise dirty

1079
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:31,640
we like Denise on this pot of this patreon so don't you take that legally speaking I like Denise

1080
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:37,240
okay there I've said it on the record and don't uh they don't go to the gripes yeah no there is

1081
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:43,160
a character in this who I don't think has a line and I even had to dig to remind myself who he was

1082
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:49,960
but he's sort of like a muppet with like an egg head and like wild eyes and little glasses and

1083
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:57,240
little curly hair on top I'm gonna send you a picture of this guy but he I realized is from

1084
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:05,000
the Jim Henson hour which is like the the least loved muppet show and the last tv show that

1085
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:13,320
Henson worked on and other thing that Waldo was on Waldo yes Waldo right right and Clifford

1086
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:20,920
Clifford's the only character from Jim Henson hour who stuck around in any way but Chip is just a

1087
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:27,560
funny looking puppet I think he was like tech support or he worked in like the the circuit

1088
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:32,520
room of the television network and Jim Henson our yeah yeah yeah he's this guy yeah he's cool

1089
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:36,600
looking and now they've just started bringing him back a lot and sometimes they give him a line

1090
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:42,520
sometimes they don't but I just think he's got fun energy he does have fun energy I mean I I think

1091
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:49,320
I you can feel it them being like well let's go through and feel like what excites us maybe more

1092
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:56,200
yeah which is like good I mean that's maybe like what Griffin what you're saying is obviously kill

1093
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:03,880
off the legacy characters permanently and and just have the fun newer characters or the characters

1094
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:08,520
that everybody likes more you want them all gone you don't want you don't want Kermit that's your

1095
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:15,720
solution is no Kermit no Kermit is dead don't even change his nose just kill him you know

1096
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:23,080
Mike is pro Kermit is is we retire we have the memories we have the movies Kermit did not come

1097
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:29,720
back from the Thanos snap Kermit was the one yeah there were like a hundred people that didn't come

1098
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:34,120
back from the snap when they returned and Kermit was one of them yeah they wanted them yeah Black

1099
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:44,920
Widow they got an alternate Gamora no alternate Kermit so here's the thing I love they do in when

1100
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:50,200
you get to the uh you guys are about to get angry at me for saying the wrong thing but like the the

1101
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:56,040
ballroom sequence what's the main sort of room yeah the ballroom you're right okay okay when you

1102
01:14:56,040 --> 01:15:00,760
get to the ballroom sequence and they sort of transition into doing a Halloween themed

1103
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:05,640
version of at the dance which is one of my favorite Muppet Show runners which was just I think it's

1104
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:12,040
only in season one or maybe they do it through season two but it was just uh they'd cut to a

1105
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:18,120
nondescript ballroom and it would be Muppets and twos dancing around and then two of the partners

1106
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:24,840
would come up closer to camera and would have like a three line back and forth joke set up punch line

1107
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:31,560
and then it goes to the next couple on the dance floor and they sort of do that here it's a very

1108
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:37,480
classical Muppet sort of like vaudevillie comic premise of just like what are sort of like

1109
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:44,440
three panel comic strip wordplay gags you can do and I like that they repurpose that here within

1110
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:49,320
the theme it's fun that then Stalart and Waldorf are like heckling those very jokes and doing it

1111
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:55,560
from a doom buggy like I think there's smart integration of both historical Muppet comedy

1112
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:03,640
stuff and the the the important tenets of uh Haunted Mansion yeah the safety announcement

1113
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:09,080
got yes the sudden then that they consider that part of that is fun yeah or that's which it is

1114
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:12,920
true like the way that that safety announcement is I don't know if we've even mentioned it

1115
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:18,760
in our many Haunted Mansion episodes but there it is like iconic in a way it made me laugh yeah Scott

1116
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:22,120
you're right we have to go back and talk a little bit more about that yeah we got a lot of good

1117
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:30,840
so I just keep moving takes up this year I'd say hey I don't know uh settled it's adjacent um the

1118
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:36,360
very weird choice though at the very end there's a tag with Stalart and Waldorf moving like you move

1119
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:42,760
uh with the ghost will follow you home sequence and a ghost does not follow them home which I'm

1120
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:48,760
only like oh that's strange because the doom buggy is moving exactly in the fashion that like

1121
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:54,520
another month does not appear in the doom buggy well and then the final gag of this is the hitch

1122
01:16:54,520 --> 01:17:02,040
hiking ghost showing up in the back of the car right but not Muppet versions of them right they're

1123
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:07,400
the real ones right that's odd yeah I kind of would have preferred if they were Muppety yeah

1124
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:14,200
yeah I I mean I also kind of if I'm getting into really nitpicky gripes I almost would rather have

1125
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:19,560
seen the hatbox ghost himself and not maybe he could have had a Fozzie like kind of cousin

1126
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:25,880
to him I mean this is where you get into this thing of like should it be the Muppets are all

1127
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:30,840
themselves they go through the Haunted Mansion and everything is the real version of the Haunted

1128
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:36,520
Mansion right like you can you can hire Taraji to play the bride but the second pickies Lyoda

1129
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:41,480
you're doing a mapping game right versus do you want to just do an earnest telling of whatever

1130
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:48,120
the Haunted Mansion mythology is and have everyone play those parts fully right I mean I I acknowledge

1131
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:54,680
that maybe people have more affection for Kermit and Fozzie than the hatbox ghost or one of the

1132
01:17:54,680 --> 01:18:02,040
waltzing ghosts well no chip everyone likes chip everyone likes chip but I'm just saying yeah me

1133
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:06,360
personally I kind of was like once I would once at the end there and I was like oh you can do

1134
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:10,760
just the real ghosts I kind of was a little bit like oh man wish we could have seen that

1135
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:18,760
hatbox ghost the real one not the Fozzie Bear Lumps then go to the ride why are you watching a Muppet one if we're not going to do a Muppet one

1136
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:25,480
well I'm saying like you could have Fozzie and the real one you know I'm saying I'd like to see the meat

1137
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:31,160
I'd like to see the meat I think what Mike is is saying Scott that the hatbox ghost should be treated

1138
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:39,080
as the Michael Caine of this special that you need one heavyweight actor like the hatbox ghost he's the star of the Haunted Mansion

1139
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:45,960
to bring the gravitas yes and then everyone else is a Muppet around him yeah exactly so like having a few of the ghosts

1140
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:51,560
be the original ghosts with the Muppets I think would have been nice but again I will say though

1141
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:56,760
I would we're picking nits I will say and I only feel comfortable picking this main nits because I

1142
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:04,680
feel like this has been overwhelmingly well received um and I mean I like a lot of it

1143
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:11,720
until now no I like it in general I really enjoyed myself watching it yeah every all culture now is

1144
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:16,920
yeah it's fine yeah it's fine it's all right yeah I know that's true that is the highest height most

1145
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:22,200
things it's into yeah it's been two years since Parasite maybe feel something so um looking for

1146
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:26,760
maybe something else will come back right is is everything worse are my feelings dead after the

1147
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:34,520
last two years probably column a and column b I've lost the ability to love uh my brain was broken by

1148
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:39,560
this pandemic uh Mike I was just gonna say uh as much as I agree with what you're saying

1149
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:46,680
hatbox fozzie looks pretty fucking cool like I do like the design of I like fozzie with teeth

1150
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:52,840
I like this weird green fozzie with wild eyes I kept on thinking I'd love a little hatbox fozzie

1151
01:19:52,840 --> 01:20:00,040
on my desk like I want sure Muppet hunted mansion merch well that's what I don't know why you do any

1152
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:06,760
real ones because like the only I think the biggest success of this is just like hey look it's miss

1153
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:14,040
piggy as madam leota hey look it's fozzie as the hatbox oh look it's sam the eagle as the dueling

1154
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:19,560
painting um it's almost like this thing works like it works in the same way on twitter with

1155
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:27,240
released images as it does the actual special itself um and I but I say that like even though

1156
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:32,040
I do like the things that they do I do then like the moments they have in the dialogue

1157
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:36,040
that they have you're seeing this would work out just as well as a series of photos

1158
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:46,600
I praise yes Scott is arguing for a flip book only release right basically equally as entertaining

1159
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:54,760
no I'm saying I like the three lines that they all say once they're in the costume got it got it

1160
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:59,240
but I'm also what I'm arguing for and tell like I don't know tell me guys if you think is the

1161
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:05,160
craziest idea you've ever heard but I just had this idea like what if you took a movie right

1162
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:12,520
and you remade it right and you uh took only took one actor from the original movie and they say

1163
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:18,920
the same wait for it okay all the rest are muppets wait what is that the craziest I'm like I'm out of

1164
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:24,280
my mind right but imagine that just like pick any movie that you can think of like I don't know

1165
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:29,480
network yeah faye done away stays and the rest are muppets wait use me wait a second

1166
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:36,920
it who's mad man carrying the zoom off right now are you saying like am I offending you

1167
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:41,720
and let me try this like maybe I'm busting open your ideas of cinema let me try this as a thought

1168
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:46,440
experiment okay so what you're saying is something like if I picked Muppet Treasure Island and I kept

1169
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:53,400
Tim Curry but everyone else was a muppet everybody else a muppet yeah that one kid the other human

1170
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:58,600
character is now a muppet what's your muppet now sorry your chip now

1171
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:06,840
you're a man you're a wild man griffin just like me the critics some of the craziest content ideas

1172
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:16,760
you're wild for me here's a question for you guys yes in my in my heart of hearts what I want most

1173
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:23,240
is for the muppets to just do a variety show again right I've said this as many times as I can on the

1174
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:29,240
18 000 times I've appeared on podcasts to talk about them you will again when you're asked to

1175
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:36,680
again absolutely um I have heard even recent rumblings that like very well established people

1176
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:44,360
are going to Disney and going like what if I produce this please uh and the pitch is just

1177
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:50,120
let's do the muppet show again like it feels like there is more and more of a push that maybe

1178
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:54,520
something will come soon or maybe it won't I don't know that's the thing I'd like to see them do most

1179
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:59,000
I think that's the format they work best in you're talking about like if the muppets did an epic

1180
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:06,840
takedown of Eric DeJoy the villain in the government right yeah Eric DeJoy DeJoy Lewis DeJoy what is

1181
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:14,680
his name oh man it's like is there another DeJoy out there probably is one DeJoy replay leave the

1182
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:20,200
last name but the first name becomes something totally random what I'm saying Jason is I want

1183
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:30,600
to see uh Pepe apologize to Dan Crenshaw in real time and so like hug him and go like hey you're

1184
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:36,760
you're okay by me man like quietly and it's like he doesn't think he's Mike's but he knows he's Mike

1185
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:43,880
it's like uh the question uh John Stewart's the question but muppets yeah that's what I want

1186
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,720
right no but I have the thought in this of like is the thing to do now

1187
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:55,880
do you do more muppet holiday centric specials like this do you make sort of like holidays or

1188
01:23:55,880 --> 01:24:02,440
themes the thing you're you're latching on to do you do it around theme parks because I do think

1189
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:08,520
as we were saying there's a good overlap in sensibility uh do you do you know muppet uh

1190
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:15,800
jungle cruise you know uh sounds more appetizing to me than jungle cruise too but like do you do

1191
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:21,000
muppet big thunder mountain or whatever you know do you go into sort of like I don't know I bet

1192
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:27,080
they got one more in the imaginary in this area right it would have to be jungle cruise or pirates

1193
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:32,680
or space mount it's got to be one of the like five things that the average person uses as

1194
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:37,560
shorthand for like disney world or for theme park but pirates I think you could do I think you're

1195
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:41,800
far enough away from the movies now that you could do a special that's more about the rides

1196
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:47,800
and perhaps that's what disney needs now is a special to reframe pirates as less of a Johnny

1197
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:52,920
Depp thing you lose one of the characters I don't know pick pick it yourself like with the muppet

1198
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:59,640
game pick which character you lose yeah just one I don't know I have one idea but yeah uh but but

1199
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:05,720
then the other thing was I was like should they just be doing on Disney plus like more muppets

1200
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:11,000
act in classic stories right like I was like why aren't they just going back to that I think

1201
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:19,000
there's now like a 90s kid nostalgia for like do muppet blank and the answer to that is I had to

1202
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:24,600
step back and go oh because Disney's already fucking remaking all of these stories as 200

1203
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:31,320
million dollar movies or yeah but you're saying like something that's culty like hocus pocus or

1204
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:37,320
something well take on their disney cults potentially in my mind's eye I want to just

1205
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:41,800
see fucking muppet Alice in wonderland or whatever not a good example because they did an Alice in

1206
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:47,560
Wonderland episode on the muppet show but like you know what what have you muppet Pinocchio right

1207
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:53,320
um I I'm more interested in seeing muppet Pinocchio perhaps than Robert Zemeckis Pinocchio

1208
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:59,320
but maybe the answer is you you pick you pick Disney things maybe you include things that you've

1209
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:05,960
gotten in the fox acquisition you know muppet aliens I mean this is what I'm wondering like

1210
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:12,840
can you do a muppet alien special ah fuck Paul Reiser would I mean it's chip is it

1211
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,840
is

1212
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:27,000
yeah it's not a bad idea no actually yeah I don't I know that's good yeah that's pretty good if

1213
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:33,560
there if the aliens are if the xenomorphs are muppets too right yeah of course yeah but there's

1214
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:41,560
still guns that you still you still shoot them yeah and muppets die in it yeah yeah canonically

1215
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:47,320
forever right right done muppet dies on screen that's it I like the goat in this by the way I

1216
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:51,320
think he's a little bit of a breakout star oh yeah the goat's good I like the goat a lot I

1217
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:57,560
just the character is fun from the witch yeah yeah I mean that does feel like the two things you can

1218
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:02,520
do with the muppets right straight sketch show the muppets put on the production of the three

1219
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:08,840
musketeers right right right maybe that's the answer maybe it is you take public domain classic

1220
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:13,960
stories that Disney never did as animated films you find the other things like Christmas Carol

1221
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:18,920
and Treasure Island you do three musketeers but didn't they do like a video series of this that

1222
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:24,440
was kind of like yeah like there was a thing called like what was it called like muppet twisted

1223
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:29,000
fairy tale theater or something like that that was like a Disney straight to video thing that was

1224
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:37,000
more short fairy tale stories more like nursery rhyme sort of stuff but but even like uh emperor's

1225
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:46,200
new clothes I think or king mitis they did and then they did a run of comics in the early 2000s

1226
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:51,160
that were sort of doing all the ones that weren't done of like Muppet Snow White Muppet Peter Pan

1227
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:59,240
Muppet Peter Pan comic book weirdly written by Grace Randolph hmm interesting but those comics

1228
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:05,480
were kind of fun and I think you wouldn't have Disney wouldn't have the muppets tell those stories

1229
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:11,160
now because it would conflict with the massive live action behemoth retellings of those stories

1230
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:17,160
that they've already got in in the circuit yeah have you yeah have you read up about you know

1231
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:23,160
Frank Oz is pretty salty about the muppets these days but he seems to like if they were they would

1232
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:28,120
let if they would let him he would be interested in coming back but they don't want that I don't

1233
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:33,320
think I think Disney will prevent Mr. Oz but but would you even a muppet connoisseur want that

1234
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:40,360
because sometimes you know maybe he's up past his prime too with the muppets I I look that's my exact

1235
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:47,000
fear like I would be far more depressed seeing a bad Frank Oz muppet thing than a bad Disney

1236
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:54,040
corporate muppet thing uh-huh I I think at this point there's kind of no reason to not give him

1237
01:28:54,040 --> 01:29:00,360
the shot the thing I'd always heard was that like the muppets deal goes through and then Eisner leaves

1238
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:06,120
right and no one really fucking knows what to do with them because it's like Eisner made that like

1239
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:11,400
his last deal on the way out because he was still bitter over the fact he hadn't been able to close

1240
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:17,080
the deal 20 years earlier and then these characters are sort of dumped him up at Disney and there are

1241
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:22,360
no champions within the system and so they were sort of doing the two things at the same time which

1242
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:31,160
were can we woo Frank Oz back to do a muppet movie and then Siegel becomes a little hot they take a

1243
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:35,400
general meeting with him and he goes the only thing I want to do is the muppets and they were

1244
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:41,640
developing those two things at the same time right and not sure which one was the right take to go

1245
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:46,920
Frank Oz and go like let's get as classical as we can or have Jason Siegel come in and go like I want

1246
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:51,880
to sort of recontextualize them I want to reset them I want to reintroduce them to a younger

1247
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:59,480
audience the thing that Siegel has admitted himself really worked in his favor was Disney was like very

1248
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:03,640
hesitant to green light either one they were dragging their heels about the viability of the

1249
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:11,080
muppets in general and what he did very cannily was every time he was going on a late night talk

1250
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:16,920
show or anything to promote any live action movie he was doing he would bring the muppets with him

1251
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:23,160
a he would talk about the fact that he was like writing a muppet movie so people be like oh that's

1252
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:30,360
like a thing here's a famous actor I know about his screenplay in development right but the other

1253
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:35,000
thing was he'd like go to whatever department and be like can Statler and Waldorf come on Kimmel with

1254
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,520
me and they would and he like helped build that relationship in the audience's mind of like oh

1255
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:45,400
this guy working with the muppets is fun so then it became like fuck I guess we're going with Siegel

1256
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:51,480
that's when they shut Oz down and Oz I think has felt very burned by that and in that interview

1257
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:56,200
you're talking about Mike recently he sort of framed it as like they don't want me to do it anymore

1258
01:30:56,200 --> 01:31:03,160
I would happily still play those characters but I think he only wants to play them if he has creative

1259
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:08,440
control again I don't think he wants to show up and puppeteer for someone else's thing I heard

1260
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:15,400
with Sesame Street it's a matter of uh he was too expensive they used to have him do like two days

1261
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:19,800
a year and it got too expensive the budget for that show has been struggling which is why they

1262
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:28,600
had to get bought out by Warner Media but um I I think with muppets it's like he doesn't want to

1263
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:33,960
play them unless he gets a creative say again and I think at this point there's no reason not to go

1264
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:39,240
hey Frank Oz here's your project especially if it's for Disney Plus the thing I know he always

1265
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:46,600
wanted to do was um the cheapest Muppet movie ever right which was like the last film script

1266
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:55,560
that he and Jim worked on uh Jim my friend Jim uh but it's it's sort of what Tim and Eric did

1267
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:01,080
for their movie but the joke is that Gonzo gets to make his own movie and he wastes 100 million

1268
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:06,840
dollars on the opening credits and then there's no budget left so the movie is them struggling to

1269
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:13,000
finish a movie I like that Gonzo was always my favorite I it's it's a gonzo centric thing

1270
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:18,920
goals is still alive and if Oz if you let Oz direct that and use that script then you have

1271
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:26,200
him playing piggy and animal and Fozzie again I think there's no reason like not to let him do that

1272
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:31,400
yeah they do it and then let him do like an old man Logan like old man Kermit

1273
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:39,960
like prestige Wolverine style movie yeah you know but I and then he dies at the end and then he

1274
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:45,960
dies at the end after he rescues Robin he rescues all of them he rescues all of the second he

1275
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:54,520
rep rescues Robin Walter Bean Bunny Rizzo Pepe like all the up-and-comers the new generation

1276
01:32:54,520 --> 01:33:01,880
chip okay I mean I just think like we're all united on this I believe as a philosophy where

1277
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:06,360
it's just like how do you say it Mike always like let's just like get into like the sludge

1278
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:11,480
like let's roll in the slop I usually say do everything mash everything yeah you know

1279
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:17,400
because I think one of the things with the Muppets that's a problem sometimes is the Muppets as

1280
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:24,120
entities are bigger than any of the movies or it's like Superman right like there's one great

1281
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:31,880
Superman story a decade every 12 years like because he has taken on a life of its own

1282
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:37,720
it's hard to write for like yeah it's harder yeah I just think you can't have spacey every time so

1283
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:42,520
what do you do in the I know it's tough it's tough and we have by my count six more years before we

1284
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:49,480
get spacey back again um I filmed in France there's no reason weirdly to be precious about

1285
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:54,200
it at all and just be like you know what we're gonna let Frank Oz make his movie and simultaneous

1286
01:33:55,240 --> 01:34:01,480
oh what happened Jason Sheridan is the host now hmm that seems like a problem

1287
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:10,520
hopefully uh well we're all recording in different manners yes um okay hmm did his battery dot that

1288
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:16,600
was very studded either his program crashed or his computer well one thing's for sure Mike will come

1289
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:27,800
back calm collected handling it well let's keep this in yeah uh my point is I just think they

1290
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:32,760
should do everything and it's like maybe you have someone developing the sketch show and maybe you're

1291
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:39,640
doing like seasonal you know specials like this or retellings of other things and maybe you let Oz

1292
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:45,080
make his thing you know like maybe you don't need 20 Muppet projects a year but maybe you can have

1293
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:49,960
different people developing different approaches for these characters at the same time and you do

1294
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:55,560
like two things a year and I think if that's the case one of them should be Frank Oz so what

1295
01:34:55,560 --> 01:35:04,920
happened there Mike yeah oh yeah we well I guess yeah we ended up just but then I mean I don't care

1296
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:09,880
uh yeah no my internet went out it's weird and then the whole thing popped right back up as

1297
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:17,160
soon as it was back up yeah weird okay we wondered if the uh the battery went down or something

1298
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:27,080
or no is your computer haunted it could be haunted yeah but don't we I think that this that this

1299
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:33,000
special is a little more in the spirit of hey we did something like we let him do something and we

1300
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,520
didn't I don't know I guess we've had our problems about story but like I like that like I think do

1301
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:44,840
five of these a year and that's a like and not the pressure of a movie it's like if you didn't dig it

1302
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:49,400
well it was only an hour it wasn't a lot of your time maybe you really did dig it this is in abstract

1303
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:56,680
the type of risk they should be taking and I think it is overall successful yeah and I think you

1304
01:35:56,680 --> 01:36:02,440
could just do it oh look loosen up the reins more like whatever characters they want to use for the

1305
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:08,440
property just lean into those characters and yeah just get less precious with like trying to retell

1306
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:13,800
exactly what the story of whatever writer just our famous movie or something they're doing just

1307
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:19,640
send them to a place or do a thing or have a theme yeah and I think if you Scott I think you're

1308
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:25,160
right if you're cranking out fortify specials a year that takes the pressure off any one of those

1309
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:33,400
yes you be like the the big thing like this is definitely the muppets yeah right yeah this this

1310
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:41,560
was definitely positioned as like this is one of our big quarter four dc plus release this is one

1311
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:48,520
of our big fall releases and that is a lot of pressure and when I was at the parks last week

1312
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:55,960
like there are photo opportunities like in multiple places for this special those are good I think

1313
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:01,560
the paintings actually follow you they do the effects it's like the it's the kind of living

1314
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:07,320
photo effects yeah haunted mansion but outside of the mansion context it's great it was the only

1315
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:13,320
thing on a wednesday without a 40 minute wait so crowds are back yeah that was bad right I know I

1316
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:18,360
was there the day before yeah I warned you awful yeah really bad uh hey walked right on the marked

1317
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:26,120
way and uh kind of called it after that you mean to tell me you didn't go in every line and

1318
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:31,240
appreciate the things in the line that's a misrepresentation of the argument now you're

1319
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:40,280
being very silly we don't have time we don't have time sure well you got what I was saying though

1320
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:43,640
so I didn't misrepresent it that much no I got I remember I knew the reference

1321
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:50,840
what haven't we done here uh I don't know any any further thoughts closing thoughts

1322
01:37:51,480 --> 01:38:00,040
uh I just want to throw out uh I I checked my little deadline window here uh two two Disney

1323
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:05,720
stories of note that just came out um uh one Alan Horn is retiring at the end of the year

1324
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:12,120
who has been in charge of Disney on the movie side of things for the last uh decade I guess about

1325
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:17,800
Cody taking over Cody horn is taking over and then magic mic and then after two episodes she's just

1326
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:23,320
gonna slowly disappear and never be acknowledged again um uh but but they've also announced this is

1327
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:31,800
a very bizarre thing a master of modern horror David Gordon Green is going to produce a movie

1328
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:40,840
about the making of Disneyland ha wow what he's directing like a uh I guess it's a biopic I mean

1329
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:48,520
it's not biopic it's a movie about Disney's journey to build Disneyland okay for Disney

1330
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:55,960
plus idea of a movie yeah I mean his like early indie movies are very like he has such an

1331
01:38:55,960 --> 01:39:01,080
interesting career you made these very quiet like indie movie and then he made a bunch of big

1332
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:07,080
budget comedies and now he's made these fun like his Halloween um the sequels coming out soon uh

1333
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:13,720
was really fun like Danny McBride co-wrote it I think so um that's an interesting choice I'll

1334
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:19,160
certainly say that this is a horror movie though is it I don't know well he's Halloween reboot

1335
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:26,920
trilogy then I think he's doing a Disneyland movie in isolation and then he's also doing a uh what

1336
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:34,600
should we call it uh exorcist reboot trilogy okay so probably not a scary movie where Walt I don't

1337
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:41,000
think so that's the fight with people and we weird palate cleanser in between the yeah just the

1338
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,680
front like I say he's gonna do his own like saving mr bank's version of the creation of Disneyland

1339
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:56,120
but like I mean I feel like this is seismic ptr news like you're getting the sort of in theory

1340
01:39:56,120 --> 01:40:04,200
prestige drama about the making of the happiest place on earth is Tom Hanks returning good question

1341
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:12,920
no talent attached or talent attached on screen is that Danny McBride's music is this like kind of a

1342
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:19,560
freewheeling cookie Walt do you think that the disease can have Danny McBride play Walt Disney

1343
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:25,720
uh I mean yeah I guess they wouldn't but I would love to see it I would love that we're taking a

1344
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:32,200
more profane approach with I take it yeah oh man righteous gemstones uh meets the creation of

1345
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:36,920
Disneyland they should that's what we're saying be looser with the muppets be looser with your

1346
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:41,960
depictions of wall oh fucking teacups to spin faster make the fucking teacups spin faster

1347
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:48,920
and you get baby Billy to play uh Roy you get oh what is his name I'm liking on his name from

1348
01:40:48,920 --> 01:41:00,200
justified and uh oh yeah uh yeah it's one Roy oh man well yeah that sounds great uh well they

1349
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:09,080
is cw wood or whatever that guy's name will they depict the opening of Disneyland a chaotic opening

1350
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:14,600
day I think that has to be the juice here right that has to be a big part of the movie if not that

1351
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:22,760
could be the whole movie right huh oh one crazy night kind of movie about the opening day of

1352
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:30,360
Disneyland would just be that'd be great Sinatra there yeah you know all the stars are out

1353
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:36,440
yeah that's great yeah well people people tripping out on pig semen or whatever it was

1354
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:46,200
orangutan yeah gonads yeah gonads that's really depict what it's like in the brain of a of a yeah

1355
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:52,440
an orangutan gonad it up uh person on live television yeah exactly so great Tom that's

1356
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:58,840
an excellent film well we'll be there opening day best of luck uh David uh you know there's one more

1357
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:04,040
little bit of business if we think we're done with Muppet Haunted Mansion and you know we've talked

1358
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:09,960
about uh our adorable friends the Muppets but we need to talk about my new adorable friend uh

1359
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:17,560
delivered to me from New York uh carried safely across the country like a mother dinosaur care

1360
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:22,600
being careful with the egg i'm talking about baby aladar that's where we left things with you

1361
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:30,040
Griffin right in the last episode uh you uh you delivered uh my beloved baby aladar to me

1362
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:36,280
your second son yes yeah yeah you know it was sooner than i thought but you know what when a

1363
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:46,520
miracle lands at your door you just adjust uh um i so um i i have him here and maybe uh um i you

1364
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:54,040
know if he's not feeling too shy maybe he'd want to say a little something um now so so here's here's

1365
01:42:54,040 --> 01:43:00,040
uh what i have to say about it he uh i made this choice i did take him out of the box because you

1366
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:05,000
brought me a pristine still in the box and i'm talking to major toy people here so i don't know

1367
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:10,680
if i made a big error by by doing that but i felt like it's personal preference yeah uh i mean

1368
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:16,040
because i wanted to i wanted to get my hands dirty i wanted to get get my hands on on the little guy

1369
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:23,000
um as matt gordon says you let him breathe yeah let the pigs breathe yeah yeah yeah yeah that's

1370
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:29,960
right well that's one thing is that he uh i think he does need that because uh here i'll pull him

1371
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:36,520
up right now uh he is uh extremely sticky it is just one of the stickiest items

1372
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:45,160
i have ever held it is a truly alarming amount of perma perspiration all over the sky

1373
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:52,120
um it's a really a strange a very strange sensation uh which is one of the things that

1374
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:57,640
will be explained because not only did i uh take him out of the box i also did an unboxing video

1375
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:01,480
so that will be available on our social media

1376
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:10,920
soon i think it's some very very important content uh but um let me let me give it a shot here and

1377
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:18,840
put in these batteries and let's see if he will make some of his wonderful very cute sounds

1378
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:26,920
very you can you can very cute you can kind of hard activate it by pressing this little nub

1379
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:31,960
between his legs uh that's not showing up well with the virtual background um but there's a

1380
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:37,240
just a little little nub down on his nether parts oh yeah if i press that i think he'll make

1381
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:39,480
his uh iconic noise let's give it a shot

1382
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:49,240
fairly oh there he goes again see now he's just going so i don't know when he's gonna

1383
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:55,160
do anything or not um so that's that's the sweet sounds of aladar

1384
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:03,640
it's kind of the mouths of babes it's kind of just an elephant right it sounds to me

1385
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:10,360
i i say this without speaking from personal experience that is what i imagine it would

1386
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:16,920
sound like if you stomped on someone's throat that is the sound that would come out if you full force

1387
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:19,960
oh

1388
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:27,640
maybe the last noise that is left of a person's voice there you go did you hear that one whoa what

1389
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:35,960
did he say he said time for a snooze oh jason amen brother right there with you you guys are

1390
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:42,280
gonna get along famously um yeah he he screams a bunch of times in a row and then it's time for

1391
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:47,560
a snooze now there's what maybe a way to get him to see there are other sound this is mainly what

1392
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:53,080
i've heard but there's a way to get him to make other sounds which is if you put this little plant

1393
01:45:53,720 --> 01:46:01,000
in his mouth he loves the leafy green those leafy greens he's he's vegetarian um and you gotta

1394
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:06,360
what i found is like so the idea is you stick this little green plant in his mouth and then he talks

1395
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:11,480
but that wasn't working so great for me so i ended up finding i had to like shove my finger

1396
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:19,080
into his mouth and kind of like press up on the top just like force my my finger um and that that

1397
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:25,000
got him talking a little more but i'll try it with the plant we'll try the more ginger version um

1398
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:31,720
so i'm just kind of shoving it there if you can hear those little and nothing as predicted nothing

1399
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:39,720
um now i'll try the other method which is jamming my thumb um he has he does have little teeth too

1400
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:46,040
i don't maybe nothing you can see the effort i'm putting oh yeah really trying to lodge the

1401
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:52,120
thumb in there which worked once and maybe isn't now um what has a whole rigor oh go ahead i was

1402
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:54,600
just saying what happens if you just give him a little kiss on the mouth

1403
01:46:57,400 --> 01:47:01,320
pull it down right yeah kiss that son right on the mouth i will but now don't

1404
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:07,880
do anyone take a screen capture well this is hard with uh you might want to stick your tongue out

1405
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:10,680
a little because you want to make sure it activates the button in the back of his throat

1406
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:16,120
it could very good point griffin i need to so you're saying i need to stick my tongue really

1407
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:21,880
deep down yeah you have to you have to give this baby's throat you have to give yourself a dinosaur

1408
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:33,240
yeah i hang on now i i'm tempted to do this but it i don't know what disease i'm gonna get from

1409
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:40,040
doing that i don't know doing it is okay to be just a nice sticky kiss it's so sticky in there

1410
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:45,480
is it sticky inside yeah i just checked it's very sticky if you'll give me a second to clean the

1411
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:51,240
thing then sure i'll tongue it all day no jason's got a call back we got a call back he has a call

1412
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:56,760
back i've been worried about jason of course i would if it weren't for jason's call back

1413
01:47:56,760 --> 01:48:00,120
no i'm saying i'm saying we don't have time to clean it i think you just got to do the

1414
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:07,800
kiss yeah steps on dinosaur caught off guard i stepped in take a fucking screenshot i'm ready

1415
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:14,200
i've been ready you can't really showing up i'm taking the green screen is is killing it yeah

1416
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:21,880
it's not now hold it hold it hold it hold it got it okay great all right so look for that content

1417
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:26,200
on the search the tongue's not going to do it if the finger didn't do it here let me keep let me

1418
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:30,600
try the finger more this is like when tom brady the first person he hugged was papa john

1419
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:37,320
he had three what the super bowl that what why is it like that like papa jen gave a big kid like

1420
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:42,280
it was very like a very intimate embrace and that was the very first burst but baby eladar is not

1421
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:49,320
like papa john so i just mean in terms of intimacy equally i think these are two entities i'd

1422
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:55,960
equally rather i i don't want to scare you scott but there's a story i know about a mild man

1423
01:48:56,520 --> 01:49:04,600
good boy who had had a little a new little thing to tend to a new little life to take care of

1424
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:10,120
he tried feeding it plant food but very soon the plant food stopped working so then he had to feed

1425
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:15,160
it little nibbles of its finger but then that didn't work until that creature demanded blood

1426
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:22,680
full human meat it's a story of little shop of horrors and i wonder if this game of this game of

1427
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:27,880
escalation of aladar refusing to get triggered until you find more and more things to put down

1428
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:36,040
his throat might have a very unseemly end and then he's gonna get a giant you mean that this little

1429
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:46,120
thing is gonna become a giant thing in a regular sized room is that where this is heading he's gonna

1430
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:52,520
get even stickier too as you told that entire story i've been holding down on his finger on his

1431
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:58,520
button nub because i didn't want him to interrupt you with a so and it's starting to hurt i gotta

1432
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:03,240
let it go like i'm just gonna he's gonna talk okay that's fine there we go and now i'll try

1433
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:12,120
