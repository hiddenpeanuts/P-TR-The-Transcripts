1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,040
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,840
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:32,280
Some episodes and topics we pour over a little bit and we say, oh, is this the right time

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,280
or is there a better way to do that or is there a better guest for it or you know, like

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,460
how can we position that the best and you know, and we mull them over and make sure

6
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,560
that they get ripe and what have you.

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:51,200
Some topics are a text that are sent and we go, yep, put it in and there we are.

8
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,680
Sometimes it's just got to go straight wordlessly from episode to topic and I'm thrilled that

9
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,000
that is what has happened here.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,840
I'm Scott Gardner, Jason Sheridan's over there and I am crediting Mike Carlson with a, that's

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,720
a grand slam out of the park with what you've texted us, which is what we're talking about.

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
Not dummy-related.

13
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:20,680
Yes, yeah, no, those are bunts that get caught and there's an out immediately.

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,400
This one to me, I mean, as soon as I actually, it took me actually watching it and maybe

15
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,240
it will for the listener too, but as soon as I saw any of it, I was like, oh yeah, alright,

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,240
here we go.

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,440
Yeah, we got a weird one.

18
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,160
This is a weird one.

19
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,120
It was something that just popped up because I've talked about this before, I don't really

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:46,680
use Facebook other than to just be a member of various different groups on it and I don't

21
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,920
even know if I'm part, there was a Back to the Future group and for whatever reason,

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,800
this just popped up and was suggested to me.

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,940
This wasn't even in like, it wasn't from, I assume it was like a YouTube algorithm theme

24
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,940
park stuff.

25
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,040
Maybe it's on some level, but it was just Back to the Future fans.

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,200
It was not theme park related and they were just saying, hey, there's like a Back to the

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,440
Future ride you should be aware of and that's really what it was.

28
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,640
Like Back to the Future, the ride is back, whoa, slow down.

29
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,240
Let me also say, if you are confused by what you're looking at, if you're looking at the

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:26,920
title of this episode, we haven't lost our minds, we didn't let AI write a title, this

31
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:38,760
is the actual name of a ride that exists and the name of the ride is, we are back, kids

32
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,600
from the future.

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,220
We are back, kids from the future, written in English on the sign.

34
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,420
In the Back to the Future font.

35
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,300
It's hypnotic, I've been saying it over and over to myself like a mantra, like maybe this

36
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,020
is my, I've been learning about, I was like, when David Lynch died, I was like, what actually

37
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,120
is Transcendental Meditation and will they give you a word and that is that you focus

38
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
on that word?

39
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,260
I'm like, maybe this is it for me, maybe there'll be inner peace if I just keep saying, we are

40
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,820
back, kids from the future.

41
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:13,100
We are back, not we're back, we are back, we are back, kids from the future is the name

42
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,620
of a ride.

43
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,420
It's like a poem.

44
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,500
Folks it's time to return to movie land.

45
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Hooray!

46
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Hooray!

47
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:29,580
So happy about, let's, so broader context here and maybe especially for newer listeners

48
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,900
because here we're referring to something that is five years old.

49
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,700
I remain very fond of the series that we did, Podcast the Red's European Vacation.

50
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:46,740
I thought we found so much interesting oddity and places that we may never go but that are

51
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:55,140
so fascinating to learn about and the euro of it all really appealed to me and honestly

52
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,260
this part might be one of my favorite things we've ever talked about.

53
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,700
I'm still, I can't speak to the quality of the episode but in terms of things I still

54
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,700
think about a lot.

55
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,140
It is that movie land, this was, I re-listened to some of the episode just to like remember

56
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,140
what we said and one thing that happened is that I said everyone say out loud what you

57
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,940
think the name of the park is and we all said different things because again what did you

58
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,940
just say?

59
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,020
Well I said movie land.

60
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,540
That's for sure.

61
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:41,140
The URL is canavaworld.it Yes, because it's part of like some broader kind of like family

62
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,140
of things infrastructure.

63
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:47,660
Vacation place in a place called Lake Garda but I've, sometimes it's movie land studios,

64
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,420
I've seen it as movie land the Hollywood park but we actually did all say different things.

65
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,460
That's how strange their branding is.

66
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,900
It opened in 2002 and it's yeah it's like a general tourist area, I don't know what part

67
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:08,420
of Italy, I don't know it well enough but broad strokes here, this park is just a full

68
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:15,380
tilt ripoff of Universal Studios at every turn from the outside, from the gate, ride

69
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,900
by ride, the characters who appear in it, the music that you hear, there is a fully

70
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,900
functioning knockoff of Universal Studios and it's not one of those things like oh in

71
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,940
China there's this weird decaying fake magic kingdom.

72
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:39,540
It's not that, it's open successful new rides, ride through videos, you know around the clock

73
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:46,180
this place is up and running that is a 100% knockoff, it's like the asylum studios of

74
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,740
parks.

75
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,300
It's so crazy.

76
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:56,900
It's right, it's like Doc Brown interacting with Spider-Man and interacting with I don't

77
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,740
know like not Lucille Ball but like.

78
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,740
Maybe.

79
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,740
Maybe Charlie.

80
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,740
They just don't call her that.

81
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,740
Right.

82
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,740
Yeah.

83
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,740
It feels like Hollywood.

84
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,740
Red haired glam queen, get out there.

85
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,700
It feels like Hollywood Boulevard where it's like there's Snoopy and Captain Jack Sparrow

86
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,340
together like just a mix of characters.

87
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,340
Maybe with costumes that aren't of the best care.

88
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,220
Intellectual property is not really concerned at this park.

89
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:26,740
Also artificial intelligence might be building some of this website now because these jumping

90
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,700
kids don't look quite right.

91
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,740
How many fingers on the jumping kids, that's always a tell of the AI.

92
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,740
Are we in a Willy Wonka touring show, Glasgow situation.

93
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:41,060
The fingers appear to be right but some of them are kind of fucked up looking.

94
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,740
Of course they do AI art for their website, of course.

95
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,140
Because that's the whole thing.

96
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:51,060
It's like and I said this in the episode that it's all using the right lenses you could

97
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:57,140
take photos that make it look like Universal Studios but if it's just unadorned YouTube

98
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:02,780
video it's just obvious like the materials of this are weird and it's all jammed together

99
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,660
and I surprised myself.

100
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,540
I heard myself say that they have a lights motors action show but that's like built into

101
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:15,140
an alley that's like a dangerous amount of space for cars to be doing stunts in front

102
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,140
of you.

103
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:23,140
Well a big thing we honed in on was the motor, the boat, the giant boat you could all get

104
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,140
in.

105
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,140
Yes.

106
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:32,140
That takes you into what is clearly the arena of a water world ripoff show that they don't

107
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,740
use anymore.

108
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,300
And that is a Knight Rider thing that's a boat.

109
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,660
So there's also a lot of like mashups of IP.

110
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,420
Well I have some good news.

111
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,780
It seems I've found some new stuff before we get to we're back.

112
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,780
Oh good.

113
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,780
We are back.

114
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,780
We are back.

115
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,780
We are back.

116
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,660
The Horror House.

117
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,660
The Horror House.

118
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,860
The haunted house.

119
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:00,420
If you remember all the creature, all the like your favorite horror icons were there

120
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,460
has been updated.

121
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,920
And now it's the Horror House presents Holmes Hotel.

122
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
That's right.

123
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,540
H.H. Holmes.

124
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,540
What?

125
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,540
It's an H.H. Holmes Hotel.

126
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,560
Did you create this from your own imagination?

127
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,800
Do we have some listeners?

128
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,840
That's what you're that's one of your guys H.H. Holmes.

129
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,840
That's one of my guys.

130
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,280
You know I was talking about that.

131
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,400
I believe he is he was caught in Philadelphia I believe buried in Delaware County.

132
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Wow.

133
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
You're a local hero.

134
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
You meet H.H. Holmes in Italy?

135
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,760
I think the heart needs to like oh this is like his haunted this is murder hotel that

136
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,320
he built in Chicago.

137
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
Wow.

138
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,520
To be fair to this place that seems kind of good.

139
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,880
Yeah that does seem cool.

140
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:53,240
The thing that confused me was this show just called USA Army Stunt Show and the tagline

141
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,920
is I am coming to get you.

142
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,480
The brand name is the US Army Stunt Show.

143
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,680
I am coming to get you.

144
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,760
That's a threat.

145
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,880
It's a stunt show.

146
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,160
That's a threat.

147
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,880
That's the wall up on the that's on the receiving end of that is Greenland.

148
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Yeah.

149
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
Right.

150
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
Canada and Greenland.

151
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
Oh yeah.

152
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,880
Canada too.

153
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
Yeah.

154
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:25,400
I you know it's a it's nice that I like that we've done so many of these episodes and some

155
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,520
of them are so long ago that I forget about them and it so to be re-listening and not

156
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,060
knowing what was coming around the corner and to hear because they also have a rip off

157
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:43,320
Hard Rock Cafe and that I loved like it's me talking but I don't remember what's coming

158
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,080
and what it was was I was it was like that they have like Rolling Stones ribs and stuff

159
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:52,960
right but then it gets then it gets to still makes me laugh so much.

160
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:02,640
Jackson Sandwich oh yeah yeah yeah yeah they have Jackson Sandwich there and what was that

161
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,800
I don't remember I remember what was in a Jackson I should I still have my I have all

162
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,920
my old notes and I should try to find it actually but the thing I the thing that you know go

163
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:18,760
re-learning about movie land the Hollywood Park made me realize like oh my god it's been

164
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:26,560
five years all those European parks might have new attractions yeah yeah even the good

165
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,320
one like Efteling redid that whole like haunted castle thing they had oh right right did we

166
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,880
find this because you did you found this like flash dance show you like put that was when

167
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:45,520
we were doing a sort of grab bag of shows yeah yeah that might have been the first time

168
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,400
we talked about it yeah yeah wait a minute now oh my god look I'm glad I checked the note do

169
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:57,880
you also does anyone remember Dakota stick no Dakota stick is a weird like corn dog looks like

170
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,400
a sausage with a roll at the bottom and then a little bit of stick coming out of the top that

171
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:10,080
looks like something it's going into your your your eat through it so it's scary and but then

172
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:16,760
also my notes are showing me I have no further information about Jackson sandwich but I wait

173
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,200
Jackson's I don't know Jackson sandwich has like they just like hard-boiled eggs in it that's

174
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,840
Jackson sandwich you see an egg salad sandwich oh yeah I got some pizzas there with all the hippo

175
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:36,080
gorilla yes that's right it's all animals that don't match the what the meat is it's so crazy

176
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,520
but yeah ripoff hemisphere dancer it's everything this place is just meant for us it's so crazy

177
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:53,280
rock and roll restaurant the margaritaville is called margaritas now my notes have really

178
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,320
thrown me for a loop because they've shown me that there already was kind of a ripoff back to

179
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:04,000
the future in a ride called magma 2.0 maybe I think it's called magma 2.0 still going strong

180
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,480
it has it is okay okay because apparently the pre-show of that is a yes yes okay so they still

181
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:16,400
have something with Doc Brown but that's not about time travel but they do now have thank

182
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:22,880
God a more fully committed ripoff back to the future ride but a little bit of story to share

183
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,560
there too I think that when we did this episode five years ago what they had maybe this had

184
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:37,160
initially it was something called Terminator 5d yeah which then became a weird melded game

185
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:43,640
attraction where a bunch of robots pop up and you blast them with lasers right and then it became

186
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:51,080
a Transformers ripoff called Android the final 3d battle and that from what I could tell has all the

187
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,680
same stuff that like it has the like part where you get whipped through the office building that

188
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:03,520
happens but it but it was also still kind of a Terminator ripoff because Terminator type robots

189
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,680
would pop up out of the ground and there were real flames in the room which is kind of cool but I

190
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,000
also don't really trust this place with flames no that's very alarming there's still some Terminator

191
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,960
stuff on the walls in the main show area too yes on the way out yeah there was a low when I was

192
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,880
watching it I was like oh look it's the Institute of Future Technology logo and then I thought no

193
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:31,560
that's cyberdine yeah that is yeah just kept it up this place rules sorry I I we don't have time

194
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:38,640
to get into the possibly unlicensed asterix and obelisk or the Fred Flintstone in the wrong

195
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:50,640
colors what but I have to say the ice cream place called ice stone creamery I ran into that late

196
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:56,640
it was late last night of the night before and I was laughing like a maniac to myself that Fred

197
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:03,360
is this horrible he's so huge he's either a messed up Fred or a messed up Barney either of them are

198
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,040
messed up he looks like you took a picture of Fred Flintstone yeah clone like stamped the or water

199
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,280
there bucketed the color wrong and then stretch it from a hundred percent to five hundred percent

200
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:21,480
with super stretch Fred Flintstone I yeah imagine a miniature golf obstacle and then make it much

201
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:31,160
bigger and put it on someone so anyways there is so they had this space that had it was it was kind

202
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,520
of a Terminator 2 3d ripoff and kind of a Transformers ripoff but also there was a chappy on the top and

203
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,040
then I was the ride was really hard to parse because it's all in Italian and that parts not

204
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,760
subtitled but I was like did they have Mike's favorite thing the moment of intimacy does it

205
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,640
have the I'm proud of you right from its prime moment and it does there is a part where a robot

206
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:57,160
at the end means down and talks to you and the thing that we say at the end of the club 3 your

207
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:04,680
bravery saved the planet but here a robot you don't know leans down and says good work guys

208
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:11,800
thanks to you the core is safe humans will have a future after all okay do you get anything from

209
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:20,600
that that a moment if it doesn't have the warmth of Peter Cullen I don't know but it's I like it I

210
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,400
like it's there yeah yeah at least they were if they're gonna do a beat-by-beat ripoff transformers

211
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:33,760
yeah that's an important part I'm impressed that they did it um but that was I guess I guess the

212
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,520
time for Android the final 3d battle had passed and they needed to step into the future with a

213
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:46,200
whole new concept we are back kids from the future yeah and I don't have myself but my big

214
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:55,200
question is can someone tell me what the hell is going on oh yes I think we will try I've never

215
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:01,520
been more confused with something that is so much exposition this might be I think we've always

216
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:09,520
reveled in sheer volumes of exposition and we were so delighted in a very genuine way I think our

217
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:15,120
feelings about the avatar flight of passage pre-show and the great David Danipour are very

218
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,960
clear like big info dumps can be extremely fun this might be the biggest one ever yeah it's much

219
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:28,920
longer than I think I understand it but it's a lot it's a lot and here's what I'm I hate to just

220
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:36,600
come in and say this is the order we must do it in but I feel that we should proceed in ride

221
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:45,600
reveal order and here's why because what this ride does is make some great leaps forward in terms of

222
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,280
the back to the future mythology yeah yeah he makes some assertions about what is now in the

223
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:58,200
world of these films bigger than now I don't keep up I don't know what the comic books are that Bob

224
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,560
Gale is doing I'm not familiar with the video games there might be like you know astounding

225
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:09,600
expansions of the world that would blow my mind but to me you know rides count the most right and

226
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,840
what this ride what movie land in Italy has declared is now part of the back to the future

227
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:22,720
franchise I'm blown away by and I give them a lot of credit yeah they took a big swing or many big

228
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,240
swings here and I applaud it yeah because we do like new mythology coming from a ride we've

229
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,280
always said that I think yes yeah it's the only ones I know I don't know you look I you guys like

230
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:40,120
comics to me it just doesn't get there's something about like the the visibility of the ride that

231
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,640
like because it's kind of where it's gonna like live in the public's hearts the most so if you say

232
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,880
guess what this now I think it counts more than anything yes and also yes you know depending on

233
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,520
choose your own choose your own mythology for a lot of this stuff now and when rides mean a lot

234
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:02,840
to you so you know that's why that's this is now canon in your back to the future is yeah and it's

235
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:08,880
and back to the future more than a lot you know it's a franchise with a hard cap on it this is not

236
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,560
how they do things anymore it's becoming a real relic the fact that it actually ended when the

237
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:19,920
creators of the franchise thought it should be ended and while that was great for everyone and

238
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:27,240
everything and we haven't had some fucking nightmare new CGI back to the future it does

239
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:35,600
yeah yes we are waiting on two people and that will be that but or if he's like if he's bummed

240
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,920
enough about how here went over maybe there's yeah start changing I think there's like certain

241
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,120
things a couple other movies you would sequel before yeah there's that's good news I think I

242
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:55,360
hope so Marwin too maybe welcome back to Marwin Pinocchio too but I was saying it does you know

243
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,400
unlike so many things that have added all of this like back to the future does end in 1990 and it

244
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:10,520
ends with Doc and Clara and but not anymore not anymore it's 2025 and everything has changed I

245
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:18,200
believe it ends with Doc and Clara and Jules and Vern and Einstein the dog doesn't it that's true

246
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,360
where we literally end is that way I mean look Marty and Jennifer are gonna go do what they're

247
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,200
gonna do but they're probably not gonna time travel anymore it depends on how much you want

248
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,440
to count the animated series as anything but you're right who's in the time vehicle is Doc

249
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:40,000
and Clara and Einstein and it's Jules and Vern very interesting and Jules and Vern have always

250
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,720
I guess been the key to is there more to the story yeah there was a cartoon that's what you

251
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,240
said yes cartoon that yep they are now like precocious little kids who sound like Tommy

252
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,920
Pickles and like all the kid voices all the time yeah and I don't really care for that I think

253
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,840
that's an ugly looking show looking show yeah don't I've never engaged with despite it having

254
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,240
extra Doc Brown shot by Peyton Reed it's still even that it's not really of interest did you

255
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,080
watch it as a kid no oh really I might have I think my back to the future fandom came later

256
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,880
like I was like 10 show was not I watched it I don't have any memory really of it but I also

257
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,800
think I really liked back to the future when I was a little older yeah yeah yeah that's where it

258
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:27,280
really came together for me but I guess like with the animated series is kind of like I had the

259
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,920
Burger King or McDonald's toys yeah I had Marty right those were cool those were cool yeah I you

260
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:40,040
know I joked I think I understand what's happening in this ride there was just so much of it by the

261
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:47,440
end oh yeah it's just like an assault it's but a very slow paced assault I know they aren't they

262
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:55,640
are not rushing through no that's for sure and there are some long shots it's five minutes of

263
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:04,200
content with one shot there are some moments like when you are shooting something in front of the

264
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:12,680
camera behind the camera you often will you know keep going what you're doing or like you paw like

265
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:19,920
something for the editors to cut around you know sure and this they left it all on the screen straight

266
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:26,680
yeah yeah but so you know if the key to expanding back to the future has been Jules and Vern maybe

267
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:34,080
this is why the door has been closed because this is a key that no one wants to use Jules and Vern

268
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:41,880
are not enticing to anyone I don't think maybe the animated show kind of got the job done but I for

269
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:48,280
one don't want to know anything more about Jules and Vern the children being raised in the Old West

270
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:55,960
in their starchy coats and I guess mainly I'm saying this because the children who were cast

271
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:05,560
in the film are the casting of those kids was the worst decision in the entire trilogy this is it is

272
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:11,960
a fumble right at the lot like it is it's a fumble at the one yard line they're almost out

273
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,400
perfect and then what the nice feelings that you're supposed to have at the end of three

274
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,840
wonderful inventive movies are it's all a little bit hurt by that like two of the weirdest little

275
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:29,320
froggiest little kids ever come out and one of them points at his wiener during the lesson of

276
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:35,680
the entire trilogy this weird we all know about this right yeah yeah this kid if you watch it bad

277
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,120
like it's but you know Doc bends down and the shots about him but the kid looks into camera and

278
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:47,800
points at his pants and it's the and he looks like he looks like a psycho he looks like he's

279
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,360
gonna go Chucky he's gonna leap up and start biting Christopher Lloyd's neck this isn't the

280
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:00,640
scariest shit ever so maybe there's not been a strong desire to like do the continuing adventures

281
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:09,600
of Jules and Vern yeah until now because we enter not the Institute of Future Technology but a new

282
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:18,400
related place Dr. Brown and Sons Enterprises and you immediately go okay well son like we are back

283
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,280
kids from the future of course it is it is Jules and Vern and then so you're going through the

284
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,520
hallway you see posters of an off-brand Doc Brown another episode that we did and then you're you're

285
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,520
going it's you know much like the ride you're trying to find like a lab you know to go get

286
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:43,640
more information interesting that this hallway kind of resembles an Instagram photo zone yes yes

287
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:51,560
it absolutely does oh it's got a selfie area with like a fake like green wall you have to have again

288
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,800
like I always say but the milkshake like a milkshake with rice Krispy Kreme on top that's gonna break

289
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:02,280
the internet if whoa how'd you get a picture in front of a neon sign and grass on a wall

290
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:10,520
grass on the ground not on a wall yeah Scott you forget the six years ago world of 2019 was a more

291
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:19,160
simple optimistic place you know experimenting we use the filters more we hadn't pivoted to video

292
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:26,720
you see um but yeah isn't it it's so cheapo it's so it's exactly what I'm illustrating about like

293
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,040
it's like technically it kind of has some of the feel of the back to the future ride but also it

294
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,800
kind of feels like you're like like walking through a doctor's office yeah it definitely yes it looks

295
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:43,400
like you're like a trendy like West Hollywood coffee shop or something that's what you're the

296
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:49,240
future technology yeah you're going to a bathroom you had to borrow a key to go to the bathroom in

297
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,880
a weird like where there's like yeah there's a boutique over here an expensive coffee place

298
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,120
over here and you got to get close to people's offices right to use the bathroom yeah I don't

299
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,920
that's what this queue feels like baffling choice really weird really weird there's like kind of

300
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,560
weird plants stuck on the other side of the hallway that like maybe you could like oh it's

301
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:13,320
an experiment or it's giving fresh oxygen oxygen or something but this clearly like the astroturf

302
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:20,120
wall is an instagram thing why would the why would Jules and Vern need that I don't know anyway

303
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:26,680
then you meet so then sure enough they introduce themselves I'm Dr. Jules Dr. Jules Brown

304
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:35,720
Vern Brown it hurts my brain to put brown after them yeah um and they so again immediately

305
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,680
important mythology they are they've followed in their father's footsteps they've gone into business

306
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,640
with it they too are time travel scientists and they still wear starchy coats I guess their

307
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:52,200
base of operations stayed in the old west I guess so but they can talk to us now using video and

308
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:58,200
they're what in their late 20s early 30s ish maybe I don't know for sure but they look like

309
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,880
they're in that zone yeah I think so yeah so they are grown so we are yes the kids from the future

310
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:10,840
have grown they are so that's interesting right away to see Jules and Vern at uh kind of Marty's

311
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,920
age or well I'm not quite I guess I don't know whatever uh but so they uh talk about their

312
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,800
experiments and stuff you kind of catch that one's like more straight-laced and one is kooky

313
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:29,560
yeah so they've divided that way they're not um going too hard either way on the delivery

314
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:35,000
of their dialogue it's accurate I'd say yeah I you're kind of you're sussing out those straight

315
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,520
laced and kooky based on one is glasses and one has a kind of a head cap thing I don't know how

316
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:49,800
to describe it accurate yes yes um this is all in Italian yeah and that kind of makes me I'm

317
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,880
actually like tracking I know that it's because it's a park in Italy but I'm also like you know

318
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,600
what maybe this is kind of cool like doc if you're time traveling parents like doc and Clara you can

319
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:05,400
raise your children anywhere and in any time so I choose to think that these boys were raised in

320
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,400
renaissance Italy oh interesting that's what I'm going with them on that and I think that is what

321
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,600
doc and Clara would do right uh you know wouldn't doc go try to get a hold of

322
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,120
DaVinci or something right yeah go try to be his friend freak DaVinci out yeah yeah

323
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,400
well he'd be quite cool he knows he doesn't want to cause a space-time continuum disturbance

324
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,800
so yeah that's what I think I think Leonardo DaVinci was like a babysitter for Jules and

325
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:37,560
Byrne and that helped that's smart yeah that's good yeah yeah could you imagine if like a

326
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:43,800
mid-century scientist like an archaeologist met like Archimedes or something or

327
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:50,520
you know they had the right kind of dial to go meet him yeah this would be everybody would

328
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:56,040
lose their minds probably not saying the right philosopher or mathematician we just don't know

329
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,680
what you're talking about yeah wait are you referencing I was referencing dial of Indiana

330
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,080
Jones oh there's your problem I never watched that fucking movie I watched it but I forgot

331
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:11,480
they eventually end up back in time spoiler alert oh oh yeah that is this wait yeah people

332
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:17,960
told I don't know I never saw it that sounds bad um so uh I was almost I was almost going like

333
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,760
is this is this like Peabody and Sherman what's he talking about um well yes I've just proven I

334
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:29,960
never saw that film I only I watched it a few months ago I finally finally uh caved and watched

335
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,640
it too and I was like I have been looking at this de-aged Harrison for yeah oh they get so

336
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,880
cocky with it it does work it definitely works and then you're 40 minutes in and you're like

337
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,840
doesn't work that well there's a reason why TV shows only do this for a scene at a time

338
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:50,440
they got so cocky about it and then they flash a flashlight on it in the dark and it's just like

339
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,160
the flashlights on and you're like why are you showing me the detail on this yeah don't you're

340
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:01,160
you're pushing your luck I know um so they explain why the lab is open to us the theme park

341
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:07,080
goers because they are opening a new era of tourism uh you where you can be part of the

342
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,600
greatest historical events and I'm parsing all of this via Italian video with um English subtitles

343
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:18,280
uh they have a new thing it's not a passenger DeLorean it's the time shuttle they invented the

344
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:24,520
time shuttle and it's interesting when you get in to the the the final room and see that the

345
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:31,720
time shuttle is a a bunch of fucking chairs it's the chairs in a big room it's just a very

346
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:37,800
it's very innovative all right the shuttle could be also a room the shuttle could be all room

347
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:45,160
yeah why not honestly it kind of reminded me of the massive factor ride you did not make it on

348
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:51,960
in great America oh that's right yeah that was big well I did get into the room the ride was

349
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,680
shut down once in the room okay yeah it was one of those where yeah you're you just have to go

350
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:02,920
with them that like it's 500 little vehicles and there's an actor yes they're doing a little bit

351
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:09,320
of sneaky business we do get we do get a stage actor who interacts with the film uh so they say

352
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,680
that we've invented the time shuttle and we will make our father's dream come true great scott

353
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,200
which is what the subtitles say but what they actually say out loud is like grande jove

354
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,240
they had to translate great scott

355
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,360
so then I don't want to just I don't want to do a recitation but then they say just a they say a

356
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,080
bunch of shit you don't need they talk for so long they're talking in front of a robotic arm

357
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:45,160
yeah they start going the lab set up some extras in there yeah they talk to some scientists and

358
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:51,000
then they pause for a while but there are like yeah they like like take a breath they like

359
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,920
collect themselves remember their lines they like keep patting the like good job

360
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:02,120
and then it freezes and it cuts to another shot just watching what they're doing keep it up

361
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:09,640
no notes they it's all nonsense too like we're solving the mathematical equation which allows

362
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:18,120
to split the impulses in the quantum tubes oh wow jules and verne you've really made something

363
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:25,320
of yourselves um then one some of this is just somebody didn't have good eyes on these translations

364
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,680
because what does this mean somebody comes in with a little bit of panic doctor electrolyte

365
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:38,280
is already reacting to electric shocks under one gigawatt electrolyte is that's not capitalized

366
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,920
that's not a person or a robot or anything doctor electrolyte is electing reacting to electric

367
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:50,360
shocks this does feel like ai wrote it ai probably did the translation we know from jason's proof

368
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:56,600
that they're in the ai business right yeah i it's just there's a lot of numbers being thrown around

369
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:02,280
and i am like kind of like i am forgetting the back to the few all i can remember is 88 miles

370
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:09,240
per hour but they're talking about the gigawatts and they're like oh we're not using uh hydrogen

371
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:16,040
and lightning like on the train that my father described we are using plutonium when we went

372
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,920
back to it and i'm like well that's one of my favorite they went back that's one of my favorite

373
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:27,640
things is that to be stolen from terrorists the first by the libyans it's plutonium and it's

374
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,360
dangerous and it's you know very dangerous material and then the upgrade of course is doc

375
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,600
so we can just do this out of uh garbage garbage but that wasn't enough for the show oh my god

376
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,760
it's so great and there's a big thing in this they make a big meal out of we're going back to

377
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:47,720
the bad stuff the plutonium this is trump era stuff this back to cool all that shit we did

378
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,240
back to square doing like we did it back scenes out they're building up hollywood they're making

379
00:32:53,400 --> 00:33:00,360
epic again and it's going to be sylvester salone and mil gibson just two dying men two visibly

380
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,080
melting men and it's like they're going to make the movie industry huge again

381
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:11,080
they ran planet hollywood now they're running real hollywood all right yeah they're no we're

382
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,440
saying merry christmas again and we're using plutonium again it's yeah no we all right yeah

383
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,920
we can power things with trash but well they had a reason it was like hydrogen wasn't stable and

384
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:31,080
it causes explosions so we decided to bring back plutonium charge they want plutonium you want

385
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:37,800
plutonium they want nuclear reactions it's going to be better than just like your newspaper that's

386
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:44,440
so good such a funny choice to do that then why do they need to tell us this no it should make

387
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,800
another thing up doc didn't tell us any of this for he told us biff is here but he like i don't

388
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,560
need to know one bit of this to go get jostled around by the no why yeah why why or just like

389
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:01,480
make up a new element they need to get yeah we need a new thing and that's modern rare sure

390
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:09,160
yeah plutonium they also it is from the movie though i suppose and they i guess i yeah they

391
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:15,480
may as well just have used like we have an odd tanium wait a minute yeah yeah well that seems

392
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,800
like what they would do i mean there there's there is a part of this where i was watching

393
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,760
with erin and it cuts to a bunch of rocks and stuff and she said oh so now we're on pandora

394
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:35,080
so it's already it's i think it is almost in the avatar world anyway yeah uh but so yeah this is

395
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,840
maybe the best mishmash part because they also they they explained something i'm forgetting

396
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:44,280
another bit of justification they say our father designed a nuclear fusion system using garbage

397
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,880
that's news to me i thought mr fusion was something from the future that he oh that he took

398
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,600
yeah i didn't think because that's too like nice of a logo how do you like design that and stuff

399
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:00,440
right yeah i thought mr fusion is something that the world uses and he brought it back to us

400
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,240
i don't think yeah you're probably right i don't think doc invented mr fusion but the ride knows

401
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,760
better than i do the ride is the ride's real and i'm not because he didn't get like rich from doing

402
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:17,080
mr fusion or like there was never any oh my god yeah he'd be loaded right you invented a clean

403
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,080
burning you figured out how to make trash run a car right and why wouldn't he live in the future

404
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:27,240
then to reap the rewards made a bunch of money converting trash into gas why the fuck is he

405
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:34,440
helping marty mcfly jr not have to go to a party or whatever the fuck he comes back yeah it is a

406
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:41,320
very utopian idea that like in this set on a larger sense of like look the pizza

407
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,280
pizza you just they're real small and then they get real big you know it's like oh isn't the future

408
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:54,040
gonna be great although hill valley 2015 is kind of like shitty looking it's good yeah yeah but

409
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:01,000
it's a little busted just like 1985 and 1950 well it's kind of accurate to our future right yeah it's

410
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,840
the way like some of it's nice like the way if you go to tokyo you're like wow the future is

411
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,680
incredible and then you go almost anywhere else and you're like wow the future stinks

412
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:16,920
but so uh um something else is going on there oh that's oh sorry i was starting to say our father

413
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,880
designed that but unfortunately it turned out to be inefficient with time travels longer than 100

414
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:29,240
years okay even though in the ride we go to the the pat we go to the dinosaurs yeah but i don't

415
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:34,360
think the ride exists i think in this timeline biff didn't steal the eight passenger delorean

416
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,520
oh you think they're cutting that out from the actual universal ride yeah i think so i think this

417
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,880
is almost maybe entirely because also something else that is not mentioned is marty mcfly right

418
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,840
doesn't matter yeah that is confusing because you would think you would have at least nodded to it

419
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:56,040
in a weird let me say this i saw two comments two people try to claim that this was licensed

420
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,800
how how that's what i think what in the like the because the i mean let's here's one big thing is

421
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:10,440
that they use the font they use the music they use the music yeah throughout but why would it

422
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,480
why would universal i don't know why they just cut like is this just some weird little way to

423
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:21,080
launder money or i well that's what i was trying to figure out i was like is there some weird thing

424
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:26,840
where it's overseas and they sort of quietly take some money because because everybody's like well

425
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,880
why isn't why haven't this been shut down why isn't this everything in the park that is the

426
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,240
question yeah so i want because like marty isn't very active you don't see marty on the original

427
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:43,080
ride very like you don't hear references to him or anything like clips um but i was like i wonder

428
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,480
if there is some weird thing with this it still doesn't make any sense that it would be this

429
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,600
shitty yeah but still i would just it all i'll say is it left like a little question in my head

430
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:58,600
of like yeah that is weird that they're allowed to keep doing it do they just like look the other way

431
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,040
or i don't know it doesn't matter enough to them and they figure well it's not our branding it's

432
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,520
not a universal part so whatever but they also have i mean aren't they building in where are they

433
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:15,080
building there one uh england uh universal yeah right that seems to just get approved they're not

434
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,760
gonna want to i was gonna say it's like a different territory so who cares but if they're

435
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,040
gonna have a park in england they don't want we are back kids from the future you would think it

436
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:29,320
would be easy to stop we are back kids from the future if you were universal that it would be

437
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:35,000
pretty quick to get a lawyer on the phone and go you have to shut down we are back wait keep going

438
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,640
so you have to shut down we are back kids from the future immediately there's a problem i know

439
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:45,160
you're confused when i could it just be yeah what if it is like they pay a small licensing fee and

440
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:52,200
it's like how actors used to go do commercials in japan because they would uh make a bunch of

441
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:59,880
money and then never seeing them i wonder but it's still it's still not enough like could there be

442
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,960
limits could there be money exchanged and limits be placed some but some of it in the park seems

443
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:12,600
completely like devoid of any iconography or anything related other than just the concept of

444
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:20,920
big robots and then this has the font it's got the delorean it's got music it does say his name

445
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:29,320
what if late garter is some kind of dark zone that is copyright free maybe what if it's like

446
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:34,520
you know in the way like there's the laws don't apply in this part of the ocean yeah it's like

447
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:40,760
maybe there's so it is somehow a copyright dark spot i'm curious that's why this park was built

448
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,280
there well it's not this land of late garter it's not like italy has ever been associated with

449
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:53,720
craft or organized crime or nothing right that's what's happening like oh like oh your lawyers

450
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:59,000
are coming where all our lawyers are paying you a visit as well and then a bunch of mafia dudes

451
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,280
show up at the universal gates and just kind of like put their fist in their hands pow pow

452
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,400
and then they like oh okay whatever you say or a bunch of just a bunch of tommy guns we've got

453
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,760
some lawyers don't you dare try to shut down we are back kids from the future be real shameless

454
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,600
something happened to your globe here just because you got a problem with we are back

455
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,840
kids from the future like you sleep with the fishes for shutting down we are back kids from

456
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:28,600
the future you know you think we're scared of universal lawyers our lawyers are all our cousins

457
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:36,600
if you follow my drift a lot of sylvios if you follow my drift you fuck with we are back kids

458
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:46,200
from the future maybe you won't be back kids from the past so i don't know i just i was like

459
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:53,560
interesting if somebody out there can tell us i somebody knows i wonder if somebody out there

460
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:58,280
somebody obviously has to know but in our audience i mean well i also think that here's

461
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,280
i think somebody i know we have people who work in the people who listen to work in the universal

462
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:08,040
organization sanity if you know a legal if you know someone in the legal department ask them

463
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:15,160
ask if they know because what i don't want to like i want to i'm torn here i i in a way want to

464
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:20,840
protect movie land yes i do i love that it's this wonderful world of ripoffs that exists

465
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:27,560
but wouldn't i'd feel a little bit proud if the history of it became this park operated until

466
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:33,880
podcast the ride told someone about it and then it was sued into the ground i mean but then i'd

467
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:42,440
also kind of feel like uh when bart gets crusty in trouble with the rs yeah like i don't i don't

468
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,600
want to get congratulated for that and then go oh my god now i can't have a dakota stick anymore

469
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:54,200
but we don't see we don't see like the complete disney rip off like this brazenly right now

470
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:02,520
and universal and comcast are a big company they have to know yeah they have somebody has to know

471
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:08,760
they have to have known that there was doc brown on their old ride i think but maybe nobody told

472
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,760
maybe just somehow it's just like don't everybody forgot maybe it's just like yeah

473
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,600
it would cost more to go after them free marketing what are you gonna do

474
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:24,040
maybe anyway you know what all it's gonna do is remind people that there's a better park with

475
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:30,040
the same stuff that's better i do hope they're still doing that streetmasphere show bit uh or

476
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:39,560
little act based on the uh the artist the academy award winning yeah they just had the poster paint

477
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:45,080
at the side of the wall and they were just like doing the charleston and the jitterbug in front

478
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:50,280
of it it looks like movie land also the only place on earth where anyone remembers the artist

479
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:59,720
is that movie that that's french isn't it thanks yeah yeah okay uh oh yeah um uh another interesting

480
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:07,080
thing is that here's why plutonium is because day time shuttle doesn't do 1.21 gigawatts time

481
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:15,560
shuttle does 3.21 oh which that when i heard that that now it's 3.21 gigawatts that felt to me like

482
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:21,880
an indominus rex type i'm like if they did the jurassic world of back to the future that would

483
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:27,800
be one of the things they'd say is like actually for the fans pretty cool because now we're doing

484
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:35,800
3.21 gigawatts and half the fans would go oh that's so fucking cool dude whoa like actually

485
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,720
this thing might be pretty good i there is a bit of that in the first chris pratt movie

486
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:47,560
where the owner goes like i don't care how big and deadly it is the shareholders and the guests

487
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:55,560
demand new attractions and then his helicopter gets fucked up yeah yeah uh um i but that seems

488
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:00,120
doesn't that seem like the kind of like weak ass fan service that we'd expect they'd expect us all

489
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:06,120
the orgasm over yeah they'd reveal that like you'd be at comic con and they would say 3.21

490
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:11,240
on the screen right you're supposed to go yeah it would work but yeah that would happen yeah

491
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,080
would it work on you maybe yeah yeah it was if i was in the room i've said this before

492
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:23,800
if you're ever in those rooms you they'll get you to pop for almost anything you'll get so excited

493
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,400
at the littlest reveal i think you already pop for almost anything me

494
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:35,640
me depends it depends i i did see admittedly i watched the post credit sequence from captain

495
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:43,560
america brave new world and i was just sitting there going who the fuck is he talking to you

496
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:51,000

498
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:08,200
dr jules brown dr jules brown doc brown's son is now the godfather of science jules are we still in

499
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:13,880
the first pre-show room not the second i think but yeah okay i got i know we got it we say we

500
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,680
keep this one short and look at us now uh so uh they they tell you that you know you could with

501
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:24,040
this you could do all kinds of things you could go see the signing of the declaration of independence

502
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:30,520
they spell like that yeah like uh that's the ai uh yeah uh um the yeah the you could be front row

00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:36,440
and the eiffel tower is uh opened um you you will see when your favorite team will win the super bowl

504

505
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,400
supposed to do that you guys know more than anything right you're not supposed to do that

506
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:53,800
um and then uh they say we'll bring you to february 13th 1955 where the first oil wells

507
00:45:53,800 --> 00:46:00,920
were built what why that doesn't come back no it doesn't why did they take us to the first oil

508
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,120
i don't know wait a minute there were oil wells before 1955 what are you talking about they built

509
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:12,760
in hill valley was that like a sea plot is it a poor translation of something else i don't know

510
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:19,320
and they didn't they didn't translate the date right the first oil wells in 1955 what's wrong

511
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:25,240
with this ride i don't know ride is broken um but then you're also going to go to the london expo

512
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:30,600
hold on to that that sounds like nothing but hold on to it london expo uh then they then things

513
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:35,400
start glitching and you gotta go and you don't you don't really know why then you go to another

514
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,080
room and it's them again and now they're in front of the time train they're in front of the train

515
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:44,280
that we saw them on when they were creepy little dick tugging kids and then uh they're talking for

516
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:49,480
a second and then they say something alarming which is that the pressure flow meter which is

517
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:56,120
all one word with no spaces is on red the pressure flow meter is on red and then it cuts out and

518
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:04,600
they're gone and then who appears on screen oh my god but a girl this popped me a young look i don't

519
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:11,080
like to say this stuff it popped me too a new a younger girl appears who we have never seen

520
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:18,200
before she looks a little bit kooky almost like the 2015 back to the future 2 style she's got like

521
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:24,760
a weird little hair uh she's got the vest and a vest she's got marty's marty's vest that's right

522
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:31,480
that actually did i do recognize i was like she's dressed like marty yes it's like well she's kind

523
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:38,520
of like marty jr because it's like like future neon and like like weird up ponytail and and she

524
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:48,120
says am i in am i in but zack are you there zack these who are these funky kids and they explain

525
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:57,720
that they are jesse brown and he is my cousin zack brown zack brown the zack brown i'm zack

526
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:08,760
the unused name zack brown uh and these are jules and verne brown's children we were wrong we are

527
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:14,040
back kids from the future jules and verne weren't the kids not the kids from the future they aren't

528
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:19,240
the kids there's still more kids from the future their kids are from the future their kids are no

529
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:24,760
no no uh well yes we are back from the future but it's our kids our kids are from the future

530
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:32,600
okay we are back doc faints now here's how i interpret this all you walk down a hallway

531
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:38,440
between the first pre-show room the second pre-show room stuff starts to act up i believe

532
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:44,040
there's neon lights on the ceiling between the two rooms and you hear a lot of like

533
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:51,400
like electrical sputtering yeah then you walk into a room what also has a delorean crash through a

534
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:57,560
wall oh right yes there was that yes that is not mentioned for a while is that they take that to

535
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:02,760
get to us okay so we have to watch three more minutes with jules and verne and then they're

536
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:10,280
back to us and i think they came in that delorean that is not mentioned for a while you might be

537
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,840
right that's just you figured it out oh wait the next line i'm looking at is we drove here in our

538
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:22,440
delorean and today brown enterprise's first time travel experiment should take place that's exactly

539
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:27,720
what happened they came here now is the day we have to drive we have to whatever it takes if it

540
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:34,200
takes driving into the building that's what we have to do another thing they say is we know it's hard

541
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:42,120
to believe but we come from 2055 that's when they are from jewel so that and they're cousins so

542
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:46,600
because it's separate they aren't so they aren't brother and sister one is jules right kid and one

543
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:51,560
is verne and the other is verne's kid yeah so cousins kids from the future we are back

544
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:57,880
and they drew they came they came here because the first experiment that's open to the public

545
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:04,760
with the time shuttle um then they proceed to tell you the most shit you've ever heard in your life

546
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:12,280
this goes on and on and on and on and i'm interested in all of it but i think there must

547
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:16,360
have been a way that it didn't have to be so much what are they doing are they covering that line

548
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:21,400
that ride doesn't seem that long no i have to do all this they have like they have diagrams they're

549
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:27,000
drawing on a whiteboard they have picked like documents like there's so much info they show

550
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,280
you a picture of the flux capacitor let me tell you i know i know that i don't know what you are

551
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:40,040
you're zach and jesse brown this whiteboard does not pay off uh no not really not really and

552
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:45,560
here's the other thing about it it is this is also a nod to the films because it shows you the

553
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:50,360
concept of here's a straight line and this is a timeline then this there's this juncture in time

554
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:54,280
where things skew into an alternate timeline and another one is created this is something

555
00:50:54,280 --> 00:51:00,840
that i love when doc brown illustrates this in the future too so they do that again to show you

556
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:07,080
here's where we're from but they put too many dates on it it has more than docs in the movie

557
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:11,240
and you don't need all of them they you kind of understand what's happening from some of the

558
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:17,000
first things they say except not actually though there's a lot this is this becomes a soap opera

559
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,680
at this point yeah this be you know what they could have said i could have saved a lot of money

560
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:29,960
you cut the first pre-show you start with these two they explain what's going on it's half as long

561
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:35,240
you had to do as few there's a kurt vonnegut quote he said people ask him how do you start a book

562
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:42,840
he's like oh that's easy you write 15 pages and you throw the first 10 in the garbage there's

563
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:48,600
your start of the book those five so yeah he should have been consulting on we are back if

564
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:53,080
he was still alive and could have fixed all these problems quick we have to go back and get kurt

565
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:58,200
vonnegut to fix the copy of we are back kids from the future he was at look he shows up and back

566
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:05,720
to school around this time you know he himself is in back to school he says like uh rodney dangerfield

567
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:12,520
had a uh a test on kurt vonnegut and he's like i got a tutor and it's like and it's actually kurt

568
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:17,560
vonnegut maybe i'm did they not he was around they call him that i think i'm so uncultured i don't

569
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:24,120
know about that kurt vonnegut was in it um so uh all right what do they tell i'm i'm going to try

570
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:28,520
to only say what's important but i might i just started writing down every line so forgive me i'm

571
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:33,800
gonna go as fast as i can because i don't just to make can you just read all the lines as fast as

572
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:40,120
you could possibly do it right now well that's not true to the spirit but okay yeah they take their

573
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:45,400
time uh without correct data sent to the electric circuit which receives in turn impulses given by

574
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:50,840
the vehicle speed that 88 miles per hour combined with 1.21 gigawatts of electricity what in physics

575
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,840
is known as the breakdown of the time symmetry which would allow the opening of space time

576
00:52:54,840 --> 00:53:00,520
which can't happen in the mechanism long story now that was probably confusing right but then

577
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:06,200
what it is is that uh uh zach is very mealy-mouthed long-winded jesse comes in and cuts through the

578
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:11,000
clutter so he says all that garbage she comes in and says long story short our parents can make

579
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:20,680
it work but we do great now i got it we have data and technology to solve bugs in the system

580
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:26,520
but it's still a big problem then they get a chart out they now they do the timeline today is the

581
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:30,360
date of the first listeners you're just gonna have to make a chart with us today is the date

582
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:36,600
of the first tourist trip through time so that's this that's 2025 uh on this day our parents did

583
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:43,080
a patrol around in the location we are going to visit using grandpa emmett's train zach and i

584
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:50,680
live here and then went to a year i don't think we didn't know where you live we didn't understand

585
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:56,760
what had happened to our fathers they had simply disappeared so when the red pressure flow meter

586
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:01,160
thing the last we saw jewels and verne that's today that's 2025 and then they disappeared

587
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:06,680
nobody knows what happens they had to come here and they found zach and jesse brown found a letter

588
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:12,760
left by their grandfather doc brown who died when we weren't born yet thanks to this letter we

589
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:17,560
discovered the position of an old garage where we found the remains of an old delorean and the

590
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:23,320
assembles the instructions to reassemble it meanwhile we picked up a signal from the past

591
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:30,120
in our laboratory the message is a distorted sos we had to recode dr jewels and dr verne are stuck

592
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:37,160
to ed in the year 1855 they reached that like don't you live there already what's the fucking

593
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:43,000
problem let them live there that's where they grew up who cares oh here's why because they

594
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,400
reached that date coming from today they they damaged the plutonium tank hitting a group of

595
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:58,760
rocks when they were a group this is family of rocks here's what happened okay let me cut

596
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:04,360
through the clutter i think okay i said earlier i'm sorry i was wrong earlier i referred to

597
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:10,760
they jewels and verne mentioned something called the london expo i think i was wrong that's different

598
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,840
than something else which is the science world congress the science world congress takes place

599
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:26,680
in the year 2030 and that is where on december 8th 2030 jewels and verne the brothers meet their

600
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:33,400
wives yes zach and jesse's mothers mothers and that's how zach and jesse come along

601
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:40,040
in 2030 yes different than the london expo london expo is nothing it didn't need to be said

602
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:47,480
science world congress is where jewels and verne meet separate eligible lady scientists to marry

603
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:53,960
and have children with and this happens in 2030 so if they're stuck in the past in 1855

604
00:55:53,960 --> 00:56:02,040
they can't go forward and make zach and jesse their children so this is now you know what i

605
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:07,240
just realized why this is throwing me off is because zach rito and jess mckenna are oh and

606
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:13,720
i started getting weird at the same time because they're both from saved by the bell oh yeah dude

607
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,920
yeah yeah that too i was like why is this it was i know it was bugging me out in the same way it was

608
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,840
for two different reasons okay i think partly what's happening here i remember reading once

609
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:33,160
about like the way they translate french comic books or japanese manga sometimes is that there

610
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:39,800
is a translator who will write the raw translation of like here's what the story is here's the

611
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:46,520
dialogue and then there's someone who goes through and fine tunes it and changes all the the

612
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:52,280
characters into english language things about different context and that joke makes no sense

613
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:58,680
in this language so it's an equivalent yeah yeah yeah i think maybe what happened here is they

614
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:05,720
didn't do that step where someone fine tunes the translation for the subtitles that uh uh behind

615
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:12,920
the scenes story about my uh ongoing product tiny puppets i used to do it with google translate

616
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:18,360
yeah and then people would say i speak portuguese and this is fucking horseshit and which is fine

617
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:23,560
because whatever it's supposed to be a bad ripoff thing but then i started hiring translators to do

618
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:29,560
it and it got i'd say five percent better then the problem just became my pronunciation which

619
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:36,760
is and will always be dog shit uh my apologies uh so i've experienced this and i do the i think

620
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:45,640
we're in a google translate world or an ai but separate issue here now we're doing the we i won't

621
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:53,400
be born plot of back to the future one right using kids from the future we have been we here meet

622
00:57:53,400 --> 00:58:00,520
zach and jesse make them be born because other characters you don't really know meet at science

623
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:06,680
world congress they have to go there you don't get to go there you have to go where they are

624
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:16,040
to find them so that they can still fuck our moms to make us it's pretty genius i'm gonna say as a

625
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:23,640
back this is like a real stab at what's back to the future four right it's about no it's it's about

626
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:29,400
your moms who we also don't see back the future four is about hooking up

627
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:35,160
our moms i'm just glad i mean look well you know hey the first little i think little verne was

628
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:41,480
horny to begin with well yeah i like skipping over jewels and verne as the real like stars of the

629
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:47,640
movie they're fake yeah they're fake out yeah you know i think i like that too because as i said i

630
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:51,320
don't want to hear more about jewels and verne they're from the past they stuck they're they're

631
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:57,880
creepy little kids i'm glad they do what their dad does but that's not different that's it's all

632
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:05,720
boring until some funky teens show up named jesse and zach and they throw the whole thing they they

633
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:12,360
bring a fresh hip energy that the franchise needs i got i was so excited when their kids showed up

634
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:17,480
i was like oh this is good now we're cooking that's like i remember yes i was like all right and

635
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:22,120
this if you i don't want to see they can make whoever they want jewels and verne but if this

636
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:27,640
is the path do they need to buy the rights to this yes and then this becomes like sydney sweeney

637
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:32,840
uh i don't know i don't i don't got a zach picked out i mean glenn powell these kids look younger

638
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:38,920
than sydney sweeney though these are you gotta get some tiktok stars yes yes i don't know i don't

639
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:44,280
know the young stars in there you might not even know the possible eligible i think the saturation

640
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:50,840
i feel like i have seen some funny like decent short sketches on instagram and tiktok i don't

641
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:56,360
remember any of the accounts but i'm like oh it might be getting saturated so much you start to

642
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:02,920
get some interesting weirdos ah like you end up you end up where you started where you essentially

643
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:09,800
have made like second city ucbio and people just figured out stuff on their own and they end up

644
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:16,280
like moldable anyway oh that's okay that's good all right well let's find the hottest tiktok stars

645
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:24,440
to play the plum rolls yeah of zach and jesse uh i mean i've i think i'm down i think we found her

646
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:31,400
four yeah as long as she's got a funky ponytail this is great sure um let's get bob gale on the

647
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:37,400
phone does he know about does bob gale know yeah that's a good question does he know i would

648
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:44,040
really love to know if he knows he's i mean look is he gettable yeah i think should we get him i

649
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:50,680
think he might know because he has like a google like right anything auto send about right movie

650
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:56,360
he's got to have a cease like a cease and desist ready to go um yeah you'd think yeah yeah because

651
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:03,560
he'd be mad if it wasn't money in his pocket but then isn't it like just to expand like do you think

652
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:11,720
uh like do you end up doing the same stuff like are jules and verne awkward with women is it the way

653
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:16,840
that like george has trouble connecting do you have to then go to 2030 and create the florence

654
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:24,920
nightingale effect to make the mod did like did that also happen like did the did jules and verne

655
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:30,440
get hurt which made two women say we'll take care of you and that's why they fell in love

656
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:36,120
right you're honing in on that but remember it is a thing that young boys do when they're nervous

657
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:41,720
like mike's karaoke holding his crotch oh yes point to your but is it point do they get point

658
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:46,040
to their penis when they're nervous or they put their hand over it i mean i when i was yeah i was

659
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:50,760
just full on put my hand in my pants i would yeah i did a lot of that too yeah yeah but i'm saying

660
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:55,800
pointing it seems different actually it seems more aggressive no it's weirder like right here

661
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:01,800
right here baby like a nerd like a nasty kid like a yeah it's like a nasty kid behavior

662
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:06,760
behavior baby yeah you're saying are you going to see actually the because because in the original

663
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:12,920
back the future it's like you know george that has to that moment where he punches biff has to

664
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:17,960
happen there's no shot you'll ever like george because he's such a loser i think you have to do

665
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:24,200
this but with two characters now who were both on both have women that they're trying to hook up

666
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:32,120
with so wait so zach and jesse have to separately be marty one has to go into one car and try to

667
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:40,440
right hand like get handy with their own mom and then they're not the right yeah but no but if but

668
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:47,960
if jesse's if jesse brown's mom is bi then it's fine then you can do it i don't know the math on

669
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:54,280
wait math on that i don't know the social worries of 2030 jason do you have a good pitch because i

670
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:59,160
have a good pitch i think i have a solve here i don't have a good pitch okay i mean i'm confused

671
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:03,400
myself too but i think you see what i'm saying though i know you're saying jesse brown has to

672
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:08,200
be marty so that means she has to try to fake get handsy with her own mother yeah but she's like

673
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:17,000
14 but marty was marty was yeah but they were the same age yes oh well yeah wait oh wait how well

674
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,120
how old were the moms at the science world congress that's a good question i guess we

675
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:24,520
haven't established that they might have been they might have been 17 i guess that's possible

676
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:32,680
so it's okay if jesse brown's mom is bi and so i see we're gonna need a whiteboard to figure the

677
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:39,640
math on this out let's find one this is we need to figure it out so then so she's pretending to be a

678
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:47,720
butch femme but then we get a femme man and uh is this allowed should we be doing this on this

679
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:55,880
chalkboard uh i was gonna pitch she just builds a robot i'm gonna a handsy robot oh yes she's

680
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:01,080
probably an inventor type this is what kids from the future bring to the table i'm so uncomfortable

681
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:07,320
for marty to have to make moves on his own mother so instead you send a robot to do a rapist's work

682
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:13,000
that's correct so that i think solves all the problems and then you get a fun robot in there

683
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,640
and the robot she'd have to program an evil robot but still well but she'd have to program

684
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:23,800
if the robot hits someone she'd have to program the robot like don't kill them so that'd be a fun

685
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,160
scene in the thing where like the robot like punches through the wall it's like oh tomb was

686
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:31,640
too strong oh yeah yeah no it's just got to like jostle a little bit right so you can't yeah yeah

687
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:37,800
yeah you can't smash the entire car sorry megan you're just too strong for this job

688
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:44,520
no yeah megan level strength would not work no 3.21 gigawatts is too much to power the

689
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:52,040
the assault bot yeah yeah so i mean i guess it doesn't have to be an assault it could be also

690
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:56,040
a different thing they could figure i'm just going by what i know i know you're trying to go one to

691
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:59,880
one from the perspective because the movie is all about mirroring which is also why i believe

692
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:06,040
that all of this needs to happen before the big science world congress conclusion enchantment

693
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:12,040
under the sea dance every year side the science world congress ends in a big dance where all the

694
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:18,280
scientists have to do couples slow dances i and if you're left alone well sorry you gotta go back

695
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:25,720
to your country or time after a three hour presentation on deep sea fish well in 2025

696
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:32,120
why did that anglerfish come up to the surface they're still asking uh uh it's an interesting

697
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:37,240
congress besides all of this yeah have i brought this up before there's a youtube channel i watch

698
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:42,120
sometimes that's that i'll talk about like movies that were never made like back man five or like

699
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:46,680
the stuff superman lives or whatever the cover smith version of it but there's a bat back to

700
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:50,440
the future 2 the original version of back to the future 2 have you seen any of this or i've never

701
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:55,400
heard any of this um is this where it was the 60s was the 60s and then marty was gonna like his

702
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:03,240
his conception was the thing in this the original version oh no yes so he had to make them like okay

703
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:08,920
they are together and in love but now they have to have sex at the right moment because it wouldn't

704
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:14,920
be marty if it doesn't happen at that right moment they have to have unprotected sex at just this

705
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:21,080
moment so it's marty not craig yes exactly like just another god like right would be a different

706
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:25,800
look a little different or whatever yeah yes but it was in the 60s but it's unlike the original

707
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:30,280
version of back to the future was completely the mapped they like their original their first

708
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:34,120
thought was just like well let's do the exact same thing but now instead of getting together

709
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:39,080
it was their conception so the absence of george and chrispon actually made them have to get

710
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:43,400
creative which maybe results in the skewing as you know an alternate timeline where it's the

711
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:48,040
big confusing movie that i love today yes that's what it sounded like that sounds like dog shit

712
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:52,040
they didn't want to make it they they put the thing at the end of the first one is like a joke

713
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:56,200
and then they got threatened that somebody else would make it or something so i guess we got to

714
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:00,840
make it oh just to like land grab so we gotta do something so let's just do woodstock so it's

715
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:08,520
gonna be that like that uh uh what george and lorraine they get like they like as we all know

716
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:15,400
they got really randy during uh you know country joe's performance at woodstock uh-huh and they

717
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:22,200
went and fucked in the mud george how marty was born they already have two children so

718
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:29,160
them two parents uh already have to go to woodstock i don't know if i'm making up woodstock but i think

719
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,280
there was something like that i think it was something i think it was that lorraine is like

720
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:37,560
a revolutionary or some shit yeah yeah it's something like that george really wanted to

721
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:46,440
watch so they couldn't do it then but then you get like back to the future this is like sleazy

722
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:52,280
back to the future one where they were going to be smoking weed and selling illegal videotapes or

723
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:56,840
whatever what's that in the first what are you talking there was an early script to back to the

724
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:02,680
future where they were gonna be they were like marty and doc were dirtbag like they were smoking

725
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:10,040
they were copying movies of vhs's and reselling them whoa i don't know that i don't think this

726
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:14,120
ever got very far they were doing a be kind rewind i know there were different like yeah

727
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:19,480
incarnations of like what their relationship was yeah like it was but i actually don't i don't know

728
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:25,880
what strap this is i just heard like oh there's a sleazier idea for this that's really weird like

729
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:31,880
closer to like more in the bill and ted uh uh wow geez well we're learning a lot is this like my

730
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:38,680
aunt who would give us like here's a lion king of vhs or here's sleepless in seattle and vhs

731
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:43,880
add a homemade label and she's like oh no my friend he's allowed to go in the theater and

732
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:50,280
tape these oh wow really you had somebody who really wow you got stolen we got handed well you

733
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:55,480
got like a true bootleg of like somebody with a camcorder in a movie theater yeah we had some

734
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:59,560
bootleg i thought what you meant was just like oh they taped like because sometimes you'd have like

735
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:03,720
the vhs machines where you could do too and you would take from a blockbuster but you're talking

736
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:11,320
about true blue i think with bootlegs it didn't seem like copy that is tremendous i don't think

737
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:16,840
i ever had a bootleg from a movie theater tape growing up you're like why it's like i like the

738
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:23,240
song of kuna matata but why is it so shaky it was and i was like i gotta wait him for christmas

739
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:30,680
man king this rules i've never heard this before this is some great jason mythology wow wow i i

740
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:36,200
think um he's allowed i think the same he's monitoring screen quality he's allowed and we're

741
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:42,200
all like license an operating license the vhs i think that same on went to a taping in new york

742
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:49,320
of the rose o donald show and there there we got borrowed vhs they were giving out freebies that

743
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:55,960
and i think it was was a i think we got mission impossible because she loved tom cruise and that

744
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:01,400
was in a real and that was one of the options mission impossible or wow i was gonna say now

745
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:05,480
see i don't understand there's these there's this moment that's so tense but why does somebody just

746
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:11,160
start coughing when he's trying to diffuse the god starts coughing at a certain point why don't all

747
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:17,080
these blurry figures walk in front of tom cruise they're so shaken by the coughing and there's a

748
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:20,680
part where just the uh you can't see the screen where someone's going to the bathroom

749
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:28,440
i didn't understand the cinematography the cinematographer's choice to leave tom walk

750
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:34,920
into a lobby stand in front of the urinal when he's hanging on the cable what falls off him is

751
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:42,360
it a knife oh that's in the trailer for the new one too it kind of i know all about but it's like

752
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:49,240
oh the knife just startled that person so much they started coughing the knife falls on the desk

753
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:56,280
right as he's leaving yeah and then the guy does see the knife there right yes um i the we've

754
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:02,120
we gotta wrap this up but i but i really just you know and here's what i'm gonna say i don't

755
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:08,120
really have a lot to say about the ride everything i had to say was about this yeah and i will not

756
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:13,160
stop anyone from getting their ride thoughts out i just the fact that it is such a mythology

757
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:17,960
expander that is so bold just to quote them officially um it what does this mean it means

758
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:21,880
that our parents are never going to meet which will activate a new timeline in which my cousin

759
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:27,960
and i don't exist which will create a space time imbalance other person says long story short all

760
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:33,960
of you will end existing too so we have to hurry up that's why we need our parents to meet at the

761
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:38,920
science congress but also you're all gonna die so all of that at once and that is all the back

762
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:44,920
story on which you go into a really mediocre simulator ride that looks like old video games

763
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:51,480
but i'm this blew my mind and is i think actually kind of a funny plausible premise

764
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:59,320
at least one i just i do wish i would like to hand this to ai like make make zach and jesse

765
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:06,600
back to the future 4 for me don't waste anyone's time don't bother christopher loyd and michael j

766
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:13,400
fox their health is not great don't you dare make them come be part of this make ai do the work on

767
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:20,120
this shit but i just want to know what the insane rest of that story would be uh i will say the

768
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:26,520
it's okay so the ride room has some weird stuff in it too one there's someone in the yellow hazmat

769
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:33,240
suit obviously obscuring their face so it can be a man or a woman they i guess get the plutonium

770
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:41,640
briefly take it off stage on screen it sure enough it is basically worse simulator footage

771
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:47,720
than the back to the future ride because it goes in prehistoric times it goes to the future

772
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:54,760
it's all the same stuff it's all the same stuff and then it ends at 1855 and everyone is so far

773
01:12:54,760 --> 01:13:02,120
away from the camera there there's no subtitles at this point and they just have like emotionless

774
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:08,840
conversation the hazmat person walks on screen for a second i believe to give them the plutonium

775
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:15,480
and then maybe take the bad one back they walk off screen then they walk into the audience again and

776
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:21,880
they walk back and the other the guys go like i guess they go like let's get out of let's get to

777
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:29,080
the conference and then it it closes like a fake shutter and it says to be continued

778
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:36,920
but i don't and then immediately after exit and an arrow of where you have to exit so i guess it's

779
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:44,840
continued in that oh jules and verne can go have sex at a conference now they can meet wives

780
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:50,760
separate that also the idea of two brothers going to the science world congress and both of them

781
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,760
meeting their wives wait okay and when you have you do have to ask the question

782
01:13:56,360 --> 01:14:00,920
did it all happen in the same room was the was this a was this a double brother

783
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:05,640
you have no wait a minute we're messing up the time okay so they go to the science conference in

784
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:13,240
2030 but jesse and zach come back and say they're from 2055 correct but they appear to only be

785
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:19,640
15 yeah they're not 25 years old so that means jules and verne have to meet the mother they both

786
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:26,520
spend about 10 years together oh right good point then they have the kids yeah oh yeah so

787
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:32,680
it's not necessary that they have sex at the congress it depends on their degree of comfort

788
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:38,680
with the women that they meet uh maybe jules takes his time maybe he does it on the 10th date

789
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:43,880
but verne i know from his weird little dick points is getting on right away he cannot wait

790
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:48,920
verne is pouncing on his wife they don't they don't say if they have any other siblings either

791
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:54,440
though uh no i bet the older ones yeah and if they don't is it just are they just lazy

792
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:58,280
or not scientists they're not scientists yeah like like can you take care of it

793
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:05,880
no can you go help me still be born thank you yeah it's really something uh the dinosaur can

794
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:12,760
i talk about yes yes of course there's a dinosaur that attacks the time uh time room the time shuttle

795
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:20,120
and this dinosaur looks like it's from like a windows 96 screensaver it is so funny it's i

796
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:25,240
mean it's very much in the mold of jurassic park classic t-rex that just bites into the into a

797
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:31,560
delorean and shakes it around like a dog it's a playstation 1 graphics nintendo 64 graphics

798
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:36,920
the jump in like frame rate it takes a bite toward you and it looks like it's it like you

799
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:44,520
missed three seconds of movement it goes from like 50 yards away to 10 yards away in a jolt

800
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:50,440
you're like wait wait wait hold on it looks so funny and bad it is a 3d movie and we're watching

801
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:56,360
it around and his big goofy teeth are right in your face it like there is i will say i actually

802
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:02,360
like i'm happy that it looks bad it looks like it's funny bad yeah it looks charming yeah it gets

803
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:07,800
the geography incredibly correct because they go to they call it the lone pine mall yes and i've

804
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:12,600
been to this mall and i'm like oh this is exactly this is exactly the space of that and then they

805
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:16,760
recreate it is perfectly the back lot it's perfectly courthouse square yes and then they

806
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:20,680
turn left and i'm like oh they go over there they show us what the movie doesn't show us

807
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:26,760
that's kind of cool but yeah it's it is just extremely video gamey back to the future stuff

808
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:31,400
and then yeah that ending that might be the most anticlimactic right ending i've ever seen

809
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:37,560
the ending is crazy you just the ride stops moving you just stare at a still shot of a very

810
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:45,560
snail paced plutonium exchange and nobody celebrates or says thanks you did it but thanks to you

811
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:49,880
we get to go make a family and the future is what you make of it they just they don't even

812
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:57,720
include us in it they could have said like you don't understand i'm your kid from the future

813
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:03,800
it's your parents you have to go back to the future like they could have just done that and

814
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:12,280
cut away really quick with the done done done you also never see zack and jesse again never yeah

815
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:16,520
yeah it's not like they get reunited like they're just like completely divorced from what part of

816
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:22,040
that we are back kids from the future don't they understand when you show us kids from the future

817
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:28,360
i expect them to be back and stay back we are back indicates that they're back they've been

818
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:36,920
there before we are we are back we are back but if it's 2025 and they need their parents to meet in

819
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:43,000
20 they ever been here well you know you know who's getting google alerts about this ride

820
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:50,520
is the writer of the children's storybook and the screenwriter of we're back a dinosaur story

821
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:56,440
surely they put in we're back we are back that's probably why it is we are back they had to avoid

822
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:03,880
that yeah right too many lawsuits going right um well let's talk this out it's called back to the

823
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:10,360
future wait no okay that is him going back i was gonna say when marty goes to 1955 that's not back

824
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:17,880
because he's never been there he's going back home for 1985 yeah you have found one and only one

825
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:23,240
logical hell yeah entire operation we are back kids from the future the kids have never been

826
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:28,840
to the present as far as we know or they have and there was an that was an important detail to tell

827
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:36,520
us right maybe they have been yeah we are back because like back to the future is pushing it

828
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:43,000
because look back to the future i guess it's a it does make sense but really it should be the

829
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:48,520
title probably should be more about going to the past that is what most of the but it's about

830
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:54,760
him getting back to the future it's kind of the goal of the movie yeah that's true but the mission

831
01:18:54,760 --> 01:19:01,160
takes place in the ride is this track then we are back kids from the future so they're well i think

832
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:06,920
it does because the goal is for them to keep being kids from the future right that's true if their

833
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:11,880
parents still meet they won't be kids they won't be anything i'm awfully tuggered out i could really

834
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:20,600
go for some ice stone ice stone ice stone ice stone creamery or would you rather go to rock

835
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:24,840
and roll restaurant and get a jackson sandwich here's probably some real food here's where i go

836
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:30,120
crazy on the ice stone one of the things that has really not happened from doing the show that i

837
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:34,760
thought would happen is that someone would reach out at any place theme park company place around

838
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:39,960
the world this is what i wanted they would ask us to help write a ride and now that i think about

839
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:45,240
it the place i would want to make a ride the most is movie land you're right because it's

840
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:52,120
totally open canvas of anything you ever wanted to yeah right that's where you do that's where

841
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:57,960
back that's where we could really happens as a ride they should give us a whole land we should

842
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:05,960
each have our own ride your script for minecraft meets roblox yeah sure we can have anybody william

843
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:13,160
frolly can show up on where we are back kids from the future it doesn't matter anything goes

844
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:20,040
at this place it's lawless and truly there's no place i would rather write dialogue for a ride

845
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:26,120
than this place i you could have more right you could have et doc brent i'm sorry i'm not even

846
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:33,640
fuck doc fuck doc i'm not even using him zach and jesse brown are going to take et and robocop back

847
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:39,320
to dinosaur times and make them joust on velociraptor sure great and it's going to look

848
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:46,840
like that t-rex in the video it's going to be top of the line quality for 2001 yes uh i was

849
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:52,760
thinking chris for loyd got me thinking about the movie nobody because he has cameo in that

850
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:59,240
well not more than a cameo well yeah i don't want to spoil it but he's in it he's one of the actors

851
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:10,120
in the film i'm spoiling this five six year old movie so we've got loyd and we've got rizza we

852
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:16,600
got odinkirk but i bet odinkirk and rizza's grandfather william frolly would love to help

853
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:22,280
them out wait so your choice of all the ip in the world you were pitching the unauthorized ride of

854
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:29,880
nobody in which william in which is exactly the same except william frolly's and it's and it's a

855
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:36,040
ride that's different no you're right like hey you have your own ride to do this is great wait jason

856
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:45,480
go nuts put dj quals in there okay all my character actor papers yeah i mean and look anything

857
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:50,360
anything goes here i guess you know if now that jason's put that out there you know what if we

858
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:58,360
just um let's say we do the teenage moon ninja turtles but uh grandpa monster now is their mentor

859
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:03,880
