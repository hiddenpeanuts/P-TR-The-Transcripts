1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I don't believe we've been introduced.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm Sebastian Jekyll.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You're just a program on a computer?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I know, isn't it something?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I had plans to bowl tonight.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Level one, kid. Start.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's a brand new game.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Well, you absolutely didn't ask for it, and here it is.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Today, folks, is the day of the jackal.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Here on podcast, the ride, the second gate.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by the cold steel kid, Mike Carlson.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I am here, yes, I am here.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm here to help you get started.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm here to help you get started.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm here to help you get started.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm here to help you get started.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Here's the cold steel kid, Mike Carlson.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I am here, yes, I am the cold steel kid.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I want everyone to remember that.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I want this to be official jackal day,

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
so next year when you're listening to this,

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
or when you're not, I want, okay,

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
listen to this episode every year is what I'm trying to say.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Once a year, it's jackal day,

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and it will be, what is it coming out on the 25th?

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
May 25th.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, so on the 25th, that is officially jackal day.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Listen to this episode, watch your favorite episodes

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
of Deadly Games, and remember that the cold steel kid sent you.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
All right, get rid of all future associations with May 25th.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Future jackal day celebrator, Jason Sheridan.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hey, kid.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Is that jackal?

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I guess.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's the only thing, as I was going out this morning,

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I realized the only line, line that really stuck in my brain

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
is how he calls people kid a lot.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, okay.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Specifically the one character, the lead character, Dr. Gus Lloyd,

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
but then I feel like he branches out and just starts calling all of his antagonists.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Anybody he's kind of needling becomes kid.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But then there's some significance to the kid.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There's a lot here.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This will be a spoiler heavy episode.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We'll do nothing but spoil Deadly, the UPN story.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Well, hang on, I want to set you up, Mike, to do it.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Mike, what is today's topic?

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sebastian Jackal.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
During the early years of the UPN network, there were different shows I would watch.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I remember Star Trek Voyager would air on this channel,

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
even though I believe it was syndicated.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And when you watch videos of deadly games on YouTube,

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
there are ads for Star Trek Voyager.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Heavy presence.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Heavy.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Everything is in the crater of Star Trek Voyager.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We have to thank the YouTube account Deadly Games Cool Show.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's two words, Deadly Games, one word, Cool Show, one word.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's a person's name.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Deadly Games Cool Show.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Deadly Games Cool Show.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
They have uploaded everything from the series.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Well, yeah, not quite.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay, okay.

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
90% of it.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But basics.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The basics.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah, back to this.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So during that time, I remember watching an ad for a new UPN show,

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and it had an ad with Brent Spiner in it, one of my favorites.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That was the way in.

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And I said, oh, I got to watch this.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Look at this.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Brent Spiner branching out, doing something different,

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
playing what seemed to be a villain, and I was correct.

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And the show was Deadly Games.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And I watched it, and Christopher Lloyd was on it, of course I liked at the time.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And who did Christopher Lloyd play on the UPN series, Deadly Games?

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And Christopher Lloyd was a regular on the show,

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and he was sort of billed last because he was the big name, the big get,

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and he was the big character, the iconic character of the show,

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and they knew it before, obviously they wrote it that way.

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But this character's name was Sebastian Jackle.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So what you're saying is Sebastian Jackle is a character from the UPN series,

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Deadly Games, played by Christopher Lloyd.

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That is what I'm saying.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I took the long road to get there.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But yeah, Sebastian Jackle is Christopher Lloyd's character on UPN's Deadly Games.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah, imprinted on you like a young pup seeing its mother for the first time.

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah, that is true.

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
His iconic white suit, I would never forget it.

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Let me ask you, both of you, I know we've talked about this before,

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
but neither of you remember this at the time, correct?

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No.

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No, and I kind of, when you mentioned it, I feel like it was a thing where I,

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know, I feel like there's a lot of B-movie syndicated television stuff

102
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
that just mushes together.

103
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Your Brisco, what is it?

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Brisco County Jr.

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Brisco County Jr. meshes with tremors, sequels, meshes with whatever was on USA Upl.

106
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, Nowhere Man on UPN, which is a show I watched the whole season of,

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and then all of course we've talked about many of the syndicate, other syndicated shows,

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Relic Hunter, VIP, Gene Roddenberry's, what, Andromeda something?

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Andromeda, yes.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But this was not really syndicated.

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This was a prime time.

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

113
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Tuesdays at 8 p.m.

114
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and in the classic 90s move seemingly aired out of order based on a fan site I saw.

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah, it does feel that way.

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, okay, that's interesting you found proof of that because there's one that feels like could have been the ender,

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
but it kind of comes in the middle.

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah, it's weird.

119
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's a little confusing.

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah, I jumped around a lot.

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I think I watched six and a half episodes.

122
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And now when I said like it's not fully complete online,

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
there is a 13th episode that is not, was not aired, was not released,

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
but there, I mean, it might be on the DVD.

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There was a DVD release like four or five years ago.

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, the synopsis of that episode is Belinda, the leather clad ex-girlfriend, wants revenge on all men.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
She can only be defeated by a golden ball.

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So fortunately that one's not, we can't tell you about the golden ball.

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We should now explain what the show's premise is, I think.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, yeah, you're going to be a little lost.

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah.

132
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But what's the character, main character?

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Dr. Gus.

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Dr. Gus Lloyd.

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Thank you.

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Dr. Gus Lloyd.

137
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
A very divorced man.

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He's very divorced.

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I like this characterization.

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yes, because just seething with bitterness.

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah, he's angry and angry.

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah, yeah, he really fuels the entire show.

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
There's a lot of 90s bad habits.

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
There's a lot of 90s indulgences in this.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Some are cute and charming and some you're like, oh, it has been 30, almost 30 years, hasn't it?

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, I mean, some of this stuff is really like what Brent Spiner's character Danny Schlecht does to Gus's ex-wife and his best friend.

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I think it's very cruel.

148
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah.

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh, yes, puts them in a compromising.

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Drugs them.

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Danny Schlecht drugs them.

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Drugs them.

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This is your way in, was the Brent Spiner.

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You watched the Joker.

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Scandalous.

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I also really do remember the Cathy Ireland promo is coming and I remember the scenes from this.

158
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Cathy Ireland.

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Cathy Ireland, yeah.

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Now that episode, one, could have used a lot more jackal, the Cathy Ireland episode.

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Also, separate from that, very unpleasant, like a shockingly unpleasant episode.

162
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Just that one?

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No, that one especially.

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:09,000
If you've ever been in an environment and someone has dismissed as like, oh, there's a real male energy to that, like as a negative, this episode, I think especially that.

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I guess.

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I think it's all.

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yeah, it's all the same to me.

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's all pretty bad, but this one.

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You mean because Cathy Ireland is playing like a.

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The horniest character in fiction.

171
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah, sure.

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah, it's really weird.

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I don't know.

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Both guys are kind of skeezy.

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The whole series.

176
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Fighting Cathy Ireland off though.

177
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
He is.

178
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
He is.

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But I.

180
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah, but there's no jackal.

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
There's no jackal to balance it.

182
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's the biggest issue.

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
There's a lack of jackal energy is the primary.

184
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah.

185
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah.

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He kind of makes it cartoony.

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Sorry to take us on a tangent.

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You were explaining the set up to Dr. Gus Lloyd's troubles.

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's crucial to know what the.

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Because I also.

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Jason and I hadn't seen the show.

192
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I also didn't know anything about the show.

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I didn't know like the general palette and world that it is.

194
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And it's all pretty delightful to stumble upon.

195
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's a great premise for a bad 90s show.

196
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah.

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah.

198
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So perfect premise for a terrible show.

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
With a really good fake out with a first scene where if you don't know what's going on,

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
you say out loud what the fuck is going on.

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yes.

202
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I think it sticks that landing pretty well.

203
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But let's spoil what's going on.

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah.

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Tell us about Dr.

206
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Gus.

207
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well, Dr.

208
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Gus has created a video game where he's the main character called and his,

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I guess, avatar or whatever in the game is the Cold Steel Kid.

210
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And he has populated this video game with a bunch of bosses,

211
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
villains that are based on people in his real life.

212
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes.

213
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
People have who have, you know, slighted him or like driven him nuts.

214
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
People like his old garbage man and his his ex mother-in-law.

215
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He has a lot of enemies.

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He has a lot of enemies.

217
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
For the new, yeah.

218
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Do you guys have enough, even do you think you have enough enemies in the world for even a 13 episode,

219
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
for even a truncated run series?

220
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I mean, if we're talking like a minor slights, maybe.

221
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah, I guess if you open it up to Dr.

222
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Gus's level, which is very pit, he's so anybody qualifies as a villain.

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Anybody looked at him the wrong way.

224
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
He's not a particularly sympathetic character,

225
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
except in the fact that he has the tropings of 90s every man,

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
like a 90s TV. He kind of looks like Kirk Cameron.

227
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He wears a lot of button up plaid shirts over white T-shirts with very light jeans.

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And that was how you communicate like, hey, this person's a regular guy.

229
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He's not rich. If he was rich, he'd be in a nice fancy suit like Sebastian Jackal.

230
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's right.

231
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You're rooting for obviously it's the guy in the plaid.

232
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Of course. So then something goes wrong and all the characters and Sebastian Jackal enter our world.

233
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yes. Well, you need to mention in addition to programming,

234
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:19,000
an incredibly photo realistic game, even more realistic than say, lethal enforcers or revolution X games that like digitized photos and made the move a little.

235
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah, like those early Sega CD games that Scottie Pippen basketball game for Sega CD that was like photo, like it was video, but it was still odd.

236
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yeah. So in addition to programming a very advanced video game based on his real life, former lover and enemies,

237
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and then essentially a cartoon character, Sebastian Jackal, he was he figured out the solution to perpetual motion or unlimited energy.

238
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
He did kind of. Yeah. He creates this energy device.

239
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah, he's like a brilliant inventor. Yeah. So that's right. Wait, I have it written down that he works for Dr.

240
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Judy Chang. He's a grant funded researcher at a university in Los Angeles, and he's trying to create anti-matter via a laser wave that he and his partner, Peter Rucker, have been developing.

241
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah, that's his main project. The video game that looks photo realistic, the video game that looks like a 90s syndicated show.

242
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes. Fully live action where nothing cartoony ever happens.

243
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Men will create a photo realistic 90s video game instead of going to therapy.

244
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You said you did you just I don't want to spoil this already because this is too early, but did you watch the episode, the end of Jackal?

245
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Episode four, episode four. It's the one with you said something in that speech that I thought maybe indicated you didn't know a big reveal.

246
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Who's in episode four? How do we it's the one with this?

247
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I don't want to spoil it. Yeah, I think I think what I did is I watched one through three jump to five.

248
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
There's a big spoilers, a big reveal. You actually might not know.

249
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Four is maybe the most crucial one.

250
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah, I figured out in five because in five they act like the premise of the show is over.

251
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
They're like, yes, you're the game.

252
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We've beaten the game. Jackal has to come back.

253
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yes. And that's why you only get a digitized Jackal.

254
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah, yeah. Right. There's a big but I think there's a big thing.

255
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm glad we get to maybe unleash this on you.

256
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No, yeah, I'm not sure. There's a big reveal.

257
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We shouldn't say four. There's really two, two big thing.

258
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Let's get through everything about Jackal until the turn.

259
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
A brilliant two mega pieces of information added in that episode.

260
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You know, I was just kind of going on my gut and going on the the mini bosses.

261
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah, the monster of the week, the bad guy of the week, which is where you get a lot of the big guest stars.

262
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah, right. I'm surprised you didn't watch the end of Jackal because it's got Jackal's name in it.

263
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I I think I probably glanced over it because so many of the other titles are so generic.

264
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Mm hmm. So it was too interesting.

265
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It was probably too interesting.

266
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And also, like I, I, the YouTube channel was well organized, but in a confusing fashion.

267
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Was that crazy? Was there one episode where everything was like mislabeled number one?

268
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Like I started clicking because because they don't have the full episodes on.

269
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's like one of four parts and then one of them I was completely out of order.

270
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Maybe the Kathy Ireland one. I was maybe I was just confused from watching that one's a two part or two.

271
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So maybe that's what it was jumbled there.

272
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Can I just maybe we should all say our our viewing journeys.

273
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Jason seems like you watched like six of them jumping around.

274
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I watched one, two, three, most of five, but didn't finish it because I didn't want to commit to watching part two.

275
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Then I jumped to I think seven and then I jumped to twelve and didn't finish it.

276
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
OK, sure. Twelve is the villain.

277
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The villain is a guest star.

278
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But then I saw in the thumbnail that Jerry Stiller was also a guest star.

279
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But like so many other episodes that could use more Jackal, this could use more Jerry Stiller.

280
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh, very much so. And it's disappointing that he's not the villain.

281
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That's what I was hoping. We all saw it, I'm sure.

282
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I clicked him and oh, please. And then he's not.

283
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah, the most tantalizing thumbnail nudity would not have been as exciting.

284
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Doesn't matter. Yeah, who cares? Jerry Stiller.

285
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
We were like, oh, God, 90s. I broke the remote.

286
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I got to recharge it now.

287
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yeah, yeah, that was very exciting to see that. But yeah, disappointing.

288
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
My viewing journey is that after getting a sense of the quality of the show,

289
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I changed my plan of watching all of them to watching only the Sebastian Jackal scenes.

290
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So I have seen every scene that the character Sebastian Jackal,

291
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Christopher Lloyd's character on the UPN series, Deadly Games.

292
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I've seen every Sebastian Jackal scene that exists.

293
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Now, you might want to put an asterisk next to the word scene in what I just said.

294
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
By the end, it became I was physically present in a room where every Sebastian Jackal scene was on.

295
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And I would sort of look up if anything. But once I got a sense of like the pattern of it,

296
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
like it just the show becomes and look, I really like Sebastian Jackal.

297
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Of course. I really like Christopher Lloyd in it.

298
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But it kind of becomes all right, every Jackal scene is the same.

299
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Essentially, once you've seen one, you've kind of seen them all once in a while.

300
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You get at least a visually interesting difference in a Sebastian Jackal scene.

301
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Like I completely agree with you. Usually it's the same thing. He's doing his little smile.

302
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
He's like kind of playing like kind of an old time like charmer kind of a guy kind of.

303
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I think the music's also doing a lot of the heavy lifting there.

304
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But then once in a while you get Sebastian Jackal in a boat with Shirley Jones drinking champagne,

305
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
which is fantastic. Well, yes.

306
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And I got very excited when I saw the guest star in the second episode was Shirley Jones,

307
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Marion the librarian from the movie version of The Music Man.

308
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Of course, the Partridge family. Of course. Yes.

309
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah. But she is not she is not the ex mother-in-law.

310
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
She's not the new potential mother-in-law in the first.

311
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
There's a mother-in-law who's a pain in the ass in the pilot.

312
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And then the second episode has a mother-in-law who's cold.

313
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Do you see what I'm saying? It's a little it's a little confusing.

314
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah. The second episode with Shirley Jones called One Mean Mother.

315
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
First up, so it's called Kill Shot. Oh, I did kind of a hybrid of what you're talking about.

316
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I watched like five or six episodes and then I sort of zoomed through a lot of them to find some Jackal stuff like Shirley Jones.

317
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I will admit I didn't end up watching the whole episode,

318
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
but I did zoom through to see a wonderful scene of just in a little tiny speedboat or with a motor.

319
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It had a motor Jackal sipping champagne. Yes.

320
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
With Shirley Jones. He ships him champagne a lot.

321
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Cameo appearance in that one by the Queen Mary. Oh, yeah.

322
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Cemented into the ground.

323
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:41,000
There's great focus. Very clearly it's one cruise ship that they've run to get on and then a very different ship that pulls away from the dock, I believe.

324
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, that's right. Yeah. The Queen Mary doesn't go anywhere. Hurry, get on the Queen Mary before it leaves.

325
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
There's a great there's like a the episode, the dentist episode with the evil dentist.

326
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
There's an exterior and Lindsay was just happy she was not watching any of this, but she just happened to see the screen.

327
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And she goes, that's my dentist and everything. It was her dentist's office.

328
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah. Whoa. Yeah.

329
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
There I think Jane did the same thing.

330
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
She's like, I've gone to that building. It's over. Yeah, it's over. Yeah.

331
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's pretty recognizable, I think.

332
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,000
If you've been over there at all, I will say I explained the premise to Jane and she joined me watching one random middle episode.

333
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It might have been the Kathy Ireland episode.

334
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And she her reaction was just like, what is this? Yeah. What is going on?

335
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And that is the one with the least jackal, it seems like.

336
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So I didn't even like all that. I was like, oh, look, he's on the screen. He's on the screen.

337
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But OK, let's let's see.

338
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And then I think we watched a little of the I guess it would be the dentist one together, which has more jackal or the garbage man one.

339
00:19:48,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Aaron's reaction to this mainly was at some point yesterday as I was rounding the corner to like episode 11, she walked by and said, I feel like you've been watching the show for three months.

340
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Me too. I'm not even watching sporadic scenes. I just really slowed down.

341
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I think a lot of the money is in is in the beginning.

342
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And I think it's fair to primarily focus on on jackal jackal by by leaps and bounds.

343
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The best part. Yeah. Yeah.

344
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And I guess I should say it since I haven't watched literally every frame of it.

345
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But I will say that the Danny Schlecht Brent Spiner episode is very good.

346
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's the best episode, I think that I saw right when you were did you see?

347
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Did you watch Danny? I did. Yes.

348
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He's got a lot to do.

349
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
He is he plays multiple like versions of himself.

350
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yeah, he seems like he's having a great time.

351
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He seems like he took what he was given and ran with it and is like putting more like zhuzh more character in it.

352
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And most other actors are. Did you see this episode?

353
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I was this was I was starting to tap out.

354
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I don't want it to be a Danny. I don't want it to be a Danny Schlecht episode.

355
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's a special. That'll be its own.

356
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But Danny Schlecht, when he's finished doing something like finished completing his evil plan, he like kind of looks at the camera.

357
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
There's maybe a wide angle lens.

358
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So he looks a little distorted and he goes, My work here is done.

359
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And they also definitely when he's the bad guy, they definitely they make him up when he's like on the phone, when he's like the actual person it's based on.

360
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah. They make him look very normal.

361
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And when he's the bad guy, they make him look a little like data.

362
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Like, well, like, like, if we're going to be really accurate, like data's brother, Lour, who is evil.

363
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Oh, of course. Sure. All right.

364
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I get more actually what you're saying.

365
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I love you would love Lour. Everyone here would love Lour.

366
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You would love Lour. You would love Lour.

367
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
By the way, whoever I mean, I know some of the people involved in making this, whoever did it are huge Star Trek fans.

368
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And I'm not just because it's LeVar Burton on one episode and what could Brent Spiner, the guy who played Barkley on Star Trek The Next Generation is on this and his name is Dwight Schultz.

369
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, we should say Leonard Nimoy directed the pilot.

370
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yes. And as a producer and then Adam Nimoy directed another one as well.

371
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yeah. Yeah. Heavy Nimoy involved.

372
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Even the is not Christopher Lloyd part of the franchise via Star Trek 3. Is that correct?

373
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You mean directing? No, Christopher Lloyd's in it.

374
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Oh, yes. Yes. Sorry. Sorry. Blanked out. Yeah. Yeah. Klingon. Yeah.

375
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So it's all so this I feel like there was a clear directive from UPN to give us a side product, something with a little bit of Star Trek magic.

376
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yes, we can't make another we can't afford another Star Trek show.

377
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But if just give us something that we could kind of at least pair with it or cross promote. Right.

378
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
There were some promos. I forget if I saw this within a Deadly Games episode or if it was a separate thing.

379
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I was curious, like the general climate of UPN besides this in 1995.

380
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:16,000
If we haven't said that's when this aired. Not the very this wasn't one of the deadly games was not an inaugural UPN show, but it was one of the first.

381
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah. Really in the launch, the proud history of this great network that RIP is no longer with us.

382
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But or did it call is it called something else? Is there a UPN? Well, UPN and WB merged to be CW. Oh, yeah.

383
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And is part of CW. OK. And this is early enough that like so it airs the fall into the fall of 95 into the start of 96.

384
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:49,000
One of the episodes the credits are playing and the announcer goes, you know, tomorrow, tune in for the comedy event of 1996, the premiere of the new show, Moesha.

385
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And like huge hit for UPN. One of their on their way to find it. Finally, what it was a big hit. Yeah.

386
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Interesting. But until then, they're fishing and they're trying to throw out other things.

387
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
There's one show they had one show called with the inexplicable title Platypus Man. Oh, yeah.

388
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I remember Platypus Man. Platypus Man was not you hear it and you think is this going to be some sort of like pre the tick like funny oddball superhero show?

389
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But no, it's based on the standup comedy of Richard Jeni, who has had a bit about male platypuses being solitary and comparing current 90s male every man living to that of a platypus.

390
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Looks like the boring thing ever. And then platypus man would be paired with something called pigsty and pigsty was a show about four slobs living with a hot girl in a messy apartment.

391
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And I bring up pigsty because I found a promo for it where at the beginning of the promo, they say, got those post Voyager blues.

392
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Check out big style and then some unfunny shots of pigsty.

393
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Like, that's interesting. They're totally framing it as like, all right, if you're here for Voyager, then stick around for pigsty.

394
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And then at the end of it, then a blues singer comes on and sings. So go on, put on pigsty for those post Voyager blues.

395
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:32,000
That guy singing a song about what is coming up next. That was a marketing gimmick in the 90s.

396
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Like a lot of them. Yeah.

397
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Stick around for meta buddy.

398
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
There's always white blues singers had to be that or maybe like kind of New Orleans.

399
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Michigan J. Frog.

400
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Oh, yes.

401
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yes, that was in the same family. I watch unhappily ever after.

402
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But that's one of the it's one of the weirdest things ever sung.

403
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Watch pigsty for the post Voyager blues.

404
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
So every so all like all roads pointed to Voyager.

405
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yeah, yeah.

406
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That was the one thing I'm looking in pigsty.

407
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
One of the episodes titled one of the episodes is titled Aaron go barf.

408
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:21,000
That is not the first time I have heard Aaron go bra turned into like Aaron go bras, you know, like some sort of bad.

409
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And sitcom titles. If you go back and read sitcom titles throughout the it's really kind of bleak.

410
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
They're either just nothing or it's like I don't know.

411
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I don't know. Simpsons had good titles. If you go, if you had the book, a guide to our favorite family and the multiple other volumes that had to follow it that were significantly skinnier.

412
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

413
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
They had some fun titles.

414
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
The picture of like the promos with the like metal behind it is really rich.

415
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Richard fonts throughout.

416
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Yeah.

417
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Yeah, here's, here's my other little bits of UPN context just for the just to paint the picture what deadly games landed in.

418
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So, Jason, you said Tuesdays at eight. This was opposite Roseanne.

419
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
That's where this had to air.

420
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Of course, it did not go well.

421
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It landed at number 100 in the ratings.

422
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And in 1995, if you were at number 100, that means that only only a pitiful 2.8 million people on watched your show.

423
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
That was an average episode of the 2.8 million people saw Sebastian Jackal every week.

424
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:41,000
If I could put this next to my favorite fact about TV viewing that I've learned recently, you guys are familiar with the Apple show, The Problem with Jon Stewart.

425
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I am familiar.

426
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
He is bad. John's back. He's back. He's taken everybody to task once more.

427
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And you know how many people watch a not the beginning, but like the seventh episode of The Problem with Jon Stewart.

428
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
They magically a streaming service released a number and it lets you know why they don't ever do this.

429
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I want to take a guess how many people watch.

430
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
75,000.

431
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Mike, 75.

432
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm going to say 150,000.

433
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Mike is closer because the answer is 40,000.

434
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Mine was a joke response.

435
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You were almost double.

436
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I did a joke answer.

437
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You might have noticed I didn't laugh at it.

438
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I did know.

439
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It was even worse.

440
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I thought it'd be like 250 or something.

441
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
No 40.

442
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And now people watch the clips online, but 40,000 Gen X NYU grads are loving episode seven.

443
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
How many of those is episode seven where he begs Bob Iger to start a news network?

444
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Because I did see that.

445
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Why does that always happen where it's like, take your money and make a truth telling servant like and it's never.

446
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Well, tax right off after the like, go handsome billionaire to do it.

447
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Chris Evans is assembling moderates of all parties to really get to the heart of God.

448
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
No.

449
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So anyway, the audience of every appearance of Sebastian Jackal was 70 times that of Jon Stewart in 2022.

450
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Wow.

451
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Jackal versus Stewart.

452
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Jackal wins.

453
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Sorry, kid.

454
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
This is not your moment of Zen.

455
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Jackal is like a character who wandered in from a better show.

456
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yeah, completely.

457
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yeah.

458
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Imagine a show where everybody's like as fun as it dressed as fun as him.

459
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
He just and I feel like Christopher Lloyd is taking it easy to like he's he's at the point in his career.

460
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
At the point in his career where he knows what he's good at.

461
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
He's and he this must have been a nice gig.

462
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm not saying a nice payday, but you show up same costume every week.

463
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You probably work two days a week because he is not in a lot of scenes.

464
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I think less and less as it went on.

465
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Less and less.

466
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You show up in like a desk chair.

467
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
You turn around in a desk chair.

468
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You pull up in your big old white car, your fancy Studebaker or whatever.

469
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And you go like, better luck next time, kiddos.

470
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And then you drive away at five miles an hour.

471
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Jason's watching this going, oh, this job.

472
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Oh, what a wonderful job.

473
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I would kill to show up, choose some scenery and an all white suit, drink like ginger ale and a champagne flute.

474
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And, you know, go home.

475
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
So we got to think of one for Jason.

476
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Show runners.

477
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Like you just go a little like what's a fancy stuffy name like you you for me.

478
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
These and what's a scary animal?

479
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Oh, Wolverine.

480
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
You you for me.

481
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
He's Wolverine.

482
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'll take it.

483
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I love it.

484
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And then some lame.

485
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Oh, like, you know, like sorry, Dr.

486
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Frank's, but this it's the day I'm not going to write it for like your electric car is never going to get off the ground.

487
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
That's great.

488
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Yeah.

489
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
There's a power or maybe raw like raw.

490
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Come on, Pop TV.

491
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Let's make this happen.

492
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Yeah.

493
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Still going.

494
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I think so.

495
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
OK.

496
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Probably somehow.

497
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I think I just Schitt's Creek.

498
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Twenty two hours a day.

499
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It's sure that Schitt's Creek is like you be UPN's Voyager.

500
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It's the same thing where that's sort of like it's great.

501
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So let's just those are some let's just say some basic stuff about Jack.

502
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Oh, we talked about.

503
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So there's the car.

504
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
He's always it's always suit.

505
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
He kind of looks like the author Tom Wolf, writer of Bonfire Vanities.

506
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Yeah.

507
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Very slick.

508
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And then that's kind of nicely paired with there's always there's a lot of cigars.

509
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
There's a lot of champagne.

510
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:14,000
In fact, when he first appears, it were not at first appears, but when he first goes into the real world, he steps off the screen as if in a much cheaper Stargate.

511
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
He's much, much, much cheaper steps into our world.

512
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
But then goes back, grabs that glass of champagne.

513
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
He's not going to let one drop of champagne go to waste.

514
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So I'm digging this guy.

515
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
But he's the first character you see.

516
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yeah.

517
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
In the in the pilot, his first character, you see the first character you hear.

518
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yes. Yeah.

519
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:46,000
When you're sort of in video game world more, he means he's the epitome of class, I would say extremely charming.

520
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I agree.

521
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:57,000
He has a cane like a very thin cane and he can just like do quick blasts of explosions.

522
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Fire.

523
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Yeah. Yeah.

524
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Well, fireballs.

525
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
That's cool. Can kind of do without even thinking about it.

526
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It's just pointed behind him.

527
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Got some people behind him causing some trouble.

528
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Poof.

529
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:14,000
He's presented as like some sort of a homicidal maniac, but he doesn't really like kill that many.

530
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
He's not really.

531
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
He seems pretty benign and honestly.

532
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Yeah.

533
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
They make it sound like he's like, oh, you should fear him.

534
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And he is a master manipulator and he can kind of just materialize or like appear.

535
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:38,000
In reality, it's just like, yeah, he just kind of walks into this screen, walks onto the screen, but he doesn't use the powers to like, OK, Dr.

536
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Gus, we just asleep.

537
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
We're going to beat the shit out of it.

538
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Yeah.

539
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And he's also he's got the Joker thing with Gus law.

540
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I mean, Gus, Dr.

541
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Gus Lloyd is like Batman and Sebastian Jackal's like the Joker, even though they're Brent Spiner's playing a Joker.

542
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,000
That's not don't get confused in the sense that Jackal wants to do this forever.

543
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:06,000
He wants to continue this endless dance between Gus and himself because he helps defeat Danny Schlecht in the episode.

544
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So he's not above helping Gus is what I'm saying.

545
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
So I know he's a villain.

546
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
He's a villain.

547
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
He's the big bad guy.

548
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
He's kind of not.

549
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I kind of feel like he likes the cat and mouse game continuing between him and Dr.

550
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Gus Lloyd.

551
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Yeah, I think that's right.

552
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Of course, because Danny Schlecht was programmed into the game by the real Danny Schlecht.

553
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Well, Jason, that's a yes, of course.

554
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
That's a big reveal.

555
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
That's a big reveal.

556
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So it's a henchman.

557
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But I feel like that's a doctor that Sebastian Jackal doesn't have control.

558
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
We have to explain, of course, that like they don't know where this character came from because this is a it looks like this guy, Danny Schlecht.

559
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And it's how could this be a character in the game?

560
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
They didn't program this in the game.

561
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So how is this part of it?

562
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
When all the other villains were programmed, programmed, Gus Lloyd.

563
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Right.

564
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So so so Dr.

565
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Gus Lloyd sees this guy looks just like his friend, Danny Schlecht, and he goes, you're Danny Schlecht, aren't you?

566
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And he goes, no, I'm not Danny Schlecht.

567
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And it's Brent Spiner doing a different like a nerd voice now because he's pretending to be a handyman.

568
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,000
His other genius friend who likes to torture him, which like, you know, he mails his house keys to Iraq.

569
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Is a big practical joker.

570
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So finally it's revealed in the episode when he finally talks to the real Danny Schlecht, which is Brent Spiner dressed up like Michael Douglas on wall in Wall Street or like or whatever.

571
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
That's the movie, right?

572
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
He's in Wall Street.

573
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Yeah. But then he there is another character later on when like Dr.

574
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Gus Lloyd's house is going to be repossessed.

575
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Yes, that looks that is dressed just like Danny Schlecht.

576
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yes, but it's not related.

577
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So I just wanted to real quick say that Danny Schlecht reveals to Dr.

578
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Gus Lloyd that a couple of weeks ago, months ago when he was sitting in Danny Schlecht's lab waiting for him, he decided to just program a character into the video game himself that looks like he had that ability.

579
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Yes, he knew enough of the specific coding language of the video game that looks like a 90s syndicated show filmed in reality.

580
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Yes, exactly.

581
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
That's what he reveals.

582
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
He's a perfect version of him.

583
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So multiple perfect versions of himself into the game.

584
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And he's like, I can't believe it took you this long to find it.

585
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Come on, man.

586
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
That's because he's a practical joker.

587
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
He's a practical joker, but he's a different kind of like sleazy buddy.

588
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Yeah.

589
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Than Peter, the other Grant based scientist.

590
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yes.

591
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
There's a regular on the show.

592
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Peter Rucker.

593
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Dr. Peter Rucker.

594
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Yeah, Dr. Peter Rucker.

595
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And they do go into the like, well, this is true.

596
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
What else is true?

597
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
They're going to have to re up that grant at some point.

598
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And the Dr. Gus Lewis money guy or landlord or bank man, I don't know what his relationship was, is going to start asking questions like you're spending a lot of money recently.

599
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Like they do analyze like, I kind of like this, that they're like, well, how are you doing all this stuff?

600
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
How are you affording this?

601
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You like that the notion?

602
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I kind of like that they acknowledge that like if you have to fight a supervillain, you have to, you know, fund it out of pocket.

603
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I thought you liked it.

604
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Just the element of like there's a Mr. Mooney on the show, like from the Lucy show where he would like be like, Lucille, you're spending too much money again.

605
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Yeah, some of the real villain of this show is Dr. Gus Lloyd's financial irresponsibility.

606
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
That's true.

607
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Should we make flashcards for the audience and send them?

608
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Maybe.

609
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Do we have time before the episode comes out to send flashcards in the mail so that everyone can learn all of these?

610
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Follow along here.

611
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
True.

612
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
We'll send them yarn as well so they can draw connections between.

613
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
We have to send them multiple cards of Schlecht, Danny Schlecht.

614
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Because if you're looking at Danny Schlecht card number one, that doesn't tell you the whole Danny Schlecht story.

615
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
No, it does not.

616
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You're going to encounter multiple Danny Schlecht's.

617
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Mm hmm.

618
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Yes, correct.

619
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah, I think that's we're going to do our best.

620
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
We may not be able to get them out in time.

621
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
So back to Jack.

622
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Back to Jackal, of course.

623
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Jackal says, I think in that Danny Schlecht episode, just help illustrate my point about Batman and the Joker with Jackal and Lloyd.

624
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Prove that Jackal is the Joker.

625
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And he says, I mean, he says to, he explains why he has defeated Danny Schlecht for them.

626
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And he says, there's room for only one CEO on the board of Jackal land.

627
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You know, he wants to be that top dog and he wants to always be.

628
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
He likes that.

629
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah.

630
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
This is this is kind of seeded throughout that Jackal wants to recreate our world in his image.

631
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
The phrase Jackal land said another time.

632
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That's what he wants the world to.

633
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yeah.

634
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
If you're wondering what his plan is in episode one, Dr.

635
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Gus, who programmed him, knows what the plan, how bad it could get because his ex-wife says, what's he want to do?

636
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And he says, level by level, people will die.

637
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Cities will burn and Jackal will eventually rule a lifeless planet.

638
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Yeah.

639
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
He's really into the garbage truck and smoke stacks.

640
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
He really wants to just roast and waste, even though he wears an all white ensemble.

641
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Right.

642
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Surely get dirty.

643
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Yeah.

644
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
If there's no life, who's going to clean your suit?

645
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
There's one episode where he's out by like by a playground.

646
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Oh yeah.

647
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Because he's going to do something like set the playground on fire or something.

648
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And then what's her name?

649
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Like uses the ice cream truck to lure all the kids.

650
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
She says, like, oh, free ice cream.

651
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Oh, Lauren Ambrose.

652
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Lauren Ambrose says free ice cream.

653
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Gus Lloyd's ex-wife Lauren Ambrose.

654
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Dr. Gus Lloyd's ex-wife Lauren Ambrose.

655
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Her character in the game is just called the girl kind of regress it kind of condescending.

656
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:57,000
We even left this out and I'm apologize for jumping all around here is that he programmed the female character in the video game to look like his ex-wife.

657
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Yeah.

658
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
He started making the video game as his marriage fell apart.

659
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Yeah.

660
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And then he made this thing where he's like saving her and she's choosing him all the time, even though they have gotten a divorce.

661
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So when characters from his video game start showing up in the world and bothering his real life ex-wife, she is very shocked to learn of any of this.

662
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Yeah.

663
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
You did what?

664
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
There's a game that you play where I am what and I'm called what?

665
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Yeah.

666
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
They have a real will they won't they dynamic and very little on screen chemistry.

667
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Yeah.

668
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It's a real tell don't show relationship.

669
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Meanwhile, Lauren Ambrose, the ex-wife and Sebastian Jackal also have zero chemistry.

670
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:51,000
They just sort of talk once in a while, but that didn't stop one artist from making the only Sebastian Jackal fan art that I could find.

671
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Come on now.

672
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And it's two pictures of just him lovingly embracing this ex-wife character who, again, they don't ever it's not even like that he might there's no episode where he turns her evil and seduces her or tricks her.

673
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
They don't even they just kind of like talk sometimes.

674
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,000
So it's really weird that there's these and Jackal is presented like an angel and there he is.

675
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
This looks like she just graduated from college and he's proud.

676
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Yeah.

677
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
He's her dad and he's very proud.

678
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
First one in the family.

679
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Lauren Ashborn.

680
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm sorry.

681
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Your name is Lauren Ashborn, but Lauren Jackal has a nice ring to it too.

682
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Sure does.

683
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Lauren Ashborn.

684
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Sorry.

685
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
What were you saying?

686
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I don't know.

687
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Whatever he told me the first time I probably just repeated it.

688
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Oh yeah.

689
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm all over the place.

690
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
So he goes to this Jackal goes to the playground and he goes there's no swings in Jackal land.

691
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Like that's because he keeps talking about Jackal land, which is like a paradise.

692
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It has no people, which is just smoke and ash and ash so you can be eating ash.

693
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Jackal land reminds me of I'm so sorry to dump another info dump of another universe, but it reminds me of scat land, which is a place that was created by Jackal.

694
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It was created on the album by scat man John.

695
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Do we know the song scat man?

696
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I'm a scat man.

697
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So much sense that you say, do you know scat land?

698
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And I go no.

699
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And Jason goes, yeah.

700
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
All the sense in the world.

701
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
The craziest story about how I know about scat land.

702
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Mike has told me.

703
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Wait, one thing at a time.

704
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Was it you say what scat land is and then you tell me what don't tell me the story of how you found it.

705
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Mike has told me about it numerous times.

706
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Oh, I see.

707
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
All right.

708
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Never mind.

709
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
That wasn't all a story.

710
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That's why we're here.

711
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,000
By the way, the reason we're all here now is Mike talking about Sebastian Jackal's.

712
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
It's catered from the telegames many times.

713
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
So now we have a new one.

714
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
All right.

715
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
What's scat land and scat man?

716
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
You know this song, this one.

717
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
You ever heard this?

718
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
No, really.

719
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
People have heard.

720
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
This sucks dick.

721
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
What are you telling me about scat land?

722
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Anyway, it was I use it as a back at wrestling theme for me in high school.

723
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
But it was it was made by this guy named Scatman John who has passed away.

724
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
But he has a concept album that this is.

725
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
This has come up before.

726
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Of course it has.

727
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Of course it has.

728
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I got trapped to get this for the second on the show.

729
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Right.

730
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
It must have been.

731
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I believe it's on the show.

732
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Amusement land.

733
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,000
There's the album is called Scatman's World and it's a concept album about utopia called scat land.

734
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So we've been we've been somewhere down this street.

735
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I agree.

736
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
You trapped me in this garage.

737
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Jackal land.

738
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Second time talking about scat land.

739
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Jackal. I think it was years ago actually.

740
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Jackal land reminded me of scat land and I won't get into scat land right now,

741
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
but it's a utopia where everybody lives in harmony.

742
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And that's brought about via scatting.

743
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Yes, it is.

744
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Scatting is a positive thing.

745
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And scat land is a better place than jackal land.

746
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
100 percent.

747
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Scat land is like a perfect place to live.

748
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And it's all described in the song scat man's world and songs of song of scat land.

749
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
How much are we going to will it be a wave of comments demanding scat land the episode?

750
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I don't know.

751
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Or just one.

752
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I don't know.

753
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Are people going to do the math of like well Scott hates it so we got to do it.

754
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I don't know.

755
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
We'll see.

756
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I'm not I'm not saying anything.

757
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I'm just saying it remind us scat land and jackal land.

758
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Remind me of land.

759
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Lands that people want to land.

760
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Based on their goals.

761
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Be that constant scatting or nothing but smoke and ash.

762
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Right.

763
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
What else is important to know about Jackal?

764
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,000
The car that he drives is a 1935 Chrysler Airstream C6.

765
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I got curious if this is a car that Jay Leno owns.

766
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Good idea.

767
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And I looked it up.

768
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
He does not Jay Leno does not own a 1935 Chrysler Airstream CX.

769
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,000
He owns a blue 1934 Chrysler Airflow CX.

770
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Wait I said six.

771
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Okay.

772
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
But like he's got if he's got one.

773
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Leno's got the car the year before.

774
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
It doesn't have a white.

775
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
It's blue.

776
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
It was during a pandemic episode of Jay Leno's garage.

777
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And I just want to say Jay I appreciate you still giving us the tours when things were at their lowest.

778
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
So he was first year 2020.

779
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Yeah.

780
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Okay.

781
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I mean I guess it's outside you know.

782
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Or was he wearing a mask?

783
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Is there a mask that fits his head?

784
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I want an enclosed car 2020.

785
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I don't want a top down one.

786
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And both that military production act.

787
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
No I think it was only him.

788
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I think they gave him a mobile set.

789
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
There were no cameramen.

790
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Oh yeah.

791
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So it was just him alone in his garage talking about the cars.

792
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
So just you know what he does every day.

793
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Wow there's a different alternate 2020 where that becomes the big pandemic hit over the Bo Burnham special.

794
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
The Jay Leno in the garage with one camera.

795
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,000
The power of a man just kind of going mad as we all are and teaching us about Chrysler Airflows.

796
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yeah.

797
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I mean that could have been some good news over the pandemic.

798
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
You know.

799
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
They just gave us good news about his transmission.

800
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
What was that?

801
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
That politician was like the best thing for the inside of a man is the outside of a horse.

802
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Jay Leno says that about cars.

803
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
What politician said that?

804
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I think Mike Pence said that.

805
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
The first thing?

806
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Say it again.

807
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
What is it?

808
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
It's so odd.

809
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Hold on.

810
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I'm going to look it up.

811
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I want to get it right.

812
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I always get quotes.

813
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Is the inside of a horse?

814
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
What does that mean?

815
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
What's best for the inside of a man?

816
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Okay.

817
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Is the outside of a horse?

818
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Is the outside of a horse.

819
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
It's skin?

820
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
So like taking a ride, taking a ride on a horse.

821
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
The outside of a horse.

822
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
That's better than if you flipped it because if it was for the outside of you then it's like.

823
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So you're supposed to have sex with a horse.

824
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
It's two things.

825
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I almost got it.

826
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I've often said there's nothing better for the inside of a man than the outside of a horse.

827
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Oh Reagan said it.

828
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
He was quoting Reagan.

829
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Two layers.

830
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Two pens and Reagan.

831
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Two big time weirdos.

832
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Oh man.

833
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
The outside of a.

834
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
That is very serial killer.

835
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Sloppy sounding quote honestly.

836
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Outside.

837
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Nothing better for the inside of a man than a car.

838
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
So the outside.

839
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Well then that would be the inside of a man than the outside of a car which means you'd

840
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
be sitting on it.

841
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
You're working on it.

842
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
You're washing it.

843
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
You're sitting on it.

844
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
But driving is the one you got to.

845
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Driving is the one.

846
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You want to drive.

847
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
You want to be inside.

848
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I guess he would prefer the.

849
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Nothing better for the inside of a man than the inside of a car.

850
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Yeah that's it.

851
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Okay.

852
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Perfect.

853
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
We fixed it.

854
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
We punched it.

855
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And there will be some smoky smoggy cars in Jack-o-Lantern.

856
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Oh yeah.

857
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
The smokiest.

858
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
There's a by the way there's a Deadly Games Wikipedia.

859
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Yes.

860
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And which reminds you that he's not just you it's on the table to call him not just Sebastian

861
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Jackal but also the Jackal.

862
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Yeah.

863
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
And here's here's just some quick facts.

864
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Jackal realizes that he's an antagonist of a computer game.

865
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
He is smug theatrical and sadistic in the extreme.

866
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
He takes great joy in the carnage that he causes.

867
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
He routinely expresses disgust at the things that give others happiness.

868
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Oh I hear that say.

869
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Yeah.

870
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Paints the picture of the guy.

871
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,000
The other thing we know about him is that he everyone in the he is could not be more

872
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
terrified.

873
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:55,000
He's like a on the loose Hannibal Lecter to everyone in the show even though what he mainly

874
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
does is walk into a room or just be there already by surprise like one where everybody's

875
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
in a nice restaurant and then somebody is walking around playing a violin and guess

876
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
what it's Jackal.

877
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:13,000
So he kind of like walks up or just appears surprised to see me kid and then like you

878
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
and I you and me kid you'll see.

879
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
He walks away.

880
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,000
They were like we have to figure out a way to have a villain who's very scary and very

881
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
thin.

882
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Everybody's very threatened by him but he never does anything.

883
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
And because we have to have a show we can film he's always got to be in the room with

884
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:39,000
the heroes and he's an old man so he can't be chased or on the run or like jumping over

885
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
chairs or diving out of a window.

886
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Yeah.

887
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
How do we have a villain who all he does is talk.

888
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Yeah it's they didn't figure it out.

889
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
They didn't maybe nail it.

890
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Sometimes yeah you go well how would that sustain for seven up to seven seasons and

891
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
this wouldn't have.

892
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
No because I started collapsing.

893
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
The other thing that it started falling apart for me and there's you know we could talk

894
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
about some of these other villains who I like but I think where I really checked out was

895
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
by around episode 11 and I'm like there's been so many episodes in a row where Jackal

896
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,000
drives up in a car with another guy and those used to be famous like Shirley Jones or LeVar

897
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Burton.

898
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Yeah I don't know who they are and they always have a gun that's a weird kind of gun.

899
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yeah that you know this one's like a mulch farmer so he fires worms at you.

900
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Yeah.

901
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Or this one is this was a that's a fake one but a real one is a dentist with a like a

902
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,000
like a like a drill that shoots lightning or one is a garbage man who has a gun that

903
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
fires trash bags.

904
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Yeah.

905
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Oh man it's always some weird.

906
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Chris Angel had that when you saw his show.

907
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
He had a gun that shot the garbage.

908
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I was being in a big wind tunnel of trash bags.

909
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
He was the ultimate trash man.

910
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
So you know it wore out its welcome a little bit.

911
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Compare that to in a very early episode the first episode actually.

912
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
He says one I guess it would be Dr.

913
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Gus Lloyd says I programmed dozens of them very optimistic of the writers that there

914
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
was going to be dozens of episode.

915
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I programmed dozens of villains in this game which also means again a lot of these villains

916
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:35,000
based on people he has garages against he has dozens of like ex ex mechanics who slighted

917
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:42,000
him dentist garbage men his mother-in-law his practical Joker friend and then also Sebastian

918
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Jackal who seemingly made out of whole cloth like made from scratch.

919
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Well you know I think I think we could get maybe it's time to we might as well reveal

920
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
it but I do feel fucked up and I will go watch it.

921
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:06,000
No this is well this is this is pretty exciting in in episode four the end of Jackal.

922
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And the end of Jack two major things happen.

923
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,000
One of them is that well here's this is a before I saw this episode I saw this bizarre

924
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,000
fact in the Wikipedia which is a lot to get all at once without knowing the context.

925
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Baseball cards do great harm to Jackal especially Mickey Mantle's rookie card to destroy Jackal

926
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
one needs an autographed Bobby Mercer baseball card.

927
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:33,000


928
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
When this is a ball this either one is wrong.

929
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Right.

930
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
It's a ball.

931
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
By Mercer baseball ball but baseball ball when hit with it.

932
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,000
When hit with enough baseball cards Jackal's suit turns red.

933
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Yes.

934
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Revealing him to be Gus's interpretation of Satan.

935
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Yes.

936
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
So reveal number one.

937
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Is Satan in the end of Jackal they hit him and then he turns red kind of like a video

938
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
game when like you would fight be rock steady and they would start glowing red at the sort

939
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
of the end.

940
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
So if you listener thought that all right these guys have shown all their cards this

941
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
is a white suited villain and I'm not going to listen anymore.

942
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Guess what.

943
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Yeah.

944
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
He's got a red suited villain.

945
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
He's got a red suit and he's the devil.

946
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
So Dr. Gus Lloyd is scared of the devil.

947
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Well.

948
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Well.

949
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Yes.

950
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Or is it his father.

951
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Well.

952
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Well.

953
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
You are.

954
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Yes.

955
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Correct.

956
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
No one else to play that.

957
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Sebastian Jackal is the most obvious possible.

958
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
It is the most obvious.

959
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Who do you have the most complicated relationship with.

960
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Yeah.

961
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Who slighted you the most.

962
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Jordan Kenneth Lloyd the father.

963
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Lloyd of Dr. Gus Lloyd Christopher Lloyd is Jordan Kenneth Lloyd.

964
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
So yes at the end of this episode where they think they've defeated Jackal forever they

965
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,000
go to meet Gus's father and imagine the ex-wife.

966
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
She never met the father it seems.

967
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
He's very surprised.

968
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Well you've spent a whole episode running from Jackal and we killed it.

969
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
He's gone.

970
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Jackal's dead.

971
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And who walks into this book this mansion party you're at.

972
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
But Jackal.

973
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
But it's not Jackal.

974
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
It's your ex-husband's father.

975
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Jordan Kenneth Lloyd your father.

976
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
This is the most.

977
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
This is like a pretty clean premise.

978
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:39,000
The Cathy Ireland episode without Jackal is so like OK I programmed this cover girl into

979
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
the game and she's really into you.

980
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And then he seems like he's about to get back together with the ex-wife.

981
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
But then Jackal is communicating just from within the computer which he hadn't done a

982
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
lot before.

983
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Like there's a lot more plates in the you know spinning in the next one.

984
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I'm assuming because they have to bring Jackal they have to get it back.

985
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Probably by this point Chris agree is like all right what does it actually mean for me

986
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
to be in an episode.

987
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
What is the thinnest definition of in the show you can imagine.

988
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Yeah Christopher Lloyd also great turn as a father in nobody.

989
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
The Bob Odenkirk movie.

990
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Very funny.

991
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Yeah buddy wait but he's not the devil or he's not a video game.

992
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
No he's not.

993
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Why am I watching nobody.

994
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Well but there is a reveal about the father.

995
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
OK cool.

996
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
He's God.

997
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Well he's kind of got the power.

998
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Everyone's kind of God is very cool with guns.

999
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:49,000
If you like shootouts and they reveal a cool reveal of who the adopted brother is too.

1000
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
OK.

1001
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
In nobody I don't want to ruin it.

1002
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Christopher Lloyd also in that Seth MacFarlane West Wild West movie.

1003
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
A million ways to die in the West.

1004
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
As Doc Brown basically.

1005
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Oh right.

1006
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Yeah that was another one you said.

1007
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Christopher Lloyd likes to work.

1008
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Yeah.

1009
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Let's just say that.

1010
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I'll say this.

1011
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Surely Jones likes to work.

1012
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
You look at her IMDB.

1013
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
She's still working quite a bit.

1014
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Recently.

1015
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Recently.

1016
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Good for her.

1017
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I feel like you had something else about this this devil father episode.

1018
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I forgot it.

1019
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
If I did.

1020
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I may have but I there's so many things going around.

1021
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I'm living a little bit and jackal and in my head and living a little bit in scat land in my head.

1022
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Oh you know.

1023
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I've got well I've got jackal on one shoulder and scat man John on the other.

1024
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
More tangents kid.

1025
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
You got him.

1026
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Keep him in this garage all day.

1027
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
On the other shoulder.

1028
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
It's give it about papa.

1029
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Just scat to the episodes over.

1030
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Thanks guys.

1031
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Here's well then.

1032
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Yeah they defeat jackal in this episode with this autographed baseball.

1033
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
But then when they meet the father he lovingly brings up the baseball.

1034
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Yeah.

1035
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
And they talk about going to baseball games together when he was a kid.

1036
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
And he says.

1037
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I wrote it down as you you the kid.

1038
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Eight.

1039
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
That can't be right.

1040
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
You the kid eight four hot dogs.

1041
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And one baseball.

1042
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
And one baseball.

1043
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
And then the ex wife says wow four hot dogs for the kid.

1044
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
So the.

1045
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:29,000
So the thing that he says as a villain is something that the father says to him in real life and it seems loving.

1046
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
But am I wrong that the father seems like a lovely man.

1047
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
No they.

1048
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Yes I was expecting.

1049
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:44,000
OK here we're going to see like that cold kind of monster which would inspire him to make a video game where the most evil man who is the devil is the bad guy.

1050
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
But yes he is not showing that to us in that scene.

1051
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I don't know if maybe he some some older men they relax as they get older and they maybe they weren't as big of a monster as when they were raising their kid when the kid was little.

1052
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Well maybe the.

1053
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Yeah what if the actual what we don't see is that the doc Jordan Lloyd had a fire cane in real life.

1054
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
So he he's relaxed.

1055
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
But when I was a kid he'd have he'd blast him with that fire cane every day.

1056
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Yeah.

1057
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Yeah maybe yes B plus not an A.

1058
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
You know what to do.

1059
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Go get your fire cane.

1060
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Go get my fire cane so I can shoot it at you.

1061
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
That's what you say.

1062
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Yeah.

1063
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Or no hot dogs for dinner.

1064
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Very possible.

1065
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
It was the original helicopter parent and I would toss you out of a helicopter.

1066
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Which does happen in the pilot.

1067
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Well Dr.

1068
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Gus Louis almost falls out of helicopter.

1069
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I should believe they missed that opportunity.

1070
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
But kill shot does the.

1071
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Player shot falls to a watery grave because his weakness was water and he falls into a big lake.

1072
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
That's another lame thing about the show that it's also OK.

1073
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
How do we have a show where a villain just talks in rooms and doesn't aside from sometimes a fire cane.

1074
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Not much happens.

1075
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:08,000
The the other then it's like OK it's got to be an action show but it's kind of a family network a little.

1076
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
So no blood and no guns no.

1077
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Yeah right right.

1078
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:19,000
So this video game construct gives us the premise that the villains are all defeated by weird things.

1079
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
As I said baseball cards.

1080
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:27,000
What happens in that is that the ex-wife puts a baseball card in his pocket and his suit turns red.

1081
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Instead of this there's no gun is not the simplicity of a gun and you kill a guy.

1082
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
But everybody else it's like it's like water guns or even I think in one case juice.

1083
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
The.

1084
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
You.

1085
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Yeah.

1086
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Somebody with dirt.

1087
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Yeah.

1088
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
The.

1089
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Oh my God I'm blanking which I guess it's the oh no.

1090
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
So dirt is one I think it's the mother in law.

1091
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Yeah the mother is Charlie Jones it's dirt but when it's the garbage man it's cleaning products.

1092
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
OK OK.

1093
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:05,000
So this man he makes a video game where he can throw a bunch of dirt on his mother.

1094
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Well yeah you blast her with like a dirt gun at some point and then it turns out it's actually surely Jones it's not evil surely.

1095
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Yeah.

1096
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
What I wouldn't give to.

1097
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Blast my mother in law with a bunch of dirt.

1098
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Hey.

1099
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Eat dirt gun.

1100
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,000
This is really yes this is like your 90s like man.

1101
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Fanta like.

1102
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Yeah.

1103
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Kathy Ireland's there and you get to blast your mother in law with dirt.

1104
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
It's like the two things that most dads in the 90s were thinking about.

1105
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Yeah.

1106
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Rooted for we're cheering the guy who wants to shoot an old lady with dirt.

1107
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,000
So your ex wife is a fool for divorcing you.

1108
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
So you have to get her back by never leaving her alone like everything.

1109
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,000
If you stripped every of you explain this show very dryly it's like oh is this a horror show.

1110
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Very troubling.

1111
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
You wake up if you woke any of our dads up in the middle of the night in 1994 you'd be like what do you want.

1112
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Shoot my mother in law with dirt and Kathy Ireland at my door.

1113
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Yeah.

1114
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I just want to go to both of them.

1115
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
The big inventor show in the parking lot.

1116
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Acts of terror.

1117
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Yeah that's a big the the Levar Burton episode kind of that one at least has some the sci fi element of like he's the boss.

1118
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,000
He's a boss who fires you and he's got a glove that shoots exploding pink slips.

1119
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I have this little clip.

1120
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Please.

1121
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Yeah.

1122
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Now this is before they had worn out the bizarre guns.

1123
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I think we're still in good good territory here.

1124
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
This is episode three.

1125
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Just what kind of flip side security operation are you running here mister.

1126
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
You're fired.

1127
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
What the hell is that.

1128
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
What do you think it is.

1129
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Exploding pink slip.

1130
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Come on.

1131
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
What do you think it is.

1132
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
It is.

1133
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Exploding pink slip.

1134
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And yeah he does have a robotic arm that just a little pink slip reloads Terminator style.

1135
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Terminated.

1136
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
And he fires.

1137
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:28,000
There's a lot of shooting of like people don't explode a lot but like a trash can will or just a shed that's nearby.

1138
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Anything around is fair game.

1139
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Levar Burton has a very funny funny in that it's a very strange delivery.

1140
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
He pulls like a guy out of a truck cab and he goes get down out of the cab driver.

1141
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
You're punching out early today.

1142
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:52,000
With like that level of excitement and he's just like hey man maybe ask for another take on that.

1143
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Maybe maybe run that back.

1144
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Maybe also cut that line in half.

1145
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Like they were handing out second takes on deadly.

1146
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I think you could get a second.

1147
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I was just like that's such a mouthful to say what you're trying to like.

1148
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Why did you make him say that much.

1149
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Most of these episodes look like they have the budget of a Power Rangers episode like the original Power Rangers.

1150
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I was going to say it very much reminds me of a theme park stunt show.

1151
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,000
If you took the budget of a theme park stunt show and tried to shoot a television show with it.

1152
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Every episode has like three things where you go oh and then at the end credits they show them all again.

1153
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
So they kind of get like a second little bang for the buck.

1154
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Which are like a lot of the humor that I hate to say this because I was looking for things that I could play in the episode.

1155
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
And a lot of them it's just it's all about looks and weird yells.

1156
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I'll try to post as much to the socials as I can just because some of the scenes little snippets of scenes I think are not the ones that are not far from like Walker Texas Ranger lever style.

1157
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Like what the fuck's going on there.

1158
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
But a lot don't quite translate.

1159
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
You know you have to see Jackal.

1160
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Okay you have to see Gus looking like a cheap Rambo like a dollar store Rambo.

1161
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:20,000
And he's shooting a football player with a gun with a hose and then the hose stops working.

1162
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:26,000
And then Jackal shows that he's got a little knife that he sliced the knife.

1163
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
A straight razor.

1164
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Isn't it like what an old barber would use and he cut a hose with it.

1165
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
He cut a hose with it.

1166
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
And then I mean I'll play just the end.

1167
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
This is more for us I think than the listener.

1168
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I don't know how much it will read.

1169
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Then a Jeep drives away and a football player throws an exploding football.

1170
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
It blows up and says game over.

1171
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Tombstones pop up.

1172
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
That's okay.

1173
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
So what they knew of video games appeared to be game over.

1174
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Villains or bosses.

1175
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And that's kind of it.

1176
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Yeah because there's no nothing silly shows up in this.

1177
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:17,000
There's no bowser's or like you know little minions running around.

1178
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
It's just yeah there's essentially kids.

1179
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,000
It's all it's long psychological torture sessions with one other human.

1180
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Yeah and like a self-contained episodes with a very thin through line.

1181
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:43,000
If you go back and look at some of the creators of this show they worked on a lot of like A-Team kind of shows or like Journeyman.

1182
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I got to shout this out.

1183
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
This was so weird to discover.

1184
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
The one creator and writer Paul Birnbaum.

1185
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Did you guys look him up?

1186
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
No.

1187
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
He is like a real like an old school Journeyman writer.

1188
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:01,000
He has written the scripts for the Nick Cage kind of sci-fi vehicle Next from a few years ago.

1189
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:07,000
He wrote this script for Hollywoodland where Ben Affleck plays George Reeves.

1190
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
And the superman actor.

1191
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
And Adrian Brody is trying to figure solve the murder.

1192
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,000
And then he wrote all four Halloween Town Disney Channel original movies.

1193
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Oh wow.

1194
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
That would be Halloween Town Halloween Town 2.

1195
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Calibars Revenge Halloween Town High and of course returned to Halloween Town.

1196
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Calibar.

1197
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Calibar.

1198
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Next year Calibar episode.

1199
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Calibar.

1200
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Calibar.

1201
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I you know I did not I was Disney Channel original movies not not big in my house.

1202
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
But but we're big in Janes.

1203
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,000
And she we did watch Halloween Town around Halloween one year.

1204
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
And I think the way she got me to watch it was saying well the grandma is Debbie Reynolds.

1205
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
And I was like sign me up.

1206
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I'm there.

1207
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
You tap dance into the room.

1208
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Yeah.

1209
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
The Phantom of the Megaplex I think is the one where.

1210
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Who is Calibar?

1211
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I'm intrigued by the name.

1212
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I think he's the evil.

1213
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
I think he's the bad guy.

1214
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Did you is anything like ooze level or Jekyll level.

1215
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I'm really struggling to remember.

1216
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
You don't remember at all.

1217
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Calibar Halloween Town.

1218
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
What's it called?

1219
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
He's got a top hat.

1220
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Yeah.

1221
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
He's got a little little staff.

1222
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
He's a warlock.

1223
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
He was once the boyfriend of Gwen.

1224
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Okay.

1225
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
There's potential here.

1226
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Yeah there is potential.

1227
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I'll have to take a look and see.

1228
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Listeners can let us know if you think.

1229
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Phantom of the Megaplex a similar arc where I like jumped out of my chair when we watched

1230
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
it because I was like it's Mickey Rooney.

1231
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
The old guy who works at the movie theater.

1232
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
It's Mickey Rooney.

1233
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,200
There's a was it on the Dana Carvey David's Bay podcast where he's because Dana Carvey

1234
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,000
was on a sitcom with Mickey Rooney before Saturday Night Live.

1235
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Oh yeah.

1236
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Nathan Lane.

1237
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Yeah.

1238
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And he just has many stories of Mickey Rooney like Holt like Mickey Rooney carrying a gun

1239
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
on set with him.

1240
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
What?

1241
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
In a studio.

1242
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Just maybe had it like holster and a gun and just was a true maniac.

1243
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Just not a not a doesn't seem like exaggerated at all that he was a total crazy person.

1244
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
You but here we are lighting up about stars of yesteryear.

1245
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:19,000
We're missing that one of today's top stars makes one of their first appearances in anything

1246
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
in this show.

1247
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Did you guys catch that in this LeVar Burton episode there's a scene between Christopher

1248
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Lloyd LeVar Burton and a young Jeremy Renner.

1249
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I did.

1250
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I missed it.

1251
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Jeremy's in there.

1252
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Wow.

1253
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I got it.

1254
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,000
We saw it on IMDB and I couldn't I was on the lookout but I figured it would probably

1255
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
be so quick I would miss it.

1256
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
It's pretty fast.

1257
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Yeah.

1258
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Yeah.

1259
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
But he makes a mark.

1260
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:50,000
You look at this young mechanic or something and go boy I want to hear this guy's music

1261
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
as soon as possible.

1262
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Does heaven have a name?

1263
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
What's his take on the House of the Rising Sun?

1264
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Wow.

1265
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Man.

1266
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
That's great.

1267
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
His big break.

1268
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Yeah.

1269
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
So you can win.

1270
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:09,360
That's that's one thing to get you to head to Deadly Games Cool Show.

1271
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,680
What else is fun in this?

1272
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,920
There's just there.

1273
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:13,920
What's nice at least.

1274
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:14,920
Yes.

1275
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:21,440
The show is not is is not a good show and in a lot of episodes is not bad enough in

1276
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,240
a lot of ways.

1277
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:29,080
Some episode again the Spiner episode is good for Deadly Games but there will be at least

1278
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:34,760
a couple times they'll say Jackal in the episode which always works and it's always funny and

1279
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,680
then sometimes they say like there's one episode where they're just like Hasta la vista Jackal.

1280
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,680
Yes.

1281
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,680
Wait.

1282
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,680
Oh wait.

1283
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,680
Do I have that?

1284
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:43,680
I think I have that queued up.

1285
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,680
This is a big moment.

1286
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:45,680
This is the one that you missed.

1287
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:49,400
First of all just I want to give you a second to be shocked by this red suit.

1288
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,600
I mean that's the end of this in the episode for the end of Jackal.

1289
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:57,760
So this is after the Mickey Mantle baseball card makes his suit red and he is the devil

1290
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:04,440
now and then this is where the magic baseball is going to be thrown at him.

1291
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:07,440
So here we go.

1292
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:24,800
Hasta la vista Jackal.

1293
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,800
So that's cool.

1294
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,320
What do you want out of Christopher Lloyd?

1295
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,320
Crazy yells.

1296
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,320
Yeah.

1297
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:36,360
I mean this is really your way to get if you wanted a little more Judge Doom at kind of

1298
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:43,840
quarter speed just a lazier Judge Doom and if you didn't like the Judge Doom.

1299
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,360
I like Judge Doom but I don't like all that stuff with like a cartoons in the real world

1300
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:51,160
and Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny and stuff.

1301
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:57,880
What if instead Judge Doom was surrounded by guys who should be in sprint commercials?

1302
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:01,440
That's what the show can provide for you.

1303
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,400
I literally learned this as we started recording.

1304
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,400
Stephen Kay the guy who played Peter Walker.

1305
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,600
Oh yeah you found it huh?

1306
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:14,840
The relation the first off in 2014 he married Piper Parabot.

1307
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:15,840
Wow.

1308
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:16,840
Who he was.

1309
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,160
Well he worked on Covert Affairs.

1310
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,280
He directed and produced Covert Affairs.

1311
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,280
She was one of the stars of that.

1312
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,160
That show lasted for five seasons on USA.

1313
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:28,160
Yes.

1314
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,160
Fucking about.

1315
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,000
Covert Affairs.

1316
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:37,000
He had previously dated Desperate Housewives actresses Terry Hatcher and Eva Longoria.

1317
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Two of them?

1318
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Two of them.

1319
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,400
Wow that's like Adam Durowitz from Con and Crows dating Courtney Cox and Jennifer Aniston.

1320
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:49,760
That it's almost exactly like that because he had sure enough directed projects that

1321
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,760
they were in.

1322
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,760
Sure.

1323
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:52,760
So.

1324
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:53,760
The judge is a powerful guy you know.

1325
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:54,760
Geez.

1326
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,320
He's directed a lot.

1327
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,480
You didn't find what I was about to reference.

1328
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:03,600
He's directed many episodes of a show I have not yet watched Yellowstone.

1329
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,600
Wow.

1330
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:08,760
Hey why are we fucking around with Sebastian Jackle here when you still haven't watched

1331
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:09,760
Yellowstone?

1332
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:14,160
I haven't watched it but Stephen Kay directed maybe 13 something like that.

1333
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,920
So the fact that he played Peter Rucker is thriving.

1334
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:19,960
Yeah he directed the Sylvester Stallone movie Get Carter.

1335
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:20,960
Yeah.

1336
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:21,960
What?

1337
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:22,960
Yes.

1338
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,200
The remake of the Michael Caine one.

1339
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,640
He works a lot it looks like.

1340
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:26,640
Geez.

1341
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:27,640
Yeah he directed.

1342
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,760
Sons of Anarchy, Friday Night Lights, Quantico.

1343
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:31,760
The Shield.

1344
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:37,040
Wow I'm glad that he found maybe his true calling in directing because acting wise he

1345
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,680
is quite annoying.

1346
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:43,000
I was very happy to skip any scenes involving Peter Rucker.

1347
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
He talks to himself.

1348
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,800
He's like talking to himself and he goes why am I talking to myself?

1349
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,560
I mean that's the writing look.

1350
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,560
Yeah yeah.

1351
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:50,560
Yeah yeah.

1352
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:55,480
Yes well there's one thing that he says that there's no way to turn it into anything better

1353
01:12:55,480 --> 01:13:04,600
which is the okay the one you were saying where the prankster Schlecht.

1354
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,600
Danny Schlecht.

1355
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,600
Danny Schlecht.

1356
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,600
Yeah.

1357
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:15,040
That he puts the guy's ex-wife and his best friend Peter in a compromising position so

1358
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:18,640
So the Gus walks in and sees them in bed naked together.

1359
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:19,640
Yes.

1360
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:20,960
And what other conclusions could you draw?

1361
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,920
He doesn't know that something is afoot then this tableau was arranged.

1362
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:29,800
It was a big prank and Peter at some point says you really think I came over here to

1363
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:30,800
boink your wife?

1364
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:31,800
Oh god.

1365
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,800
Once in every 90s.

1366
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,800
Boink in reality.

1367
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:42,040
Sorry just anybody like oh come on boink me boink me.

1368
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,760
Oh boink me.

1369
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Yeah there's a lot.

1370
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,320
A network sensor or something saying stuff like that.

1371
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:54,040
There's another episode where they go to Vegas.

1372
01:13:54,040 --> 01:14:02,680
Dr. Gus Lloyd spawns his car to get money to win the back rent he has to pay but then

1373
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:08,040
goes on a losing streak and the running thread through that is that he remembers a lot of

1374
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:15,960
details from him and his ex-wife's relationship but they both keep getting stuff wrong and

1375
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:23,160
I don't like yeah just the vibe of the two main male characters is like of course we're

1376
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:28,600
guys so we're idiots and we're scumbags and we're messy but we're also geniuses.

1377
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,840
It's very strange.

1378
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:36,320
You're running through the you were running Deadly Games through the 2020s filter.

1379
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,320
Somebody had to do it.

1380
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:39,840
It's very on the nose.

1381
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,520
It's just like I don't know.

1382
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,480
Be better writers of Deadly Games.

1383
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:50,320
The show is you know what I was going to say is that it's like the thing they can do because

1384
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,840
they can't do violence but they can do horny and they can do body.

1385
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,280
They can say boink.

1386
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,280
They can do body though.

1387
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,280
They can say boink.

1388
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,600
They can talk about just what guys talk about like boinking.

1389
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:07,240
This show is a 13 episode homemade commercial that won the Doritos rocked a Super Bowl

1390
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,240
contest.

1391
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:13,160
I'm just saying it's a very European show you know because it's not as violent but it's

1392
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:17,960
very sexual so it's a lot more comfortable with that.

1393
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:23,040
And in the filmmaking too it's very surprising and experimental.

1394
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:27,040
And very obviously like if they only have one take to do things you know quick.

1395
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,640
That's how the European filmmakers work and they have a four hour lunch.

1396
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,640
Yeah.

1397
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:32,640
Sure.

1398
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:38,480
Let's run this moment here through the prism of European filmmaking.

1399
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:42,560
This is a part where I don't again I'm only watching jackal scenes.

1400
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,000
I'm surprised I caught this one because he's not even in it.

1401
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
It's just his voice.

1402
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,680
But there is an episode where I don't even know who the characters are.

1403
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:54,200
They're at I think one is the ex-wife or the other guy I don't know.

1404
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,480
They're at a drive-in theater.

1405
01:15:55,480 --> 01:16:00,240
They're there to see Ace Ventura when nature calls.

1406
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:03,560
He's very snarky about the movie.

1407
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:09,360
I don't know exactly what's going on but imagine if you were in a drive-in theater and the

1408
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:15,800
trailers were hacked by the devil himself and you're watching no mere regular trailer

1409
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:19,000
but an evil devil trailer.

1410
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:35,960
That man had the brilliance and the power to bring him to his knees and that man called

1411
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:39,520
upon the car mechanic.

1412
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:45,520
Ross Logan is the car mechanic coming much sooner than you think.

1413
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,960
Digital explosions.

1414
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,280
The audience goes nuts for that trailer.

1415
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,280
They love it.

1416
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:58,000
Glad you caught that one Scott because you don't see Sebastian Jackal but you do hear

1417
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Sebastian.

1418
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Yeah I know I almost missed it.

1419
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,760
Yeah it was very high odds I was going to miss it.

1420
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:07,080
But that's a great because you want to hear Lloyd screaming and you want to hear him shouting

1421
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:12,080
RUN RUN RUN RUN.

1422
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,480
I feel like he's a little out of character.

1423
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,760
I don't think Jackal's ever amped up to that degree but I guess you tell Jackal to narrate

1424
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:25,440
a trailer and you get Jackal times 30.

1425
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,040
He doesn't yell ever really.

1426
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,040
Jackal doesn't.

1427
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,040
He's very calm.

1428
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,120
Once in a while he gets a little intense but that's it.

1429
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:34,200
I wouldn't say he ever gets to that decibel level.

1430
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,360
More about cutting comments kid.

1431
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,840
He makes friends sometimes.

1432
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:43,360
They show up at a bowling alley at one point and Jackal's walking out with a bowling team

1433
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:48,360
and a real salt to the earth guy and the guy goes like you come by.

1434
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:53,120
We didn't think you were going to be good at bowling and then we took a chance on you.

1435
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:57,160
Come by the factory some time and we'll have some chow off the truck.

1436
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:03,000
It's like I really should have watched the credits to see if that actor was credit as

1437
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,560
like blue collar Joe blue collar man.

1438
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:13,800
My favorite condiment there is is the salt of the earth.

1439
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,040
The show is an hour long.

1440
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,040
Do we say that?

1441
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,040
That's a lot of difficulty.

1442
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:19,040
Did we say that?

1443
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,040
Because that I think is a big problem.

1444
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,240
It feels so much longer.

1445
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,960
We probably should have said that earlier.

1446
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:25,960
I get it.

1447
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:26,960
OK.

1448
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,960
That makes a lot to sustain.

1449
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,200
Yeah.

1450
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:38,440
I was hoping somebody had made a super cut of Jackal moments, but somebody has.

1451
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:41,960
It's just they put music under it and there's no dialogue.

1452
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:42,960
Oh no.

1453
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:43,960
Oh, it's a fan.

1454
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,080
It's just like the fan cams.

1455
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,080
Somebody made.

1456
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,080
Yes.

1457
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48,080
Well, somebody made here.

1458
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,080
Let me find it here.

1459
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:54,680
And it's like a non-English song, but somebody made a salute to Jackal, which I believe is

1460
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:55,680
sincere.

1461
01:18:55,680 --> 01:19:12,360
What a song.

1462
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:13,360
Perfect guitar.

1463
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,360
Mid 90s guitar.

1464
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,360
Raises toes.

1465
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:26,760
Yeah, it's like all the like he looks great in the suit and yeah.

1466
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:27,760
What is that called?

1467
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,760
What is the name of that video?

1468
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:31,480
Just as Sebastian Jackal, it was made eight years ago.

1469
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:32,480
Great.

1470
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,880
OK, so he's been represented.

1471
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:39,080
We are not the first thing to acknowledge and celebrate Sebastian Jackal, but we're the

1472
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:40,520
longest to.

1473
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:44,520
And there's one comment on the video and it says, I remember Deadly Games back in high

1474
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:49,200
school, Sebastian Jackal was an awesome villain and the user name is Bluntasaurus.

1475
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,200
Nice.

1476
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,200
Crunchy.

1477
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:59,240
Here's your poll quote for the Blu-ray Bluntasaurus restoration of Deadly Games.

1478
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:03,760
There's other again, I really was not paying attention to these last few episodes.

1479
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,040
There's one with a needle.

1480
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:11,400
We already had an evil pink slip guy and as an evil divorce lawyer who shoots, I can't

1481
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:14,320
even tell what just kind of yellow glows.

1482
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:23,200
Legal legal forms, affidavits, I don't know, but that character's plan is to electrify

1483
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:27,040
the chairs of the Supreme Court justices.

1484
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:31,400
They have to go to the Supreme Court and stop, which that's come on.

1485
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,600
Hey, don't do that.

1486
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,800
No, no, that'd be a shame.

1487
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,800
Just no.

1488
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:42,680
Those are doing five figures important in our times.

1489
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:43,680
No, no.

1490
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,680
I was.

1491
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:48,680
Do you have another?

1492
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:52,040
How many other highlights of Jackal before we I have an idea for the end?

1493
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:56,560
So make sure you take a quick good glance.

1494
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,560
This is our chance.

1495
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,360
So a gun that shoots trash bags.

1496
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,760
I said it was a part where he says he is going to.

1497
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:09,520
Well, firstly, there's a scene that he walks into and eats, eats a decorative soap out

1498
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,520
of his hand.

1499
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,600
All right.

1500
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,600
So chomp chomp.

1501
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,280
And then he's going to be messing up his house somehow.

1502
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:18,640
I think they may have blown a wall out of his house.

1503
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:24,120
And then he says, I might just put this on the inaugural cover of Jackal and homes and

1504
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,360
gardens.

1505
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,000
A lot of Jackal endeavors.

1506
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,960
He's got a lot of irons in the fire.

1507
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:29,960
Yeah.

1508
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:35,960
In the camp counselor episode where the villain is Anthony Michael Hall.

1509
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,000
Oh, yes. He's the evil camp counselor.

1510
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,560
Yeah, he's the evil camp counselor.

1511
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:45,080
That one, especially confusing for Jane to hop in on because it involves them.

1512
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:50,520
They have to go to a store called the Spy Guy, which is a guy who sells like home surveillance

1513
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:51,520
equipment.

1514
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:58,080
But the Spy Guy is not there because he's appearing on a show called Eric, a Jerry Springer

1515
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,960
type show.

1516
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:05,040
And they only know this because a guy tells them that and then says, oh, there was a sign

1517
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,040
on the door.

1518
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,600
Guess it's not there anymore.

1519
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:13,220
And they're like, oh, the camp counselor must have been here and taken the sign with him.

1520
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:17,200
And this is after the camp counselor drains their bank accounts.

1521
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:23,380
So that was a bad one to hop in on because there are like that's like five subplots that

1522
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:25,880
are this is all very unnecessary.

1523
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:27,080
It's very confusing.

1524
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:32,760
You got even more confusion there because it's a daytime show called Eric spelled with

1525
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,080
a K.

1526
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:39,600
And then you're in the studio and you see photos in the green room of Eric Estrada.

1527
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:45,440
But then the show starts and it's like, here's your guest host, Jimmy Walker.

1528
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:51,560
And then Jimmy JJ Walker is the host of Eric, a show that context clues tells us, tell us

1529
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:54,200
are you is usually hosted by Eric Estrada.

1530
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,280
Huh?

1531
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,320
Why do we need to process all this?

1532
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,960
And what happened to make this have?

1533
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:04,720
I think that they got bailed on by Eric Estrada.

1534
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:12,200
He like somebody offered him free lunch or like a convention was going to pay him more

1535
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,720
going to pay him more than sorry.

1536
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:15,720
Nothing I can do.

1537
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:19,760
So they're like, crap, can we get Jimmy Walker here within the hour?

1538
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,520
And the answer was they could.

1539
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,240
So but what they couldn't do was repaint all this side.

1540
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,400
They can't make a bunch of Jimmy signs.

1541
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,400
Somebody started.

1542
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,400
They only got the Jay done.

1543
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,640
All right.

1544
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:30,640
Nevermind.

1545
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:31,640
He's a guest host of Eric.

1546
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:34,760
Go and you are watching much more closely than you alluded to.

1547
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,680
Well, I well, yeah, there's huge parts I would I would bail on.

1548
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:43,280
But I think if I see media, if I see a movie trailer or I see a show, I mean, I got to

1549
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:48,240
know the details with the show and what details Eric guest host Eric and issues based talk

1550
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:52,720
show, not like a comedy show, guest hosted by Jimmy Walker.

1551
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,960
Everyone involved in the show is a goofball.

1552
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,760
Why are they doing daytime shows?

1553
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:00,160
And they're talking about like controlling relationships.

1554
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:06,800
That's why they have a surveillance expert on to, I guess, explain how people could watch

1555
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,120
the people trying to control.

1556
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:14,160
So it's whatever message is unclear.

1557
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:17,680
It's so much of this is just like, yeah, we got to get this script on and we got to shoot

1558
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:20,800
this in five days, four days, probably.

1559
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:25,820
That one you end up the I think the grand plan and that one involves causing damage

1560
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:27,900
at the ultimate camp Camp David.

1561
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:32,460
So there's a part where there's jogging and then just this is in part two.

1562
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:38,020
Maybe you might miss this. But late in part two, they cut to the jogging group and of

1563
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:40,180
Secret Service agents and then the president.

1564
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:43,500
Like it is Bill Clinton, not actually him.

1565
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:47,340
But they you think, OK, so they're going to show this from a distance and imply Bill

1566
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:49,100
Clinton. But then it gets way closer.

1567
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:52,180
And there's a little scene of somebody talking to President Clinton.

1568
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:56,740
You're just showing Clinton in the show and it's just some guy like

1569
01:24:56,740 --> 01:25:00,700
you're sure the season to you've heightened to the president.

1570
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:07,300
And then you're going to the few episodes later, they might pour toxic sludge

1571
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:11,260
at the top of the Hollywood Bowl where it would cascade down through the crowd.

1572
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:14,100
Oh, yeah. And he is playing that night.

1573
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:16,100
I missed that detail. That's it there.

1574
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:18,700
It's a Tom Fetty Hollywood Bowl.

1575
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:20,420
Tom Fetty Hollywood Bowl concert.

1576
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:27,660
Unless I missed it by a country mile, I did not see Tom Fetty because most of the

1577
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:29,460
climax takes place.

1578
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:36,100
Not like an over overlook where the Hollywood sign is in the background.

1579
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:40,660
I believe it's the overlook right above the Hollywood dog park, which is a mile away

1580
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:42,980
from the Hollywood Bowl in the other direction.

1581
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:45,140
Yeah, you think that, oh, we're going to get some real stuff here.

1582
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:47,220
This is going to be a big fight at a concert.

1583
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:48,780
And then they go, look, that service road.

1584
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:50,940
Go up there. Go up the service road.

1585
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:55,300
We have the stock footage of a crowded Hollywood Bowl concert from the back row.

1586
01:25:56,380 --> 01:26:00,860
Jackal succeeds. Then all these people from a concert six years ago will be dead.

1587
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:05,380
I have one more line. I have one line.

1588
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:07,220
Oh, yes. Not said by Jackal.

1589
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:09,300
I think it's said by Detective Dorn.

1590
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:14,020
And he says at the end of a scene, he goes, I'm going to be going to see

1591
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:15,420
Beatlemania tonight.

1592
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:17,820
Ringo's playing himself.

1593
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:20,380
OK, great.

1594
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:22,220
Pretty. Yeah.

1595
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:23,380
Ringo Dig.

1596
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:27,100
Beatlemania, pretty big in the 90s, I think that like cover.

1597
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:28,780
Yeah, the cover band. Yeah.

1598
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:31,700
A good reference.

1599
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:35,180
There's a lot of good like comedy go to references.

1600
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:39,060
There's a sheer amount of mentions of like, well, oh, that's the other.

1601
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:42,020
Yeah. Shirley Jones, the villain, Shirley Jones,

1602
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:45,140
his mother and Lully always thought was cold.

1603
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:48,140
So she shoots ice bolts.

1604
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:52,740
You know, finally, what we all think about our mothers in law,

1605
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:54,860
the truth portrayed on.

1606
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:56,700
Yeah. A figurative cold.

1607
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:59,660
Not the literal.

1608
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:01,540
My mother-in-law listens to this, I believe.

1609
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:04,620
Oh, just kidding, man.

1610
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:07,220
No, no shade and no dirt guns.

1611
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:09,020
No, no good dirt.

1612
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:12,540
Coming your way, but you do have two tickets to a mysterious cruise.

1613
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:16,220
My favorite Jackal monologue is this.

1614
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:21,980
It's about camps, horseback riding canoeing, water skiing.

1615
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:25,940
The very idea of summer camp makes my stomach turn.

1616
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:30,180
These children should be doing something useful, like working long hours

1617
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:33,540
and a sweatshop producing Jackal memorabilia.

1618
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:40,740
I mean, there needs to be a supercut of the Jackal scenes.

1619
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:41,540
Yeah, yeah.

1620
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:44,980
If somebody needs to do that, I'll throw some clips up at least, if not a supercut.

1621
01:27:44,980 --> 01:27:46,780
I'll do a cut. You don't have to do supercut.

1622
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:49,300
I'm just saying I'm just saying that's what it should be.

1623
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:52,340
Some cuts. But so where are you heading with?

1624
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:54,980
Well, I do. We know we talked about it earlier.

1625
01:27:54,980 --> 01:28:00,340
Like if we really could think about who would be in our deadly games game.

1626
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:02,340
And I was just thinking we could start from the point of

1627
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:07,900
number one would be the person that told us we couldn't get a seat at Ballast

1628
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:10,260
Point at downtown Disney a few weeks ago.

1629
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:13,780
Yeah, right. That would be one of our villains of the week.

1630
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:17,380
The hostess at Ballast Point, downtown Disney.

1631
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:19,820
Who shoots little

1632
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:27,140
she shoots a restaurant buzzers, but not good.

1633
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:28,620
Yeah, not because it'll ever be.

1634
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:33,700
All it does is attach itself to you and buzz you to death, buzz you till you explode.

1635
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:35,380
Right. Yes.

1636
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:39,580
And then I guess you can defeat her by somehow getting

1637
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:44,300
the reservation reservation for the restaurant.

1638
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:46,500
Well, you squeeze you squeeze grapefruit.

1639
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:50,060
Oh, well, that yes, we give a shit about grapefruit.

1640
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:53,820
Jason would have to like the arc for Jason in the episode

1641
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:58,140
would be begrudgingly acknowledging that we should be shit about the grapefruit.

1642
01:28:58,420 --> 01:29:00,980
You know, after today, I do give a shit about grapefruit.

1643
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:03,100
You should have a grapefruit.

1644
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:06,420
But yeah, you know, you can all obviously our dads are all jackals.

1645
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:08,340
Yeah, every scenario.

1646
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:10,380
Imagine your dad and everyone listen at home.

1647
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:13,820
Imagine your dad in a white suit, dripping champagne.

1648
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:16,460
That's your own personal jackal.

1649
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:18,220
So we all have jackals.

1650
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:21,380
I just turned mine into John Hammond.

1651
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:23,300
The classic white suit.

1652
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:24,420
Yeah, it's short sleeve.

1653
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:26,540
Hammond would have the short sleeve. That's true. Yeah.

1654
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:30,020
But yeah, if any other slice you can think of,

1655
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:35,580
I'm trying to think, you know, they didn't have the jelly donut at Dunkin

1656
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:39,100
a couple of weeks ago that I had ordered via the mobile app.

1657
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:41,900
Although they were very nice now to think about and give me a different donut

1658
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:43,740
and more of them to make up for it.

1659
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:46,580
So they are not on the villain list as I'm talking through this.

1660
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:48,220
But it's something they could have been.

1661
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:50,980
They were they were they could have been put in your deadly game.

1662
01:29:50,980 --> 01:29:52,620
They were close. Yeah.

1663
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:53,740
One false move.

1664
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:56,540
Well, wait, and that also added another wrinkle

1665
01:29:56,540 --> 01:30:02,620
because you sent me a screen grab of a local, not a next door post.

1666
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:03,540
Or like a Facebook.

1667
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:05,820
I'm on the Burbank Bank Facebook group.

1668
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:10,500
And someone said I was at the Dunkin Donuts and they told me

1669
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:14,420
they were all from different stores that the entire staff had quit the day before.

1670
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:15,620
I think that happened two weeks ago.

1671
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:18,100
The entire staff of the Dunkin Donuts over here in Burbank quit.

1672
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:19,300
Whoa. Yeah.

1673
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:22,300
Hmm. But no, they probably have some deadly games.

1674
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:24,260
Whoever caused that walk.

1675
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:27,660
Whoever was the boss of the franchise owner, the franchise owner,

1676
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:30,740
the local Dunkin Donuts franchise owner can be a villain.

1677
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:34,500
The dunker, the dunker, Sebastian Dunkle.

1678
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:37,060
Yeah, that's good.

1679
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:38,740
Better check your bags.

1680
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:40,540
There might be something wrong in there.

1681
01:30:40,540 --> 01:30:41,260
Mm hmm.

1682
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:42,020
Jason, did you get to know?

1683
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:45,180
Is there anybody get an order wrong lately when you were getting any food or?

1684
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:49,700
I just when I I went inside to pick up a mobile order recently,

1685
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:51,100
it was just kind of chaos.

1686
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:52,700
OK, it's just like 20.

1687
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:54,940
I'm talking about in general, though, if you picked up food

1688
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:56,540
and like the sauce was wrong.

1689
01:30:56,540 --> 01:31:00,300
I they have they have like shut the window and been like, have a good day.

1690
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:02,020
And I'm like, I had food.

1691
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:03,540
I had sandwich. Huh?

1692
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:05,260
Oh, just a fast food.

1693
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:08,380
Whatever whoever was there was like almost sent.

1694
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:09,820
You're still talking about Dunkin, aren't you?

1695
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:12,060
My order. Yeah, I'm talking about just over.

1696
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:12,660
Just a general.

1697
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:14,140
It doesn't have to be Dunkin related.

1698
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:15,780
That's what I'm saying. Yeah.

1699
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:17,220
I'm saying, do you have any food?

1700
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:18,940
Yeah, I got a was.

1701
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:21,100
I think everyone has dealt with this at some point.

1702
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,420
A broken McDonald's ice cream machine.

1703
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:25,220
Sure. Yeah, yeah.

1704
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:28,740
And the recently one there is that is there someone to do?

1705
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:31,860
Do you pin that ultimately on the CEO?

1706
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:34,300
I would be that the installer.

1707
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:36,780
Oh, yeah, it could be whoever is in charge of equipment.

1708
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:38,220
I mean, there's one repair.

1709
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:41,900
There's one company that makes them who sends out repair people.

1710
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:46,620
But I feel like who's ever in charge of McDonald's industrial equipment supply?

1711
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:52,620
The supply man, the warehouse guy, the supplier.

1712
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:58,500
Yeah. OK, so how does this so he installs shoddy ice cream.

1713
01:31:58,580 --> 01:32:01,700
Right. Machines.

1714
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:04,020
It is in elevated Jackal.

1715
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:04,900
What is that like?

1716
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:10,540
Does he have the power to like the point at them and then they get electrified?

1717
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:14,300
Do they blow up or just shoot ice cream everywhere that blinds you?

1718
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:15,940
It's got to be an ice cream gun, I think.

1719
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:17,220
Oh, it's just an ice gun.

1720
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:21,420
I think he simplified it just out a like not standardized,

1721
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:23,900
somewhat liquefied amounts.

1722
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:26,300
Like, yeah, this is not up to company standards.

1723
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:30,340
I think like just an ice cream man, like a white suited good humor man.

1724
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:31,140
Oh, that's good.

1725
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:36,620
Like so another like and so then Jackal can go like, I like this guy's style.

1726
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:39,660
Your dad, Jackal. Huh?

1727
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:42,940
Yeah, personal dad, Jackal.

1728
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:46,380
You must he must have been shopping at the Jackal's warehouse.

1729
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:50,660
You're going to like the way I look.

1730
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:51,860
It's a guarantee.

1731
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:57,260
It's also good to think of your personal dad, Jackal's weakness as well.

1732
01:32:57,620 --> 01:33:01,100
Like how Jackal has the baseball card or the baseball.

1733
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:04,500
Which so the weakness is something good and nice.

1734
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:07,860
You write dad that you associate your dad with.

1735
01:33:07,940 --> 01:33:09,780
Right. And that's the Achilles.

1736
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:11,540
That's the Jackal Achilles heel.

1737
01:33:11,540 --> 01:33:16,220
Yeah. Yeah. My dad runs canned food drives at the church.

1738
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:19,300
So he is is a can of cream corn.

1739
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:20,580
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1740
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:21,900
Create. Yeah.

1741
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:26,820
I have to throw canned corn at my dad to get back at him for

1742
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:28,940
helping all those needy people.

1743
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:29,740
OK, good. Yeah.

1744
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:31,900
Can corn and pie stuff instead of me.

1745
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:34,660
He was helping all these people and Jackal at Jackal.

1746
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:37,340
Now your dad, your private Jackal, your personal.

1747
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:39,020
Everyone has a personal Jackal.

1748
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:40,580
Everyone has a personal Jackal.

1749
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:42,580
You have to return.

1750
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:47,060
You give your Jackal the twenty dollars that he would have given you

1751
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:49,660
when he heard you were, oh, you're going to mall with the friends.

1752
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:51,580
Here you go. Have fun.

1753
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:54,780
And I slice him with it. Yeah.

1754
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:57,980
Don't help me have a good time.

1755
01:33:57,980 --> 01:34:00,340
My dad, I guess my dad,

1756
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:03,380
when I asked for a guitar, he just gave me one of his old guitars.

1757
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:05,900
When I was 16, maybe it's a guitar.

1758
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:08,180
I like to smash it over his head.

1759
01:34:08,420 --> 01:34:10,900
Jeffrey Jackal's head, not my dad.

1760
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:17,060
The computer Jeffrey Jackal, which is my father's villainous avatar, I guess.

1761
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:19,140
Yeah. What do you think?

1762
01:34:19,140 --> 01:34:20,100
What do you want your dad?

1763
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:21,740
What's your villain dad? How do you get to feed?

1764
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:24,380
How do you defeat him? Oh, how do I defeat him?

1765
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:26,260
Hmm. Yeah.

1766
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:27,740
Well, that's what I think.

1767
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:29,220
That's what I was saying for mine.

1768
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:30,820
They give the 20.

1769
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:34,540
You give him the 20 or you turn the 20 like, oh, he gave me this

1770
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:37,300
20 dollar bill because he heard I was going to the mall.

1771
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:39,780
Turn into a paper airplane or something, throw it back.

1772
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:41,500
OK, all right.

1773
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:44,820
Buy yourself something demonic. Yeah.

1774
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:49,860
So let's hear. Tell us what your personal Jackal.

1775
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:52,180
I have a I think in terms of

1776
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:56,700
slights to put into my own deadly game, I have a

1777
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:00,340
I'm coming up with a boss named the co-host.

1778
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:06,980
And what the co-host does is keep bringing up this scat oriented.

1779
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:11,420
OK, place or album or premise.

1780
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:14,500
Right over and over again.

1781
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:18,220
And he also goes by Narleson.

1782
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:21,100
OK, and I guess you would defeat him.

1783
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:24,500
So you just you know, you're when he's around, your ears just get flooded

1784
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:26,860
with nothing but scatting. Right. Of course.

1785
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:32,340
So I guess I have to like electrify the microphone wire.

1786
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:36,300
I do or do I just throw them?

1787
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:37,540
I just throw the microphone.

1788
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:39,420
You throw the microphone and then you don't care.

1789
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:42,940
Although that might be too violent for the show.

1790
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:44,140
Yeah, it might be too violent.

1791
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:46,940
You might want to do like a thing where like you're like a humor

1792
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:49,700
and talk to him with a microphone for like

1793
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:55,220
60 to 90 minutes and just let him go go on about scatting.

1794
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:57,460
What's the opposite of scatting?

1795
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:59,220
Just clear, clear talking.

1796
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:01,740
I guess they're. Yeah, I guess so.

1797
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:06,100
That is. So I have to hack your headphone.

1798
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:09,060
His head for the co-hosts headphones play

1799
01:36:09,580 --> 01:36:12,820
clear sounding audio that isn't rhythmic or

1800
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:15,860
scatish in any way.

1801
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:18,460
I can think of the most deadly games villains for you.

1802
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:21,940
Yeah, like like the the punk rocker,

1803
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:25,140
which is Billy Joe Armstrong.

1804
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:28,980
I guess I have a massed a lot of villains on this show specifically.

1805
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:31,180
The punk rocker.

1806
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:33,700
The never the never grow up or the never.

1807
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:34,460
Yeah.

1808
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:37,900
Never grow up pervert little boy in a green unit.

1809
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:42,740
But yeah, I mean, we can we can talk about guest star.

1810
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:44,220
We would have guest stars to.

1811
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:47,140
You know, I haven't missed a lot of villains lately, which is people

1812
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:51,380
tweeting at me pictures of Peter Pan from the Chip and Dale movie.

1813
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:52,300
Yes, I see.

1814
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:55,460
Yes, there's like I'm up to like 50 villains, I think.

1815
01:36:57,860 --> 01:36:59,420
Yeah, so I don't know.

1816
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:03,340
I mean, the way imagination can run wild with the universe of deadly games.

1817
01:37:03,340 --> 01:37:07,420
And yeah, what it opens up, what this show carved out

1818
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:13,140
with its unique premise of putting people who've slightly annoyed you.

1819
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:16,780
Yeah. But casting them as the devil and especially

1820
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:21,180
your father, who seems very lovely once you've. Yeah.

1821
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:25,060
Actually, I have to reverse engineer it where I drive my

1822
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:30,540
dad, Sebastian Jackal, to the mall on Wednesday for new comic book day.

1823
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:33,220
I trick him.

1824
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:35,780
This is, you know what?

1825
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:37,900
I think the lesson of this

1826
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:41,780
after all this time, the build up to Sebastian Jackal and the episode itself.

1827
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:44,460
I think the message is go hug your dad.

1828
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:46,980
Your dad's not a jackal.

1829
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:51,180
Your dad's no devil, no matter what kind of suit and hat he's wearing.

1830
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:53,740
I've met a few. I've met a few actual jackals.

1831
01:37:53,740 --> 01:37:56,300
But yeah, I mean, if you look, you're right.
