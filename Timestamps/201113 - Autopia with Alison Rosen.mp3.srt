1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,760
Warning, the following podcast contains insider lingo, a giant speakerphone, walking in pursuit

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,520
of cake and children burning rubber.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,840
Alison Rosen joins us to race around a track at a reasonable speed and talk utopia on today's

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,280
podcast, The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,920
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the podcast about theme parks where we sometimes struggle to

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,560
breathe over the heavy gasoline emissions from the power of our recording equipment.

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,400
I'm Scott Gardner, I fumbled there due to the emissions.

10
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,000
Mike Carlson is here as well.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,080
Yes, I'm here.

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm also fumbling over the emissions that I'm smelling.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I do.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sure we'll get into it.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,640
I sometimes like the smell of gas, but just a little bit.

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
That's all.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,560
That'll be a tease for the episode for my take.

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
Anyway.

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,960
I guess I know what you mean.

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
A little bit.

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,600
That's not so bizarre, Jason Sheridan.

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,760
Opinions on the smell of gas.

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,640
Beep, beep, zoom, zoom, Scott.

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,720
I do like it.

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,720
I know what Mike is saying.

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,960
I do like it sometimes, but it might be time to go move on.

28
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,680
I think gas more than exhaust is what I'm saying.

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
Yes.

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,560
Gas itself versus exhaust.

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,920
And exhaust is what the utopia, of course, provides.

32
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
Interesting.

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
Okay.

34
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,240
Well, we'll parse these differences as we get into it.

35
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,760
Hey, it's the utopia today.

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
It's a big one.

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,760
And we got a great guest to talk about it with us from the podcast.

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,240
Allison Rosen is your new best friend and childish.

39
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,520
It's Allison Rosen.

40
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,520
Hello.

41
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
Hey.

42
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,520
Hello.

43
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,640
I don't care for the smell of gas at all, although I think farts are very funny.

44
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:16,720
And my, I have two, two young sons and they, and my husband and I, we all think toots are

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,520
hilarious, but actual gasoline, no.

46
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,200
The other definition of gas, certainly.

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
That's got to help.

48
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,560
As I was telling you before, I newly have a baby and you, you have to be comfortable

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,880
with the casual farting.

50
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,520
I know just from that point, I imagine the farts don't go away as the years go by.

51
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,960
Well, my kids are three and a half and one and a half, so we're still in prime fart territory.

52
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,680
I don't know at what age, like at some point they're going to get some kind of embarrassment

53
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,160
about it, I'm sure.

54
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,280
And I already feel sad about that.

55
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,280
That's like a loss of innocence in a way.

56
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,640
That's childhood disappearing.

57
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,080
They're tooting their truth right now.

58
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,640
Yeah, but you got to get them in those etiquette classes at some point, you know, like every

59
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,960
modern child in America, you got to have like, the fork goes on this side.

60
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,880
Jason, you have to feel shame.

61
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,800
Little Lord Fauntleroy's etiquette school as a child.

62
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,440
Yeah, Little Lord Fauntleroy's Academy.

63
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:24,320
I actually went to Cotillion and I'm a very non, I know that that suggests that I'm a

64
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,640
certain kind of horrible, irritating person.

65
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm really not at all.

66
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,200
I just grew up in a place where everyone else was and I learned all sorts of dances that

67
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,760
they said were going to come in handy one day.

68
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:43,000
You'll be so happy you learned like the box step and the foxtrot and I'm forgetting the

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
other ones.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Never.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,640
People would say when and they would say at weddings.

72
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,840
I know the Roger Rabbit and that is the only one that I will break out at a wedding and

73
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,240
even that I do sort of ironically even though I've had to admit that like there's no really

74
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,280
no such thing as ironic dancing because to someone else you're really just doing the

75
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Roger Rabbit.

76
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,320
Oh, yeah, they don't they don't have a chart in front of them telling them your level.

77
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,960
They don't see the huge air quotes around it.

78
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
Yes.

79
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,040
I'm pretending to be a person who does this.

80
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
You're just doing it.

81
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,160
Huh, that's true.

82
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,800
You do kind of lose irony just as it which is sort of a beautiful thing about especially

83
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,960
at a wedding where the like this the sincerity is off the charts generationally.

84
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
Grandma's out there.

85
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,120
Little kids are out there.

86
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,760
But wait a minute.

87
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,480
Yeah, you were projecting an adulthood during which a foxtrot would come in handy and let

88
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:39,320
people know that you are not some gutter trash that you are a acceptable high society person.

89
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,320
That's right.

90
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,320
I'm sidewalk trash.

91
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
Sure.

92
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,080
I'm not gutter trash.

93
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
I guess.

94
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
Yeah, I don't know.

95
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,520
I mean, I feel like Cotillion when I did it was already a relic of a different time when

96
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,880
that stuff was theoretically important.

97
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,920
But I think that the teachers and maybe some of the parents that enrolled their kids in

98
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,280
it were projecting a future.

99
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,280
I don't know.

100
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,000
I feel I grew up in Orange County, California, home of the theme park that we're going to

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
be talking about.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Indeed.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,920
I think a lot there were there's areas of Orange County where they kind of just did

104
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,960
stuff because they've just always but that's just always how they do it.

105
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,960
Right.

106
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
It's a little like high society.

107
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah, I had relatives in like Newport Beach, which is very like old money.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,400
Where though?

109
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,120
Where's a foxtrot happening?

110
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:35,240
Where where where what area of Orange County thinks foxtrots are going to be in vogue again?

111
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
It was Newport Beach.

112
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,760
Oh, there you go.

113
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,040
But it's really I don't think of it as old money.

114
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,360
I think of it as new money.

115
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,040
Well, I was just charting this like Trump rally because the Beach Boys were performing

116
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
at it.

117
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,860
And I think it was like a young billion.

118
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,960
He was like a mid-twenties guy who's involved in Oculus, I think it was at his house.

119
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,840
So that which I did note like, yeah, that's not an 80 year old's house, despite having

120
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,560
a band of 80 year olds come to support an 80 year old candidate.

121
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,440
But it was just I feel like it was only one of the Beach Boys.

122
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
That's correct.

123
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
And it wasn't Brian Wilson.

124
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
Was it Mike Love?

125
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
It was Mike Love.

126
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,680
We talked about this on our Patreon podcast that's coming out.

127
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,520
This is the second time in several days that person which Beach Boy I mean, I'm happy with

128
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,280
Beach Boy references as often as possible.

129
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,040
But yeah, he's been like taking around a bunch of randos and bowling shirts for 20 years

130
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,400
and calling them Beach Boys, even though I don't even know who they are.

131
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,120
And I'm a big Beach Boys nerd.

132
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Are you?

133
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,720
Who's your favorite boy?

134
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,400
Carl Wilson is my favorite boy.

135
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,200
He's kind of the heart of the band really like, you know, to help them go through the

136
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,560
tough times in the 70s.

137
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,760
You know, it held the band together, I feel.

138
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
Yeah.

139
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,640
Well, there's a lot of Beach Boys talk on the theme park podcast.

140
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,400
It does end up happening.

141
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,320
Yes, that ends up happening.

142
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,920
I feel I feel I learned how to square dance in elementary school with the promise of,

143
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,120
well, this is something you're going to be doing a lot.

144
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Yes, same.

145
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,760
And I'm from the Midwest and that I'll be honest, I've never square danced since.

146
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,760
Have you done a cake walk?

147
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,200
What a cake walk?

148
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Like a bake sale?

149
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,280
What are you talking about?

150
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Like at a like family fun fair.

151
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,880
Yeah, but that's not like a dancing.

152
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
That's just like stepping on.

153
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,240
But it's a similar artifact of that time, I feel like.

154
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
That's true. But isn't it?

155
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Isn't there just steps?

156
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,720
Yeah, it's kind of like kind of like in my memory, sir, is it's kind of like hopscotch.

157
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,000
And if you try to land on a spot where you end up winning a cake, is that about right,

158
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,600
Michael?

159
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,840
I think so. But why does that have to do with dancing?

160
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,360
I just remember the same elementary school gymnasium floor, like quickly pivoted from

161
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,120
like, oh, we were just doing square dancing here and now we're doing a cake walk at the

162
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,600
fun fair, you know, the fundraising fair for the school the next day.

163
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,320
I feel like cakewalk, though, will come into play more in people's lives still to this

164
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,840
day probably than square dancing.

165
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,720
That's my hypothesis.

166
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,160
I think that's right.

167
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,480
Was the cakewalk particularly easy?

168
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Easy enough that it's a cakewalk?

169
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,360
Yeah, I don't think it takes a lot of skill.

170
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,040
I think it takes a Candyland level of skill so that children can play it.

171
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,200
Yeah, it's not a dance of any kind.

172
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,800
I don't know.

173
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,760
It's just like sort of a game where you can win a cake.

174
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,880
Yeah, but I feel like you're moving at the same speed as square dance.

175
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,720
Like what?

176
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Child's moving at the same speed.

177
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,560
That's yeah, child square dancing is going real slow.

178
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,160
That is not a fast doing and flipping arms and stuff.

179
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,000
Cakewalk is stepping on like things that say like I've won a cake.

180
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,200
You were dealing with better elementary school square dancers than I was.

181
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,360
I could be wrong.

182
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,120
If cakewalk fans out there, if I'm diminishing what you do, I apologize.

183
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,960
Yeah, if there's a podcast called like Cakewalk, the dance.

184
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,440
Yeah.

185
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,360
Or Cakewalk, the game.

186
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,280
Get in touch.

187
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,600
Yes, please let us know.

188
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,560
Clarify any experts out there.

189
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,320
Shame me.

190
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,360
We'll have a cake.

191
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,840
Cakewalk tip line.

192
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,040
You can you can send in your your your steps, I guess.

193
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,480
What you do, your protocols and we'll understand this and I will be shamed.

194
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,520
Has there ever been an adult situation you've that sounds way more titillating

195
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,240
than I mean, I just like any sort of social situation you've been in

196
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,400
where you thought I wish I could do that dance, but I don't know the moves.

197
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,760
Ooh, that's a good question.

198
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,480
I feel like maybe I've tried to floss, but in a small group of people.

199
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,120
I've tried to do the you know what I'm talking about, the floss.

200
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,560
I can't do it. It's very hard.

201
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,160
But I felt like it looks fun and it looks simple.

202
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,160
And I've tried. I can throw up a dab.

203
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,600
I can do that. That's pretty easy.

204
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,960
But I have like felt like I've tried to floss in front of a group of people.

205
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,360
And I just I cannot.

206
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,320
I'm uncoordinated. I can't do it.

207
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:13,640
I have seen rallies or like I've seen it in in like mentioned in comedy sketches.

208
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,760
The cha cha slide.

209
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,520
And I have I wouldn't even I don't even know where to start.

210
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,720
I have no idea how everyone knows that I have not encountered it.

211
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,560
Don't they explain it in the song, though?

212
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,280
I guess they kind of do.

213
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,080
But people are like ahead of it, I feel, you know, they they like you.

214
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,960
It's hard to still like it's like doing karaoke to a song

215
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,120
you're you're experiencing for the first time.

216
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,480
Still better to have like one run through it under your belt.

217
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,800
That's a little bit. Yeah.

218
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,640
There was this there was people like celebrating in Philadelphia

219
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,400
and someone was in a gritty costume.

220
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,840
And when it says slide your right, he immediately slid to the left

221
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,160
and do a bunch of people he could not see.

222
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,600
That is I feel like a preview of my future.

223
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,480
Alison, dancing you the you're lacking.

224
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,760
Yeah. The only time I've been in a situation where I thought

225
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,200
I wish I could do that dance that everyone was doing was in actually a dance class.

226
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,960
I took a class.

227
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,760
It was a little bit beyond my skills,

228
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,280
which was just meant it was still beginner, but just a hard beginner.

229
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,680
And everyone knew the dance and I just tried to keep up and I couldn't.

230
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,240
That's really the only but my cha cha.

231
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,000
I did not fall back on that or my box step or my waltz.

232
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,080
My god damn, I'm forgetting some of the main ones that we learned in Ketulia.

233
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,920
And I cannot remember for the life of me.

234
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,040
But no, I've never needed them.

235
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,240
Yeah. The the the beggar kicker, like a dance where that you where you could also use

236
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,960
to like kick a guy on the ground to kick a hobo.

237
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,320
The beggar kicker, the the finding deductions, the

238
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,560
I have the tax loophole.

239
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,320
You can't step on my yacht.

240
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,920
Those are these are Ketulia steps.

241
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,520
Not in my backyard.

242
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Now, those come in handy.

243
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,640
You do use those on the regular.

244
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,080
But some of these other ones.

245
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,520
OK, wait. So Orange County raised.

246
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,360
Yeah, that's right.

247
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,640
And that's a theme park Mecca, not just Disneyland, but not very far.

248
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,200
Some of the things that we love and are missing right now.

249
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,000
So were you were you a Disneyland regular or at least did you enjoy going?

250
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,680
Was it a part of your childhood?

251
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,640
Yes. Although I was listening to your episode with Matt Appadaca,

252
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,440
and he was saying that his mom would drop him off like would

253
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,680
they would sometimes just be dropped off there to spend the day there.

254
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,960
Yeah. And that was not my childhood at all.

255
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,440
I wish it were. As an adult, I look back and I think we were only like

256
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,560
35 minutes away. Why didn't we go more often?

257
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,160
But we would go on special occasions and maybe

258
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,560
maybe once every other year or so.

259
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,280
Just sort of for just because just to go.

260
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,760
But oftentimes we go like for birthdays or pretty much birthdays.

261
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,320
So, yeah, it was always like I loved it.

262
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,320
It was a huge special thing to be able to go.

263
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,160
But I always and I'm wondering if you've encountered this,

264
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,280
if anyone else has ever mentioned this feeling.

265
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,000
And this started when I was very young.

266
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,440
In the car on the way home from Disneyland,

267
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,520
I would feel like sad and kind of scared.

268
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,000
And then I would have trouble sleeping that night.

269
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,560
And it's like I was overstimulated.

270
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,280
It's like I had it was like Disneyland was just pure,

271
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,880
amazing fun. And then like it's almost like when you hear people talk about

272
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,360
coming off of Molly, which, by the way, I've never done so. I don't know.

273
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,920
But it's like I had experienced ecstasy and then I was returning to real life

274
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
and it was too hard for me.

275
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,520
I completely know what what you mean.

276
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,880
I mean, I felt it big time from my childhood Disney World trip.

277
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,520
I've talked about that before, just like the utter immense sadness,

278
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,120
because that's such a giant experience.

279
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,400
But even just the Disneyland day trip. Yes.

280
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,400
I remember like specific sad songs that I listened to on the way home

281
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,200
and just like, well, guess that was it for the year.

282
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,760
I guess just a year of bland misery is ahead of me now.

283
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,320
Like I do. Some of the saddest I've been. Yes, absolutely.

284
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,160
Yeah. And I think it was knowing

285
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,000
that it's going to be a while till we come back.

286
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,560
And this thing that I was so looking forward to is now behind us.

287
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,200
And I sort of remember like moving in the same way that you like enter the park

288
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,160
and the excitement, you know, the excitement swells, just kind of like

289
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,640
having that in reverse, like going through Main Street and through the crowds.

290
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,600
And then we'd usually like hit the one of the shops on Main Street

291
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,920
and like get candy or something and then taking that and going to the car

292
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,400
and then slowly being among fewer and fewer people till it's like

293
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,040
just my sister and me and my mom or my mom and my dad.

294
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,400
He usually didn't come with us.

295
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,560
So just just three of us in the car going home.

296
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,240
And it was like so everything felt very barren and late and sleepy.

297
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,600
Yeah, I I had only I probably went, I think, four times

298
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,160
by the time I was 18 to Disney World.

299
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,880
And that was it. Just we had four family trips because I'm from Illinois.

300
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,160
And yeah, I think I would like count down how many days we have left.

301
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,760
This is probably I still am like this where it's just like I'm thinking of like the bad.

302
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,720
I'm just thinking of the glass half empty.

303
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,960
And I'm just like, oh, this is going to be

304
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,640
there's only one day left of happiness and then it'll be years.

305
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,600
And I think probably this was so psychologically damaging to me.

306
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,080
It's the reason I've been to Disneyland at this point, like 200 times in 10 years,

307
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,080
because I got an annual pass and I was just like, I can go down for two hours.

308
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,040
Huh? OK.

309
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,960
Like I'm trying to correct a mistake that I felt like was in my brain.

310
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,640
It was a child. Like I'm trying to fix it and it just won't fix.

311
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,400
But I think that is a thing when you become an adult

312
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,120
and you're in charge of how you spend your time and you have your own method

313
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,640
of getting there that you're like, oh, I don't I'm not depending on,

314
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,320
you know, the the whims of adults to get here.

315
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,840
I can do it myself. So then you go nuts. Yes.

316
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,320
And I've yeah. And that's yeah.

317
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,720
That's how I've chosen to go on a go nuts

318
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,800
is to go on Big Thunder Mountain and then go home.

319
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,600
When I when I had a nine to five job, I would go on Sundays a lot.

320
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,720
And the end of the day Sunday, whether the it was like,

321
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,040
you know, the park was closing or whether I was just about to leave.

322
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,000
Like the drive back to L.A.

323
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,440
just felt like the bleakest thing in the world, because like, oh my God,

324
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,240
I have to go to my shitty nine to five job tomorrow.

325
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,480
I was just at Disneyland. What the hell?

326
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,120
I think it is that it's just like a case.

327
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,880
It's a compounded case of the Sundays. Yes.

328
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,080
Yeah, it's like it's like that phenomenon they talk about when people would see

329
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,640
Avatar and they get depressed after because they wanted to live in Pandora.

330
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,280
This is real, isn't it? A joke.

331
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,280
I don't know how I've ever I've forgot about it.

332
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,800
The other these articles about people that would feel this deep sadness

333
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,960
post seeing Avatar because they wanted to go back to Pandora.

334
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,880
And that Disneyland is Pandora.

335
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,920
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

336
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,160
Unplugging and not getting to see Jake Sully again.

337
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,280
Right. All your friends, Jake Sully and the other ones.

338
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,400
That's right. I also liked Knott's Berry Farm,

339
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,120
although I think Disneyland was always a bit more special.

340
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,600
But have you guys talked about the corkscrew on this show? No.

341
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,040
Do you do you know what that is? Do you remember it? Not really.

342
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,640
I don't think so. It was a roller coaster. It was a

343
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,680
when I when I realized you guys talk about not the brain from, I was like,

344
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,600
oh, maybe I should have I should have suggested that as a topic. So someday.

345
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,440
But it's a roller coaster.

346
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,800
It's a roller coaster that used to be at Knott's Berry Farm.

347
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,520
And it went upside down, but it would twist like a corkscrew.

348
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,360
I'm looking at instead of doing like a loop to loop.

349
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,040
It would kind of flip over.

350
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,880
And I think that was the first I was afraid to go on Montezuma's Revenge.

351
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,200
But that was the first roller coaster I went on where I went upside down.

352
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,760
And then I felt so proud of myself that I like kept going on that one.

353
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,560
I don't know how long I don't know when they stopped having it.

354
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,080
But it was pretty fun. 1989. It looks like it closed.

355
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,400
It's weird because I'm 23, so I don't know how I ever went.

356
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,120
Did you fit it in? I interesting.

357
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,880
Yeah, this looks intense. So this was like a

358
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,680
you felt like you had like

359
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:43,040
scaled a level of fear, overcoming fear and going on it over and over.

360
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,880
Like you're like you can't believe you're maintaining this level of bravery.

361
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,920
Exactly. That was how I felt because I was young when I went on it.

362
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,560
I also remember skipping parks, being very

363
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,160
afraid of Space Mountain.

364
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,240
A babysitter had taken us to Disneyland.

365
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,920
And I said I was going to go on Space Mountain.

366
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,120
And then as we got closer to the entrance, I got really scared and I started crying.

367
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,520
By the way, I feel like a lot of stuff from my childhood was like that,

368
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,920
where I said I could do it.

369
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,240
And then as it got there, I was like, no, I can't do it.

370
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,920
And for example, I said that I would take my sister to get her ears pierced.

371
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,640
And then once we got there, I was like, I can't I can't watch them pierce her flesh.

372
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,080
Wait, not even your ears. You were just like hanging out.

373
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,840
Not even my ears. No, I I already had pierced ears at this point.

374
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,600
And my sister was four years young.

375
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,840
I had to wait till I was 12 or 13 to get my ears pierced.

376
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,440
My sister was four years younger.

377
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,400
She got to get them pierced earlier, but still not at the same time as I did.

378
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,440
And I said it's like to help her convince our parents.

379
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,440
I said I would accompany her.

380
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,400
But then when we got there, I couldn't do it.

381
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,440
So it wasn't my ears. But she got her ears pierced.

382
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,720
It was fine. Anyway, so Space Mountain, I started crying.

383
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,400
And I think I think I decided I didn't want to go on it.

384
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,760
So then the babysitter went with I don't know who.

385
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,720
And then like an hour later, I did go, though.

386
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,840
And then again, I felt super proud of myself.

387
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,400
Sure. Yeah, it's a great way to like as a kid, like give yourself

388
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,560
these little benchmarks and then see if you can hit them.

389
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,160
But boy, the humiliation, if you you don't.

390
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,800
And like, what do you do instead?

391
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,960
Like, well, your friends go on the scary ride and then you just like stand around

392
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,280
or look at shirts or and then like people have to come out and say, like,

393
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,120
it's OK, we totally understand.

394
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,880
It's not it's perfectly norm.

395
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,840
But you know, they're putting on a big show and they don't really think that.

396
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,480
And then there's also I just say the scenario where like your friends make fun of you.

397
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,280
Yes. Space Mountain is complicated, though, because like

398
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,400
there's two things at play one.

399
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,960
I feel like most kids build up coasters like that

400
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,880
either go upside down or in the dark.

401
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,560
Like those are two very common.

402
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,560
Like, I don't know why all kids like, you know, or at least nervous kids.

403
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,160
Like I was thought like if you go upside down, if you go in the dark,

404
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,000
there's a chance that death is waiting for you there.

405
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,000
The other thing is like Space Mountain is like shorthand for like

406
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,200
big scary roller coaster in popular culture.

407
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,160
Like, you know, even just like on the news, if like a pundit or something

408
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,240
is looking for something, they'll just toss out space.

409
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,400
So like Space Mountain is just in the lexicon as like,

410
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,120
you know, a big roller coaster, you know, so it just builds it up even more.

411
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,520
The 2020 election was a real Space Mountain

412
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,840
as yes. Yes.

413
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,240
Florida Space Mountain.

414
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,080
It's unpleasant. It's bumpy.

415
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,120
It hurts your back.

416
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,760
We're still in the dark about exactly how it played out.

417
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,840
In reality. Yeah.

418
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,440
I said e-ticket ride to someone kind of recently,

419
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,680
and they did not know at all what I was talking about.

420
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,480
And I think it was Greg Fitzsimmons, my childish co-host.

421
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,360
So he's definitely old enough to know that reference.

422
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,880
Yeah. But maybe it's because he I don't he wasn't living in California

423
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,040
when it was like that. You guys know the reference, right?

424
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,120
Oh, yeah, we do. This has come up before, though.

425
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,640
This is where I start to because we super nerd out on this thing

426
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,000
and just start talking at like level 10 out of 10 of theme park nerd.

427
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,000
And then we'll look at our social media and somebody will say like,

428
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,600
hey, so I don't know what e-ticket means.

429
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,920
And these guys just say it like we know.

430
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,960
And I don't is an e-ticket like an online ticket, like when I buy on a computer.

431
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,600
And there's nothing wrong with that question.

432
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,360
They're correct to need that clarity.

433
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,160
And what is e-tickets are you would because you would buy rides.

434
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,440
By a ticket. Yeah. Yeah.

435
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,880
When you go to Disneyland, you'd buy a ticket book.

436
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,080
And it had like different a different amount of each kind of ticket.

437
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,120
And I think they offered like if you depending on what you felt like,

438
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,720
maybe you wanted to do the easier, like, you know, younger rides

439
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,920
or maybe you wanted to do a lot of the bigger attractions.

440
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,200
And the e-ticket rides were the roller coasters and the ones that went fast.

441
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,840
So to say something is a real e-ticket ride is like it's a real fly by the sea

442
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,160
to your pants kind of.

443
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,400
It's a real space experience. Yeah.

444
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,760
And then your A is you go all the way down and your A is like

445
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,560
a horse carries you 20 feet down the street.

446
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,960
That's that's one of the eight tickets.

447
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,840
Yeah. Yeah.

448
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,080
It's I feel like that maybe term is even like

449
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,120
maybe people know it and kind of know what it means,

450
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,600
but don't know it's even from Disney.

451
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,480
Like it's been around.

452
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,240
I feel like I have seen it in completely out of context for theme parks, too.

453
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,200
Well, that was my that was why I was surprised that who again,

454
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,280
I don't mean to besmirch the good name of Grapefruit Simmons if it wasn't him.

455
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,680
That's why I was surprised that this person didn't know,

456
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,000
because I thought that, yeah, like like you're saying, it exists outside of Disney.

457
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,960
It's just a phrase now. Right.

458
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,040
Yeah, I was wrong. So, yeah, I guess I don't know.

459
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,680
I would be interested in a polling if the pollsters can all switch over

460
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,600
to maybe pulling this thing now.

461
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,680
I am interested to know, like, how did that term move over?

462
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,040
Because they haven't had the ticket books at Disney for a long time now.

463
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,760
So it's interesting that has seemed like I see it pop up here and there,

464
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,000
that it just like that it got so popular at the time that it's just lasted.

465
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,360
Do we need to do a glossary episode?

466
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,080
This is the question for the audience.

467
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,320
Do we need to run through terms?

468
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,440
Just do it.

469
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,960
And that could be like you're you start with that one.

470
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,800
If you're like, how do we like

471
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,600
how do you get led into the podcast or add water with the glossary?

472
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,440
Don't tempt me. Do not tempt me, Scott.

473
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,120
What other terms have come up that you need to gloss?

474
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,880
Well, I mean, we like we talk ride vehicles.

475
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,400
The word Omnimover comes up, which is what Haunted Mansion

476
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,360
ride vehicle is and other things I'm trying to think of.

477
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,840
Do you know that term? Have you ever heard Omnimover before, Alison?

478
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,560
I have not now.

479
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,040
Yeah, that's like if it's like Haunted Mansion where there's like it never

480
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,480
it never stops.

481
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,800
It's not like the utopia where you drive up to a point and then you keep going.

482
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,680
It's like one of the tracks that just is always going in an endless loop.

483
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,240
Which other rides at Disneyland use an Omnimover?

484
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,480
The Little Mermaid ride.

485
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,920
Mm hmm. A lot that are aren't around anymore.

486
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,000
Like the old adventures or journey into inner space.

487
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,320
This came up too. Oh, yeah.

488
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,480
Yeah, that was that was one.

489
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,200
I guess. Yeah, I feel like there used to be more.

490
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,400
I think because Buzz Lightyear is kind is on a kind of an omnimover, right?

491
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,720
Because it's got. Yeah.

492
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,280
That's on a sort of a conveyor like a escalator, not escalator,

493
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,160
like like at the airport.

494
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,640
You know what I'm talking about? Yeah.

495
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,680
Oh, yes. The moving sidewalk is maybe the tell. Yes.

496
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,920
So that's Buzz Lightyear is like, I guess maybe technically we haven't done

497
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,960
the episode we don't know.

498
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,520
We haven't looked into if they technically call it an omnimover.

499
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,360
Yeah. I and every episode stuff is revealed.

500
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,440
Like for today's episode, how at one point in time at Disneyland,

501
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,080
there were three autopias simultaneously.

502
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,040
Which I never knew.

503
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,160
Like I didn't I knew at some point there were smaller ones next to it

504
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,160
or around it, but I didn't know that there was a point in time

505
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,440
where you could go on three autopias in one day.

506
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,120
And one of them had a name that is not really right.

507
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,120
That is that is extra problematic. I took.

508
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,000
I did a little bit of research because I was like,

509
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,800
I don't remember that much about Autopia, although I do have a story about Autopia,

510
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,680
but I don't.

511
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,720
And then I then a lot of stuff came back to me.

512
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,280
And all of a sudden it did come back to me that I remember there was like

513
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,960
there was more than one at one point. Yes.

514
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,160
But there being three, that was, you know, way before any of our times.

515
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,360
Yeah. Oh, problematic one was very, very long ago.

516
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,280
Very shortly. Yes.

517
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,960
I guess we'll get to that.

518
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,880
Yes. You brought up you brought up the Autopia as a thing to talk about.

519
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,400
Yeah. What's why the Autopia?

520
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,480
What's in any personal fondnesses for it or stories

521
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,400
or experiences? Yes.

522
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,680
So we always just went to Disneyland as a day trip.

523
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,000
And I know that Disney World is very different for people like that's a whole

524
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,400
you go, it's a whole vacation.

525
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,520
But when I turned six or possibly seven, I can't remember,

526
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,160
we went and we spent the night in the Disneyland Hotel

527
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,880
either for one or two nights.

528
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,080
And so we had like back to back days at Disneyland.

529
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,880
And it was me and it was my family.

530
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,400
So my parents, my sister and then my best friend, Brooke.

531
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,840
And we were like inseparable.

532
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,760
And Autopia was always one.

533
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,600
I was always fascinated with driving.

534
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,000
Like I got my driver's license on the day I turned 16.

535
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,320
And so to be able to drive in a little car,

536
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,000
even though it's on a track, was very exciting to me.

537
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,960
And I couldn't I always sat next to my mom.

538
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,520
I think sometimes she would let me steer.

539
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,200
But the idea of being able to operate my own car, I mean, I could just like

540
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,640
I couldn't even couldn't even wait to do it.

541
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,160
So I was hoping I was tall enough.

542
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,320
And there was you had to stand up to a thing to make sure you're tall enough to ride.

543
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,680
And on that trip, I was just tall enough, like by a hair.

544
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,000
And my friend Brooke was a few months younger than I was, but like a lot shorter.

545
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,200
She was very short for for our age.

546
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,520
And I was probably average height.

547
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,360
So anyway, it's like a six to six year olds or two seven year olds.

548
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,360
I've just passed the clearance to get in the car.

549
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,920
I'm so I'm like shaking. I'm so excited.

550
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,880
And I go to push and we're off and I go to push down the pedal.

551
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,080
And I I realize, though, my toes reach the pedal.

552
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,680
I cannot. Get it to go without.

553
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,080
Like sliding my whole.

554
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,080
But I basically start to panic because I realize I'm actually not tall enough

555
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,440
to operate the car.

556
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,760
And in order to get it to go, I have to like slide my butt down

557
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,080
to the edge of the seat.

558
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,120
But then when I push on the pedal, it pushes me back into the seat.

559
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:09,200
So I've got to like brace my I'm like it bracing myself, trying to push the pedal,

560
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,720
panicking and to get down low enough where I can actually make the car go.

561
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,400
Now I can't see anymore.

562
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,840
I don't know why I didn't just say this isn't working, but like somehow

563
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,200
we had gotten the car to go enough that it was like I would have had to walk

564
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,200
along the track to get back.

565
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:35,000
So anyway, my best friend, Brooke, super resourceful, a wonderful wing child

566
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,000
climbs down into the bottom of the car and just pushes the pedal.

567
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,080
And then I just steered it.

568
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,200
But it was still.

569
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,520
I was still like sweating and panicking the entire time.

570
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,200
It was still a total nightmare.

571
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,120
So after that, I decided not to go on that again until I was definitely tall enough.

572
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,800
Geez. So the fraction of an inch, but it only got you to where you were operating

573
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,200
that the way like the toys drive a car and Toy Story.

574
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,200
Yes, it was.

575
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,800
It's it's like silly and funny, but it was deadly serious to me at that age.

576
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,600
And it was awful.

577
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:20,720
Yeah, I think because it's to me, it was as if I had like stalled out on the freeway.

578
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,160
The fact that it's a ride, the fact that there's actually I mean, when I think about it,

579
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,640
probably whoever the you know, the person who sits at the little control station

580
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,720
could probably have seen what was happening.

581
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,680
But I felt like I was on the four or five and I couldn't get my car to go

582
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,720
and I was going to get hit by other cars.

583
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,160
Yeah, I that way that you I'm sorry, sorry.

584
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,240
Right. That's the way that you take off.

585
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,840
Like where, you know, there's a big line of maybe 16 cars.

586
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,520
And if you were anywhere towards the front, if you're in the first five

587
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,720
and then there's that go time, this one goes, this one goes, this one goes.

588
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,240
And it's oh yeah, and it's you.

589
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,160
And you feel like suddenly everybody's staring at you.

590
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,240
Like you you have an if you have an inability to perform in any way.

591
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,640
Or you haven't like exactly set up your body just how it needs to be.

592
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,360
And you know, this is going to be a problem the entire time.

593
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,560
This is going to set the tempo for your entire run through the thing,

594
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,200
which is a long ride.

595
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,080
And you have to keep up the speed.

596
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,800
Like this is a performance ride.

597
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,600
Probably only the canoes is is the only other ride where like you have to work.

598
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,720
So that stress, you sit down and like, oh my God, we're not.

599
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,600
I am not capable of operating this.

600
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,200
That must have been horrible.

601
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,320
It was truly awful.

602
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,600
It was really bad.

603
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,200
That's like that's like if I think about it as a as a youth,

604
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
I would have been like, that's my biggest nightmare,

605
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,240
because every you feel like everyone's watching you.

606
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,200
And then you also, of course, like as kids do, like you blame yourself.

607
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,560
You're like probably like, ah, like I would just I would have melted down,

608
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,200
I'm sure at that point, I would have I don't know what I would have done.

609
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,360
I would have it was like I hid.

610
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,320
It was honestly like.

611
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,280
An Abu Ghraib stress position, because it's like either I can see

612
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,240
or I can push the pedal, I can't do both at the same time.

613
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,200
Yeah. No offense to people who've been through horrible things.

614
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,000
The actual. Sure.

615
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,840
The was your friend then in a point where are you having to avoid

616
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,600
kicking your friend or having or or having your foot right in your face?

617
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,520
I must have been like I don't quite remember the resolution.

618
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,560
I just know that she was down there pushing on the pedal, too.

619
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,480
But I don't remember then thinking like, oh, few.

620
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,000
I felt like it bought us a few more seconds, you know,

621
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,080
even though somehow like I'm here now, it all worked out.

622
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,040
But I don't remember what I did with my foot at that point.

623
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,440
I just remember being like, I can't do it.

624
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,160
Like there was a lot of like yelling and stuff.

625
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,600
Again, I don't understand why.

626
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,800
I feel like adults should have intervened.

627
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,760
Yeah, there's so many cars, I would guess, that they're not doing a great job

628
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,000
of like making sure everyone is a bill, has the ability to do it.

629
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,840
But also maybe there was a teen, an extra apathetic teen that day that.

630
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,880
Probably. Yeah, it was.

631
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,360
Paying attention of time.

632
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,680
Probably once they started introducing like these other variants,

633
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,800
like there's a junior utopia, and it seems like the difference became.

634
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,240
Well, yeah, little kids can drive it because we put like a big brick

635
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,360
on the pedal so that they can reach it.

636
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,480
It seems like a really like inelegant.

637
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,840
It's just like a attach.

638
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,320
Let's put it. Let's install like a high heel basically on top of this pedal.

639
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,640
And now then that you wouldn't have had that problem.

640
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,760
Yeah, I don't know which one it was because this was when both of them.

641
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,480
I think there were two of them at this point.

642
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,440
So it could have actually been Junior Utopia.

643
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,000
Well, I was a little bit too short.

644
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,520
I think there was a time and you guys correct me if I'm wrong,

645
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,040
where there was just like they were the same.

646
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,560
Like what I remember when I went when I first time I went,

647
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,280
which is probably an eighty seven, that it was just the Tomorrowland utopia

648
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,560
and the Fantasyland utopia and they were the same.

649
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,400
I don't think one was a junior of the other.

650
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,120
I don't think.

651
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,600
What a weird thing, though, for there to be two versions of the same ride

652
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,440
just in different like with it that popular.

653
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,120
I you know, I guess at the time, at the time the park open, the 50s,

654
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,680
like the highways of America were like the pride of the country.

655
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,120
And I was associate like opening Disneyland with like, man,

656
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,400
there was a lot of trains everywhere.

657
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,160
But then those reading about all these utopias, I'm like,

658
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,640
oh, I underestimated the sheer number of cars

659
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,920
between these and the Main Street, like kind of novelty cars

660
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,720
that were just in that park pumping out that beautiful gasoline smell everywhere.

661
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,920
Yeah. Right.

662
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,960
I think locomotion was a big deal to the for early Disneyland.

663
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,440
And like moving people around and I guess Autopia.

664
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
I always associate it with the Autobahn.

665
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,200
It's a portmanteau of automobile and utopia.

666
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,480
And it really was a celebration of the highway,

667
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,240
which is funny when you think about it, like imagine that being,

668
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,640
you know, a fun ride to sit on on a highway.

669
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:13,360
And when I turned 16, I lost my interest in that ride 100 percent.

670
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,080
OK, there was it held no excitement for me anymore

671
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,680
once I could drive an actual car.

672
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,920
Yeah. Without a rail once you didn't have a rail on the railroads.

673
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,600
You know, I remember doing that ride when I was, you know, young,

674
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,400
too young to drive, but old enough to operate that car and thinking

675
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,840
what this really needs is for there to be no rail.

676
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,320
Like that would be super fun.

677
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,640
And I think it started without the right. Right. Right. Yes.

678
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,040
It was it was and no bumpers either.

679
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,040
Some mild, but I don't know that you'd call.

680
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,720
They call them bumpers to me.

681
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,720
They just look like strips of aluminum.

682
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,640
But in the in the opening day, Disneyland special,

683
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
you can watch Sammy Davis Jr.

684
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:02,560
bump Frank Sinatra and his son in an Autopia car, which is very funny.

685
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,280
It seems like those early Autopia, like you could have

686
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,920
with a little like hitting it at the right angle,

687
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,680
you could have driven one off the track pretty easily.

688
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,680
I think this happened all the time. Yeah.

689
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,720
I think it was very common for cars to be able to go off roading

690
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,440
if you could get enough speed.

691
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,120
One one problem I discovered in interviews with with with Bob Gerr,

692
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,400
who is a guy we talk about a lot.

693
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,800
That's in the guy in the car.

694
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,040
Like that's in the episode.

695
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,480
Bob Gerr is a pretty frequent term.

696
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,240
This guy comes up a lot because he's like, you know, you think about

697
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,960
these Disneyland attractions being like super high tech

698
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,480
and just the most like military grade operations.

699
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,160
But it feels like an original Disneyland.

700
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,680
They just had this guy, Bob Gerr, who's kind of like

701
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,040
if your handy uncle went and fixed all the rides himself.

702
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,160
Like if a ride broke down, he just kind of like bang on it until it worked again.

703
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,840
It was like very ungraceful.

704
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,920
There's a lot of like imagineers who are like, you know,

705
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,960
and basically we wanted to capture what the story of Peter Pan was

706
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,560
and the actual experience.

707
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,360
They're talking very like flowery terms and really trying to explain it.

708
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,960
And Bob Gerr is like, yeah, they wanted me to make a car that turned around 360.

709
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,920
So I was like, I don't know how to do it.

710
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,760
And then he like went into the garage in here.

711
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,440
I figured it out. OK.

712
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,920
Like he has no it's very utilitarian.

713
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,200
He was just like a guy around who could do stuff.

714
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,240
Yeah. Yeah. Sounds amazing.

715
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

716
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
He was only 23 back then and he's still alive now.

717
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,320
So he was he actually went he I think of him as like this uncle figure.

718
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,720
But really, at the time, he was almost a Valencia teen.

719
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,680
He was almost an apathetic.

720
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,200
Almost. Yeah.

721
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,240
Have you tried to get in touch with him?

722
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,840
We haven't.

723
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,040
But we have. I think he's pretty podcastable, though.

724
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,840
I think it's I think it's possible.

725
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,280
I feel like we have a degree.

726
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,960
There's a degree or two of separation.

727
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,160
Maybe we could. Yeah. Yeah.

728
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,720
Might not make that work.

729
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,120
But we can ask about some of this stuff.

730
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,440
Like one of the ones that I found was that, OK, so today

731
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,440
the cars have a top speed of about seven miles an hour.

732
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,720
When when the ride started, the cars could go 11 miles an hour,

733
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,960
but only because they put on a part called the governor.

734
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,760
There's a device that's the governor, strangely.

735
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,880
And that stopped it from going its real high speed, which is 25 miles an hour.

736
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,800
But Disneyland opens and they've never done this before.

737
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,680
And it gets extremely hot very quick because it opened during the summer.

738
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,880
So it gets into August and the cars start having problems

739
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,800
and the governors start breaking.

740
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,880
And if the governor breaks, then suddenly a kid can go all out of nowhere

741
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,920
from 11 to 25 miles an hour, like getting a mushroom in Mario Kart.

742
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,400
Suddenly. Oh, my God.

743
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,680
So Bob Gurst says, yeah, if you were a lucky kid,

744
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,120
suddenly your speed could more than double out of nowhere.

745
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,720
So kind of the wild. Yeah, amazing.

746
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,040
I believe governors in various forms are common in transportation.

747
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:07,400
My old Saturn, I think, had a governor built in for going down the hill.

748
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,440
And no one told me that when we bought it.

749
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,360
So when I first went down the hill at one section of the 101

750
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:19,840
and the car starts to slow down, I was like, Jesus Christ, what's happening?

751
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,000
And it was a feature, not a bug.

752
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,680
So eventually I got used to it.

753
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,600
But terrifying if you're not expecting it.

754
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,080
And now governors are pretty much around just to put a limit

755
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,920
on the fun that we can have.

756
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,480
Bastard, newsome.

757
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,400
Now they just take away our freedom. Yes. Yes. That's right.

758
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,840
They limit our breathing with their masks.

759
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,760
They suffocate us is what these this governor class does.

760
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,600
Mm hmm.

761
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,640
There's a lot of we've just been mired in like

762
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,800
like most Disney fans understand, like, OK, we have to like figure out a way

763
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,680
to do this safely, and I hope that we can go back and forth

764
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,240
and get these parks open again.

765
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,560
But there is a degree of this kind of thing.

766
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,240
I read a big article that was comparing Governor Newsome to Frollo,

767
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,760
the bad bishop or whatever in hunchback of Notre Dame.

768
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:22,520
He is a modern day Frollo who seeks to suffocate the citizenry.

769
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:27,200
So the intersection of like Disney fans and

770
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,400
conservative, well, maybe it's not all conservative.

771
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,760
Yeah, yeah.

772
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,280
Whatever that is, free speechers, general crank.

773
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,480
Yeah, it's also possible they're like one issue is opening Disney.

774
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,920
And that's the only that's as political as they get.

775
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,880
They have no nothing else that they believe they didn't vote.

776
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,160
They didn't care about care about it all.

777
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,840
It's just they literally want to just walk down Main Street.

778
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,480
That's it.

779
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,680
I would vote if it was Beast versus Gaston.

780
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,320
There I have opinions, but otherwise.

781
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,960
What is going on with when Disney is going to open?

782
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:08,160
And I had Carly Weisel, who you guys have on sometimes.

783
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,720
Yeah, yeah. I had her on my podcast recently.

784
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,000
And I feel like I should.

785
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,680
I feel like she might have said and I should know, but I'm blanking.

786
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,000
Do you know what the latest on when it might be?

787
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,440
Mike, do you have your charts?

788
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,360
Yeah, we need to get color codes out.

789
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,200
With the way it is now, with the way the covid spread is now

790
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,960
and the way the charts are, it's not going to open ever until there's a vaccine.

791
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,320
I mean, that seems to be unless something a miracle happens.

792
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,320
And like like like California has this thing they have in place

793
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:45,240
is basically saying like the spread needs to be so low.

794
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,720
Like there needs to be such a small amount of transmission going on

795
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,160
that then they would feel comfortable opening up again.

796
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,240
I don't know.

797
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,440
I guess the X factor is if Disney and this is what I said,

798
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,840
I think months ago is if Disney like turns Mickey and Friends

799
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,680
into a rapid testing site,

800
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,120
like you drive through and you get your 15 minute covid test

801
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,400
and you wait like on Chip and Dale platform and they go, all right,

802
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,120
your car can go your know this one, your son has covid.

803
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:18,160
You have to like I don't know if there I saw an article talking about it.

804
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,800
I don't know if it's just logistically impossible, which it might be.

805
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:26,480
But I don't think Disney land is going to open before we have a vaccine.

806
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,880
Right. But you know, Disney will keep firing employees, though,

807
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,080
to make the governor suffer.

808
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,920
They will keep firing people, though, until that they give into what they want.

809
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,320
So I don't know. We'll see.

810
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,720
I don't. That's why there's that's why the stock went way up on the

811
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,880
the Pfizer announcement, because that's like, oh, maybe this is hope

812
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:54,800
potentially that the any that Disneyland will be open in any regard in 2021. Right.

813
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,080
I wish we had less depressing news for you.

814
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,160
You ask us a question and we're like, it's not so good.

815
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,280
The vaccine. Well, vaccine is a pandemic right now.

816
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,160
So it makes sense that it's not not wonderful news.

817
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,200
Yeah. The vaccine news is good, though.

818
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,760
As of today, as of when we're recording this, the vaccine news is good.

819
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,760
And potentially, yeah, first half of next year.

820
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,600
It's been very. Yeah. Yeah.

821
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,720
Well, we took my son, Elliot, for his third birthday.

822
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,200
We took him to Disneyland.

823
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,600
And it was so much fun.

824
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,760
It was really nice to be able to go with a child.

825
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,040
My husband and I, before we had kids, we actually had annual passes at one point.

826
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,800
And we would go and we enjoyed it.

827
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,880
But it just it wasn't the same for I don't know how it is for you guys.

828
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,720
From for us, it just wasn't the same.

829
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,520
And there were days where we would go and just kind of walk around

830
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,560
and it would be crowded.

831
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,400
And then we'd be like, you know what?

832
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,320
I don't really feel like being here. Yeah, let's go.

833
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,720
Let's get to eat and then let's go.

834
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,520
Like we did. We didn't.

835
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,880
We felt like we never quite took advantage of it in the way that that we should.

836
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,040
But then to take Elliot there,

837
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,720
it was to see it through his eyes, it was just amazing.

838
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,640
And he had the best time.

839
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,320
And I mean, we really didn't do very much, but just even buying popcorn,

840
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,760
like the little the tiny little figurine in the popcorn.

841
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,200
Cart like cart. Yeah.

842
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,560
Just, you know, the cranks, the machine.

843
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,680
Yeah, we've never really talked about those.

844
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,360
Those are great. He to him, that was as exciting as anything else.

845
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,520
So there's a lot of talk in our house about how, you know,

846
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:35,840
we'll get to go back when and he says when the virus like BIR,

847
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,920
BIR US, that's what he calls it, when the virus is over.

848
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,320
So they're very looking forward to that.

849
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,400
I want the virus to be over very much as well.

850
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,400
That sounds great.

851
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,760
We're like any you have no idea what's going to like spark his eye,

852
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,840
like what might grab.

853
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,280
I imagine like a nap probably would at some point.

854
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,120
They probably conk out pretty quick. But I think I wanted to grab a nap.

855
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,680
Yeah, he liked that.

856
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,480
He liked Mickey's house and Minnie's house.

857
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:13,280
And there's like a little play area outside of like a little play yard,

858
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,520
which really is nothing is not more special than any little playground.

859
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,640
But he likes playgrounds. So he liked that a lot.

860
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,120
We did Pirates of the Caribbean.

861
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,280
He liked that, but he got water in his eyes.

862
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,600
So he didn't like that.

863
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,040
It's not good water to get in any anywhere near your body, really.

864
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:37,480
Yeah, you know, he did Dumbo and he liked being able to control the car.

865
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,040
What else? Oh, Small World, of course.

866
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,840
Yes, is that kind of the kid icebreaker?

867
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,400
I feel like I hear that a lot is the answer.

868
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,720
There's maybe like good first babies first ride.

869
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,520
Small World. Yeah, that was the very first one we did.

870
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,640
So I think I mean, popcorn came first and then Small World.

871
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,840
Yeah. So yeah, I think so is very well lit.

872
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,440
The song is repetitive.

873
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,800
You know, there's lots of bright colors.

874
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,040
Doesn't go too fast.

875
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:10,360
You know, if they like it, you can usually get right back in line pretty quickly.

876
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,280
So it's I feel like it's got all the factors for like, yeah,

877
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,400
especially like a under five year old to enjoy.

878
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,280
And there's also a stroller parking lot, basically pretty close to it,

879
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,880
where you can park your stroller and just leave it for a long time.

880
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,960
Yeah. Yes. Which they've done a good job lately.

881
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,960
I think of making those not like the most chaotic hell holes that have ever

882
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,120
like I feel like theme park stroller zones are often a lawless land.

883
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,160
Like they are like you do people just like push theirs into a pile.

884
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,520
They start stacking up triple decker.

885
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,080
They get so nuts.

886
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,200
What's funny is that's the kind of thing that somehow

887
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,520
I just was completely blind.

888
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,040
I had a real blind spot.

889
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,800
Like I just it's like it was a color my eyes couldn't see.

890
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,160
I mean, I remember being in a stroller when I was a little kid

891
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,240
that you would rent. My mom would rent a stroller at Disneyland.

892
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,600
It was like this little green stroller, I think that you could rent.

893
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,960
So I sort of remember vaguely remember the stroller parking from that time.

894
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,320
And then even though it existed, it didn't exist to me all

895
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,160
all the way up until this most recent time that we went.

896
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,440
Right. Right.

897
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,880
It's like unless you need it, you just don't even it doesn't even register.

898
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,160
For me, it didn't at least.

899
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,400
I agree with that. Yeah.

900
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,880
Anyone ever think about

901
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,560
what if it was not that this was not a bizarre thing to do?

902
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:35,880
If you imagine like, what if I could be in a big stroller at Disneyland today?

903
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,600
If someone could push me around in an adult size stroller?

904
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,440
I guess, yeah, for sure.

905
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,720
Thought about that. Yeah.

906
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,880
How do you have to be dressed up like a big baby?

907
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,880
I don't know, Scott.

908
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,320
The rules of your hypothetical.

909
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,960
I am going to call that the point where it gets weird.

910
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,560
When I was saying if it's not weird, I think the baby, the

911
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,480
the baby, the giant onesie is the point where it gets.

912
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:06,680
I like I like if I can wear my polo shirt, but also just be in a giant stroller.

913
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,800
I like that.

914
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,000
I like the idea of the big bonnet and the diaper, but not the stroller.

915
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,000
Oh, like you're just dressed like a big baby.

916
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,320
And whenever you want, you could do that around your house right now.

917
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,240
Hmm. That's a good. Hey, you know what?

918
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,560
Oh, Mike is leaving the zoom call.

919
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,720
You are not free to do that at Disneyland.

920
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,720
Let's be sure. Let's be clear on that.

921
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,880
Like you're not necessarily.

922
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,040
You cannot dress like Big Baby Huey at Disneyland.

923
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,920
What would happen?

924
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,960
I don't know. I feel like the plain clothes cops.

925
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,840
I feel like they flag people pretty early on like, hey, they're going to be a problem.

926
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,840
Are there actual plain clothes cops at Disneyland?

927
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,960
There's plain clothes. Disney security.

928
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,200
Like that there is do.

929
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,200
There's a story a few years ago about people, especially after

930
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,840
weed legalization in California.

931
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,800
You know, now I think at this point, they just go like, hey, man,

932
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,000
just take it back to your car and get in line.

933
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,120
By the time it was very new or it was still medicinal or whatever.

934
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:15,000
And some people got pulled out of line and there were plain clothes security guys.

935
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,280
And they were wearing like the baggy

936
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,680
like Darth Vader with a Mickey ice cream bar shirt.

937
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:25,560
Like they were dressed like dads, like to blend in with the crowd.

938
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,720
Yeah. Wow.

939
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,360
And yeah, they would like I don't it's weird.

940
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,480
I'm not sure how many of them are there are because sometimes you hear like, oh,

941
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,360
they're everywhere.

942
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:39,320
They can, you know, spring into action at a moment's notice.

943
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,520
And then there's been like, especially a couple of years ago, there was like a weird

944
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,000
like fight that happened at Disneyland in Toontown, right?

945
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,200
In Toontown. And it was like they were nowhere to be found.

946
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,240
I didn't see anyone for minutes.

947
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,240
So I'm not sure.

948
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,360
I I think we've once or twice been like, I think that's one of them.

949
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,720
Like, because they kind of stick out a little bit.

950
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,280
It definitely feels like they're like doing dad cosplay.

951
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,720
Like, yeah, something's a little off and like they're alone.

952
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,440
Like they're alone. They're a dad, but they're alone.

953
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:13,080
They say the way to pick out an undercover cop is look at the shoes.

954
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,200
Like the shoes are always a dead giveaway.

955
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,520
The shoes are always wrong.

956
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,520
Like it's always wrong.

957
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:23,200
It's either like like like Skechers dress shoes,

958
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,680
orthopedic dress shoes or like the shoes that like Rudy Giuliani was photographed

959
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,200
in a month ago and everyone's like, what are those?

960
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,360
Oh, like the pilgrim shoes.

961
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:38,080
The pilgrim shoes are like, yeah, very odd shoes.

962
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,960
Isn't that how you pick out an actual undercover cop, too?

963
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,720
That's what I mean. Yeah, that's how you pick out an actual undercover cop.

964
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:49,320
So I'm assuming I'm assuming it translates to Disney undercover cops, too.

965
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:54,800
So like unless they just issue them like fluorescent New Balance's like dads.

966
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,200
You know, something that I remember, something that struck me,

967
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,120
I remember when Splash Mountain was introduced and I remember going on it.

968
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,080
It was fine. It was fun.

969
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,080
I didn't have strong feelings about it either way.

970
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,600
And then my husband and I were at Disneyland

971
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,080
and we went on Splash Mountain and I got drenched, like soaked.

972
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:23,160
Like I had to go buy new socks. Yeah.

973
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,920
And change socks.

974
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,880
And it was just it was miserable.

975
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,200
And I want I kind of wanted to go home after that because I'm a ton of fun.

976
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:35,280
But I would like did how did I avoid getting so wet before?

977
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,640
Did they change it?

978
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,240
Well, they can change the amount of splash at the end.

979
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,560
And by what?

980
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,720
I it's a little unclear.

981
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,680
It's a little unclear exactly like the numbers,

982
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,120
but I know they can change the sort of the splash at the end.

983
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,720
But because now I'm taking it personally. Yes.

984
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,760
But also there's a couple of different factors.

985
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,200
Log placement is a big factor.

986
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,800
Mm hmm. Yeah, I don't know where I don't know where I had been sitting before.

987
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,880
Yeah, log placement can really make the difference between getting soaked.

988
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,920
And then also, and I think we haven't gotten a good answer for this.

989
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,720
There's like the second biggest drop on the ride is the one

990
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,600
where I think the most people get wet as well.

991
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,560
So I think if you're in the front of the log at this point,

992
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:22,080
and I don't know if this has always been the case, people get their pants soaked.

993
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,360
The first two people in the log on that first drop, not the big crazy one,

994
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,280
they get their pants like soaked on that.

995
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,720
So I think there's now there's a variety of places where you can get wet.

996
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,240
It depends on I think in like the summer, they might turn the water up

997
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,920
on the big splash when it's hotter out.

998
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,120
And then it's all like log, because I've been in the back of the log

999
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,160
and escaped mostly unscathed.

1000
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,120
And then I've been in the front and got soaked on that first drop

1001
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,640
and then got pretty wet on the final one.

1002
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,320
So I think it all depends.

1003
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,440
If there's a there's many factors is what I'm saying.

1004
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,520
I'm thinking back to like that photo that they take, you know,

1005
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,840
and like, did we buy a key chain?

1006
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,120
Because then if we did, I could look into the hole

1007
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,800
and I could tell you exactly where I was sitting. Yeah. Yes.

1008
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,600
Are you third? Are you fifth?

1009
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,720
Like where what is the splash point?

1010
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,880
But are you suspecting that this is a conspiracy

1011
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,040
and that you were being targeted by some splash operator?

1012
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,480
I mean, I wasn't.

1013
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,720
But now that Mike mentions that they can control it, I am as possible.

1014
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,000
And what is it like?

1015
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,840
Do they hate my podcast?

1016
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,080
Do they hate my my vibe?

1017
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,880
Do they hate my hair?

1018
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,000
I, you know, it's up to the operator.

1019
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,560
It's up to whoever the operator is at this point.

1020
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,680
You know, I maybe they make a call.

1021
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,320
It would be funny if there was like a malevolent,

1022
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,440
like a evil villain in the control room.

1023
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,480
It's just like like Ursula.

1024
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,440
It was Ursula.

1025
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,000
She's just like dictating to like more splash for this car.

1026
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,040
I don't like this log full of people.

1027
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,640
It's like Ursula or it's like Ashton Kutcher. Yes.

1028
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,560
This is I get this on camera.

1029
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:00,200
I also remember when and again, this dates me

1030
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:06,040
when the Matterhorn, I think I remember when the Matterhorn

1031
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,560
introduced the abominable snowman.

1032
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,760
Yeah, that's about it.

1033
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,080
Yeti was not always in that ride, right?

1034
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:17,520
Yeah, there was a point, I think, like like late 70s, I think,

1035
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,960
is where he showed up.

1036
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,160
Oh, yeah. How do I remember that then?

1037
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,600
They also changed the snowman at some point in time.

1038
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,120
They made a change a number of.

1039
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,520
Yeah, he's been they made it on the 60th anniversary,

1040
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,720
like five or six years ago, they put like a very advanced one in there.

1041
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,080
Mm hmm. But I forget.

1042
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,760
Yeah, I forget if we talked, we did the matter, right?

1043
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,080
We did one episode about that. Yeah, we did do it.

1044
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,120
Yeah, I forget. Amazing.

1045
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,240
I had one the other day. Yeah.

1046
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,000
There's probably theme park.

1047
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,040
Memories are very positive, like memories, good times with family and friends

1048
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,240
and also a lot of Mandela effect.

1049
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,080
Yeah. Or Mandela. It's been a dollar.

1050
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,160
Is that right? OK, is that I said?

1051
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,720
Yeah, it's a lot of that.

1052
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,400
I have convinced myself that right in my memory.

1053
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,680
There are total mirror opposites where it's like, oh, God,

1054
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,040
all the action happens on the left in this ride.

1055
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,040
I have been picturing the right in the last 10 years.

1056
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,040
Yeah, it's also possible on that Matterhorn episode, we were like, well,

1057
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,880
of course, the Yeti first appeared in 1981 and like we were so very

1058
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,160
like authoritative, we have people like, oh, these guys really know

1059
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:21,720
what they're talking about.

1060
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,320
And then it just went right out of our heads like two days later.

1061
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:29,160
Well, yeah, because the yeah, the two hours of work or whatever research,

1062
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,600
you know, and then you do it and then you move on to the next episode.

1063
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:36,920
You got to make room for new fat to it. Right. Yes. Yeah.

1064
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,280
And then also now I'm just using you guys as my personal Disney Google.

1065
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,960
Sure. Yes.

1066
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,600
There was a train ride where you saw dinosaurs ages ago, right?

1067
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,960
There still is. That is the train. Yeah.

1068
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,520
You still see it. Yeah.

1069
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,680
I didn't know that.

1070
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,120
Maybe it was out of maybe it wasn't working.

1071
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,200
The last time I thought of trying to go on it or something.

1072
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,880
It's funny you say that because I think it was a couple of years

1073
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,400
actually going to Disneyland before I figured it out,

1074
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,280
because you have to go on the Tomorrowland to Main Street loop.

1075
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,480
Am I correct, Jason? Yeah, that's right.

1076
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,320
There's one loop of the train, Disneyland Railroad,

1077
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:16,840
that takes you through Primeval World, which is this whole diorama.

1078
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,920
And it's it's like the Grand Canyon.

1079
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,160
And then it takes you back in time and you see like big robot dinosaurs.

1080
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,000
And it's been there forever.

1081
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,040
And I didn't know it was there for a couple of years.

1082
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,320
But you have to go on that one stretch from Tomorrowland to Main Street to see it.

1083
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,400
Yeah. If you got on at Main Street and got off in Frontierland,

1084
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,400
you would not write or New Orleans Square.

1085
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,800
You would not see the dinosaurs.

1086
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,160
I don't even know where you line up to get.

1087
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:45,440
And this is not this is a completely different line than the monorail. Right.

1088
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:50,960
Yes. Yes. But it's but it's all kind of a mess back by the by the Autopia as well.

1089
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,600
It's all sort of crammed around there.

1090
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,920
And you could like you could easily get in one line thinking you're

1091
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,480
going on to the other side.

1092
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,960
I have a terrible sense of direction.

1093
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,400
So this is no wonder I can't find it.

1094
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:05,440
But when you're seeing the dinosaurs, are you inside?

1095
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,400
Like, is it inside a tunnel kind of thing? Yes.

1096
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,800
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

1097
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,920
It's all restored.

1098
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:14,200
Like it's all holdover stuff from the World's Fair, from the 64, 65 World's Fair.

1099
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,040
That they like throughout the years have like,

1100
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,040
you know, kept it up and redone it and stuff.

1101
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:24,800
It was a ride where you took a Ford car and you drove it past dinosaurs.

1102
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,880
And then they made it a ride where you'd get on a train and take it past dinosaurs.

1103
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,480
Neither particularly makes sense.

1104
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,840
But they're all interesting rides, though.

1105
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:40,640
And it's look with the power of Ford and a good quality Detroit,

1106
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,880
you know, made in Detroit and wonderful gasoline.

1107
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,240
You can ride the highways of America.

1108
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,040
You can drive by dinosaurs.

1109
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:51,720
You can do whatever your mind pleases.

1110
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,920
You can see where the gas came from.

1111
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,320
You can see awesome.

1112
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,560
The dancing robot.

1113
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:02,600
Another memory, I believe it was in Tomorrowland.

1114
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,400
There were these phone booths where it was speakerphone.

1115
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,800
But this is before again, I'm 23.

1116
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,800
So it's weird that I'm able to remember a time before speakerphone.

1117
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,360
But there was a keypad on the wall and you would just dial it.

1118
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,720
And then it was like speakerphone. It was so cool.

1119
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,240
Does anyone remember this?

1120
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:23,560
Yes. We've never talked about this because I would go in there with my mom

1121
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,480
and we would call my grandma and say, guess what?

1122
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,760
We're in the giant phone.

1123
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,320
And I don't remember where it was or what it was or why.

1124
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,960
You would like you wouldn't go in there to make a call you needed to make.

1125
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,600
You would use it and call someone just because it was cool.

1126
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,440
They had they had it at Epcot. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1127
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,400
You wouldn't do business there. No.

1128
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,720
What is it like the Hall of Inventions or something?

1129
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,440
It Epcot, it was, I believe, after Spaceship Earth.

1130
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,520
It was like the exit area at Spaceship Earth.

1131
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,320
Yeah, I feel like it was around Space Mountain.

1132
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,560
No, maybe around.

1133
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:00,440
Hmm. I looked up Disneyland giant phone and I found nothing.

1134
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,240
That's too confusing of a Google.

1135
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:07,160
So maybe sad is that you're just going to get like a Mickey Mouse

1136
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,360
with a speakerphone function phone.

1137
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,880
Exactly. It's products.

1138
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,320
This is this is very difficult.

1139
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,520
Wait, wait, AT&T giant speakerphone.

1140
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:17,280
This was at Epcot, Mike. You're correct.

1141
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,400
But they're all right.

1142
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,520
AT&T giant speakerphone episode coming soon.

1143
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,760
There also was one at Disneyland, I swear, because I've never been to Epcot.

1144
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,840
Hmm. I wonder.

1145
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,840
Yeah. No, no, no. You're correct.

1146
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,840
Because I did this cherished memory and it's not a button.

1147
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,040
Feeling like I was I had shrunk and was next to a regular size.

1148
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,680
And I was very small.

1149
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,440
Scott. Yes.

1150
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,760
I know. No, I don't believe so.

1151
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,280
Because I remember it from being a little before there was interventions.

1152
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,680
Someone settle the bet for us.

1153
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,880
When was there a big phone searching?

1154
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,440
Disneyland.

1155
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,920
Now, see, I looked up AT&T giant speakerphone,

1156
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,320
but then again, I just find an actual product.

1157
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,440
I just find like a bunch of wholesale phones for my office.

1158
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,320
And I don't have an office.

1159
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,720
The one on Epcot that you just found.

1160
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,440
And then can you put that name in and then search Disneyland?

1161
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,200
AT&T giant speakerphone was the attraction at Epcot.

1162
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,480
And here you wait here.

1163
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,080
Now it's on my mouse mice chat.

1164
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,120
Someone is saying huge phone and Epcot.

1165
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,240
I don't think it was.

1166
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,040
Wait a minute.

1167
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,840
It looks like there was something called colossal communicator.

1168
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,360
Circle vision, speakerphone booths.

1169
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,840
I'm looking on mice chat.

1170
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,960
It used to be where the and someone is just asking people about it.

1171
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,880
It used to be where the Buzz Lightyear is now.

1172
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,400
The people move.

1173
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,560
Yeah, that feels right.

1174
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,720
Circle vision pre show room.

1175
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:40,920
Da da da.

1176
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,240
Yeah.

1177
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,920
Circle. Wait, what is Circle Vision, though?

1178
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,120
Isn't that where America Sings was?

1179
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:51,880
No, Circle Vision, we've also never talked about.

1180
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:56,560
It's where you would go see 360 movies that were shot on nine cameras

1181
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,360
that all fanned out from the same point, and they would show you

1182
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,680
shots of the Grand Canyon, stuff like that.

1183
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,640
Yeah, I didn't really.

1184
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,400
Yeah, it was never my favorite thing.

1185
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,840
Do you guys like movies?

1186
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:10,600
Right. The one in Canada at Epcot is Circle Vision.

1187
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:15,200
Oh, they have a ton of France, Canada, China.

1188
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,960
I like the idea of it.

1189
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,680
Technology. I like the idea of it.

1190
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:24,080
But I've never been like super hyped on Circle Vision.

1191
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:29,680
Mm hmm. No, I think it was like a hot air balloon giant phone.

1192
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,120
That's what I associate it with.

1193
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,800
Yes, that's the kind of thing.

1194
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,400
Now, you of course see hot air balloons also in Soren,

1195
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,360
but that's not what we're talking about.

1196
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:44,040
This was a weird, an old analog way to see big air.

1197
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,040
You could talk on a speakerphone after.

1198
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,240
And then talk on a giant phone, which but that's not AT&T

1199
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,080
giant, but I know I was there.

1200
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:01,640
I I'm afraid if we keep helping you uncover buried memories,

1201
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:05,000
eventually it will lead to darkness.

1202
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,120
We're just one tick away from something.

1203
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,320
Wait a minute. Grim.

1204
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,120
You heard bad news on the giant.

1205
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:16,680
I was in the ice cream parlor and I realized I was looking right at Zodiac.

1206
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,160
I was looking at the Zodiac killer himself.

1207
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:23,040
Well, that's if we keep digging, maybe we'll find some unsolved murders.

1208
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,480
We'll find that be cool. Yeah.

1209
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,560
I yeah, I called my grandma on the giant speakerphone

1210
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,720
and some other voice picked up.

1211
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,360
And then my grandma got murdered.

1212
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,480
It was Richard Ramirez, the nice talker.

1213
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,840
It was a future phone exhibit.

1214
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:45,200
It had glass booths with speakerphones and seating for about six.

1215
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,080
Yeah, he was right.

1216
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,400
But did you like it or you just remember it?

1217
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,000
Because I feel like that's where I am.

1218
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
I'm like, was that good or not? It was cool.

1219
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,800
I don't know. It wasn't nearly as exciting as, you know, all the other stuff.

1220
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,600
But sure.

1221
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,440
For me, a thrill was when I got to the age

1222
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,520
where I could go with friends and parents as well.

1223
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,160
But it would be like, OK, you guys can go off on your own.

1224
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,520
Meet us back here at this time.

1225
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,920
Like not having to be tethered to and I don't mean

1226
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,240
my parents didn't have actual tethers or anything,

1227
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,280
but not and not having to be with my mom the whole time

1228
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:29,200
to experience like a little bit of what felt like independence,

1229
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,360
because then it felt like anything could happen.

1230
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:36,720
I mean, I remember for many years feeling like I'm probably going to like

1231
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,400
meet my boyfriend.

1232
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,560
I didn't have a boyfriend, but I'm probably going to get one from going to Disneyland.

1233
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,480
I'm just looking cute.

1234
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,840
Sure. I didn't I didn't look cute, but I was, you know,

1235
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,600
that's what I mean about like it felt like possibility, like any.

1236
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:56,440
I mean, I was like a chunky kid who made my own Michael Jackson pins

1237
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,640
and put that like.

1238
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,840
There weren't a lot of young boys dig in my style,

1239
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,280
but I still felt like anything could happen at one of these theme parks.

1240
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,200
If I was away from my parents.

1241
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:13,600
Yes, I remember the same phenomenon, and I do think maybe maybe in my head,

1242
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:18,560
I was like the way you get a girlfriend is you lock eyes with someone

1243
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,960
and then you're a girl, your boyfriend, girlfriend.

1244
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,760
Like it would just like happen like that, because it would also like take

1245
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,680
any of the work out of like, hey, you have to meet somebody

1246
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,360
and they have to like you and you have to not be a weird 13 year old.

1247
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,720
Like all that was gone.

1248
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:36,080
So you'd imagine this magic and it would, of course, be special

1249
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:40,000
when you were away from your parents, because then then you could really be yourself.

1250
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,120
I guess I don't know what your head thought.

1251
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,880
For that hour and a half in a line, you'd meet somebody, fall in love

1252
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,360
and then say, I have to go back and be with my parents.

1253
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:54,400
Yeah, but before I go, I have to tell you,

1254
01:04:55,040 --> 01:05:00,480
you know who rode this ride on opening day, Dan DeFour, Ozzie and Harriet's next door neighbor.

1255
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,480
Pretty cool, right?

1256
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,680
That would have been your opening.

1257
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:04,720
Never forget that.

1258
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,800
Exactly what would make people fall in love.

1259
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:12,560
Don't confuse him with the man, William Frawley, who played

1260
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,880
Fred Mertz on I Love Lucy.

1261
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,080
He is not Dan DeFour.

1262
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,520
I was glad we're all dating somebody currently.

1263
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:25,760
Yes.

1264
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,560
I had to think of Halps.

1265
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,200
This is where we were at.

1266
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,800
We've only gone deeper down.

1267
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,000
We've gone all the way.

1268
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,080
We went so far down this rabbit hole.

1269
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:38,720
At 13 when I thought maybe I could will a girlfriend into happening.

1270
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:43,680
I don't think I was going to tell her about William Frawley who played Fred Mertz on I Love Lucy.

1271
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,120
I do think I had some shame about it and now it's gone.

1272
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:51,440
Now, Lindsay, my girlfriend is just hears about William Frawley every day.

1273
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,200
Well, sure.

1274
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:58,560
And probably giving it, you know, factoids right back because that seems like in our lane as well.

1275
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,560
Not as much.

1276
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:01,060
You know.

1277
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,160
No, she doesn't want to.

1278
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,560
What are her thoughts on Autopia?

1279
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:07,060
Lindsay?

1280
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:08,640
Yeah.

1281
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,520
We never go on it.

1282
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:10,820
Okay.

1283
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,040
We never go.

1284
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,560
Let's talk about this.

1285
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,640
Allison, I think there's a pretty big

1286
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,600
component, there's a pretty big opinion among theme park fans that

1287
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,080
people have nice Autopia memories.

1288
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:26,640
This is cool.

1289
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,680
It's a nice place to experience that driving freedom.

1290
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,080
However, it is so much land.

1291
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,600
There's so much land there.

1292
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,400
We're all becoming greedy Daniel Plain views.

1293
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:41,200
Like, look how much land and we could get maybe like a big new roller coaster there.

1294
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,760
If we just got rid of that Autopia.

1295
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,880
Where do you where do you fall on this discussion?

1296
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:51,680
Well, it does seem like a simpler ride from yesteryear.

1297
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:52,740
I can't.

1298
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:59,460
I don't even think now I sound like an like get off my lawn old man, but I can't imagine

1299
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:04,820
young kids are that excited about driving even because it seems to me, especially with

1300
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,220
like Lyft and Uber and things like that.

1301
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:13,860
Pre pandemic, it seems like I know a lot of people who have 16 year olds who don't

1302
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:16,180
who opt not to get their license on their birthday.

1303
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:21,220
Like this thing where that was like the only way to have freedom is to get my license

1304
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:23,620
when I turn 16 and then I can.

1305
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:25,140
You know, it's not like that anymore.

1306
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:29,460
So I just doubt that that ride would be nearly as popular now.

1307
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:30,900
That's fair.

1308
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:31,400
Yeah.

1309
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:39,300
I just laugh because it's like the world of tomorrow as in pitched by Disneyland at the

1310
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:47,220
moment is just a giant gasoline spewing car ride next to a giant water eating like

1311
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:49,060
submarine ride.

1312
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:51,940
And it just that is such a huge amount.

1313
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:54,420
You could build a whole other land at that area.

1314
01:07:54,420 --> 01:08:00,980
It's funny, too, to look back like the year 2000 when Chevron started sponsoring Autopia

1315
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:07,860
and they kind of at that point, like combined the areas of like the the Junior Fantasy Land

1316
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:14,180
Autopia and Tomorrowland Autopia made one long one and their vision for the future was

1317
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:16,980
just tiny gas guzzling cars.

1318
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:22,260
Like, well, stinky cars like, of course, Disney, some Disney obviously wants to project the

1319
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:27,300
future, a futuristic futurism type of vibe of like, oh, this is gonna be wonderful in

1320
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:27,860
the future.

1321
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:33,940
But as we, of course, learned in the Epcot ride, the universe of energy, sometimes their

1322
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,340
thinking is not so forward.

1323
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:40,340
Sometimes they go, yes, isn't this wonderful?

1324
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:44,660
The land of tomorrow, by the way, we need to get a bunch of money from this car company.

1325
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:47,140
The only way they'll do it is if it's a gas engine.

1326
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:53,220
Listen, good news, this gas company's got to pay to redo the whole ride.

1327
01:08:53,220 --> 01:09:00,580
We just have to include their characters, the Chevron Cars, Dusty, Sparky and Susie.

1328
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,780
People like the Chevron Cars, right?

1329
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:06,420
Everyone knows and loves the Chevron Cars.

1330
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:11,940
Remember from the commercials, the Chevron Cars, you could see all you could be in the

1331
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:13,060
Chevron Cars.

1332
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:15,460
You could see all you could be in your friends.

1333
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:19,540
Yeah, that's one of the things I would put when we're talking about should it go, should

1334
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:25,700
it go away forever is like they have cars with names and I didn't know until I was looking

1335
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,700
today for information.

1336
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:28,200
Yes.

1337
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:29,720
Yeah.

1338
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:34,820
And Chevron said they were surprised by the popularity because for like years they then

1339
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:36,820
sold the cars in the gas station.

1340
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:41,060
But since Honda took over the sponsorship, it's all awesome boat.

1341
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,140
Now, baby, awesome and bird.

1342
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,900
I don't know who they are awesome and bird.

1343
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:53,620
If you haven't done the ride with awesome and this would have been the last three years

1344
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:58,340
you would have had to have gone to the utopia and see it's not at his new end anymore, is

1345
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:58,740
it?

1346
01:09:58,740 --> 01:09:59,220
Oh, yeah.

1347
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:00,900
It is still there.

1348
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,420
Oh, very much still there.

1349
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:02,900
Yeah.

1350
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:07,620
For now, unless we get our wish to burn it to the ground.

1351
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:08,100
Yeah.

1352
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:08,600
Yeah.

1353
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:09,320
A version.

1354
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,600
I didn't know this.

1355
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,320
How did I not?

1356
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,800
Well, it's because I haven't been there except for that.

1357
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,080
I haven't really been there in the last.

1358
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,320
Wait, that's not where never scratch everything I said for the record.

1359
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,920
Nothing I'm saying is making sense.

1360
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,280
I was unaware that it's still there.

1361
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:27,720
I have not met awesome and bird.

1362
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,160
But next time I go, I will acquaint myself with them.

1363
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,040
Oh, awesome.

1364
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:38,120
Is the robot Honda built in the 90s that would like go around to schools and like

1365
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,360
tech conferences and dance?

1366
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,560
It's kind of like what do we know though?

1367
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:47,560
What type of dance did did awesome learn in robot school?

1368
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,560
Was it just slide?

1369
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,000
Was it just slide?

1370
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,200
A simple box step.

1371
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:55,960
He could probably pull off a rudimentary box that may be a grapevine.

1372
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:01,720
No, no need for a cake walk as robots cannot.

1373
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:02,840
Make them corrode.

1374
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,160
Jason's robot though can do a cake walk that he's been building for years.

1375
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,680
He brings me the cake.

1376
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,360
That's his secondary function.

1377
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:12,840
He wins the cake walk is this primary function.

1378
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,320
The secondary function is delivers the cake to me.

1379
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:20,760
So wait, is it is there because there used to always be a really long line for Autopia.

1380
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,880
Is there still a long line?

1381
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,160
Is it still popular?

1382
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:27,800
There seems to be a wait every time because once in a while we'll go like,

1383
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,920
oh, you want to go on Autopia?

1384
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:29,640
I guess I'm looking.

1385
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,920
It's like 30 minutes.

1386
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,520
No, not for this.

1387
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,600
Like it does seem there.

1388
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:39,080
It's it feels like it should be five minutes, but it does feel like it's always still a pretty big wait.

1389
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,240
Well, it's a seat belt.

1390
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:42,360
Still a leather strap.

1391
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:42,860
Line.

1392
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,240
It is a strap.

1393
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:46,440
Yeah, leather.

1394
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,000
It's it's like a vinyl cloth.

1395
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,440
It's like a big it's like it goes over at both people's laps.

1396
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:52,940
Yeah.

1397
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:53,240
Yeah.

1398
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:53,640
Yeah.

1399
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,840
It's not like 10 little studs.

1400
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,280
There's so many studs.

1401
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,200
It's if that's the word.

1402
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,480
I am six, three.

1403
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:05,080
And it's it's the opposite problem that you were talking about.

1404
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,080
I barely fit in the car also.

1405
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:14,440
So as much as I don't have a problem, as much as it's fun once in a while, I go,

1406
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,840
you know, we haven't been on topia in a year or two.

1407
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,160
And then you get in there and you go, why are we on Autopia?

1408
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:24,440
So, yeah, but I think I do think, yeah, yeah, I do think kids.

1409
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,920
The idea of it is fun, but I do think it doesn't live up to

1410
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:35,160
even the promise because because the technology of it is still basically the same as when

1411
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,720
Autopia opened.

1412
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:42,600
And now the kids have been on Radiator Springs Racer and sure that's the Cars Land ride

1413
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:47,480
at California Adventure and sure they're not controlling it, but the ride is 50 times better.

1414
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:52,120
So I can't I can imagine kids are like, yeah, this is kind of cool.

1415
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,080
I'm kind of driving it.

1416
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:57,720
But then they go and they go, but I can go see Mater and we go faster and we get to see cool stuff.

1417
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:04,040
So I bet I don't know, I bet kids don't love it like they used to for and we've talked about

1418
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:04,840
that already today.

1419
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:09,560
But for a variety, like it feels the kids can feel it, whether they can articulate or not,

1420
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,720
that it's not as sophisticated as most of the rides now they're going on.

1421
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:14,520
I would imagine.

1422
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:22,200
Yeah, nor is it as exciting as go-karts, which you can actually drive fast.

1423
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:30,360
And if you are seeking danger as a kid, then maybe you get that fix with a go-kart and certainly not

1424
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:34,120
with a seven mile per hour governed vehicle.

1425
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,240
I got nailed.

1426
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:40,920
Like I pulled into like to, you know, exit the ride in a go-kart once and the kid behind me

1427
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,160
did not break and just nailed the car.

1428
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,080
And it sucks.

1429
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:50,680
It sucks on Autopia and like it's not going very fast at all.

1430
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:56,280
The long line, by the way, comes from how much of a pain in the ass it is to get people in and out

1431
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,400
of those cars in a quick fashion.

1432
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,560
Like that sucks.

1433
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1434
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:04,140
Yeah.

1435
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:10,920
I mean, maybe a way to spice this thing up if they don't intend to get rid of it,

1436
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,480
maybe they need to bring back an idea from the past.

1437
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:18,920
And one of my favorite things I discovered about this attraction that there was police

1438
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:24,200
officers, that there were highway patrol officers in the original Autopia.

1439
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:31,560
There were 40 cars and two of them they painted black and white and they would deputize Autopia

1440
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:37,720
employees to drive around and chase down kids who were making trouble and trying to hop over the

1441
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:43,240
rails or trying to turn the car around entirely, which did happen one time.

1442
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:50,120
Some kid figured out the one way that you could turn the car around entirely before the rail.

1443
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,560
And then he started driving around and hit another car space first.

1444
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,160
Now that's fun.

1445
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,840
Now there's some stakes.

1446
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:57,340
Yes.

1447
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,400
Yeah, yeah.

1448
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,000
Maybe you got to make it dangerous again.

1449
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,520
Maybe we got to go back to the Wild West.

1450
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:08,840
Which that I think the police officer thing, I mean, that's so insane.

1451
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,600
I think it didn't happen very often.

1452
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:15,480
I think people were not necessarily fearing the fake highway patrolman.

1453
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:19,960
I think it was mainly that they would say to little kids, hey, you want to ride with me in

1454
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:23,160
the police car and that would seem like a little special trip.

1455
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,640
But yeah, maybe we bring stakes back.

1456
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,720
We bring back highway patrol.

1457
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:33,160
We give you the ability to do a full turn and start coming heading into human traffic.

1458
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:39,800
They do Disneyland events, Disneyland after dark, two hours, three hours, you pay an upcharge fee.

1459
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:44,520
But yeah, maybe on one of these, it's retro night and they just take off the divider thing

1460
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,320
in the middle for that, just that event.

1461
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:50,440
So you can drive it like kids drove it in the 1950s.

1462
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:54,840
That was one of my things that made me nervous about this ride and a kid.

1463
01:15:54,840 --> 01:16:01,800
I thought I was going to get in trouble the more I hit the safety rail, the rail under the car.

1464
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,200
I was like, you're really not supposed to hit that.

1465
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,200
That's just in case of a birth.

1466
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,600
I don't know why I got this in my head.

1467
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:11,560
One of my parents probably without thinking was like, hey, don't do that.

1468
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,080
Just keep it straight. Keep it straight.

1469
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:16,200
It's like you were doing like operation rules, the video, the game operation,

1470
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,520
where you can't hit the sides while you're operating.

1471
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,440
I guess so.

1472
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:26,600
I mean, there's a certain kind of kid that just makes up like the punishment.

1473
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,880
Death is around every quarter.

1474
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,560
Everything is a source of worry.

1475
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:37,000
And then they all go into the entertainment industry and that's how we are here.

1476
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:43,000
So yes, you really that's but you know, you don't get a score at the end.

1477
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:48,200
No one judges how many times I will say I was looking at the Florida.

1478
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:52,040
I watched the Florida one, which I they, you know, a lot of the

1479
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,200
Autopias around the world have different names.

1480
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:59,960
Florida, they call I believe the current iteration is just called the Tomorrowland Speedway.

1481
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:09,320
And it is filled with a number of giant white spheres and like metal art, like installation,

1482
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:13,000
like it looks like Richard Serra metal art made it white.

1483
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:18,200
Yeah. Why? What's that about?

1484
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,520
I don't know. I mean, it's kind of futuristic.

1485
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:22,360
It's the only futuristic looking thing.

1486
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:29,880
They briefly had a sponsorship with the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in the Florida one.

1487
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,520
And I have no recollection of that.

1488
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:36,440
Like they put in some work like car racing specifics for that.

1489
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,640
Well, I don't know. What do we do?

1490
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,560
Do we try to turn it around or do we bail?

1491
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:46,840
Do we just bail on this?

1492
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:47,400
You think bad.

1493
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:52,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to Autopia and I'm sorry to the Autopia lovers among us,

1494
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:56,600
of which I claimed that I was one since I'm like, I want to talk about Autopia.

1495
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:00,200
But the more we talk about it, the more I've decided it's an idea whose

1496
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,200
day has come and gone.

1497
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,760
Like no one really cares about cars that much.

1498
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,640
And the exciting things are like electric cars.

1499
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:13,000
So I mean, I guess maybe we could turn it into a bunch of Teslas.

1500
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,760
I think people have talked about Tesla.

1501
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,600
I do think there's like we do.

1502
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:20,680
So another term we'll have to talk about is plus up, which is when you make a ride better

1503
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,720
when they like add something that's newer.

1504
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:30,520
There's probably a plus up version of this that is like Wi-Fi controlled vehicles

1505
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:37,080
that you can control, but they keep you on rails, but like not with an actual physical rail.

1506
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:41,560
So they can prevent you from hitting a wall just because the car won't be able to do it.

1507
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:48,680
There is probably some crazy, crazy expensive version of this that has like

1508
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:53,320
the Tesla self-driving technology, but it has to always work.

1509
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,320
And that works so well.

1510
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:56,520
That's great.

1511
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:02,120
Finally, a ride that just catches on fire for no reason as opposed to when they

1512
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,680
occasionally catch on fire for a reason.

1513
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,880
Again, stakes.

1514
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,640
Yes, the danger.

1515
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:08,520
That's fair.

1516
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:14,360
I think in Tokyo, didn't they make them electric in Tokyo before they closed it there?

1517
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,400
I believe that's right.

1518
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:21,000
But then they closed it, the ultimate move of the future.

1519
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:25,080
They gained land and put in Beauty and the Beast and stuff.

1520
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:29,640
Like a next generation Beauty and the Beast ride, but it was cost prohibitive.

1521
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,840
It is insanely expensive to convert all those cars to electric.

1522
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:40,120
We've heard old Imagineers talk about the transformative thing that happens for kids

1523
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:42,760
on Autopia when they get to drive for the first time.

1524
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:44,920
When I was a kid, I drove, I liked it.

1525
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:47,000
I don't feel it was transformative.

1526
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,520
I don't feel it changed.

1527
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,240
It was cool.

1528
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,120
I liked it.

1529
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:54,760
But I much rather would go on pirates because there were pirates on that ride.

1530
01:19:55,720 --> 01:20:01,000
I liked steering, but I also knew this isn't a real car and I'm not on a highway.

1531
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:08,280
Well, before the internet and cable television, all you had to do for entertainment, you go

1532
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:14,200
down to the malt shop or the drive-in, you meet up with Corn Pop and Soda Head.

1533
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:17,000
And that was transformative.

1534
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,680
You would do this whole thing.

1535
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:24,280
Nowadays, kids have cable TV and the internet and they don't need it as much.

1536
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,800
Who are Corn Pop and Soda Head?

1537
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:26,600
Are those your friends?

1538
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,840
Joe Biden's childhood.

1539
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,680
One of them is Joe Biden's childhood.

1540
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:30,920
Right, right.

1541
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:32,280
Yes.

1542
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:37,480
Hey, nothing but respect for my president and his weird old friends.

1543
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:39,560
I love them now.

1544
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,520
Soda Pop, Secretary of State.

1545
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,680
Secretary of Transportation, Corn Pop.

1546
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:47,240
Put them in.

1547
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,680
Corn Pop is going to fix coronavirus.

1548
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,880
It's better than what we've had.

1549
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:52,520
It is.

1550
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:55,400
Yeah, without having met Corn Pop, it is better than what we've had.

1551
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,440
I prefer Corn Pop to Squee.

1552
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:58,040
Yeah.

1553
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:05,880
So yes, a plusing up of Autopia would have to be some crazy thing with technology that

1554
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,560
to me doesn't seem perfected yet.

1555
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:15,480
Would you accept also, all my pitches are just bringing back old ideas like the Highway

1556
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,200
Patrol.

1557
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:21,640
Apparently Bob Gurr designed a bus that there would be some, he at least just drew it and

1558
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,680
that like there'd be a bus so that a bunch of kids would go on.

1559
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:25,800
I think I like that too.

1560
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,560
One of the vehicles was just a bus, you're saying?

1561
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,800
Yeah, just pack 10 kids on the bus.

1562
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:38,280
One was like maybe one was a tractor, one was a bus, one was a plane taking off, I don't

1563
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:38,780
know.

1564
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:40,680
That's interesting.

1565
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,200
Oh, they should all be different.

1566
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,280
One's the Oscar Mayer Weir Mobile.

1567
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:45,640
Red Bull can.

1568
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:48,120
The Red Bull car.

1569
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:48,680
Perfect.

1570
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,280
Oh weird like Flugtog stuff.

1571
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:54,280
Oh yeah, like those, they could partner with, do you guys know these mini brands?

1572
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,400
Have you encountered these?

1573
01:21:55,960 --> 01:22:00,840
They're these little like blind box ball things that you open up and there's like

1574
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:06,680
a tiny thing of like Brillo Pads or like tiny thing of Arm and Hammer baking soda.

1575
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,760
And they're just like plastic replicas.

1576
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:09,560
I don't know.

1577
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:10,760
That sounds fun.

1578
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:11,260
What?

1579
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,940
What's the point of that?

1580
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:19,340
Kids like opening, since trading card packs, kids like blind boxes, you know?

1581
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:20,860
They like the risk.

1582
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:22,540
It's hard to find these things.

1583
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:24,940
I think Gen Z is going wild for the brands.

1584
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,660
Gen Z is going, you heard it here first, folks.

1585
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:29,040
Gen Z.

1586
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:35,740
What if, speaking, okay, Gen Z makes me think, is there some, it's stakes is what we keep

1587
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:36,380
coming back to.

1588
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:37,340
That's what we're talking about.

1589
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:41,740
Is there some way to like have this ride also have a lesson and the lesson is don't

1590
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:42,940
text and drive.

1591
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:43,660
That's good.

1592
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:44,160
Yeah.

1593
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:46,540
Like there's some, what, how does this play out?

1594
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:53,660
Like you're like, like, they, do they tell you like, I don't know how they make you get

1595
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:57,980
on your phone and start using it, but maybe you're just like passing by other cars that

1596
01:22:57,980 --> 01:23:00,540
have crashed into trees because they were texting.

1597
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:07,260
You're seeing like a trail of blood and accidents and gore that all, and all of it comes

1598
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:08,860
from people texting and driving.

1599
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:13,820
Well, it's funny you say that Scott, because the morning of the day of my senior prom,

1600
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:21,260
we all had to go outside and watch a little play of a wrecked car with some faked bloodied

1601
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:21,740
students.

1602
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:22,300
I did too.

1603
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:22,940
I did too.

1604
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:23,900
I did too.

1605
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:25,020
Did you do that too?

1606
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:28,460
This is more weird high school shit than we had to do.

1607
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:33,580
They staged a drunk driving car accident and the fire department was next door to the high

1608
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:34,060
school.

1609
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:39,500
So they got a fire engine to come and pull up in front of the high school next to this

1610
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:44,140
accident where students had supposedly died and they're like, okay, you can have your

1611
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:46,220
half day to get ready for prom now.

1612
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:47,100
Have fun tonight.

1613
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:52,460
We had a helicopter land on the football field to pretend that there was a drunk driving

1614
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,020
accident.

1615
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:54,860
Yes.

1616
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:56,380
Whoa.

1617
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:57,980
My high school science.

1618
01:23:57,980 --> 01:23:58,300
Cool.

1619
01:23:58,780 --> 01:23:59,580
They didn't do anything.

1620
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:00,620
Boring.

1621
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:02,860
There were no threats.

1622
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:04,620
Threat plays.

1623
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:05,660
No hell houses.

1624
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:09,420
They pulled a sheet off and they had made one of the students look like he had gone

1625
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:10,460
through the windshield.

1626
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:11,980
Yeah.

1627
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:12,620
Yes.

1628
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:13,180
Yeah.

1629
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:18,860
Everyone, people covered in blood and meanwhile, all of us are totally desensitized with it

1630
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:23,180
because all of the upperclassmen are like, oh, you got to watch a fake car accident set

1631
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:27,900
up and then you can go home for the day before the dance.

1632
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:31,420
Who got to be the kid who had went through the windshield?

1633
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:37,740
Um, I, I, it was very, just weirdos.

1634
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:38,860
I, I don't know.

1635
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:39,420
I don't know.

1636
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:43,660
Were they weirdos that went to your school or were they supplied by the city?

1637
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:44,300
Yeah.

1638
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:45,900
I, I know exactly.

1639
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:50,220
I know exactly which student was through the windshield on my school.

1640
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:52,700
It was not the drama club.

1641
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:53,200
Student.

1642
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:55,340
Oddly enough.

1643
01:24:55,340 --> 01:25:01,180
The kid who went through my fake windshield was like, hey, it's that funny guy who like

1644
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:06,700
everybody likes who like dances at the basketball games to get everybody psyched up.

1645
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:09,580
Oh, it is a crowd.

1646
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:10,140
Yeah.

1647
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:10,460
Yeah.

1648
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:16,300
Like, like it's a beloved guy who like, he's like got a lot of energy and like everybody.

1649
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:19,260
And I guess that's the narrative reason for making us all go.

1650
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:19,820
He's dead.

1651
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:20,540
He's been killed.

1652
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:22,060
Yes.

1653
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:24,460
Uh, weird.

1654
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:25,900
It's weird that you did that too.

1655
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,500
Now this is bizarre.

1656
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:28,000
God.

1657
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:30,860
Very strange.

1658
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:30,940
Okay.

1659
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:05,740
So you're driving around and you're seeing like, you know, dogs and stuff

1660
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:11,260
who are, if I really would like, crashed through the windshield, like the Polly Shore one.

1661
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:12,620
And she's everywhere.

1662
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:13,820
The can exploded.

1663
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:16,620
The whiz is everywhere.

1664
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:18,940
There's yellow on the ground.

1665
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:22,380
I like the morals you're trying to give kids here.

1666
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:25,980
And it ends up with a happy ending.

1667
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:31,580
He decides to like, or like you max learns to focus and then you listen to the nice song at the end

1668
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:35,340
and he knows to keep his eyes on the road and his hands on the wheel.

1669
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:38,780
Do we all sign off on this?

1670
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:41,100
Like a Mr. Toad vibe.

1671
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:41,420
Yeah.

1672
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:42,940
That's good.

1673
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:47,820
There has not been a good new Disney morality play for a long time.

1674
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:54,060
And I think this like blood on the concrete is the way to bring back a great Disney tradition.

1675
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:55,420
Look, I'm going to think about that.

1676
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:58,060
Mm-hmm.

1677
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:01,340
It's just, it's an idea.

1678
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:02,140
I don't know.

1679
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:09,420
But lacking that, do we say it's time to retire the utopia and put something new in there?

1680
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:14,140
That's my, yes, I feel that's a lot of real estate there.

1681
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:21,980
We can have something transformative somehow for children, but also high speed rail,

1682
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:24,300
high speed rail simulator that simulates the

1683
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:25,100
Maglev.

1684
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:27,340
Los Angeles to Las Vegas trip that we want.

1685
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:28,300
Yeah, it's a bullet train.

1686
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:29,180
Yeah.

1687
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:29,420
Yeah.

1688
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:32,060
New bullet train attraction.

1689
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:34,140
Alison, anything you want to see go into that land?

1690
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:35,580
If we're, is there a type of ride?

1691
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:37,020
Is there a franchise?

1692
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:38,460
Are they anything with Frozen?

1693
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:39,260
Do you know?

1694
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:40,940
Well, they've talked about it.

1695
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:43,500
They have one in Epcot.

1696
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:47,820
They changed this ride, the Maelstrom around to be frozen, but there's been a,

1697
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:53,420
I've heard rumors and this is now all pushed back, you know, and maybe canceled because of COVID,

1698
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:59,340
but the rumor was they were going to carve out a chunk maybe of the utopia and back where the

1699
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:04,780
subs are and they would make like an Arendelle and a full new Frozen ride.

1700
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:10,140
And then very smartly use the backdrop of the Matterhorn to look like Arendelle.

1701
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:13,820
So when you were in that air, like little mini land, you would kind of feel more

1702
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:17,420
immersed because you'd see the Matterhorn, which thematically blends in.

1703
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:25,820
I think that would be cool because my son is super into Frozen right now.

1704
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:29,980
And I feel like almost all toddlers go through a Frozen stage.

1705
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:32,140
So that would be neat.

1706
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:36,460
I personally, Pete's Dragon is Disney, right?

1707
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:37,580
Yep.

1708
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:42,060
I know that there's not like a real clamoring for Pete's Dragon, but I always love Pete's Dragon.

1709
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:45,740
So if they want to make a Pete's Dragon ride, I could get on board with that.

1710
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,020
That would be very cool.

1711
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:54,700
They seem to be very like synergy focused new stuff, which is a bummer for us who like the old.

1712
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:58,060
But they did a new, we all know new Pete's Dragon.

1713
01:28:58,060 --> 01:28:59,660
Oh, Redford, baby.

1714
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:00,460
Right?

1715
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:01,260
Everybody loves it.

1716
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:04,220
They made a live action Pete's Dragon that we all remember.

1717
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:07,180
So we'll put in an animatronic Robert Redford.

1718
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:07,980
Nobody's happy.

1719
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:13,820
But the only Pete's Dragon stuff in the park is still if they bring back the electrical

1720
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:14,460
parade.

1721
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:15,260
Oh, right.

1722
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:15,980
So that's-

1723
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:17,100
There's the big dragon.

1724
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:17,580
Right.

1725
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:19,420
That's the problem.

1726
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:23,340
Probably for now, the only thing we're getting when it comes to Pete's Dragon.

1727
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:25,740
I think so.

1728
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:26,940
Frozen's a good vote.

1729
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:27,500
I know.

1730
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:32,780
Everything's been pushed back at this point and I don't know if that's coming within five

1731
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:34,140
years or more.

1732
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:35,740
That would be my guess.

1733
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:37,740
Yeah.

1734
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,100
We shall see.

1735
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:39,600
Yeah.

1736
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:40,100
Yeah.

1737
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:41,540
We shall see.

1738
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:46,100
You know, I realize as I look just one more time at my notes that there is a tradition

1739
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:50,580
that there was a part of this ride where everybody got hurt a lot and they called it Blood Alley.

1740
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:51,700
Oh.

1741
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:58,820
To do something bloody and violent would be in the tradition of the utopia.

1742
01:29:58,820 --> 01:29:59,320
Right.

1743
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:01,700
Let's rename it Blood Alley.

1744
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:03,300
Wait, what happened to people in Blood Alley?

1745
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:07,900
I don't have anything about that.

1746
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:09,820
You know, maybe like big car pileups.

1747
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:14,740
You know, like the bumpers used to like, if you look at pictures of the old cars, the

1748
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:17,020
bumpers would be kind of like hooks, right?

1749
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:22,140
And I think that there's some story where one of the hook-like bumpers got caught on

1750
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:26,100
a tree, which caused that car to get stuck and then the car behind it and the car behind

1751
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:30,660
it and the car behind it and then like 20 cars that were all hooked together essentially

1752
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:36,860
and somebody had to go and like shut them off one by one, move them one by one.

1753
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:39,300
Sounds like it was a tough ride to work.

1754
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:44,580
Scott, you are reminding me a thing I wrote down when the Chevron sponsorship was going

1755
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:45,580
on.

1756
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:49,620
The announcement about like, keep your hands and arms inside the vehicle.

1757
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:52,060
And so here's how to make it work.

1758
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:57,380
And the guy, the voice says, I'm dusty beat the utopia car.

1759
01:30:57,380 --> 01:31:01,380
To make us go, push your foot on the gas.

1760
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:07,300
Just hearing the voice say to make us go, I find very unsightly.

1761
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:16,940
So maybe the cars like talk to you or can scream if like they get nudged or something

1762
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:21,100
if we're talking about upping the stakes to make us go.

1763
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:27,620
Don't make me scream, but please don't make us hurt, please.

1764
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:28,620
That's good.

1765
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:29,820
Plus up for sure.

1766
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:32,260
That's fine to me.

1767
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:33,020
Yeah, yeah.

1768
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:39,260
Look, something they got to roll the dice big or else, you know, the public is speaking

1769
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:41,700
and I think there'll be a big outcry after this episode.

1770
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:46,660
Yeah, to either Frozen or New Blood Alley.

1771
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:48,180
New Blood Alley.

1772
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:50,260
Yeah, I think we're I think we're agreed.

1773
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:51,780
I think we've come to a consensus.

1774
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:54,500
Alison Rosen, you survived podcast The Ride.

1775
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,020
Thank you so much for being here.

1776
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:58,020
Thank you for having me.

1777
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:00,140
Absolutely.

1778
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:02,220
Let's let's exit through the gift shop.

1779
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:03,380
Is there anything you'd like to do?

1780
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:04,700
Please listen to my podcast.

1781
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:07,660
Alison Rosen is your new best friend and childish.

1782
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:08,580
Oh, and I have a book out.

1783
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:12,220
It is called Tropical Attire Encouraged and Other Phrases That Scare Me.

1784
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:15,540
Well, hey, fantastic.

1785
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:16,540
Oh, geez.

1786
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:17,940
Cool. Yes.

1787
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:19,420
Check that out. All of all that out.

1788
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:20,340
Thanks for being here.

1789
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:22,860
As for us, you know, we're on the social media.

1790
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:28,580
Is help us with any questions we didn't come up with the answer to during this episode.

1791
01:32:28,740 --> 01:32:33,620
If you can remember what the phone was for us or for Alison, fill in some memory holes.

1792
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:39,300
And besides all that, we got three bonus episodes every month at the second

1793
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:43,100
podcast, the second gate at Patreon.com slash podcast The Ride.

1794
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:47,260
Hey, we never said the name of the the the the bad one.

1795
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:48,300
Oh, that's true.

1796
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:52,140
They call it the the it was called the the middle

1797
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:56,340
of the little person, Utopia, which would be the more correct term.

1798
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:59,740
Yeah, even at the time, we bleep when I said it.

1799
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:01,660
Even at the time, it didn't make much sense.

1800
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:05,180
It was not aesthetically like doesn't roll off the tongue.

1801
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:06,620
Well, it's just for kids.

1802
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:10,460
It was like a weird way to like it was like we're calling kids that

1803
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:13,100
like I just call it the kid.

1804
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:15,260
Utopia. Why use that? Cars were cute.

1805
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:18,020
Cars were cute. It was an off the off the shelf ride, too.

1806
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:20,500
It was not like original Disney design. Mm hmm.

1807
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:26,260
Hmm. And I wrote down that it replaced what was there before.

1808
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:28,540
Which was a bunch of tables and umbrellas.

1809
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:34,620
So I guess even with its bizarre name, it still was an improvement.

1810
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:38,380
Maybe that's that episode.

1811
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:41,340
Maybe that we covered it so that we don't have to put out an episode

1812
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:43,660
with that weird word in the title.

1813
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:45,180
So we we just did it.

1814
01:33:45,180 --> 01:33:47,340
Yeah, well, two for once.

1815
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:49,500
You're welcome, everybody. Hey, great.

1816
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:53,380
Took care of that other different topics coming to the second gate

1817
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:54,260
and to the main feed.

1818
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:56,140
We'll be back for more next week.

1819
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:57,780
Thanks for listening, everybody.

1820
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:59,260
Right. Bye bye.

1821
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:06,300
This has been a forever dog production executive

1822
