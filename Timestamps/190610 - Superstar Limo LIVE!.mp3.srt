1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,020
Warning.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,800
The following live podcast is presented begrudgingly

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,220
by people who would rather be at Oga's Cantina right now.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,200
If you are prone to epileptic seizures,

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,200
do not sit in rows one, three, four, seven, eight,

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,120
nine, or 15.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,560
At some point in the show,

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,480
there will be a massive dump of Shrek 4D surplus water.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,760
The first three rows will get typhoid.

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,920
And now from a theater that's only two blocks away

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,640
from a Chuck E. Cheese, it's Podcast the Ride Live!

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,480
Oh!

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,320
Oh!

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,160
Oh!

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,980
Oh!

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,820
Oh!

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,660
Oh!

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,500
Oh!

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,320
Oh!

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,120
Oh!

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,940
Oh!

24
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,780
Oh!

25
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,620
Oh!

26
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,440
Oh!

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,280
Oh!

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,120
Oh!

29
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,940
Oh!

30
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,780
Oh!

31
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,620
Oh!

32
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,440
Oh!

33
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,280
Oh!

34
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,120
Oh!

35
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,940
Oh!

36
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,780
Oh!

37
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,620
Oh!

38
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,460
Oh!

39
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,280
Oh!

40
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,120
Oh!

41
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,960
Oh!

42
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,800
Oh!

43
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,640
Oh!

44
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,460
Oh!

45
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,300
Oh!

46
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,360
Oh!

47
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,480
Oh my god, hello and welcome to Podcast the Ride,

48
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,160
the podcast about theme parks hosted by three men

49
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,760
who hired nannies tonight to babysit their Rexes.

50
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,400
It's true.

51
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,640
Concerned about the little guy,

52
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,840
so I want him to get droid-napped.

53
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,280
I'm Scott Gardner, hello, hello.

54
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,280
My name is Mike Carlson.

55
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,940
And I'm Jason Sheridan.

56
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,780
Thank you.

57
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,080
Yeah, and I, sure is.

58
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,560
He sure is.

59
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,800
Yeah, starting already.

60
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,080
I wanna say kudos to Jason for working on a holiday.

61
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,920
In case you don't know, today is-

62
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,320
Yeah, I do know.

63
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,880
National Donut Day.

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,240
Yeah, let's hear it.

65
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,080
Usually, Jason just sits in his room.

66
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,600
It's a day of remembrance.

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,200
But today he's made an exception

68
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,320
to come and entertain all of you!

69
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,160
Yes.

70
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,000
Thank you.

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,840
Thank you.

72
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah, so it's our 100th episode, really.

73
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,840
Yeah.

74
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,680
We're at it!

75
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,200
It's in progress right now.

76
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,240
We can't think of a better way

77
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,440
than to spend it with all of you.

78
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,080
We really appreciate you coming out.

79
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,160
Yes, thank you so much.

80
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,360
How many people have listened to all 100?

81
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,160
Wow.

82
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,000
Pretty good.

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,720
Geez, that's something.

84
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,120
All right, well then, you know,

85
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,800
this is gonna be a big treat for everybody.

86
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,240
But I realized, like, the 100th episode,

87
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,800
that's sort of a big deal.

88
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,480
That's an auspicious occasion.

89
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,800
And we can't just come out here like normal

90
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,120
and say, welcome to Funcast, all right,

91
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,920
we gotta do something bigger.

92
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,800
And I started thinking,

93
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,760
who is the world's greatest welcomer?

94
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,480
Who is the person who is the best anywhere

95
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,480
at welcoming people to things?

96
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,800
And with that in mind, I created a little video

97
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,480
that we're debuting tonight.

98
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,520
Turn your eyes to the screen

99
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,280
for the world's greatest welcomer.

100
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,640
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,

101
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,820
hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,

102
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,640
hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,

103
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,520
hello, gosh, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

104
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,

105
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,980
hello, hello again.

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,640
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,

107
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,640
hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,

108
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,480
hello, hello, hello, hi.

109
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,600
If you're looking for me, I'm right over here.

110
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,200
No, no, no, over here.

111
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,440
I'm in the computer, here on the desk.

112
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,720
Hello.

113
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,160
You did it, boys!

114
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,320
The show was.

115
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,800
Second, wait a second.

116
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,240
Take him away, take him away.

117
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,720
Okay, so, that's not part of the welcome.

118
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,080
Now you've officially been welcomed to the show.

119
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,520
Now we can all officially say hello.

120
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,000
Hello.

121
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,280
Hello.

122
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,480
One of those, he was drawn into a

123
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,920
Little Orphan Annie comic strip.

124
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,920
Yes, by the way, for the 20s, he was on a raft?

125
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,120
There's so much going on.

126
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,200
Being drawn into a Little Orphan Annie comic strip.

127
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,360
Your dream. My dream.

128
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
We can only hope.

129
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,360
We shouldn't just go too Jason hard right now,

130
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
but you did, we had a whole plan of how we were gonna start

131
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,360
this thing, and then we got a text that you got yourself

132
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,360
into a hot dog mess.

133
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
Yeah.

134
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
Well.

135
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Plans are off.

136
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Changing everything.

137
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Scott said, save it for the pod.

138
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
The phrase was hot dog hijinks.

139
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Sorry.

140
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
I shouldn't rewrite you, I'm sorry.

141
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,360
I went to eat dinner at the Fonda next door,

142
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
and I was like, I'm gonna go to the gym.

143
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
I went to eat dinner at the Fonda next door after tech.

144
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
It's very nice.

145
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,360
Wonderful mariachi bar.

146
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,360
There is a giant sign out front that says $10,

147
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,360
like two tacos or a plate of wings, $10,

148
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
an entree and a beer.

149
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
And one of the things was a Dodger dog.

150
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,360
And I was like, oh, I'm a hot dog and a beer.

151
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
That sounds lovely.

152
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,360
And I go in and that same sign is inside,

153
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,360
and it is on the bar top, on the bar,

154
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,360
and I sit there for about 20 minutes

155
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
before anyone comes behind the bar.

156
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
And when he does, I go, oh, I just want this hot dog

157
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
and a beer thing.

158
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,360
And he goes, we don't do that anymore.

159
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,360
And he took it down.

160
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,360
And so.

161
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
And I did try.

162
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,360
I was like, well, oh, it's on the sign outside.

163
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
And he's like, this is the happy hour menu.

164
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
And it's just the regular menu.

165
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,360
It's like, OK, well, that answers that.

166
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
No hot dogs.

167
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,360
No hot dogs for me.

168
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
It was outside the restaurant, too.

169
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
Like a banner.

170
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
It was heavily featured.

171
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
Yes.

172
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Well, I think these hijinks cannot be blamed on you for once.

173
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,360
For once.

174
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Did you leave like a Yelp review or something?

175
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Not yet.

176
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
We'll see.

177
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
He's been known to do that.

178
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
That's not a joke.

179
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
Oh.

180
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
They're long.

181
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
He writes very long ones.

182
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
That was like eight years ago.

183
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,360
And you're still just digging in.

184
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
Mike's brain does not let go.

185
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
If you haven't learned that, put it out.

186
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
I have not forgotten a fact about you in a decade.

187
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,360
You told me that as a child, you caught pond eels in a pond.

188
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,360
Yeah.

189
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
What is that?

190
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
What are you thinking?

191
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,360
It's eels that live in a pond.

192
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
Like it's not a big.

193
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Fair enough.

194
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
You know?

195
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
All right.

196
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
He answered the question.

197
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
What do you want?

198
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
Yeah.

199
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Yeah, he answered the question.

200
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
But look, we're not just here to talk about pond eels.

201
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
No.

202
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
We're here.

203
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,360
And we can do this show.

204
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,360
You know, when we did the live show with Tony Baxter at the That's From Disneyland exhibit.

205
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
Thank you.

206
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,360
You know, we were kind of on our best behavior because there was an imaginary legend there.

207
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
And also Scott's parents were there.

208
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Mom and Dad.

209
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
And we are very good boys.

210
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
We are good boys.

211
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
No curses.

212
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,360
But no parents are here tonight.

213
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Yeah.

214
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
Yeah.

215
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,360
So we can do whatever we want that would upset BB Boomer parents.

216
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
It's time to renounce God.

217
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,360
Bring out the golden calf.

218
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
We worship a new faith now.

219
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
You know what?

220
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Oh, sorry.

221
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
Go ahead.

222
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,360
I was just going to say, when I'm at home sometimes I will say like, hell, Satan.

223
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
And my mom gets mad.

224
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
Like very mad.

225
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Not like kind of mad.

226
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,360
Very mad.

227
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,360
Not when you're at your apartment now.

228
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
She doesn't like sense that you did it.

229
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
She knows.

230
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
No, she knows.

231
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
She knows.

232
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,360
Yeah.

233
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Could be the case.

234
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Well, what we are doing tonight may be considered an abomination against God.

235
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
And it's own right.

236
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,360
We had a big goal tonight, which was to just say, podcast the ride live and see if people

237
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,360
came without us saying what the hell we were doing.

238
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
And you all came and we really appreciate it.

239
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
Yeah.

240
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
Thank you.

241
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,360
So really, we don't owe you anything.

242
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
It's true.

243
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
Yeah.

244
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
You're seeing us.

245
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
You're sitting in chairs in a theater.

246
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,360
We fulfilled our obligations.

247
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,360
The biggest prank of all.

248
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Goodbye.

249
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
That was the idea.

250
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,360
But we do, okay, we do have a topic.

251
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,360
We thought of something to do.

252
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Uh-huh.

253
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,360
And it's something we've been looking forward to doing for a very long time.

254
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,360
And if I could consult my notes really fast, because to tell you what we're doing tonight,

255
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,360
we have to go all the way back to February 8th, 2001.

256
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,360
The opening of Disney's California Adventure.

257
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Disneyland's second gate was unveiled to the worst reviews and poorest word of mouth

258
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
that the company had ever received.

259
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,360
And most of the ire was reserved for one particular attraction.

260
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Yeah.

261
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,360
This is, including us, a room of insane people.

262
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Get ready.

263
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Get ready, seasons of the vine.

264
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,360
You're in our, you're in the fucking scope.

265
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
No.

266
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
Fucking hate shot.

267
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
Nazis.

268
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Jeremy Irons taking him down a peg.

269
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
No.

270
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,360
My precious Mondavi wine movie.

271
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
Don't say anything.

272
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
No.

273
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
You're in the fucking scope.

274
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
No.

275
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Fucking hate shot.

276
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Nazis.

277
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,360
Jeremy Irons taking him down a peg.

278
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
No.

279
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
My precious Mondavi wine movie.

280
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Don't say anything.

281
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
So Jason.

282
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,360
The early 2000s were a great time for Robert Mondavi.

283
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
Bankruptcy.

284
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
You know, California Park.

285
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,360
He went bankrupt in the early 2000s.

286
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Oh, okay.

287
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
Well, that's an episode.

288
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
That's a second gate.

289
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,360
Coming up, we're going to shit on Mondavi hard.

290
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,360
But for now, we're going to shit on something else.

291
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,360
A ride so hated that it became the first ride ever to close at Disney's California Adventure.

292
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:53,360
Theme park tourists called this attraction unfunny, instantly dated, and creatively starved.

293
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,360
We at Podcast Ride call it the perfect topic.

294
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Ladies and gentlemen, the name of the ride, let's all say it together.

295
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
Superstar limo.

296
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,360
Oh shit.

297
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
Yeah.

298
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
We're doing it.

299
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,360
It's been dead for so long, but tonight and tonight only we are bringing it back to life here at Dynasty Typewriter.

300
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,360
We're all going to go on the ride together.

301
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,360
So with that being said, guys, let's bring out the limo.

302
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:50,360
Oh, boy.

303
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Yay.

304
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Are we?

305
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Are we?

306
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Right there on the license plate.

307
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,360
Hey, thanks to Aaron Gardner for building this little thing for us.

308
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
Hey, wow.

309
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Oh, geez.

310
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,360
Aaron, Aaron who makes, has designed all the shirts.

311
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
Oh, yeah.

312
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
The little girl.

313
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
The Potanica shirt.

314
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Yeah, yeah.

315
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
A round of applause for Aaron.

316
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:18,360
Now her finest work, a bunch of sparkly stars taped onto garbage, which is now that, which is literally what this is.

317
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,360
And yet this is not dissimilar from the actual ride vehicles of Superstar Limo.

318
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Should the limo be more straight?

319
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Oh, wait.

320
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Well, you should swing out the, that side.

321
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Show the wheels, fellas.

322
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
There we go.

323
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Yeah, there's wheels.

324
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,360
Am I upside down?

325
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360
No.

326
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
No, you're right on.

327
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
I'm good, right?

328
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,360
I was, I was thinking also, oh wait, you got the steering wheel.

329
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
Oh yeah, the steering wheel.

330
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,360
Hey, Mike's going to be our guide.

331
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
He's going to take it for a spin.

332
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
Hey, give us a steer.

333
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,360
I was thinking also with this configuration, I guess Mike would be the pilot.

334
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
I'm the gunner.

335
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
The pilot of the, yeah.

336
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
And Jason is unfortunately the engineer.

337
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,360
The most stressful position on Millennial Falcon Smugglers.

338
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,360
Anton Podcasts are it.

339
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Superstar Limo, you read one review of it.

340
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,360
Denver's Rocky Mountain News called this attraction whelming.

341
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,360
They called it whelming and then clarified in the next sentence, that is worse than under whelming.

342
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
A layer below hell.

343
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360
Oh my God.

344
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:39,360
So, I mean, okay, this attraction, it's kind of emblematic of everything that was wrong with California Adventure when it opened.

345
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:48,360
If anybody else like me grew up around Disneyland and went all the time as a kid, you remember what a bummer era this was.

346
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Because we're still, the rocket rods are still fresh in our memory.

347
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Light magic.

348
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,360
If anybody witnessed the fiasco that was light magic.

349
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,360
It was all like, it was kind of like the Randy Quaid Anthony Michael Hall season of SNL.

350
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,360
But it went on way longer, it was way more expensive.

351
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
It was a bummer of a time.

352
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,360
It really all culminated in this.

353
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
And you went on this.

354
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
No, no, no, I didn't go.

355
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:20,360
I didn't go to, I felt so betrayed by the negative reviews that California Adventure was getting that I didn't step foot in the place until they added some better stuff.

356
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Jason, you also did not go on this.

357
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
I did not, no.

358
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,360
The first time I went to California Adventure was like 2006, so it was already Monsters Inc.

359
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
I didn't go on it either.

360
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
Mm-hmm.

361
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,360
Yeah.

362
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
All right.

363
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,360
Well, we're all talking to be fact-finding mission together then.

364
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,360
But if I had to guess, I would guess that it sucked.

365
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,360
Just call me crazy.

366
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,360
That's my hypothesis.

367
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:54,360
I mean, one of the big bummers about it is that the betrayal of Westcott's not happening in general.

368
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:04,360
We were promised this crazy, beautiful park, and instead we got the world's biggest mural and that big orange and wine movie.

369
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,360
I mean, there was a letdown to all of it.

370
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:17,360
And then this in and of itself, even the bad idea of, we should say, a ride where you get in a limousine and it takes you around a kooky version of Hollywood.

371
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,360
There was even apparently supposedly a better version of this that did not come to pass.

372
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,360
Yeah, you were supposed to go into a recreation of the theme building.

373
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:32,360
That's the building in the center of LAX that's kind of like, you know, very neatly designed.

374
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:39,360
Had a restaurant in it called Encounters, which was former Imagineer Eddie Soto worked on in the 90s.

375
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
So there was a Disney connection to it.

376
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
Sure. Yeah.

377
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,360
But then the money had to get scaled back.

378
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,360
And they ended up with, do you have a picture of the facade?

379
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,360
Do we end up with one of those?

380
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,360
I don't know that we do.

381
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
Maybe we didn't.

382
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Well, the logo tells you something.

383
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,360
With a beautiful, with a tribute to the 110 freeway.

384
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:09,360
Seeing that fade homage to in a theme park and the idea of traffic.

385
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Great to remind people of.

386
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,360
Is there an uglier sign in theme parks?

387
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,360
You mean, you're, you know, you're maybe competing with your, what were the, what was the sunglass?

388
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,360
What was like, there was like a dinosaur with sunglasses.

389
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
That was great.

390
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
That was great.

391
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
Yeah.

392
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
The dinosaur with the sunglasses.

393
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Oh no.

394
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
I'm going to get, I'm going to get shouted down on this.

395
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,360
I don't recall.

396
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,360
I look, I have a vague sense of me not liking the typography, but I'd have to have it in front of me to know.

397
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
All right.

398
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
We'll figure it out.

399
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,360
Again, there'll be an episode about it.

400
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,360
We're going to stumble on 12 or so ideas, I'm sure.

401
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
While we go.

402
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Of course, this was originally supposed to be a fast paced thrill ride where you avoided the paparazzi.

403
00:16:52,360 --> 00:17:00,360
Unfortunately, then the paparazzi killed Princess Diana and her lover, Dodi Afayed.

404
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:07,360
Everyone always forgets Dodi, but don't forget Dodi.

405
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
Thanks, Jason.

406
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
Yes.

407
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
Giving him a live.

408
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
Yeah.

409
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,360
So they, Disney very quickly were like, well, we cannot be trying to outrun the paparazzi in this ride.

410
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,360
That is the most ghoulish thing imaginable.

411
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,360
But that's where I start to wonder what's up.

412
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,360
Because so the solution then is not to do a different ride.

413
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,360
It's to do this ride, but slow and bad.

414
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
Yes.

415
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:39,360
Was there no other, nothing but the paparazzi could have been the villain of this?

416
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:47,360
Well, they talked about trying to clone Tower of Tower Rock and Roller Coaster, but those cost money that they did not have.

417
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,360
We also almost got the Rock and Roller Coaster version with No Doubt.

418
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,360
They were going to pay homage to the Orange County music scene, you know?

419
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Of which I'm told No Doubt is part.

420
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
I'm very cool.

421
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,360
I know a lot about music.

422
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,360
Were you guys reading the same Jim Hill article that I was?

423
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
Oh, my friend.

424
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
I was reading that long ago.

425
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
You read it when it first came out.

426
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,360
I did.

427
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,360
A Jim Hill original, yes.

428
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,360
So yeah, I have all the stuff of what supposedly was in the ride.

429
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
Oh, yeah, yeah.

430
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,360
Even though, I mean, we will show you if you don't already know some of the things that were in this ride.

431
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,360
But in the Jim Hill article and multiple theme park articles are like, oh, but what could have been?

432
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,360
And you read what could have been and you're like, I don't think that should have been either.

433
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,360
Yeah.

434
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,360
There's one thing I like and then the rest of it when they're describing it is like this was going to be better.

435
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
I don't know.

436
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Well, do you say what you don't like?

437
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:57,360
Well, the stuff I like is that as you boarded your limousine, Disney CEO Michael Eisner would appear on the ride vehicle video screen and reminded you that you still hadn't signed the contract for your next picture.

438
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,360
Finally, the Michael Eisner ride.

439
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,360
There would have been a goddamn Michael Eisner ride, which is what we want.

440
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,360
There's many episodes where I've like pined for like a hundred and fifty dollar figure of Michael Eisner.

441
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:19,360
And maybe if this existed, that would have been a piece of merch because he was an in park character.

442
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
Definitely would have been.

443
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,360
Would he also have like spun around and played songs through Bluetooth?

444
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,360
I think he would have he would have been deactivated.

445
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,360
But then at D23 two years ago, they would have been like, we've got a big announcement for Star Wars land.

446
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:43,360
DJing in the Cantina, the robot of Michael Eisner.

447
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,360
Hello, hello, hello.

448
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,360
Hello, hello, hello.

449
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,360
I'm the CEO of Cool Jams.

450
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,360
So, yeah, so that that was part of it.

451
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,360
And that's the best part in this gym.

452
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,360
Jim Hale. Jim seems to think Jim seems to think a lot of this stuff is like very good, but I disagree.

453
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,360
We come from different places, I think, in general.

454
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,360
But did you read about the typical gag?

455
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
I sure did. But please, do you want me to read this?

456
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,360
Steer us to the great, the best gag that never was.

457
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,360
OK, a typical a typical gag would have been and these are not my words.

458
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,360
So I apologize. This is 2019. I would not use this terminology.

459
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,360
A typical gag. What are you about to say?

460
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,360
You'll see. I'm not going to do anything crazy.

461
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,360
A typical gag would have been as you roared up on tail.

462
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,360
Oh, the pup, that famous Los Angeles area hot dog stand that shaped like what else?

463
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
A giant hot dog.

464
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,360
You would have seen the back of this grotesquely fat man dressed in a white rhinestone studded jumpsuit.

465
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,360
At the same time, you hear the unmistakable sound of flatulence.

466
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,360
As your limo took the corner, you'd see that the man in rhinestone jumpsuit was actually Elvis Presley.

467
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:09,360
As for the source of that breaking wind sound, you'd eventually see that the noise comes from the squeeze bottle of mustard that Elvis held in his hand.

468
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,360
The king would give the bottle a few more squeezes, making even more whoopee cushion noises.

469
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,360
As he squirted mustard out on his hot dog, Presley would say,

470
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:24,360
Thank you very much as our limo roared off into the darkness, the paparazzi again in hot pursuit.

471
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
Yeah, so that sucks.

472
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,360
Like that was the good one. That was like, you know, this is what you missed out on, folks.

473
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,360
Yeah, that's like Jim Hill's Westcott.

474
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,360
Oh, what could have been?

475
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:55,360
I don't. Yeah, he makes quick mention of another thing where you see an ad or something or that the three tenors, the three tenors are playing somewhere and then they turn around and it's one.

476
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,360
He also says, but here it's a one fat guy with three heads.

477
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:06,360
What? In LA? Where the tenors famously reside.

478
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:12,360
That's what we're dealing with. And also, well, the the little the little slam.

479
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,360
Did you guys come up? Yeah, yeah. Michael Eisner supposedly like. Yeah, yeah.

480
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,360
That you would come up on Dream Jerks Studio.

481
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,360
Eat shit, Katzenberg. Eat it.

482
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,360
The average tourist is like, what a burn on Jeffrey Katzenberg.

483
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:39,360
About time alternate versions Warner Bastards.

484
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,360
20th century fucks.

485
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,360
That's pretty good.

486
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,360
Can I try one?

487
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,360
Yeah, I bet it. United Fartists.

488
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,360
Hell, yes.

489
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,360
I think you understand the superstar limbo.

490
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,360
I think I got it. Submit your spec.

491
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
I think I'll hire you. The Mary Pickford account.

492
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,360
Very upset by that joke.

493
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,360
So people were going to build this ride.

494
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,360
That's that was the plan for a while.

495
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,360
People are excited about that.

496
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,360
Oh, and by the by the way, then at the end, Michael Eisner reappears.

497
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,360
And it's something like, well, you know,

498
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,360
you got caught by the paparazzi too many times, you know,

499
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,360
can't have somebody involved in scandals representing the Disney company.

500
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,360
So you would have been you in the limo would have been the first James Gunn.

501
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
Well, that was one of the blues guys.

502
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,360
You're on your way to one of those parties that he got in so much trouble for.

503
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,360
So he tells you like better luck next time, kid.

504
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,360
So you don't you lose the ride.

505
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,360
It's a less exciting Radiator Springs where you always lose

506
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
instead of a big mater.

507
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,360
It's Michael Eisner on a TV.

508
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,360
It's just like the Millennium Falcon ride.

509
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
You always lose.

510
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,360
Every time we got off it, it was like things were broken on the walls.

511
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,360
Yeah, we only lost and lost less.

512
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,360
Yes, we lost.

513
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,360
So people this is we're going to do this.

514
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,360
This is great.

515
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,360
Then the then the death of Princess Diana.

516
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
We got to change course.

517
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,360
Other rides too expensive.

518
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,360
So we got to go full speed ahead with this.

519
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,360
So they have to read they have to reconfigure what this ride is going to be.

520
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,360
And it ends up being something that's a little more complicated.

521
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:48,360
It's a little more about about puns and the so the thing does get built.

522
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
And right.

523
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,360
You know, there's a little sample of it right before you get onto the ride.

524
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,360
The cast member says, how many in your entourage?

525
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,360
Yes, correct.

526
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,360
They should have gotten an audience and said that.

527
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,360
And then they're like, well, we're going to do this.

528
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,360
And then they're like, well, we're going to do this.

529
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,360
They should have gotten an audience and said that and heard them groan.

530
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,360
I have changed some minds.

531
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,360
The voice over in the queue said the white curbs are for loading and unloading.

532
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,360
No schmoozing.

533
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:37,360
Yeah, this is all this is Hollywood as inspired by like one of those maps you could buy in the 90s where everything was drawn in like bad, mad, mad ripoff style, not mad TV style.

534
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
What are you saying?

535
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,360
Like bad, mad magazine style, like those souvenir maps that were like cartoony.

536
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,360
Do you mean the ones you would fold in?

537
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
Yeah, kind of.

538
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:58,360
No, like like when you would go to a theme park, they would like sell maps to or like you go to cities that had like, look, the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty.

539
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,360
It was kind of like cartoony and you could hang it up on the wall.

540
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,360
And I'm the only one who bought one of these pieces of garbage.

541
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,360
Does anyone know what he's talking about?

542
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,360
Thank you.

543
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,360
Like, novelty maps that were like posters.

544
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,360
So there would be like jokes on them or something?

545
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
Kind of, yeah.

546
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Not even jokes?

547
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
Not even jokes, really.

548
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,360
Very much like this ride.

549
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:32,360
But what the ride lacks in comedy that works, it makes up for in, well, terror.

550
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,360
It's almost scarier than the Haunted Mansion.

551
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,360
Wait, first of all, well, let me say one thing first.

552
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:44,360
The exterior, okay, so they like, they were going to build the LAX theme building, that big cool pod.

553
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,360
But instead they do something different.

554
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,360
They build a recreation of Union Station.

555
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:55,360
And so you go into Union Station and you walk in and then you are inside, you're seeing baggage carousels and you're inside LAX.

556
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,360
What?

557
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,360
It's the train station and then you're in LAX.

558
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Already, like, something's wonky.

559
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,360
And then you wind through these like, just like depressing TSA kind of corridors.

560
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,360
So this is, okay, this is a real picture of the queue on this ride.

561
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,360
And look how...

562
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,360
This is like Ellis Island or something.

563
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,360
Yeah.

564
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,360
What was that?

565
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
The limo's in the way of the screen.

566
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Oh, sure.

567
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,360
The limo's in the...

568
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
Well, you're missing out.

569
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,360
Is that better?

570
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,360
Which one?

571
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,360
Just imagine the hallway where you've been the saddest.

572
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,360
That's what it looks like.

573
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,360
I am using the limo for warmth now as I am directly under the air conditioner.

574
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,360
And I've been slowly putting my sleeves down as we start the show.

575
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Oh, yeah.

576
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
Yeah.

577
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,360
Deflect it.

578
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
Yes.

579
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,360
Turn on the heat.

580
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,360
So, okay, so then you get on the ride itself.

581
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,360
And the very first thing you do on the ride is go into a dark tunnel.

582
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,360
You know, not at all like the one Princess Diana died in.

583
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,360
Like, still a limo in a dark tunnel.

584
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,360
But then there's a little flash of light.

585
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,360
And you meet one of the most unique characters in Theme Park.

586
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,360
You know that we love our original characters that are only found in the theme parks.

587
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,360
But I don't know that we describe the word love to Swiftie LaRue.

588
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,360
We have a little taste of Swiftie here and just to experience him for yourself.

589
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,360
Welcome to Hollywood.

590
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,360
Look at sensation as always.

591
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,360
Listen, I'll have your contract for you at the premiere, okay?

592
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,360
Just get to the Chinese Theater pronto.

593
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,360
You hear me?

594
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,360
Everybody's waiting to be.

595
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,360
Now don't be late, babe.

596
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,360
Don't worry.

597
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
We'll get you there in time.

598
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,360
So that's Swiftie LaRue.

599
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,360
Did anyone when they when that played accidentally at the start, did anyone go, oh, shit, it's Swiftie LaRue.

600
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Good on you.

601
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
You know what's up.

602
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,360
I'm a little free spoiler.

603
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,360
And you're and you love Swiftie.

604
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,360
Who doesn't love Swiftie?

605
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,360
You're my favorite audience members.

606
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,360
The ones who love Swiftie.

607
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:28,360
What do you guys think Swiftie had to do to climb the ladder to get to this Hollywood agent position?

608
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,360
I feel like you have an idea in your head.

609
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:49,360
I have just been think I've been trying to figure out like I feel like he started at the mail room at one of the big agencies and then he covered up like an embarrassing like it's like he flushed the drugs or like he covered up someone like almost swallowing their tongue or something.

610
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,360
That honestly not so bad.

611
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Like there's worse things people could cover up.

612
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
So he got off in light if that's it.

613
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,360
Oh, OK.

614
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,360
He killed Jim Belushi.

615
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,360
Jim Belushi.

616
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,360
Jim Belushi.

617
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:12,360
Oh, oh, somebody check on Jim Belushi.

618
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,360
I have an alibi.

619
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,360
I was on stage.

620
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,360
He's got a plastic knife in his throat.

621
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:28,360
Jason and Swiftie LaRue orchestrated Jim Belushi's murder.

622
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:37,360
You lure him to a trap with a trail of harmonicas to a large box with a stick holding it up.

623
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,360
What if the guest was Jim Belushi and he was going to play some harmonica for you?

624
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,360
That would be awesome actually.

625
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,360
We're going to hand it over to a good buddy of ours.

626
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,360
Do something a little different tonight.

627
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,360
A little less theme park stuff.

628
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,360
I think you're going to enjoy it.

629
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,360
He wants to talk to you about muddy waters.

630
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,360
Although, here's the theme park connection.

631
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,360
The Buena Park Portillo's.

632
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,360
There's a picture of Jim Belushi in there.

633
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,360
And there's a picture of Jim Belushi in every Portillo's nationwide.

634
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,360
Not a joke.

635
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,360
I grew up with that photo in Chambrig, Illinois.

636
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,360
In your home, right?

637
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,360
Yeah, I had a copy made.

638
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,360
When you said Hail Satan, you were referring to Jim Belushi.

639
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,360
Yeah, yeah.

640
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,360
So, Swiftie LaRue.

641
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:36,360
I'm just glad that now it's 2019 and we know that Swiftie LaRue has finally been brought to justice.

642
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:44,360
His brother Bob LaRue took over the LaRue Company who knew nothing.

643
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,360
That's the basis for him, right?

644
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,360
You'd have to think.

645
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,360
Harvey Weinstein has to be the basis for him.

646
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Surely there was no one else in Hollywood who was like that besides him.

647
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
He was the only one.

648
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,360
So, that's my assumption.

649
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:07,360
Creepy, hairy-chested cigar-chomper who says Capiche and Babe and why?

650
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,360
Was there ever this Hollywood?

651
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,360
Did Michael Eisner come up in this Hollywood?

652
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,360
Did he get phones thrown at him as a mailroom guy?

653
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,360
And he's fond of the word Capiche and some bizarro...

654
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:26,360
I feel like it only exists in Wag the Dog or The Player or something like that.

655
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,360
These movies.

656
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
Showbiz movies.

657
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,360
Yeah.

658
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,360
One director was told Capiche once and he never forgot it.

659
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,360
It's like growing up on the East Coast.

660
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:43,360
Anytime you watch something set in LA, you're like, God, I guess everyone's eating at Spago and Chin Chin all the time.

661
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,360
That's the only restaurant.

662
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:54,360
Well, speaking of LA stuff.

663
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,360
Let's play the character of this ride.

664
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,360
Swiftie told us that he's got a contract for us if we can get to the Chinese theater.

665
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
So, we all got to get to the Chinese theater.

666
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,360
And Mike, you're the navigator.

667
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,360
So, how are we going to do it?

668
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,360
How are we going to do it?

669
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,360
Because if we're taking the actual route of the ride, if we're going to...

670
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,360
Because they represent...

671
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,360
It's a little like cartoon representations of different parts of LA.

672
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,360
You LA natives will appreciate all that.

673
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,360
All the inside references.

674
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,360
So, here's the path that you're to the most.

675
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,360
What's the clearest way from LAX to the Chinese theater?

676
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:37,360
Well, it would probably be from LAX to Rodeo Drive to the Sunset Strip to Bel Air to Malibu to Muscle Beach.

677
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,360
And then to the Chinese theater.

678
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:51,360
You're not going to be able to see this listening at home, but I did the liberty of throwing this into a Google map.

679
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
Yeah, let me just bring that up right here.

680
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,360
Oh, sure.

681
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,360
There you are.

682
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,360
Everybody can see it.

683
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,360
Three hours and nine minutes.

684
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,360
Well, that's if you're...

685
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,360
Covers 86.8 miles.

686
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:10,360
It's 86.8 miles, but that's if you're in a car like you and me.

687
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,360
But remember, this isn't your Princess Diana death mobile.

688
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,360
This is a slow moving limousine.

689
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,360
So let's say, let's be generous and say 10 miles per hour.

690
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:24,360
Then probably you're getting to your premiere in like eight hours, 40 minutes.

691
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,360
So you're welcome for doing the math, superstar limo.

692
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,360
I'm spending my time well.

693
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,360
So say, so Mike, take us off.

694
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,360
Let's go.

695
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,360
Okay, so here let me get the wheel.

696
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,360
Yeah.

697
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
Here we go.

698
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,360
Whoa.

699
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
We're driving.

700
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,360
I'm going to buckle in.

701
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,360
Oh, no.

702
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:49,360
Before we started, of course, we were watching a TV show hosted by Joan Rivers.

703
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,360
Oh, yeah.

704
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:57,360
Hey, Swiftie's not the only terrifying puppet in town.

705
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,360
I never touched puppet Joan.

706
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,360
So yeah, so before that, she gave like a gossip report about Brad Pitt.

707
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
Oh, I don't know.

708
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,360
I don't remember what Joan does.

709
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,360
Oh, well, she's just, she's in the queue.

710
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,360
And she is just like, oh my God, Brad Pitt.

711
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,360
And who is he?

712
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,360
Was he with Aniston at the time?

713
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,360
Aniston maybe.

714
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,360
Jennifer Aniston.

715
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,360
And there's just some bullshit.

716
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:33,360
And like, it's like, it's like one of the old E shows she did, except, you know, she looks way terrifying.

717
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,360
Sure.

718
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,360
Oh, the queue also reminds you don't wear white after Labor Day.

719
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,360
Like some mismanner's ass bullshit.

720
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,360
Yeah.

721
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,360
Never understood that.

722
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,360
It's always after Labor Day.

723
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,360
It's after a Labor Day at all times.

724
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,360
Yeah.

725
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,360
Don't get it.

726
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,360
Yes.

727
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,360
But so, well, so the thing is why Eisner no longer wanted to appear in the ride.

728
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,360
A, he was probably starting to think maybe this is not a good idea and I don't want to be on this ride anymore.

729
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,360
But also the ride's getting more cartoony, right?

730
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
You got, we got it.

731
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,360
Well, it should be like a cartoon agent guy.

732
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,360
And that's where you get Swifty from.

733
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,360
A live action Michael Eisner is not going to fit.

734
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:18,360
And as they're putting this thing together, they realize that puns alone are not going to make this ride a success.

735
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,360
And they need to introduce some of Hollywood's most gettable stars.

736
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,360
Stars under contract to ABC.

737
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,360
Yes.

738
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,360
Who's got a development deal?

739
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,360
So let's start meeting some stars.

740
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,360
First of all, hey, you know him, you love him.

741
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
You know his name.

742
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,360
My final answer.

743
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
Yeah.

744
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
Regis.

745
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,360
Regis Philbin.

746
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,360
I know.

747
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,360
How's that? Can we see that in general?

748
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,360
Is it still hard up here, over here?

749
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,360
I'm sorry.

750
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,360
Well again, well we have to describe it for the people at home anyway.

751
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:05,360
Regis is wearing a berth, like a ribbon, like a packing present ribbon on his jacket.

752
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:11,360
And he's, he's in a building where the doorknob is a big gem.

753
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,360
And he's flapping money around.

754
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,360
And that's the beginning of the ride.

755
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,360
We're kicking off with this.

756
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:28,360
Keep in mind that there is now, as of the last few weeks, a ride where a very real Hondo Wanaka does movements as real as any of us are doing.

757
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,360
And 20 years ago it was this.

758
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:35,360
And 20 years ago they just decided to do stuff a Jerry Mahoney doll.

759
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,360
The ventriloquist puppet and then wiggle his head around.

760
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,360
It is so scary.

761
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,360
I had to just do this.

762
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:48,360
Let's just zoom in a couple times.

763
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:53,360
Alright, here he comes closer.

764
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,360
Watch out one more time.

765
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,360
Ah!

766
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:05,360
Look at his lifeless dead eyes.

767
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,360
This is scarier than Snow White's scary adventure.

768
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,360
Holy shit.

769
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:18,360
Was the flower in his lapel supposed to be a poppy like remembering those who died in the fields of Flanders?

770
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,360
What?

771
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,360
It looked like a poppy.

772
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,360
What are you talking, what is that reference?

773
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,360
Like a poppy, like around Armistice Day.

774
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,360
In England people wear poppies to remember the war dead.

775
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,360
Scott, do you know stuff about Armistice Day?

776
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,360
Certainly not.

777
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,360
It's still Veterans Day here.

778
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,360
Okay, so Armistice Day is Veterans Day.

779
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,360
In Europe they're commemorating World War I.

780
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,360
Much more gruesome for them, much more dead.

781
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,360
I am not trying to make fun of you, you are smarter than me.

782
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,360
This is a thing people should know about, this is real information.

783
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,360
Yeah, people wear poppies, like yeah.

784
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,360
And British politicians get in trouble if they don't have a big enough poppy or something.

785
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,360
I'm saying Regis's flower looked like a poppy.

786
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,360
Well, let's take a look.

787
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,360
Like a blue poppy, but a ploppy nonetheless.

788
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,360
It's like a bow.

789
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,360
It's a ribbon.

790
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,360
It looks like a gouache ball.

791
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,360
That would have been, I mean this is a real late 90s, early 2000s,

792
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:24,360
like the only thing missing is the pets.com dog,

793
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,360
and like a Borders books, like if they went through a Borders books.

794
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,360
So, that probably...

795
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,360
Why there's Rob Thomas.

796
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,360
If they owned Borders, that would probably have happened.

797
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,360
Alright, so...

798
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,360
Back in the car, back in the car.

799
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,360
Nightmare Regis, out of the way, in the rear view mirror.

800
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,360
Oh, we got my favorites maybe coming up.

801
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,360
Yeah.

802
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,360
So vivacious.

803
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,360
Should we not say and see if people know?

804
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,360
Oh, that's a good way to put it.

805
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,360
Because the first time I saw this, I had no idea.

806
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,360
So, here they are.

807
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,360
If you know the answer, don't say anything.

808
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,360
But how many people know who these celebrities are?

809
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,360
Okay.

810
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,360
That's like 15%, I feel like.

811
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,360
And they're a couple in real life.

812
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,360
That's a hint in 2001.

813
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,360
Anybody want to take a wild guess?

814
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,360
Tony and Van Der Aerts.

815
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,360
Melanie's crew.

816
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,360
Very good, very good.

817
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,360
My first guess, Robert Wagner and Vanna White.

818
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,360
That does not look like Antonio Banderas.

819
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,360
And you're also confused, because who likes...

820
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,360
What celebrities famously love milkshakes?

821
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,360
Who are always seen with big frosty milkshakes.

822
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:53,360
I also, I have a theory, which is that this mold for Antonio Banderas

823
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,360
was later repurposed to make Alec Baldwin in Team America.

824
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,360
They just like puffed the jowls with an air cannon.

825
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,360
And that was the end of that.

826
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:10,360
Yeah, Team America looks better, honestly, than these weird puppet robots.

827
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,360
Maybe they said to make it look a little bad.

828
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,360
Yeah, yeah.

829
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,360
The next one's not much better.

830
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,360
No, there's another good guessing game, and don't say it if you know already.

831
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,360
But maybe even more, like, ooh, the hell.

832
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,360
Let's take a look.

833
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,360
I'm getting there.

834
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,360
Mmm.

835
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,360
Throw out a guess.

836
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,360
Human woman.

837
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,360
If you have them, I'd memorize, don't say.

838
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,360
But if you truly didn't know before tonight, throw out a guess.

839
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,360
Vitamin C!

840
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,360
We could.

841
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,360
Top it, like, appropriate.

842
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,360
Get in here on the podcast mics, we got vitamin C.

843
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,360
That's a good guess.

844
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,360
Really good guess.

845
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,360
Possibly on Disney's Disney Channel.

846
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,360
That's a good guess.

847
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,360
Really good guess.

848
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,360
Possibly on Disney's label at the time, we don't know.

849
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,360
Could have been.

850
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,360
Any other guesses?

851
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,360
Julia Roberts.

852
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
Julia Roberts, good guess.

853
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,360
I thought we might get that and that it's some kind of pretty woman reference,

854
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,360
because this is, it's a little prostitute-y.

855
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,360
It's a bit judgy, Scott.

856
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,360
I'm sorry, I just, I don't know.

857
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,360
She's having a good time, all that.

858
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,360
She can dress how she wants to.

859
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,360
Yeah, hell yeah.

860
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,360
I'm not, I'm not trying to shame.

861
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,360
Any other guesses?

862
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,360
Cindy Crawford.

863
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,360
Yeah, that's it.

864
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,360
Cindy Crawford is the answer.

865
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,360
Cindy Crawford, yes.

866
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,360
And your prize is nothing.

867
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,360
Her famous mole.

868
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,360
She's got her famous mole.

869
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,360
It is there, yes.

870
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,360
And she's holding up a clam.

871
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,360
What's up?

872
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,360
It's like she's trying to hypnotize you with something.

873
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:52,360
And she's in front of, we really haven't pointed out some of the really fun store names.

874
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,360
Oh, hell yeah.

875
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,360
Dollars and cents.

876
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,360
Dollars and cents.

877
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:01,360
Cents spelled in the other way, not in the money way, but with an S at the top.

878
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,360
And there's a lot like that.

879
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,360
One of those Gemma Hill articles said that they weren't even going to do the celebrities.

880
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,360
It was just going to be this shit.

881
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:13,360
It was going to be plywood signs and then not, I mean, love them or hate them and probably hate them.

882
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,360
At least it's something to talk about.

883
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:19,360
If there weren't these creepoids on this ride, you'd never remember it at all.

884
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,360
Yeah, I'm trying to, I guess, does it make it better?

885
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,360
Do these characters make the ride better?

886
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,360
They make them more interesting, but I don't know about better.

887
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,360
Oh, can I introduce the next one and then you hit the slide?

888
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,360
Oh, yeah.

889
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,360
So you want to say it and then I'll hit the slide?

890
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,360
I'll say it and then you'll hit the slide.

891
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,360
Got it.

892
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,360
Hold your, yeah.

893
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,360
Wait, hold on a second.

894
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,360
Is it the next celebrity?

895
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,360
Yeah, it's the next celebrity.

896
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,360
Okay, I hope this is right.

897
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,360
Well, we've got it memorized.

898
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,360
Okay, I'll know by your intro.

899
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,360
Go.

900
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,360
Hold your sides, everyone.

901
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,360
It's funny man and convicted cocaine dealer Tim Allen.

902
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,360
There he is.

903
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:18,360
My favorite part about this and I really should have gotten a clip of it is they play music during this part, a real brief snippet of music that is a sound alike to the home improvement theme.

904
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:26,360
It is not the home improvement theme, but it's like, like, and it's just adjacent to it.

905
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,360
I think they all ABC obviously owns home improvement.

906
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,360
But the composer was like, you got to have standards guys.

907
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,360
I'm not giving away boo to just anybody.

908
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,360
That would have made the ride way better.

909
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,360
Yeah, yeah.

910
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,360
A ride that played the home improvement theme.

911
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,360
Disney's most beloved piece of music probably in a little while.

912
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,360
Yeah.

913
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,360
And if it was still around, they would have just changed it to the last man standing.

914
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,360
Is that his show theme?

915
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,360
Yeah, yeah.

916
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,360
Yeah.

917
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,360
We just flipped it and yeah.

918
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,360
Yeah.

919
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,360
Laughter Shocks is the nightclub.

920
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,360
Yeah.

921
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,360
That's what they were going for.

922
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,360
Laughter Shocks is not too PC to have Tim Allen perform.

923
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:18,360
We welcome every Louis could perform at Laughter Shocks.

924
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,360
Just put your phones in that bag.

925
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,360
Put your phones in the weird Ziploc bag.

926
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,360
Zip them up folks.

927
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,360
We should have had you guys zip your phones in a bag before this.

928
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,360
Yeah, put your phones in the bag.

929
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,360
In case Jason melts down on stage tonight.

930
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,360
We don't want that captured.

931
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,360
Put your phones in the bag.

932
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,360
You're going to be laughing too much.

933
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,360
You'll drop your phone and crack the screen.

934
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,360
You're going to be laughing too much.

935
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,360
You'll need your hands to hold your sides, everyone.

936
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,360
Let me take a brief second out of the celebrities.

937
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:57,360
There is a reference to character Swifty LaRue here.

938
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,360
Right there.

939
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:06,360
Laughter

940
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,360
Even at his sloppiest, Telly Savalas never looked that bad.

941
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,360
Even at his sloppiest.

942
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,360
You got to dress right, baby.

943
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,360
You got to dress well.

944
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,360
He's on the cover of Star Maker magazine.

945
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,360
There may be some people here not from the Los Angeles area.

946
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,360
If you're looking to move here, stay here, if you're looking for an agent or something,

947
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,360
just look for an ad where somebody says they will make you a star.

948
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:42,360
Check how many medallions he's wearing and how many hair follicles are on his open chest.

949
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,360
If it's upwards of 60, then sign that contract.

950
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:53,360
Free assessment is what this says.

951
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,360
This is not a good idea.

952
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,360
I feel like in the narrative of the ride, he is legitimate.

953
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,360
Yeah.

954
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:07,360
But this is not the ad for a legitimate businessman in Los Angeles.

955
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:12,360
Maybe the contract he's having you sign is that billion-year contract with Scientology.

956
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:20,360
It would be a good commentary of a ride if it all turned out to be a Scientology scam.

957
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,360
Honestly, yeah, makes a lot of sense.

958
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,360
Then it's actually satire.

959
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:36,360
Looking at that image reminds me, this feels like the time to point out that this ride opened February 2001, closed January 2002,

960
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:44,360
which means people likely walked off Superstar Limo and learned about the September 11th attacks.

961
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:48,360
People were like, Star Maker, what the fuck?

962
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,360
And they came out, what happened?

963
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,360
Why do we have to leave the park?

964
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,360
Why are they closing the park for the day?

965
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,360
What's that? Planes?

966
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,360
That's the second most depressing thing that's happened today.

967
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,360
All right, well.

968
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,360
Let's stay around here, Mike, quick.

969
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,360
That's why I wanted the phones in a little bag.

970
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,360
That's just how time works.

971
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,360
That's just how the window of time happens.

972
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,360
Don't put just that clip online, please.

973
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,360
It's in the podcast already.

974
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,360
It's in the podcast.

975
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,360
It's in the podcast.

976
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,360
It's in the podcast.

977
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,360
It's in the podcast.

978
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,360
It's in the podcast.

979
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,360
It's in the podcast.

980
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,360
It's in the podcast.

981
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,360
It's in the podcast.

982
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,360
It's in the podcast already.

983
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,360
It's public.

984
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:42,360
OK, well, let's say to get to get to something lighter, let's go to a star who we all love.

985
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,360
He's introduced with the line, care to rumble?

986
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,360
Hey, Jackie Chan.

987
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,360
Jackie Chan.

988
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,360
There he is.

989
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,360
You recognize him anywhere.

990
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,360
In his famous clothes.

991
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,360
Look at him go.

992
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,360
He was just filming a movie where he escaped from prison.

993
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:13,360
He's the only one because everybody else so far has a ABC or Disney connection.

994
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,360
Well, Jackie Chan definitely has.

995
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,360
Well, that's what I found.

996
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,360
Yeah.

997
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,360
You say it then.

998
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,360
I'm looking for.

999
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,360
No, say it because I don't remember the exact thing.

1000
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:27,360
Chan sang the title song for the Chinese release of Disney's 1990 animated hit Beauty and the Beast.

1001
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,360
Yes.

1002
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,360
Jackie Chan is a trained opera singer.

1003
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,360
Yeah.

1004
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,360
Yeah.

1005
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:39,360
But then he provided the voice of Shang for both the Cantonese and Mandarin versions of the studio's 1998 release Mulan.

1006
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,360
Also, I think Beauty and the Beast is that was not 1990, right?

1007
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,360
Or was it 91?

1008
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,360
Hmm.

1009
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,360
I believe that one.

1010
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,360
Yeah.

1011
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,360
Oh, that's my kind of room where everybody's murmuring.

1012
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,360
Disney release date.

1013
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,360
Yes.

1014
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,360
Love it.

1015
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:58,360
Hey, where does Mickey go if he needs to make a call?

1016
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,360
Yeah.

1017
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,360
Yeah.

1018
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,360
Hell yeah.

1019
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,360
All right.

1020
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,360
Thanks for indulging that one.

1021
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,360
I use the den.

1022
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,360
My dream.

1023
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,360
I finally realized.

1024
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,360
Okay.

1025
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:19,360
So is Jackie Chan maybe a good point to start talking about the remodeling that went down?

1026
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,360
Because we sort of alluded to this.

1027
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:27,360
If you go to Disneyland or Disney's California Adventure today, you get on the Monster's Inc.

1028
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,360
Monster's Inc.

1029
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,360
Mike and Scully to the Rescue.

1030
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,360
The title-y named attraction.

1031
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,360
Scully.

1032
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,360
Is it Scully?

1033
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,360
Mike Scully to the Rescue?

1034
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,360
Mike Scully.

1035
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:43,360
Simpsons writer Mike Scully to the Rescue.

1036
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:49,360
Again, all this inside Hollywood stuff on these rides, they got to broaden out.

1037
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,360
Yeah.

1038
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,360
Okay.

1039
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,360
Mike and Scully to the Rescue.

1040
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:59,360
And when you get into that ride, first of all, the ride vehicles are the same.

1041
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,360
They just painted them yellow and then they turned them into cabs.

1042
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:07,360
And then the other big change, there's a bunch of hazmat suits.

1043
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,360
I forget the name of the characters.

1044
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,360
Thank you.

1045
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,360
Thank you.

1046
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,360
Again, my kind of room.

1047
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:20,360
So they're all in hazmat suits and they're looking for boo.

1048
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,360
Boo.

1049
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,360
Sorry.

1050
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,360
I really...

1051
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,360
Yeah!

1052
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:35,360
Love a crowd that knows how to boo.

1053
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:43,360
So boo's out in the city, the hazmat suits, and the hazmat suits, next time you go on

1054
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,360
it, are in some pretty familiar poses.

1055
00:51:46,360 --> 00:52:00,360
Take a look at this side by side and you may notice a foot up in the air, like Jackie Chan,

1056
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,360
also dangling off of a wire.

1057
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,360
Yeah.

1058
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,360
And so that's how...

1059
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:10,360
They needed to get this ride gone as fast as humanly possible.

1060
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,360
What can we throw in here?

1061
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,360
The monsters ended up being the solution.

1062
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,360
They just put new suits on the guys.

1063
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,360
The other...

1064
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,360
And this one's also pretty notable.

1065
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,360
Let's take a look at Drew Carey.

1066
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:24,360
So, yeah, this is a regular Drew.

1067
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,360
Okay.

1068
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:31,360
Of course, by the way, selling maps to the stars homes.

1069
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,360
Of course.

1070
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,360
Why?

1071
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,360
Why?

1072
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,360
And there he is.

1073
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:41,360
Now, I don't know if you guys came across this, but somebody makes a very good point

1074
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,360
online, and I should have a source I don't.

1075
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:51,360
This is not my thought, is that his head wouldn't fit under that helmet.

1076
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,360
Ah, yeah.

1077
00:52:52,360 --> 00:53:01,360
So there's a very good chance there's a headless Drew Carey under that hazmat suit.

1078
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:06,360
I think I know how to fix Buzzy.

1079
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:10,360
He's all grown up.

1080
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,360
Screw her in.

1081
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,360
Yeah.

1082
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,360
So what a fun ride.

1083
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,360
Jason, do you have info about...

1084
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,360
Because there were some other...

1085
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:24,360
They were talking about how do we get a ride in here as fast as possible.

1086
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,360
Yes.

1087
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,360
Okay.

1088
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,360
So there was a couple...

1089
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:33,360
They were going to try rethinking it to Goofy Superstar Limo, where they would have repurposed

1090
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:41,360
statues from closed Disney stores throughout the ride of all the biggins, all Mickey and

1091
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,360
Minnie and Donald and all the big guys.

1092
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,360
Fantasia brooms.

1093
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,360
There were like 700 fantasia brooms.

1094
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:54,360
The other idea, and this was very blue sky, was turning it into Miss Piggy Superstar Limo,

1095
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:00,360
where the muppets would slowly, the rumor is, slowly be refurbishing the ride.

1096
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:06,360
So as the weeks went on, there'd be more and more muppets with scaffolding.

1097
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:13,360
You would ride through an active construction site with gradually more and more muppets going,

1098
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,360
yeah, this is a piece of junk, right?

1099
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,360
We got to get her ready for Piggy.

1100
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,360
That was the dream.

1101
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,360
That would have been awesome.

1102
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,360
Yeah, that would have been good.

1103
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,360
That would have been great.

1104
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:30,360
I have some punch ups if we could bring it back now with today's celebrities.

1105
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,360
Oh, go ahead.

1106
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,360
Yes, if we're bringing Superstar Limo back.

1107
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,360
Here's Constance.

1108
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,360
Whoa.

1109
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,360
Devastated to hear her show has been renewed.

1110
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:47,360
Let's take a turn into the quickly gentrifying neighborhood of Frogtown.

1111
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,360
Who's that buying a sandwich named after Ira Glass?

1112
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,360
Gad Zooks.

1113
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:59,360
It's Hollywood gadfly, Josh Gad.

1114
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:04,360
I'm a robot.

1115
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:10,360
Here's Robert Downey Jr. in his wheelbarrow of vitamins.

1116
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:13,360
There's the Capitol Records building.

1117
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,360
Who do you need?

1118
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:17,360
You need someone who can sing all songs.

1119
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,360
It's Meghan Trainor.

1120
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,360
And who's that in the booth next door?

1121
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:31,360
Why, it's all 10 members of South Korean boy band NCT 127.

1122
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:36,360
Not to be confused with the original NCT, which has 21 members,

1123
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:41,360
or NCT U, another offshoot of NCT.

1124
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:46,360
The Korean music industry is weird.

1125
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:51,360
All that gets said and the ride has come to a full stop.

1126
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,360
And it lurches forward.

1127
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,360
That is who they would get, definitely who they would get.

1128
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:02,360
Here's the voice of Hades, James Woods.

1129
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,360
He's lost his voice today.

1130
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,360
Oh, he's just there, he's just waving.

1131
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,360
He can't say anything.

1132
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,360
Thank God.

1133
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:16,360
That's better, James.

1134
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,360
Oh boy, who have we not seen?

1135
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,360
Who can we find out who?

1136
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,360
There's two more robots.

1137
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,360
This is where it starts to get a little condescending

1138
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:30,360
with the way they set out these last two stars.

1139
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,360
Yeah, yes indeed.

1140
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:36,360
The always entertaining Cher.

1141
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:40,360
The always entertaining Cher.

1142
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:44,360
It's like what a mad uncle says about a nephew they don't like.

1143
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,360
Yeah.

1144
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:51,360
It's entertaining, it's always something.

1145
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,360
This is the best one.

1146
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,360
Yeah, yeah.

1147
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,360
This is the best one.

1148
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,360
Not bad.

1149
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,360
Not bad, not that scary.

1150
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,360
Looks like her, great.

1151
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:07,360
The person herself is like plasticine enough that it's like,

1152
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,360
enough of an analog.

1153
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,360
Not so bad.

1154
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,360
The last one they totally ran out of steam on,

1155
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:17,360
Hollywood favorite Whoopi Goldberg.

1156
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,360
Yeah.

1157
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:22,360
Hollywood favorite, that's it, Hollywood favorite.

1158
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:26,360
That's like if you came up to us after the show and said,

1159
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,360
it looked like you guys were having a lot of fun up there.

1160
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:34,360
That is the equivalent of that, a comment no one ever wants to hear.

1161
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:38,360
Whoopi Goldberg, of course, in February 2001,

1162
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,360
the world's most relevant movie star,

1163
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,360
everyone was still reeling from the release of her last film,

1164
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,360
2000's More Dogs Than Bones.

1165
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:53,360
A film so special it was only released theatrically in Italy.

1166
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,360
True fact.

1167
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,360
I have a picture of that, but it's not in my slideshow.

1168
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,360
Oh, damn it.

1169
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,360
Look up More Dogs Than Bones later.

1170
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,360
I can do it now.

1171
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:08,360
It's got Joe Montagna in a different place than Whoopi Goldberg,

1172
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,360
poorly photoshopped together.

1173
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,360
It's a beautiful piece of art, print it out, frame it.

1174
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,360
There's also like a very odd,

1175
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:19,360
self-referential theme park moment in this where you go to Beverly Hills

1176
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:24,360
shortly before this scene and a floating head says,

1177
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:30,360
agents, execs, producers beyond, give us a sign, the green light is on.

1178
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,360
Shoot me in the fucking face.

1179
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:36,360
Like, I have never said this before on the show.

1180
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,360
This ride is straight trash.

1181
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,360
Like, this is like the worst.

1182
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,360
Is that by the leota head?

1183
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,360
Yeah, it's supposed to be like the leota head.

1184
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,360
Do you know that? Look at that.

1185
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:52,360
So that's the great Madame Leota reference.

1186
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,360
This is a scary, it's a weird projected head with a wig.

1187
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:04,360
This would have been rounded up in one of the flesh fairs in AI, doused with oil.

1188
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:08,360
Also, I read this only in one source, and I don't know how much I can believe it,

1189
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,360
but I think the voice of it was Melissa Joan Hart.

1190
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,360
Really?

1191
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,360
Does anyone know the answer? Is that right?

1192
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,360
Yes.

1193
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,360
Yeah.

1194
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,360
Okay.

1195
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,360
All right.

1196
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,360
I heard her famous voice, of course.

1197
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,360
Very distinct.

1198
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:26,360
Having an audience is really easy because we can fact check right away.

1199
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,360
Uh-huh.

1200
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:31,360
And Jason gets validation when he's talking about poppies or whatever.

1201
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,360
Yeah.

1202
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,360
Yes.

1203
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:37,360
Yeah, he's doing a podcast with two dummies.

1204
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:41,360
Yeah, I mean, the thing is, I think it's a little bit of a surprise

1205
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:46,360
that Melissa Joan Hart, they had her on the hook for a lot of stuff, I feel like, in the night.

1206
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:50,360
Like it'd be another now one could be like,

1207
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:56,360
there's Elizabeth Olsen reprising her role as Scarlet Witch, a role they never finished writing.

1208
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:01,360
The character's not really fleshed out.

1209
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,360
Well, she will be on the Disney Plus show.

1210
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:08,360
Yeah. They just got those poor Marvel people forever.

1211
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:12,360
Yeah. You sign a, what's the bad contract that Swiftie makes you sign?

1212
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,360
The millionaire contract.

1213
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,360
The billionaire, yeah.

1214
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,360
Yeah, that's what they all signed.

1215
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,360
Uh-huh.

1216
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:20,360
Do you think we could get everybody here, this is what, like 190 people and us,

1217
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:24,360
could we get everybody to agree to go in on one Disney Plus account?

1218
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:28,360
We all share the, that's the plan.

1219
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:33,360
Now we got value, password, Swiftie.

1220
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:38,360
Oh boy.

1221
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:43,360
The only thing watched on that one account is the Imagineering documentary series.

1222
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:47,360
Yeah. For sure.

1223
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:52,360
Well, we've covered a lot of stuff here.

1224
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,360
I mean, we've like wound our way through this ride.

1225
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,360
Yeah, let's keep the train rolling.

1226
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:02,360
The Malibu hillsides having fires and mudslides like I did not age well.

1227
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:05,360
Didn't age at the time well.

1228
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,360
Was that funny in 2001?

1229
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:12,360
For some people it definitely wasn't.

1230
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,360
Yeah.

1231
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:18,360
Eisner lived in Bel Air, so he's in Katzenberg, lived in Malibu.

1232
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,360
So let's slide it up.

1233
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:27,360
There's, I found on Monsters Inc, there's a, supposedly this is a reference to

1234
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,360
Superstar Limo.

1235
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:32,360
There's a thing that says top 10 ways to get fired that's on a bulletin board.

1236
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:38,360
And number eight is post scare reports on Ain't It Cruel News.

1237
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,360
Brutal, just brutal.

1238
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,360
The legacy of groans continued.

1239
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,360
Yeah.

1240
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,360
Oh boy.

1241
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,360
It's a lot of great.

1242
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:52,360
I'm just, I'm feeling like, do we need to like, kind of like speed this thing up or

1243
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,360
something?

1244
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:57,360
Do we need to like, I like, with that level of pun, I just, I feel like we're in like

1245
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:01,360
a weird, we're in like a seedy area here in our, in our limo trip.

1246
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,360
I guess, yeah.

1247
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,360
And I feel like maybe we need to like keep this thing rolling so we can get, maybe see

1248
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,360
if Swiftie's got a contract for us.

1249
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,360
Yeah.

1250
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,360
Huh.

1251
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,360
Oh, there's a hitchhiker.

1252
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,360
Whoa.

1253
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:20,360
For anyone listening at home, there is a white outstretched hand that seems to want to hitch

1254
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,360
a ride.

1255
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,360
From us.

1256
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:24,360
I mean we do have a long limo.

1257
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,360
We have a lot of room.

1258
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,360
This thing is spacious.

1259
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,360
What are you talking about?

1260
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,360
We're not picking up a hitchhiker.

1261
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,360
It's crazy.

1262
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,360
Come on, live a little Michael.

1263
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:35,360
It's not every day you're doing a live show in a limo.

1264
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,360
Just think about it like having Sprite for breakfast, you know?

1265
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,360
Living on the edge.

1266
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:43,360
I appreciate you doing that reference, but I still think it's a bad idea to pick up a

1267
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,360
strange hitchhiker.

1268
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,360
Huh, I guess so.

1269
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,360
I don't know.

1270
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,360
You know what?

1271
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,360
I'm making the call for us.

1272
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,360
I may be the gunner.

1273
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,360
I'm going to bring him on.

1274
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,360
Hey, you know what?

1275
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,360
We got plenty of room.

1276
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,360
Come on board, stranger.

1277
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,360
Sing, sing.

1278
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,360
No.

1279
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,360
No.

1280
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,360
Sing, sing.

1281
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,360
No.

1282
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,360
Sing, sing.

1283
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,360
Yeah.

1284
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,360
Oh my God.

1285
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,360
All right, all right, all right.

1286
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,360
No.

1287
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,360
I'm high-tailing this.

1288
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,360
You're my idea.

1289
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:14,360
You're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're.

1290
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:29,360
You're Cues, you understand?

1291
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,360
Because I'm Bugsy Bones.

1292
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:39,360
And I'm, I'm hijacking this here podcast the right you understand?

1293
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:40,360
I want to ruin it.

1294
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,360
I want to ruin it.

1295
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,360
So mind your Ps and Qs and guess what?

1296
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:48,360
If you don't like what I have to say, you gotta amscray.

1297
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:58,360
You gotta, you gotta, if you don't like it, you gotta amscray.

1298
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,360
You're minding your Ps and Qs.

1299
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,360
While you were, while you were, while you were back, because I'm not going back to sing sing.

1300
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,360
Okay.

1301
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,360
Okay.

1302
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:10,360
Folks, I want to tell this whole thing and ruin it all.

1303
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:15,360
For the listener at home, it's Bugsy Bones from the great movie ride episode.

1304
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,360
He's back.

1305
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,360
Yeah.

1306
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,360
Oh my God.

1307
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,360
I hope.

1308
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,360
Shut up.

1309
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,360
Mind your Ps and Qs.

1310
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:22,360
No, no, no.

1311
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,360
Bugsy, no.

1312
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,360
Are you going to get the lead?

1313
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,360
No, no, no.

1314
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,360
He want it?

1315
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,360
Hey.

1316
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,360
He want the lead?

1317
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,360
No.

1318
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,360
Hey.

1319
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,360
He want the lead?

1320
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,360
Not to our audience, Bugsy.

1321
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:33,360
He want the lead?

1322
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,360
He want to mind the Ps?

1323
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,360
What?

1324
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,360
What are you saying?

1325
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,360
He want them and a Q?

1326
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:38,360
What are you asking?

1327
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,360
I don't understand.

1328
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,360
I don't get what you're asking either.

1329
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,360
He want them and a Q?

1330
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,360
What?

1331
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,360
Why are you even here?

1332
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,360
He's thrusting in front of us.

1333
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,360
This is terrible.

1334
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,360
I don't get it.

1335
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,360
I'm trying to ruin this thing.

1336
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,360
What do you mean?

1337
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,360
Why?

1338
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,360
We were having a perfectly good time.

1339
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:51,360
Why are you, you came back to find us again.

1340
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,360
What is it that you have against us?

1341
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,360
Why are you, you came back to find us again?

1342
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,360
Why are you, you came back to find us again?

1343
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,360
I don't like him.

1344
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,360
Yeah, that's right.

1345
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,360
I hate fresh air with Terry Gross.

1346
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,360
I think she is Terry Gross.

1347
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,360
I don't like him.

1348
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,360
Boo.

1349
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,360
Boo him.

1350
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,360
Boo him.

1351
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,360
That was terrible.

1352
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,360
No, he wants it.

1353
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,360
No, don't do that.

1354
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,360
Yeah, that's right.

1355
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,360
I think the Dope Boys are a bunch of dorks.

1356
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,360
I give them one part.

1357
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,360
I ain't bought that.

1358
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,360
No.

1359
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,360
I ain't bought that.

1360
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,360
No.

1361
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,360
I ain't bought that.

1362
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,360
No.

1363
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,360
I ain't bought that.

1364
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,360
No.

1365
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,360
I ain't bought that.

1366
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,360
No.

1367
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:50,360
No.

1368
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,360
No.

1369
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,360
I ain't bought that.

1370
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,360
No.

1371
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,360
I ain't bought that.

1372
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:55,360
No.

1373
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,360
No.

1374
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,360
They're our friends.

1375
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,360
That's right.

1376
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,360
No.

1377
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,360
They stink like poo.

1378
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,360
What?

1379
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,360
What you gonna do?

1380
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,360
I ain't bought that.

1381
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,360
I hate him.

1382
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,360
Look.

1383
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,360
No.

1384
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,360
No.

1385
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,360
Don't do that.

1386
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,360
The middle part of the limo.

1387
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,360
He gingerly placed her prop limo on the ground.

1388
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:11,360
Bugsie.

1389
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,360
I ain't bought that.

1390
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,360
No.

1391
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,360
I ain't bought that.

1392
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,360
My wife worked on that.

1393
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,360
Bugsie.

1394
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,360
What else you got?

1395
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,360
What, you have a script?

1396
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:19,360
It's a script.

1397
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,360
I'm not a script.

1398
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,360
I'm not a script.

1399
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,360
I'm not a script.

1400
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,360
You have a script?

1401
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,360
He's got more.

1402
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,360
He's got more reps and no item.

1403
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,360
Somebody in the audience take him.

1404
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,360
Wait, almost.

1405
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,360
It's hard to see.

1406
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,360
I understand.

1407
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,360
You're standing under a light.

1408
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,360
I wrote this down.

1409
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,360
God damn it.

1410
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,360
Jason, help him out.

1411
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,360
We'll get it done quicker.

1412
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,360
No.

1413
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,360
Podcast, blah, blah, blah.

1414
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,360
I want to go to the Coco Bunga Cha Cha.

1415
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,360
I hate podcasts.

1416
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,360
That's what we waited for?

1417
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,360
Podcast, podcast, they stink.

1418
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,360
I hate podcasts.

1419
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,360
I hate podcasts.

1420
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,360
I hate podcasts.

1421
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,360
I hate podcasts.

1422
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,360
I hate podcasts.

1423
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,360
I hate podcasts.

1424
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,360
I hate podcasts.

1425
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,360
I hate podcasts.

1426
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,360
I hate podcasts.

1427
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,360
I hate podcasts.

1428
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,360
I hate podcasts.

1429
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,360
They stink.

1430
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,360
More than Jar Jar Binks, I hate podcasts.

1431
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,360
Oh.

1432
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,360
Boo.

1433
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,360
Podcast Save America makes me sick.

1434
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:57,360
Podcast Save America can take my dick.

1435
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,360
I hate podcasts.

1436
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,360
Oh my God.

1437
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,360
This is too much.

1438
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:01,360
For those of you listening at home, he's dancing and jumping around.

1439
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,360
It's very impressive, but I hate it.

1440
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,360
I hate him.

1441
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,360
No.

1442
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,360
No.

1443
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,360
Cut him off.

1444
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,360
Cut the track.

1445
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,360
Cut him off.

1446
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,360
Cut the track.

1447
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,360
I hate podcasts.

1448
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,360
I hate podcasts.

1449
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,360
I hate podcasts.

1450
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,360
No.

1451
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,360
I hate podcasts.

1452
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,360
I hate podcasts.

1453
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,360
I hate podcasts.

1454
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,360
I hate podcasts.

1455
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,360
I hate podcasts.

1456
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,360
I hate podcasts.

1457
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,360
I hate podcasts.

1458
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,360
No.

1459
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,360
I hate podcasts.

1460
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,360
Be quiet, everybody.

1461
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,360
Just be quiet, everybody, just be quiet.

1462
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,280
Cut the track.

1463
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,280
Cut the music.

1464
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,280
No.

1465
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,280
Boo.

1466
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,280
Boo him, boo him.

1467
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,280
Boo.

1468
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,280
Boo.

1469
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,280
Boo.

1470
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,280
No.

1471
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,280
Boo.

1472
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,280
He's going into the audience to hear the boos better.

1473
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,280
Really milking it.

1474
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:39,280
I eat your boos.

1475
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,840
Oh, you're standing, Bugsy.

1476
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,840
You're crushing the tire, Bugsy.

1477
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,080
Bugsy.

1478
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,900
You've just cost upwards of $9, Bugsy.

1479
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:48,900
Hey, hey, hey.

1480
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:49,900
I'm in there.

1481
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:50,900
All right, Bugsy.

1482
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,900
Get out.

1483
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,900
Bugsy, the audience doesn't like you.

1484
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:54,900
Oh, they love me.

1485
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:55,900
Don't you, audience?

1486
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:56,900
Yeah.

1487
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:57,900
That's right.

1488
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:58,900
Tell him.

1489
01:07:58,900 --> 01:07:59,900
Tell him.

1490
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:00,900
I like it.

1491
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:01,900
No.

1492
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:02,900
I like it.

1493
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:03,900
No.

1494
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:04,900
I like it.

1495
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:05,900
He's sucking a Tommy gun.

1496
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:06,900
I like to suck a Tommy gun.

1497
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:07,900
Bugsy, these are people online.

1498
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:08,900
They said they don't like you.

1499
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:09,900
Here's a couple comments that actually are real.

1500
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:10,900
Oh, man.

1501
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:11,900
Oh, man.

1502
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:12,900
Oh, man.

1503
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:13,900
Oh, man.

1504
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:14,900
Oh, man.

1505
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:15,900
Oh, man.

1506
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:16,900
Oh, man.

1507
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:18,900
Oh, this is on Twitter.

1508
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:19,900
Yeah, yeah.

1509
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,900
I've heard them all at Sink Sink.

1510
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:22,900
No.

1511
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:23,900
No.

1512
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:28,300
Seethers says, also, while I'm talking podcasts, I like podcasts right after a Batman live episode,

1513
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:30,660
but the great movie right episode made me drop it.

1514
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:35,700
I couldn't stand the stupid Bugsy Malone shtick being dragged on and on constantly.

1515
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:40,420
It wasn't funny to me and actually got annoying.

1516
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:44,900
You know what I say to that commenter?

1517
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:45,900
What?

1518
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:47,900
Ampskade.

1519
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:48,900
No.

1520
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:53,900
The last part of the limo has been gingerly kicked down.

1521
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,900
He tipped to the final panel.

1522
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:56,900
No.

1523
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:57,900
Ampskade.

1524
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,900
You son of a bitch.

1525
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,900
Hey, T's, Q's.

1526
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:03,900
Q's, okay.

1527
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:07,900
Okay, I'm going to high tail the car here.

1528
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:10,900
The car you made be on the ground.

1529
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:14,900
All the way to Sink Sink to bust out my friends.

1530
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,900
Oh no.

1531
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:16,900
Do you understand?

1532
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:17,900
Yeah.

1533
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:20,900
Okay, so I'm hijacking your whole thing and they love me, these guys.

1534
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:21,900
Okay.

1535
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:22,900
They love me.

1536
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:23,900
Is that so?

1537
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:24,900
That's not true, right?

1538
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:28,900
Well, let's just, I guess we just try to do the rest of the podcast.

1539
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:32,900
Should we try to just keep doing the episode maybe and see if this doesn't get in the way?

1540
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:37,900
Because we had more great facts about Superstar Limo locked and loaded and we might never get

1541
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:38,900
them out now.

1542
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:41,900
We might not get to find out if we get that contract from Swiftie.

1543
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:43,900
Bugsy's ruined it all.

1544
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:48,900
Like the cast of the Drew Carey show begrudgingly went on this ride.

1545
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:49,900
What?

1546
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:50,900
Interesting, huh?

1547
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,900
For the Rosie O'Donnell talk show.

1548
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:53,900
You shut your mouth.

1549
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:54,900
Okay.

1550
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:57,900
Okay, keep going.

1551
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:00,900
All right, well, oh, oh, oh, the merchandise.

1552
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:01,900
Was it?

1553
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:02,900
There was a little merch.

1554
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:06,900
Okay, there was a little merchandise and you could buy like a poster, but they also had.

1555
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:07,900
Do it quick, Mike.

1556
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:08,900
He's got a gun on you.

1557
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:09,900
Okay.

1558
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,900
They had this like little toy here and you're like, Donald would be driving on Pluto and

1559
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:13,900
then Mickey.

1560
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,900
So like they were the Superstar Limo.

1561
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:16,900
That's interesting, right?

1562
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,900
Because they weren't on the ride and they were in the merch.

1563
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,900
Yeah, that actually looks pretty fun.

1564
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:21,900
So that's funny.

1565
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:22,900
Yeah.

1566
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:23,900
How many of these were me, dude?

1567
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:24,900
Huh?

1568
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:25,900
How many of these?

1569
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:26,900
You're talking about Hollywood?

1570
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:32,900
I'll take you to Hollywood and Vine right now and show you the real Hollywood.

1571
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:33,900
Huh?

1572
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:34,900
What?

1573
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:35,900
What does that mean?

1574
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:36,900
None of this Mickey Mouse.

1575
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:37,900
Hollywood and Vine is where the Arclight is, right?

1576
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,900
Hollywood and Vine is a wonderful place.

1577
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,900
So Starbucks and a 33 taps.

1578
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:42,900
It's like, but it's different.

1579
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,900
The Schwab's drug store isn't there anymore.

1580
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:45,900
There's no.

1581
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:46,900
All right.

1582
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:47,900
Peace and Q.

1583
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:48,900
Okay.

1584
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:49,900
Sorry.

1585
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:50,900
Sorry.

1586
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:53,900
We have to think of stuff interesting enough to make Bugsy not shoot us.

1587
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:54,900
Yeah.

1588
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:59,900
Well, well, Superstar Limo was not the only limo in the history of the Disney company.

1589
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:00,900
Oh, this is good.

1590
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:07,900
For the 25th anniversary of Walt Disney World, there was a limb mouse zine that drove around.

1591
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:08,900
Pretty cool.

1592
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:09,900
Pretty cool.

1593
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:10,900
Yeah.

1594
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:14,900
Because you know, the Disney corporation was, they own Miramax.

1595
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:15,900
That's what that was.

1596
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:16,900
Right?

1597
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:17,900
Well, no, no, no, no.

1598
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:18,900
Bring that up.

1599
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:19,900
When they got Miramax?

1600
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:20,900
They own Miramax.

1601
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,900
That's technically correct, but this is no way place to bring that up.

1602
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:24,900
Oh, okay.

1603
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:25,900
Yeah.

1604
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:30,900
So I like the time that that head of Disney, one of the head of Disney's like actually was

1605
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:36,900
caught in that porn scandal where he was photographing pornography and they were like, oh, that's

1606
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:37,900
No.

1607
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:38,900
No.

1608
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:39,900
Photographing pornography and they fired him.

1609
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:40,900
None of that?

1610
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:41,900
No, none of that.

1611
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:42,900
None of that slander.

1612
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:43,900
Okay.

1613
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:44,900
Area.

1614
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:45,900
Might be public record.

1615
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:46,900
We don't know.

1616
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:47,900
Yeah.

1617
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:48,900
Let me look.

1618
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:49,900
I just, we have some other slides.

1619
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:50,900
Okay.

1620
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:51,900
We have some other slides.

1621
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:54,900
There's this weird thing from the ride.

1622
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:55,900
This weird couple.

1623
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:56,900
Oh yeah.

1624
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:57,900
Look at these guys.

1625
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:58,900
What do you think?

1626
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:03,900
There's a weird little like couple that are kind of splotchily painted and they're like,

1627
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:11,900
they're tiny and they're sunbathing next to a giant lock and that's in the ride.

1628
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:12,900
Yeah.

1629
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,900
So they're, that's good, right?

1630
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:15,900
Yeah.

1631
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:16,900
Yeah.

1632
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:17,900
That's all right.

1633
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:18,900
You know,

1634
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,900
Oh, so you, so he likes that, I guess.

1635
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:21,900
Oh, okay.

1636
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:27,900
Guys, I, you know, I, I just felt like I got a bad rap last time, you know?

1637
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:30,900
Oh, hey, wait, everybody aw him.

1638
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:31,900
Yeah.

1639
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:32,900
Yeah.

1640
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:39,900
So Bugsie Bones, formerly Bugsie Malone's was, was, he was a bad guy, but now he's, you

1641
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:41,900
know, he's starting to turn around a little bit.

1642
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:42,900
Okay.

1643
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:43,900
You are?

1644
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:44,900
You are?

1645
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:51,900
You know, he, he, he really believes in all of podcasts, the ride, because at the end

1646
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:57,900
of the day, Bugsie's happy to be here for you, for your 100th show, you know?

1647
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,900
Oh, that's nice.

1648
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:00,900
Yeah.

1649
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:01,900
Bugsie, that's really sweet.

1650
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:02,900
That's genuinely sweet.

1651
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:06,900
And if you ever talk back to me again, I'm going to shove this up your ass and pull it

1652
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:07,900
drink it, then it goes high.

1653
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:08,900
Oh, God.

1654
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:09,900
You understand that?

1655
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:10,900
All right.

1656
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:11,900
This is a tough one.

1657
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:12,900
This has gone far enough.

1658
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:13,900
Yeah.

1659
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:16,900
Even a sweet message turned into a very foul thing.

1660
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:22,900
And what we're finding is that for the second time in our first 100 episodes, a terrible,

1661
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,900
supernatural being has hijacked everything.

1662
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,900
And I can't take it anymore.

1663
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,900
We can never let this happen again.

1664
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:29,900
No, no, no.

1665
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:34,900
There's no force anywhere in the universe that can stop this terrible scourge.

1666
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:37,900
Boys, boys.

1667
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:44,900
Is it?

1668
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,900
Could it be?

1669
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,900
Could it be?

1670
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,900
He has returned.

1671
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:54,900
Wait, wait, wait.

1672
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:55,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1673
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,900
Wait, let his music play.

1674
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:02,900
He's even more resplendent than he once did.

1675
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:03,900
That heavenly shine.

1676
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:04,900
He is resplendent.

1677
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,900
It's the Sector Keeper, ladies and gentlemen.

1678
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:07,900
Yeah.

1679
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:12,900
For the first time in person or in ghost or whatever.

1680
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:17,900
Boys, boys, boys.

1681
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:20,900
You give me strength.

1682
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:21,900
Yeah.

1683
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:23,900
All right.

1684
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:24,900
Yeah.

1685
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,900
You give us strength, Sector Keeper.

1686
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,900
You could tell that we needed your help, huh?

1687
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:30,900
No, no, no, no, no.

1688
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:36,900
Who's this little pipsqueak who's not minding his P's and Q's?

1689
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:39,900
It didn't go off this time.

1690
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:40,900
It didn't go off.

1691
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:41,900
Eh.

1692
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:43,900
Eh.

1693
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:48,900
I thought Nick Mundy was a bad man.

1694
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:54,900
But you, you're a bad man.

1695
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:55,900
Hey.

1696
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,900
And I think if you search in your heart.

1697
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:58,900
No.

1698
01:14:58,900 --> 01:14:59,900
This guy's giving me the willies.

1699
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:03,900
You'll see, you'll see me as I see you.

1700
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:04,900
Yeah, yeah.

1701
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,900
This guy's giving me the willies over here.

1702
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,900
I don't know how you see me, man, but I don't know you pipsqueak.

1703
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:10,900
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1704
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:16,900
Are you, Sector Keeper, are you saying that you somehow know Bugsy from some other avenue?

1705
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:17,900
Yes.

1706
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,900
But I know him by a different name.

1707
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:25,900
I know him as Brother.

1708
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:46,900
Wow.

1709
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:49,900
A cannonball don't pay no mind.

1710
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:53,900
You're kidding.

1711
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:54,900
You're kidding.

1712
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:57,900
Somewhere in the confines of heaven.

1713
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:58,900
Yes, yes.

1714
01:15:58,900 --> 01:15:59,900
You two are related?

1715
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:05,900
If you re-listen to and review with five stars all the 100 episodes, it's there.

1716
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:08,900
I promise.

1717
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:09,900
Listen.

1718
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:10,900
All the clues.

1719
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:11,900
No, no, no, no, no.

1720
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:17,900
Listen, I'm going to kill this little pipsqueak because he, it's a P, that's a P and he's

1721
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:18,900
not minding his Q's with the pipsqueak.

1722
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,900
I'm going to kill this little pipsqueak.

1723
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:21,900
No, no.

1724
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:24,900
And then I'm going to kill all of you and I'm going to high tail us all to sing sing

1725
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:27,900
because I fucking, fucking.

1726
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:28,900
What?

1727
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:30,900
What did you?

1728
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:35,900
These are not good boy gestures happening on our stage.

1729
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:37,900
Sector Keeper, you're going to let this shit happen?

1730
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:39,900
No, I will not let this happen.

1731
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,900
This ends now.

1732
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:44,900
This ends today.

1733
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:49,900
Because with the power harnessed by the 19 Sector Stones.

1734
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:51,900
Wait, what do you got there?

1735
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:55,900
I have a coin that you get for a coffee machine taped to a glove.

1736
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:57,900
No, no.

1737
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:00,900
And it's the most powerful Sector Stone.

1738
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:01,900
All right.

1739
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:02,900
I'm sorry Bugsy.

1740
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,900
You say you got jewels?

1741
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:05,900
Yes.

1742
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,900
Let me suck them jewels.

1743
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:08,900
Suck them.

1744
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,900
Get him out of here Sector Keeper.

1745
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:12,900
You will not be sucking jewels.

1746
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:14,900
Let me suck, let me suck the jewels.

1747
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:15,900
Bugsy, you can't.

1748
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:16,900
Let me suck the jewels.

1749
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,900
Let me suck the jewels.

1750
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:18,900
Let me suck them.

1751
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:19,900
Let me suck on them.

1752
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:23,900
Let me suck on them jewels to make them feel noise.

1753
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:26,900
Bugsy, it's 11.35.

1754
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,900
We got to get those jewels.

1755
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:30,900
We're going to get kicked out of the venue at some point.

1756
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,900
We're going to get those jewels.

1757
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,900
Don't you understand Bugsy?

1758
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,900
You can't kill what's already dead.

1759
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:37,900
Okay?

1760
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,900
That was poetic.

1761
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:42,900
Damn.

1762
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:46,900
What you have to realize is that the power of this gauntlet.

1763
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,900
With the power of these Sector Stones.

1764
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,900
With one snap of my fingers.

1765
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:52,900
I can send you to hell.

1766
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:55,900
Until your soul is pure.

1767
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:59,900
Much like how Thanos sent Spiderman and his friends to hell.

1768
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:04,900
Until God saw that they were worthy again.

1769
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:07,900
Christian God, yeah.

1770
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:09,900
I'm sorry brother.

1771
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:10,900
But snap.

1772
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,900
It's like when we were boys.

1773
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:13,900
Snap.

1774
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:20,900
Oh, yeah.

1775
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:29,900
Yeah.

1776
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:37,900
I can't feel these hugs, but I can imagine.

1777
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:41,900
It's close to what a hug would be like.

1778
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:46,900
You saved us from our most villainous character of the two.

1779
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:47,900
Boys.

1780
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,900
Boys, boys.

1781
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:56,900
You give me such strength.

1782
01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:00,900
I want you to remember that as you go on to your next 100 episodes.

1783
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:03,900
Whenever you need to be lifted up.

1784
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,900
Whenever you need strength.

1785
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:08,900
I want you to turn to the city on the hill.

1786
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:13,900
I want you to find strength in City Walk.

1787
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:22,900
And I want you to especially look for that strength there and in me.

1788
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:25,900
Yes.

1789
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:26,900
Yes.

1790
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:27,900
We promise we will.

1791
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:28,900
We'll never forget.

1792
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:29,900
Of course not.

1793
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:31,900
Sorry, my ghost brain is forgetting.

1794
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:32,900
Oh, yes.

1795
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:34,900
Especially this fall.

1796
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:38,900
When you go on your most amazing journey yet.

1797
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,900
To the downtown Disney ordeal.

1798
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:49,900
God.

1799
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:52,900
God damn it.

1800
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:58,900
The downtown Disney ordeal.

1801
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:01,900
And none of it can be behind a paywall.

1802
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:02,900
What?

1803
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:03,900
No.

1804
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,900
We didn't talk about that.

1805
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:06,900
Actually, well, go seek.

1806
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:07,900
Come on.

1807
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:15,900
We got to make a living, sector keeper.

1808
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:16,900
You're right.

1809
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,900
I have a job now too.

1810
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:20,900
Oh, really?

1811
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:21,900
What?

1812
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:22,900
What's up with you?

1813
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:25,900
I work at a cricket wireless.

1814
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:29,900
Oh, cool.

1815
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:30,900
Yeah.

1816
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:31,900
It's cool.

1817
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:32,900
It's cool.

1818
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:36,900
I guess they're hiring, but it's not really like an industry for the future necessarily.

1819
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:37,900
Oh, yeah.

1820
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:38,900
Well, you know, it's all right.

1821
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,900
And I get a lunch break and.

1822
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:42,900
I hope.

1823
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:43,900
Yeah.

1824
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:44,900
Yeah.

1825
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:45,900
Yeah.

1826
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:46,900
It's next to a GNC and that's.

1827
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:47,900
But OK.

1828
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:48,900
Yeah.

1829
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:49,900
Yeah.

1830
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:50,900
Good.

1831
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:51,900
Like, parking's all right.

1832
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:52,900
Parking's awful.

1833
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,900
There's no parking.

1834
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,900
It can't all be perfect.

1835
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:57,900
But you know what?

1836
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:58,900
Things are pretty perfect right now.

1837
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:01,900
And I'm just glad we're finally done with that son of a bitch.

1838
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:02,900
Bugsy.

1839
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:03,900
Yeah.

1840
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:04,900
We're done with him forever.

1841
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:05,900
Forever.

1842
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:06,900
Yeah.

1843
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:07,900
Oh, wait.

1844
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:08,900
Wait a minute.

1845
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:09,900
But he looks different.

1846
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:12,900
He's oh, the audience is thrilled.

1847
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:17,900
Guys, I'm a hugsy now.

1848
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:24,900
The power of community and friendship.

1849
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:28,900
Has kind of shown me just like a whole other way right now.

1850
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:29,900
That's great.

1851
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:30,900
Oh.

1852
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:31,900
And like, I get it now.

1853
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:32,900
Yeah.

1854
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:33,900
Like, I didn't.

1855
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:36,900
The thing is, is like, you have to like, get it a little bit.

1856
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:37,900
Yeah.

1857
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,900
Now I get it.

1858
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:40,900
Come here.

1859
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:41,900
Give me a hug.

1860
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:42,900
No, it's like, you can know it.

1861
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:43,900
You can read about it, but it's got to be real to you.

1862
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,900
It's good to see you, brother.

1863
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:46,900
I'm finally back.

1864
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:47,900
Just like old times.

1865
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:48,900
Just like old times.

1866
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:49,900
God, I love you.

1867
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:50,900
Just like old times.

1868
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:51,900
Oh, my God.

1869
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:52,900
Oh, wow.

1870
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:53,900
So you're good now.

1871
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:54,900
I'm good.

1872
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:55,900
I'm a hugsy.

1873
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:56,900
I went, I saw the light.

1874
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:59,900
I'm not going to ever be annoying again.

1875
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:00,900
Oh, great.

1876
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:01,900
Nowic.

1877
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:02,900
No, no, no.

1878
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:03,900
I don't.

1879
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:07,900
I actually, I now love podcasts and especially, you know, I heard this podcast.

1880
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:08,900
I don't know if you guys heard of it.

1881
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:09,900
It's called Pod Save America.

1882
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:10,900
I love this podcast.

1883
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:11,900
Oh, yeah.

1884
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:12,900
This podcast is so clever.

1885
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:15,900
This podcast, it says the things that like, I just heard it.

1886
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:16,900
I just heard it.

1887
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:17,900
I just heard it.

1888
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:18,900
I just heard it.

1889
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:19,900
I just heard it.

1890
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:23,900
It says the things that like, I just, I can't.

1891
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:29,900
It's like you three guys, but if you guys were like really smart, you know?

1892
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:31,900
So now I understand it.

1893
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:33,900
They're probably like actually funny.

1894
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:35,900
They're probably like really professionally funny.

1895
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:36,900
And when I listen to them, that's what it is.

1896
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:39,900
It's like if I'm hanging out with them, you know?

1897
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:42,900
I mean, but also you get that insider info.

1898
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,900
And obviously when you donate, it's like a very good thing.

1899
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:45,900
So all of you guys, please do that.

1900
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,900
And listen to Pod Save America.

1901
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:48,900
That's right.

1902
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:49,900
Year to year first.

1903
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:52,900
Stop listening to us and go to this better podcast.

1904
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:53,900
Yeah.

1905
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:54,900
Type in Hugsie to get past paywall.

1906
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:55,900
It's just very good.

1907
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,900
Yeah.

1908
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:57,900
Cool.

1909
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:58,900
All right.

1910
01:22:58,900 --> 01:22:59,900
We'll do.

1911
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:00,900
I mean, that pretty much sums it up, except wait a minute.

1912
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:01,900
Wait.

1913
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:02,900
We forgot about Swifty.

1914
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:05,900
We got to see if there's some big, is there a contract or something waiting for us?

1915
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:06,900
Did we ever get the deal?

1916
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:07,900
Let's find out.

1917
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:08,900
Swifty, are you still around?

1918
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:09,900
You did it, boys.

1919
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:10,900
The show was baffo.

1920
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:11,900
The sector keepa was Bugsie's brudda.

1921
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:12,900
What a twist.

1922
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:22,900
Hey, Swifty's in Conyou in a most lucrative contract in all of podcasting.

1923
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:26,900
700 bucks to read penis enlargement ads.

1924
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:27,900
Kudos, boys.

1925
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:28,900
I better go, Capiche.

1926
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:29,900
I'm getting sued by the WGA.

1927
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:32,900
And also several dozen women who didn't want to see Swifty's puppet dick.

1928
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:33,900
Better lawyer up pronto.

1929
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:34,900
Are they going to try to get me?

1930
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:35,900
I'm going to try.

1931
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:36,900
I'm going to try.

1932
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:37,900
I'm going to try.

1933
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:38,900
I'm going to try.

1934
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:39,900
I'm going to try.

1935
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:40,900
I'm going to try.

1936
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:41,900
Lawyer up pronto.

1937
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:45,900
Are they going to throw old Swifty into Sing Sing?

1938
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:48,900
Sing Sing?

1939
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:56,900
I think I like this guy.

1940
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:59,900
Oh, Hugsie.

1941
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:01,900
That's our show, ladies and gentlemen.

1942
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:02,900
