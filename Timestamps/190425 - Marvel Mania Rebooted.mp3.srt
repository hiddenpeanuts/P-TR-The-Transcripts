1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,000
Podcasts arrived at the second gate.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,060
Hello, welcome.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,520
The real casual one today.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,360
Yeah.

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,720
Real casual getting into it.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,960
Yeah, yeah, we're doing real casual.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,200
Scott's not here, so we don't have to be as formal.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,200
He always insists on, you know,

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,640
announcing who we are and saying what we're doing.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,480
We don't care.

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,440
Jason and I are free spirits.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,980
Yeah, it's just Jason and Mike, the naughty boys.

14
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,800
As we were once christened by the great Joe Wingert

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,600
when he was coaching our improv team five lifetimes ago.

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,400
Did he actually make that up or is that something we said?

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,520
And then he like said it like,

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,960
was like, oh God, what are these assholes saying?

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,760
I think, yeah, he may have,

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,160
maybe we said it in a scene or something like that.

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,040
And he kept up the joke.

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,820
The thing is with naughty boys,

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,800
now that I'm thinking about it,

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,120
we thought that was funny at the time,

25
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,640
but now that's kind of feels like proud boys to me

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,560
or something.

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,120
So I would be a little bit worried

28
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,640
if we were called naughty boys.

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,080
Well, we do call ourselves, we are the good boys.

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,320
Yeah, I mean, we've called ourselves that a little bit.

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,200
I almost feel like the listeners have taken that on

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,920
and made that our identity a little more.

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,160
Not that we haven't leaned into it

34
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,200
because we certainly have.

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,400
So yeah, I guess I don't really associate myself

36
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,720
as naughty anymore like I once did.

37
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,200
Yeah, yeah, we've calmed down in our 30s.

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,240
We were such wild children in our 20s.

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,960
I mean, we're actually exactly the same.

40
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,840
But we're gonna go back a little today

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,840
to our childlike states of wonder

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,920
and something that I kind of have never dropped.

43
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,520
We're talking Marvel Mania today

44
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,360
and we're reviving the Marvel Mania menu.

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,360
We're launching a new Marvel Mania.

46
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,200
Yeah, so we did an episode in the City Walk saga

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,680
that contained Marvel Mania.

48
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,880
It was in one of the sectors,

49
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,080
I'm trying to remember which number it was.

50
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,000
Sector 17.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,400
Sector 17.

52
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,240
The Fallen Brothers.

53
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,320
Had, yeah, it was the Fallen Brothers

54
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,960
and it had Marvel Mania in it.

55
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,400
It was a short-lived restaurant

56
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,280
at Universal Studios City Walk in Hollywood.

57
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,120
Yes.

58
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,960
Not in Orlando.

59
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,400
Not in Orlando, but originally advertised

60
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,480
as coming to Orlando for the Islands of Adventure

61
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,840
City Walk expansion.

62
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,680
I remember it very clearly

63
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,080
because I was at the preview center.

64
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,160
I got all the preview materials and I pored over it.

65
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,040
I'm like, I can't wait to eat at this Marvel restaurant.

66
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,400
Yeah, oh, I actually didn't as a kid.

67
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,280
I was not, it was not on my radar either of these coasts,

68
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,560
but seeing all that stuff would have made me crazy

69
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,640
because as kids we were ravenous for Marvel content.

70
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,480
Yeah.

71
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,320
So yeah, I can imagine that you as a kid were like,

72
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,480
oh boy, oh baby, here we go.

73
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,040
Oh yeah, and I told the story of being at Islands

74
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,480
of Adventure opening summer and City Walk as well

75
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,360
and just asking everyone,

76
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,640
is the Marvel Mania restaurant not open?

77
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,080
When is it opening?

78
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,920
You were asking people at City Walk?

79
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,840
I was asking people.

80
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,280
Like who, who were you asking?

81
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,640
Like they used to have little help kiosks

82
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,240
when it was brand new because you couldn't really,

83
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,920
at times you haven't been able to make reservations

84
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,680
at restaurants or if you did, you had to do it at a kiosk.

85
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,260
So I'd be like, what's going on with this Marvel Mania

86
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,840
that was in the promotional, like in the stuff

87
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,680
and they're like, we don't-

88
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,500
So how old are you then?

89
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,000
You're like 13 or something?

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,560
Yes, the normal things a 13 year old was doing

91
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,560
like what's the deal with this advertised food service?

92
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,720
So did you know, did you know where it would have gone?

93
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,400
Like it wasn't, you weren't that in deep.

94
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,560
I guess obviously the internet wasn't so great yet.

95
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,760
I don't think they advertised it

96
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,840
and even that I knew Hollywood had gotten one somehow.

97
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,280
I think they mentioned it in Marvel comics

98
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,360
and then Wizard Magazine had a round table

99
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,360
where like I think then still knew editor Joe Cassata

100
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,400
and some other Marvel people were eating

101
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,360
and being interviewed at the Marvel Mania restaurant

102
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,200
at Universal Hollywood.

103
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,240
Oh yeah, I do remember that actually now that you say that.

104
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,080
Yeah.

105
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,220
That I do remember.

106
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,440
So I did, I guess it was on my radar,

107
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,080
but like I've said many times on the podcast before,

108
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,440
it was in Los Angeles so I would never go there.

109
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,760
No, and you know, this was my childhood version

110
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,760
of what I experienced recently with the Hard Rock Park

111
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,880
of being nostalgic for a place I never was

112
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,240
because I always wanted to go to the Marvel Mania restaurant.

113
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,640
Like as a kid, especially when we were in the vacation club

114
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,600
and we knew our points could be used at other Disney things,

115
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,280
I was like, it would be great to go to Southern California

116
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,800
to eat at Marvel Mania and ride this Indiana Jones ride,

117
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,840
but I know that's incredibly realistic.

118
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,160
Unrealistic?

119
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,200
Unrealistic, yes.

120
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,100
Unrealistic to drag my family to do these two things.

121
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,720
Yeah, I just was like, okay, I've been on a plane

122
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,160
once and will probably never be on a plane again

123
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,000
because I'm too scared

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,920
and my family doesn't seem to want to fly ever.

125
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,940
So yeah, okay, that just happens out there.

126
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,760
Oh cool, there's an Indiana Jones ride?

127
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, that'd be fun.

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,160
Never going to happen.

129
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,740
There's no way.

130
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,240
There's no, seriously not,

131
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,460
it didn't even occur to me that I could go there.

132
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,200
I don't know what it is, what it is about the Midwest

133
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,520
or what it is about certain suburbs or whatever

134
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,680
where you're just like, I'm here forever, baby.

135
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,580
Well, I think, I mean, before I came to Disneyland

136
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,020
for the first time, which within like an hour or two,

137
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,040
I was like, this place is truly wonderful.

138
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,380
The reputation of Disneyland in my mind as an East coaster

139
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,040
who spent his childhood going to Disney World

140
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,760
is Disneyland is just the Magic Kingdom.

141
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,380
Yeah, no, I think I wasn't,

142
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,100
I don't think I even thought about it

143
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,620
because Disneyland obviously reinvigorated my love

144
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,760
for this stuff because I wasn't following it so hard

145
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,340
through like college and stuff.

146
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,100
I wasn't reading Disney Adventure in college.

147
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,460
I wasn't reading Jim Hill in college.

148
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,900
Scott is the one, he's not here.

149
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,340
He's also in Japan, that's why he's not here.

150
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,540
He's on assignment in the land of the rising sun.

151
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,320
Our cub reporter, Scott Garner in Japan.

152
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,380
He was, Scott was reading like Jim Hill before,

153
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,900
years before I ever even knew of Mr. Hill.

154
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,420
It didn't, for whatever reason, it didn't dawn on me,

155
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,420
but I would check in on a website called IOACentral.com.

156
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,260
Which was rumors.

157
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,220
I went to Adventure Central?

158
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,180
Yeah, which is now defunct.

159
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,400
What year?

160
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,560
Like freshman year in college, I remember doing this.

161
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,560
Wow, Islands of Adventure specific news website.

162
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,400
Yeah.

163
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,240
In 2003?

164
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,960
Yeah, 2003, 2004.

165
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,120
And I remember making my backdrop

166
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,780
like Marvel Superhero Island.

167
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,440
Also, my current computer backdrop is also a picture.

168
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,880
Marvel Superhero Island.

169
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,120
It's all of Islands of Adventure.

170
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,960
Okay, fair enough.

171
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,200
It's like a crazy Photoshop

172
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,520
where it's all on one like flat plane.

173
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,600
So yeah, you're like, your dream,

174
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,280
everything is just Islands of Adventure,

175
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,080
Marvel Superhero Island, Spider-Man ride.

176
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,160
Like that is the top, I think, it seems like for you.

177
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,360
I think it was just like perfect timing.

178
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,480
If you could live in nostalgia, it would be there.

179
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,440
Yeah, yeah.

180
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,200
Because like, I don't, I think like as a kid,

181
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,800
I mean the speculator boom,

182
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,800
like the early 90s comics boom of like X-Men number one,

183
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,480
the Jim Lee, Chris Claremont one is selling

184
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,720
like 10 million copies or whatever.

185
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,360
I came to it like probably a year later

186
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,720
where that comic was like a dollar everywhere

187
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,600
because there was so fucking many of them.

188
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,440
Yeah, sure.

189
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,680
And then I was trying to catch up

190
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,040
and I was also just trying to understand

191
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,480
the world of comics.

192
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,720
So then by the time I get to like middle school,

193
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,740
to me, I don't know anything about Marvel

194
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,440
having financial difficulties.

195
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,040
I'm just like, well, I liked the Phalanx covenant

196
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,800
and onslaught and Operation Zero tolerance.

197
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,040
Bankruptcy.

198
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,780
I think as I got into like seventh and eighth grade,

199
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,480
I started to become more aware

200
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,320
because it would get in the news.

201
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,680
And it was in Wizard.

202
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,560
I was a very savvy seventh, eighth, ninth grade.

203
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,680
I knew all about Avi Arad and Toy Biz.

204
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,340
So this is a real quick recap,

205
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,600
Marvel file for bankruptcy in like 90 what, six?

206
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,440
No, 99.

207
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,280
Was it 99?

208
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,480
Was it a little later?

209
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,640
I think it was a little later.

210
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,800
But then they were rescued by the toy company Toy Biz.

211
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,640
Yeah.

212
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,240
Which was the company that made Marvel

213
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,960
and Marvel figures and other toys as well.

214
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,880
And that was owned by Avi Arad and now CEO,

215
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,720
like Perlmutter.

216
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,360
Perlmutter, real life super villain.

217
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,760
Real life Dr. Doom, like Perlmutter.

218
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,160
Yeah.

219
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,840
Yeah, so they basically like bought the company

220
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,920
and rescued it from bankruptcy.

221
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,800
And then Avi Arad is still like producer on some,

222
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,320
he was up on stage at the Oscars

223
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,200
receiving the Oscar for Spider-verse.

224
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,040
Really?

225
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,860
Yeah.

226
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,760
Is he still on all the Marvel movies

227
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,240
or just like the Spider-Man ones?

228
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,840
Just the Spider-Man ones.

229
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,680
For whatever reason,

230
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,600
I have to look in exactly why that is.

231
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,520
He's a very, he's got a producing credit

232
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,200
on a lot of the earlier ones, like The Punisher.

233
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,040
Yeah.

234
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,160
I've heard, I don't know if I'm allowed,

235
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,500
I probably won't, I won't say these stories.

236
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,720
I've heard stories though of like him pitching

237
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,880
crazy things in the room for Marvel movies.

238
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,920
Like he's- Probably.

239
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,760
He's like a little bit of a madman.

240
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,600
Yeah.

241
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,720
I mean, I knew him as like the guy whose name was on

242
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,200
all the Marvel, like movies and cartoons.

243
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,540
So I was like, well, I like that guy.

244
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,920
He makes the stuff I like.

245
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,720
Cause if you can imagine,

246
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,100
there was a dearth of Marvel media.

247
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,720
Now we're at like the crest of the wave

248
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,980
for like the Avengers end game comes out in a week.

249
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,680
And who knows what happens after that.

250
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,600
The crest of the wave,

251
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,440
sorry to clarify that expression.

252
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,320
Does that mean we're at the apex essentially?

253
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,840
Is that what that means?

254
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,080
I think I might be using that wrong.

255
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,120
I guess the crest of a wave is when,

256
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,800
right before it becomes all crashing down.

257
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,480
And I don't know that I believe that.

258
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,080
We are certainly at a climax of the first like leg,

259
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,240
which was 22 movies or 23 movies.

260
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,080
Yeah.

261
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,620
The only reason I think I was wondering what that meant

262
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,920
is because I was like, I don't think,

263
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,240
I think a much bigger wave before a crash even is happening.

264
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,120
Yeah.

265
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,120
I think that we'll get up to like seven

266
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,240
Marvel movies a year.

267
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,080
Yeah.

268
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,960
And like there'll be just a channel.

269
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,760
I mean, there's going to be Disney plus there's be like

270
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,920
a ABC will be replaced by Marvel TV shows or something weird.

271
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,120
Like we'll get to the point where this,

272
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
everyone be so sick of this.

273
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,400
We will have a what the TV series,

274
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,400
the, the Marvel parody of itself comments.

275
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,600
Yeah. Oh, and what the, I believe here's a little anecdote.

276
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,480
So maybe you have a similar thing.

277
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,440
I don't even know if we've ever talked about this.

278
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,720
When AOL started, there would be massive,

279
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,600
this is very creepy now in my head,

280
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,720
but this is just how you're my little 12 year old brain work.

281
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,520
People would post the screen names

282
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,840
of the writers and artists.

283
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,080
Jesus.

284
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,320
On things.

285
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,240
And I was like fascinated because on an instant messenger,

286
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,800
that was everyone's life.

287
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
It was portrayed in pen 15,

288
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,320
where you just go on your instant messenger and talk to

289
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,160
friends.

290
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,800
I got both my prom dates over it.

291
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,080
Well, it's the messenger.

292
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,200
Wow. Really both.

293
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,440
Yeah.

294
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,000
Was it just a simple, Hey, you want to go to prom?

295
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,760
Pretty like pretty much because like,

296
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,960
I didn't know when I'd run into people in the hallways.

297
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,800
Like, yeah,

298
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,240
but you were doing it to be,

299
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,920
you were being a coward too.

300
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,760
Oh, absolutely.

301
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,600
Yeah.

302
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,440
That to be fair.

303
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
I'm not saying I wasn't a coward either.

304
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,720
I'm just saying that, yeah, that's a,

305
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,840
the only time I wasn't was performing.

306
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,080
And that's why I like when I was doing plays and stuff was

307
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,880
the only time I did not feel cowardly at school.

308
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,720
Uh-huh.

309
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,000
So, but you, they said yes.

310
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,840
They did. Yeah.

311
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,680
All right. Well, that's good.

312
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,520
Yeah.

313
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,360
Cause that would actually make it easier to say no to

314
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,800
somebody. I think you could at least like wait a while.

315
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,840
Like if somebody texted me a thing,

316
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,840
I'd wait a while and compose like a perfectly like amazing,

317
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,760
let you down nicely thing.

318
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,400
And then like text it as a big paragraph.

319
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,680
Well, the first one, junior prom, the response was,

320
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,880
are you serious dude?

321
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,120
And I was like, yeah, yeah, a hundred percent.

322
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,800
And then the second one, there was a long pause.

323
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,440
And I later found out,

324
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,000
gonna keep this as vague as possible.

325
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The person called another friend of ours who she was like

326
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,920
secretly, they were secretly dating,

327
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,120
but he didn't want anyone to know because he was an asshole.

328
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,320
Like he's like, don't tell it.

329
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,480
Like they were secretly.

330
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,360
And she said like, so what,

331
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,000
so I got asked, but you didn't seem like you want it to get,

332
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,920
and he's like, yeah, go with, go with him.

333
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,760
Like,

334
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,580
so it was like a cover.

335
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,440
You were like a decoy or you were pretty much like, yeah,

336
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,000
you were to throw people off the scent.

337
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,240
So honestly, he probably liked it.

338
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,320
He was probably happy that his secret girlfriend was going

339
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,160
with this other guy.

340
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,000
Cause then people would go, oh,

341
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,480
well she obviously doesn't have a real boyfriend.

342
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,320
Yeah.

343
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,720
So you, but you do know this going in.

344
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,640
I didn't know that until I was 31.

345
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,460
Really?

346
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,300
Yeah.

347
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,140
You didn't know about secret boyfriend until.

348
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,220
No, I knew about secret boyfriend down later on,

349
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,220
but I didn't know that exchange happened.

350
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,060
Oh, okay.

351
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,340
That obviously she had to get approval from secret boyfriend.

352
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,180
Yeah.

353
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,300
He wouldn't even, did he go to prom?

354
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,260
Yeah.

355
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,340
In our limo.

356
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,180
Who did he go to prom with?

357
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,020
Someone else.

358
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,860
Wait, what?

359
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,860
Yeah.

360
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,700
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

361
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,180
So he went with a different person to prom.

362
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,740
Was he dating her secretly too?

363
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,780
No.

364
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,340
She was just a decoy.

365
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,100
He, I think it was to get someone else in.

366
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,860
There was a lot of managing of like getting people

367
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,860
from other schools or underclassmen in to a prom.

368
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,900
Yeah.

369
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,300
I don't quite understand.

370
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,140
So there was some sort of a.

371
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:16,980
I didn't understand it at the time.

372
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,180
There was some sort of a negotiation

373
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,780
with a different high school to get somebody's friend to come.

374
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,780
So he was taking somebody's friend maybe

375
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,380
from a different high school so they could be allowed access

376
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,220
to your prom.

377
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,820
There was a lot of negotiations.

378
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,380
You don't remember the girl's name?

379
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,740
I don't know.

380
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,740
That he would have taken.

381
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,580
I don't remember that girl's name.

382
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,780
You remember his name?

383
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,620
Yeah.

384
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,460
Okay, okay.

385
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,460
So you know those people well, I'm not asking you

386
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,300
to say that they're names.

387
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,140
Yeah, yeah.

388
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,980
I wouldn't hate it.

389
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,820
It would be funny.

390
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,380
There's a thing when,

391
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,980
if there's any teenagers listening to this,

392
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,060
if you think you're too smart for your own good,

393
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,020
I would advise you to experiment with drugs and alcohol.

394
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,340
Cause if you don't, this is what you do.

395
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:58,340
You do Machiavellian maneuvering and maneuvering.

396
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,180
Manipulation of your friendships.

397
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,180
Okay, so in the limo, you knew that guy before as well.

398
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,060
Yeah.

399
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,340
You didn't know he was dating your prom date.

400
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,180
Who had the flu when we went to prom.

401
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,020
Who had the flu.

402
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,260
So was there any, did they even like,

403
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,340
did they dance it all together?

404
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,060
And you go, oh, we're just friends

405
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,180
and they're just friends. Maybe in a group.

406
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,020
But never anything.

407
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,700
She seemed like she was about to die

408
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,540
cause she was like running a fever.

409
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,380
I ran a fever at a turnabout once.

410
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,140
Is that where the girls-

411
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,380
That's like Sadie Hawkins dance.

412
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,260
Oh, right, right. Okay, yeah.

413
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,580
And then I made everyone come home with my friend Ryan

414
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,100
and I made them watch a TLC match, a WWE TLC match.

415
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,940
That's much more fun.

416
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,140
Tables, ladders and chairs.

417
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,580
But I was also like running a fever

418
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,140
cause I had been sick all week.

419
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,500
And yeah, I think they were all bored,

420
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,140
but I think I was like delirious.

421
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,020
Not that I wouldn't be that dumb

422
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,540
to like bore a whole bunch of people

423
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,540
that I didn't know that well.

424
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,300
But yeah, anyway, so she's running a fever.

425
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,580
You're in the limo.

426
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,820
There's a different guy that you know

427
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,660
that's secretly dating

428
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,300
or you don't know they're secretly dating.

429
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,780
He has brought somebody from some other school,

430
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,660
some other situation.

431
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,780
And then they never interact at all.

432
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,820
So they're lovers.

433
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,980
Barely, yeah.

434
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,420
They're two lovers.

435
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:23,340
But they just are committed to this secret situation.

436
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,900
Yeah.

437
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,100
And they never,

438
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,180
cause this is a longer story for a different time,

439
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,100
but there's been times when a friend of mine

440
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,780
was seeing somebody that I went to a dance with

441
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,820
and I didn't know.

442
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,300
And then when I finally knew, I put it all together.

443
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,500
I said, oh my God, of course this time.

444
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Oh, that was weird.

445
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,380
I remember this now.

446
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,380
And of course I should have seen,

447
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,220
it's like the end of usual suspects.

448
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,060
Yeah.

449
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,540
You go, oh my God, I should have seen all of this

450
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,860
or sixth sense or whatever.

451
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,980
It's like a movie.

452
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,940
But you're saying you now in hindsight,

453
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,420
you didn't even see it.

454
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,820
They were so good about it.

455
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,660
Yeah.

456
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,980
Yeah.

457
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,860
I mean, let's not say good.

458
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,300
Because she seemed like in her telling,

459
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,620
she's like, I was young.

460
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,980
I begrudgingly went along to it.

461
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,660
And it wasn't until I was older that I realized

462
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,540
that was super shitty and manipulative.

463
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,380
Yeah.

464
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,260
I like the idea though that she would be like,

465
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,260
Hey Jason, can you, there's a limb over here.

466
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,780
Get me a cup of ice in it.

467
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,940
And somebody's like, oh sure.

468
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,100
And you like, you like turn your back

469
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,340
and they're just making out like furiously.

470
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,900
And you're like, oh, the ice is really stuck

471
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,740
at the bottom here.

472
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,140
And you like put it in the glass, you turn around

473
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,940
and they're just like back in the situation,

474
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,340
back in the same situation.

475
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,700
You know, I think part of my charm is a charming naivety

476
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,500
and a very hard citizens guy.

477
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,700
And those are my only modes.

478
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,540
That's fair.

479
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,380
I think that's fair.

480
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,300
Swinging between the one and the other.

481
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:47,020
So it's possible they were like hardcore making out

482
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,260
when you'd go to the bathroom.

483
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,980
Well, probably not because I don't think

484
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,980
she wanted to pass along whatever she had,

485
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,220
like whatever illness she had.

486
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,900
But like you dropped your baked potato at the table

487
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,860
and you're like, let me go get this baked potato.

488
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,260
And then they like lean over and start making out.

489
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,620
Just got to retrieve the old baked potato.

490
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,060
Yeah, that's a very funny like slapstick routine.

491
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,900
I'm imagining that is what happened.

492
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,260
I mean, the next day most people like bailed

493
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,060
or the couples went off their separate ways.

494
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,700
And those of us who were still standing

495
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,460
went to Chuck E. Cheese and have a lot of fun at Chuck E. Cheese.

496
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,580
Well, I can't be mad at that.

497
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,420
Yeah.

498
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,260
That's great.

499
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,820
And the two of them went as well or no?

500
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,260
One of them disappeared and the other went home

501
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,860
to sleep for 12 hours because of the flu.

502
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,460
It didn't go and the other guy went away.

503
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,300
Okay, got it.

504
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,940
I mean, he crashed on someone's rec room basement floor

505
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,460
that night.

506
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:47,460
No one had a good time sleeping on shag carpet.

507
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,660
Like, I don't know.

508
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,820
I mean, at the time you're like, oh, we got to do that.

509
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,340
We got to go to the after-prompt party

510
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,420
and then we all got to crash at someone's house.

511
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,700
We did that too.

512
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,020
Which I don't, it's all exhausting.

513
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,860
It was exhausting.

514
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,340
I also though at the time, like I've had to get over the fact

515
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,820
because like my mom drilled it in my head

516
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,420
that if I, excuse me, didn't get enough sleep, I would die.

517
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,740
So I would get so worked up if I didn't get enough sleep.

518
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,860
Oh, I would never get enough.

519
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,900
So I don't think I got more than six hours of sleep

520
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,180
at night in high school.

521
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,900
On the weekends I would sleep like 10 to 12 hours.

522
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,180
I think there was certainly situations

523
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,340
where I wouldn't get enough sleep,

524
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,420
but I was always just very paranoid

525
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,540
about not getting enough sleep.

526
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,620
And now I've kind of gotten over it a little bit

527
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,780
where it's like, I don't,

528
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,820
even though I actually didn't get enough sleep last night,

529
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,660
but you just kind of like roll with it as opposed to like,

530
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,500
I was like, oh my God, I've only gotten two hours of sleep.

531
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,580
I'm gonna get so sick.

532
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,900
I'm gonna get so sick.

533
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,420
And then I just worked myself into being sick.

534
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,260
Yeah, oh yeah.

535
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,100
I would just make myself sick

536
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,940
because I was like worried about that.

537
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,340
I made myself sick all grades.

538
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,140
And let's be honest, that's what sick is.

539
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,420
A lot of the time it's just stress in our brains.

540
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,500
Yeah. Okay, anyway.

541
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,260
This is a circuitous route to say, yeah,

542
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,100
like all of these problems went away

543
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,220
when I went to see my friends in the Marvel universe.

544
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,540
Sure, yes.

545
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,060
I had friends in the Marvel universe as well.

546
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,780
And I enjoyed their company a lot.

547
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,860
I have a lot of the comics still upstairs.

548
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,620
And it's funny because there was a great creative resurgence

549
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,900
at Marvel that came out of the bankruptcy

550
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,620
because they kind of gave people a little bit of free rein.

551
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,620
Joe Cassata made editor of the Marvel Knights line.

552
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,660
And that, you had Kevin Smith writing Daredevil.

553
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,500
And then David Mack came in and did it.

554
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,260
And then eventually Cassata promoted to editor in chief.

555
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,860
Brian Michael Bendis comes in at the time.

556
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,180
Grant Morrison writes X-Men run.

557
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,900
All of this great talent was happening

558
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,140
like in the bankruptcy recovery.

559
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,740
Well before the Marvel cinematic universe.

560
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,580
But-

561
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,420
Well, X-Men happened.

562
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,820
Yeah, and X-Men happens right around that time.

563
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,660
The first movie.

564
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,980
The first movie, yeah.

565
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,260
But all of that is kind of separate from Marvel Mania

566
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,540
because Marvel Mania was kind of a hodgepodge

567
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,820
of like 90s Marvel.

568
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:13,940
Yeah, mid to late 90s Marvel.

569
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,580
Yeah, this is before the cool,

570
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,740
because Marvel sort of had, with Cassata,

571
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,060
like the Marvel Knights line was a little darker,

572
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,100
a little weirder.

573
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,940
Yeah.

574
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,740
And then it's for sure the Grant X-Men,

575
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,740
which I love as well, very weird, very creepy in places.

576
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,820
And not at all like the tone of the 90s X-Men,

577
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,580
which is just very big and colorful.

578
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,220
I've said it before, everyone's just hot.

579
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,780
Every character in the X-Men is just so good looking.

580
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,500
It's insane.

581
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,100
They're like all pumped up.

582
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,940
Yeah.

583
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,700
And it's totally a different vibe.

584
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,620
But yeah, Marvel Mania right in the pocket

585
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,940
of all the X-Men are hot, bright colors,

586
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,460
great artists still on all the menus and stuff.

587
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,860
And yeah, it's very much this stuff I started reading

588
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,500
when I started reading Marvel really.

589
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,380
But kind of like great artists,

590
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,940
but in Marvel Mania kind of shoehorned together.

591
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,780
Like kind of like-

592
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,860
Oh yeah, the menus aren't perfectly designed.

593
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,180
The menus aren't perfectly designed.

594
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:19,180
And I have to say, when we first talked about Marvel Mania,

595
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,860
we talked about like, well,

596
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,460
we'll have to revisit Marvel Mania,

597
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,220
or we'll have to come up with a new Marvel Mania menu,

598
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,980
which I have a lot of pitches for today.

599
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,260
The other thing that got me down that rabbit hole

600
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,340
and I revisited was looking at, can I buy these menus?

601
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,140
Can I find these menus on eBay?

602
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,060
Yes.

603
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,540
And they are gouging these prices.

604
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,180
Like how much is that?

605
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,540
Anywhere between 35 and a hundred plus dollars

606
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,700
for these menus.

607
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,540
And are they in good condition?

608
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,620
They seem reasonably good condition,

609
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,620
but my discovery doing this is that I found some

610
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,820
more affordable items where I realized like,

611
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,300
we might be able to practically,

612
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,060
we could restart Marvel Mania realistically.

613
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,140
And this has been on my mind recently.

614
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,020
We knew Scott was going out of town.

615
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,340
Are you going to propose that we start a restaurant?

616
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,060
I mean, I've got a menu and-

617
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,020
All you need for a restaurant is one menu.

618
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,460
I've got some pitches.

619
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,860
You know, you were explaining to me recently

620
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,060
the way licensing works for toys.

621
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,900
Yeah.

622
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,020
You were talking about how like the Ninja Turtles,

623
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,180
they'll give the license to anyone.

624
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,860
To make toys, right?

625
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,020
Yeah, for a lot of different, most properties now,

626
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,220
people that want to make so much money that there's like

627
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,460
very few exclusive licenses for toys.

628
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,660
So like for years, Playmates was the only company

629
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,100
that can make Turtles toys.

630
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,540
Now there's many of these different cooler collectible

631
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,340
companies like NECA or Super 7 that can also make Turtles.

632
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,140
The only problem is that they just can't put them next to

633
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,540
the current Nickelodeon Playmates toy line.

634
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,860
But a lot of it works this way for DC.

635
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,940
It works this way for a lot of things where you can get

636
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,860
a license for a lot of things.

637
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,460
I don't know how it applies to restaurants.

638
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,940
I don't either, but you can start-

639
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,780
All right, turn your computer on and show me

640
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,260
whatever this is gonna be.

641
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,660
So I found a guy selling this plate,

642
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,900
an official Marvel media plate.

643
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,500
That looks fake.

644
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,820
But on the eBay page, there's a couple of things.

645
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,900
One, he shows the box the plate is in

646
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,500
and it's got the shipping label on it

647
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,660
saying it was going to Universal Studios.

648
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,660
100 Universal Plaza, whatever Universal Studios

649
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,620
Hollywood's address is.

650
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,620
And I say, well, okay, so this plate is retailing.

651
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,340
He's buy it now for $8.

652
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,500
I have a $5 off eBay coupon that brings the plate

653
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,580
down to $3.

654
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,220
I start to read the description more.

655
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,820
He's like, I am selling this plate.

656
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,980
In fact, I have a lot of 2000 of these plates.

657
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,380
I am willing to do bulk discounts.

658
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,540
So I have ordered one of these plates

659
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,540
to see the quality of this Marvel media plate.

660
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,060
And I'll post the link to this Marvel media plate.

661
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,980
What the Marvel media plate looks like,

662
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,300
and maybe this actually isn't gonna be,

663
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,420
maybe everyone doesn't have this experience.

664
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,580
As a kindergartener, I made a plate for the holidays.

665
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,140
I don't know if you had to done this as well.

666
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,980
Oh yeah, I made a ton of these shitty plates.

667
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,300
So you know what I'm talking about then.

668
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,260
So most people probably do then.

669
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,420
I drew Michelangelo as Santa Claus.

670
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,260
It was kindergarten.

671
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,860
He is holding a present.

672
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,380
It's not my finest artwork.

673
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,820
But this plate looks like a slightly better version of that.

674
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,140
I mean, obviously the characters are well designed or whatever,

675
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,940
but it looks like a cheap ass plate

676
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,820
that was just drawn on with some,

677
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,860
I'm underselling it.

678
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,700
It looks better than that.

679
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,100
But it looks like a knockoff.

680
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,940
It looks like something you'd get at a dollar store.

681
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,780
It looks like a knockoff,

682
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,100
but there were enough pictures on the guy's description

683
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,580
and enough positive reviews.

684
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,660
And he's saying that these were legit.

685
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,340
These were legit.

686
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,700
I don't know if they were ever,

687
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,060
I don't think they were ever used.

688
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,620
They look still in the wrapping.

689
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,460
So this guy stole.

690
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,660
Bought, I think bought.

691
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,260
You think he bought them from someone else.

692
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,100
I think he bought like,

693
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,940
How do you know that?

694
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,780
When they're clearing out.

695
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,500
This is like a guy in a van when he goes,

696
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,300
hey, I got a bunch of TVs who fell off the truck.

697
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,580
Because other people are selling this same plate too.

698
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,540
Okay, so that verifies that it's real.

699
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,380
I think it's real.

700
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,660
But I'm saying we don't know that this guy

701
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,180
didn't steal a big thing of plates.

702
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,900
He could have.

703
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,460
Look, the only thing he is selling on eBay

704
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,300
are these plates.

705
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,740
Are these plates?

706
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,580
But again.

707
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,420
He has over 2,000 plates.

708
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,540
He has 2,000.

709
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,940
And he said he'd love to move the whole lot.

710
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,780
I also found.

711
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,900
So you wanna buy the whole lot.

712
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,340
Well, I'm just considering it.

713
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,860
I've bought one so far.

714
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,020
And I'm pretty stingy with my fun money.

715
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,460
So six grand.

716
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,300
Now another.

717
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,460
You could buy all of it for like five grand?

718
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,260
I mean.

719
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,700
So one month of the Patreon

720
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,740
goes to buying 2,000 Marvel Mania plates?

721
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,100
I only found one of these.

722
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,140
This is a bar mixing glass that says Marvel Media.

723
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,980
I like that.

724
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,020
I mean, that looks also cheap as well.

725
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,860
But I like how it's got a little sippy.

726
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,700
This didn't cost that much,

727
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,140
but the shipping was like 10 bucks.

728
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,060
Because it's very oddly shaped.

729
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,940
It's got like, yeah, it's like a beer glass.

730
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,260
But then it has a little sippy,

731
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,900
as if you were a little baby.

732
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,500
Yeah, I can't tell if this is an official

733
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,980
from the back of the bar or from the shop.

734
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,500
Yeah, I mean, I don't know who would drink

735
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,980
a beer out of this weird tall glass.

736
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,820
No, I think it's mixing.

737
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,660
It's got the measurements.

738
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,420
It's a mixing glass.

739
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,260
Oh, I see.

740
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,100
That makes a lot more sense.

741
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,940
So it's got the measurements on the side.

742
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,780
I thought you were gonna just drink out of this

743
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,220
like a baby, but I see what you're saying.

744
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,380
It's easier to pour that way.

745
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,340
Got it.

746
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,460
So potentially we have the inventory

747
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,780
for 2,000 plates and one mixing glass.

748
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,260
To start a restaurant.

749
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,380
Where is the restaurant?

750
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,020
Is it happening in my apartment?

751
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,860
Like, what do you, is this a pop-up?

752
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,700
You know, I don't know.

753
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,140
Is this like the Save by the Bell pop-up restaurant?

754
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,340
We gotta start looking at real estate.

755
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,820
I mean, this episode is essentially the proof of concept.

756
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,140
Because you said you have some concepts.

757
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,500
I have some concepts, sure, but I don't know.

758
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,780
I've got some very specific menu items.

759
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,180
Can we talk to the person,

760
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,260
the people who did the Save by the Bell pop-up?

761
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,860
Is that still going on?

762
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,180
I don't know the answer to that.

763
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,460
They were hoping it was gonna go forever.

764
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,100
There was also like a fake Johnny Rockets pop-up

765
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,860
called like Rami Jockets.

766
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,700
What was that for?

767
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,300
It was on, like there was one of the original ones

768
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,380
on Melrose that Johnny Rockets closed,

769
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,900
and then someone did like a parody of Johnny Rockets.

770
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,940
But it wasn't like Nathan for you or something?

771
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,940
I don't think it was, no.

772
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,780
It wasn't dumb Starbucks.

773
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,260
Was it Johnny Rockets Enthusiast?

774
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,620
It seemed like it, if you're committed to that.

775
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,660
I thought you were the only one.

776
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,580
I mean, I love, you know I love those wet hamburgers.

777
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,420
Those wet.

778
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,380
The wettest hamburgers.

779
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,700
The wettest hamburgers.

780
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,740
Yeah, okay, so, all right, we'll find a place, I guess.

781
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,900
I mean, look, fine, we'll do it.

782
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,740
We'll remake Marvel Mania.

783
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,580
I mean, we'll talk it out.

784
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,420
We'll see at the end of the episode.

785
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,660
Maybe it's not feasible.

786
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,460
Okay, I think it's, it'll be feasible.

787
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,580
But I put a lot, you know, I spent some time thinking,

788
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,860
thinking on this, and yeah.

789
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,180
This just sounds like, there'll be times

790
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,060
when we suggest doing, I don't know,

791
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,660
maybe a longer episode or a topic.

792
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,620
One time Scott suggested that we record an episode

793
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,660
at City Walk and you lost your mind.

794
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,500
So this undertaking.

795
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,940
Well, I don't like getting in trouble.

796
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,780
Well, we wouldn't have gotten into serious trouble.

797
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,900
But I do like flights of fancy.

798
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,420
All right, well, I'm just saying,

799
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,420
the restaurant business seems like it might be tougher

800
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,620
than recording a podcast outside of shopping malls.

801
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,140
Well, we don't know which of our listeners

802
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,580
may have opened or closed restaurants before.

803
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,820
You know, you never know.

804
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,580
How many of you Patreon listeners

805
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,660
have opened or closed a restaurant?

806
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,540
I like, just a message, tweet at us,

807
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,300
say it in the comments on the Patreon episode.

808
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,740
Have you opened or closed a restaurant?

809
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,660
And we're not saying like you closed one down

810
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,980
like you were there when it closed.

811
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,540
You, at least we're managing the restaurant,

812
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,980
if not, all right, owning it.

813
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,940
Hopefully owning it.

814
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,420
Where you at, where you,

815
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,500
take you out of the Bennegan franchise.

816
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,420
Yes.

817
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,700
If we have any just like insanely rich listeners also,

818
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,660
like that wanna like bankroll something stupid

819
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,420
for podcasts, the right to do, let us know.

820
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,260
Yeah.

821
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,820
Like, do you have enough money?

822
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,740
Are you somebody who like has Dubai level,

823
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,820
like Dubai Prince level money?

824
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,980
And like, maybe we just like do our own park.

825
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,820
Yeah.

826
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,620
Like let us know that too.

827
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,900
Maybe, cause maybe somebody's got a ton of money

828
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,980
and capital, but they just don't wanna do a restaurant.

829
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,660
They wanna do a full theme park.

830
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,500
Sure.

831
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,660
And then we'll get the rights to Marvel McFay.

832
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,100
Oh, it's all Marvel.

833
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,660
It's all Marvel's.

834
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,420
We could have both Captain Marvel's

835
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,900
and then we could have Shazam and Marvel's.

836
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,780
Half a dozen Captain Marvel's.

837
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,260
There'll be all the Captain Marvel's.

838
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,100
Yeah.

839
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,500
And then it's gonna be hard to get that.

840
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,700
So it's just, you know what, nevermind.

841
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,900
It's just Marvel McFay again.

842
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,980
And it's all Marvel McFay rides.

843
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,820
Great.

844
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,380
So, but so anyway, yeah, let us know if you're rich.

845
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,060
And in the parking lot, Marvel Mania 2.

846
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,220
Yeah, but it's Marvel Mania 2,

847
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,940
but it's about Marvel McFay.

848
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,420
So the restaurant is separate.

849
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,260
That way, yeah.

850
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,380
The thing you're pitching now, separate entirely.

851
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,220
Okay.

852
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,780
Marvel Mania 2 at the Marvel McFay theme park

853
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,180
bankrolled by one of the podcasts,

854
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,980
the ride Patreon listeners.

855
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,900
That's just about Marvel McFay.

856
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,300
It's called Marvel Mania 2.

857
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,740
Oh, okay, perfect.

858
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,980
Okay, so is that clear?

859
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,820
Yeah, that's clear to me.

860
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,860
Okay, because I can repeat it.

861
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,700
That's clear to me.

862
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,700
Okay, got it, all right.

863
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,540
Okay, great.

864
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,300
So let's get into it.

865
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,700
So I'm gonna do movie stuff last.

866
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,140
You know, I feel like movie stuff,

867
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,900
you'd probably think it was gonna come first,

868
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,380
but here's a big problem I had

869
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,980
with the original Marvel Mania menu.

870
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,380
Little vague, a little generic in terms of.

871
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,540
Well, let's go, yeah, let's go over a little bit

872
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,620
just in case the listener didn't listen

873
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,180
to the City Walk episode.

874
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,700
Whatever reason, they may not have wanted

875
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,540
to listen to all 19 parts, which is crazy.

876
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,780
I know that's probably a 1% tile

877
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,060
of people who didn't listen, but they're.

878
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,740
Look, just to give you like kind of a hint,

879
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,660
let me, I'm finding these right here.

880
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,180
The original, okay.

881
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,780
So like you would get Wolverine's Grilled Cheese Sandwich,

882
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,660
a triple decker grilled cheese sandwich

883
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,460
on white bread with American cheese,

884
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,700
served with fantastic fries and applesauce.

885
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,820
It's great any way you slice it.

886
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,820
You could get the Defenders Tenders,

887
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,340
Chicken Fritters served with fries and applesauce.

888
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,140
The Defenders, of course, Silver Surfer,

889
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,100
Doctor Strange, Hulk, and Namor.

890
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,020
You could get the Uncanny X Pasta, X-Men Pasta,

891
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,140
with, I like how they say X, I assume it was an X,

892
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,980
that's what they mean by that.

893
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,180
Oh, maybe, this is of course

894
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,740
the kids menu you're rating.

895
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,020
Well, it's still the menu.

896
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,700
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

897
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,620
X-Men Pasta with a tomato meat sauce

898
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,580
or butter and Parmesan cheese served with pizza bread.

899
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,220
Cap's Battle Burger, the Dare Dog,

900
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,860
which of course would have been your favorite.

901
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,700
All beef hot dogs served with fries and applesauce.

902
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,100
Yeah, I was a 13 year old with very specific opinions

903
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,900
on Frank Miller's Daredevil work.

904
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,020
What would you, I guess you wouldn't have ordered

905
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,900
for the kids menu, but what would you have ordered

906
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,580
from this, do you think?

907
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,180
If you were the champions. From these options?

908
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,940
The Champions Cheese Pizza,

909
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,340
the Mighty Mutant Macaroni and Cheese,

910
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,500
one of the supersonic shakes perhaps?

911
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,580
Well, I think I would have definitely gone

912
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,380
with a supersonic shake.

913
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,860
Yeah.

914
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,900
I was pretty into ordering from adult menus pretty early on.

915
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,980
Yeah, I was cool like that too.

916
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,820
Yeah.

917
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,540
Maybe would have tried something a little spicy.

918
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,900
One of the menu options, of course, that are spicy,

919
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,220
have the Human Torch next to them.

920
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,900
Yes, right.

921
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,940
Maybe I would have had a Stanwiches,

922
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,620
one of the Stanwiches or a superhero,

923
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,260
I mean, but it's superhero burgers,

924
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:35,220
like Captain America Burger, pretty vague.

925
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,300
Two Gun Kid Cheeseburger.

926
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,020
That's actually pretty specific.

927
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,300
One of my complaints was that it was too vague,

928
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,740
but yeah, the Two Gun Kid is,

929
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,500
that's the level of specificity I want,

930
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,660
but then the Iron Man Burger.

931
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,180
Well, like Calypso has, Calypso is an X-Men character.

932
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,300
The Calypso Linguini?

933
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,460
The Calypso Linguini.

934
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,540
Calypso is a very obscure character.

935
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,860
That's like the number 400th

936
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,460
on the most recognizable X-Men.

937
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,140
Maybe 300, 200?

938
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,220
She was in the cartoon,

939
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,340
the Morlocks show up in the cartoon.

940
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,060
A lot of people were in the cartoon though.

941
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,300
But Calypso has Linguini, which is wild,

942
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,100
like good for them for that,

943
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,660
because the other one is fantastic for cheese pasta.

944
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,780
Why not the Ben Grimm, the Thing cheese pasta?

945
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,260
Yeah.

946
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,820
There must have been a Calypso fan

947
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,460
who made this menu, is what I'm saying.

948
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,540
I mean, it should have been like

949
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,420
the Things Aunt Petunia's cheese pasta.

950
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,420
I want that level of specificity.

951
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,740
And I mentioned the Stan Witches.

952
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:42,980
Of course a nod to Marvel's great Stan Lee,

953
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,140
the late Stan Lee, but I want more of that.

954
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,780
I want more nods to Marvel talent.

955
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,340
So to start us off, I've made a-

956
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,140
So this is your, now you're gonna give us

957
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,140
some of your ideas for this new Marvel Mania,

958
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,500
is what you're saying, okay.

959
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,100
So I've made some drinks

960
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:06,140
named after multiple editors in chief of Marvel Comics.

961
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,740
Of the comics, so these are people

962
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,220
that worked on the editorial side.

963
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,140
They weren't even like the creatives.

964
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,660
They didn't write or anything.

965
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,620
They just made sure there were no spelling errors

966
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,420
in the Marvel Comics, and you wanna honor them.

967
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,260
I wanna honor them.

968
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,300
Some of them did write, like Jim Shooter,

969
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,300
the great Jim Shooter.

970
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,820
So obviously you want a little page of the drinks menu

971
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,260
to be Jim's Shooters.

972
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,780
Little shots, little fun.

973
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,860
Maniac editor Jim Shooter, who was like a wild man.

974
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,180
Yeah, I don't know if he's a mania, but like a wild man.

975
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,020
I think that's right.

976
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,940
I'm probably more known as an editor,

977
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,620
the first editor of Valiant, the Valiant 90s comics.

978
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,900
So you wanna honor him with some shots.

979
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,260
And his big work at Marvel, of course, was Secret Wars.

980
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,820
Secret Wars one and two.

981
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,860
So like you'd have the Beyonder,

982
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,220
which is pineapple vodka, mango rum,

983
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,580
and a little creme de coco float on top

984
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,940
that will make the whole thing white.

985
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,100
Like the Beyonder, of course a man

986
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,380
who wears an all white suit.

987
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,380
Kind of an all powerful god character.

988
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,620
So you made up the Beyonder too,

989
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,460
that's not from the menu?

990
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,300
Yeah, no, I made that up.

991
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,860
Okay, because that sounds good.

992
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,220
The Beyonder, I remember,

993
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,900
there's a card game called Overpower

994
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,180
that was like Magic the Gathering.

995
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,020
I'm sure we've talked about it before,

996
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,980
where you'd get characters.

997
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,060
And then I think the Beyonder was like all infinite symbols.

998
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,980
Yeah, the Beyonder is very powerful.

999
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,380
And then, but the Secret Wars shot,

1000
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,380
that's what you wanna drink if you're gonna get fucked up.

1001
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,420
This is like a Long Island iced tea in a shot.

1002
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,380
It's a double shot vodka, tequila, rum, gin,

1003
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,460
triple sec, sour mix, and a little coke on top.

1004
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,300
Hmm, you really put a lot of thought into this.

1005
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,420
I did, I did.

1006
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,620
We kept pushing back when we were going to do this

1007
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,060
because I really wanted to work on this.

1008
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,260
Because I was like, what's interesting is like

1009
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,660
when we talk about these segments,

1010
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,260
I will be like, oh yeah, you gotta come up

1011
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,580
with like a funny thing, whatever.

1012
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,740
You just like tried to think of a good menu.

1013
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,700
Yeah, I've got more, so.

1014
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,340
Go ahead, I mean, this seems like it's an earnest pitch.

1015
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,340
This seems like we're on a restaurant version of Shark Tank

1016
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,660
and you're really trying to impress people

1017
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,300
with like what would actually taste good.

1018
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,420
So I'm impressed.

1019
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,820
So Jim's Shooter, so that's its own little thing.

1020
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,300
Right. Because he's got a fun name.

1021
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,980
The rest of the Editor-in-Chiefs

1022
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,220
and the history of Marvel's editors-in-chiefs,

1023
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,380
God, it's such a weird plural.

1024
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,820
It's editors-in-chief is the plural,

1025
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,980
is kind of odd.

1026
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,120
Like there's been a number of them,

1027
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,540
but then for a brief time in the 80s,

1028
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,900
there was just a handful of executive editors.

1029
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,260
So there was like three head editors at once.

1030
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:33,860
So I didn't go down that whole rabbit hole.

1031
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,340
So to simplify this,

1032
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,340
this menu is all different variations

1033
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,900
of the classic Moscow mule.

1034
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,020
So the Tom DeFalco is the classic vodka in ginger beer.

1035
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,140
The Bob Harris is a variant gin in ginger beer.

1036
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,180
Joe Cassada is mezcal in ginger beer.

1037
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,780
Axel Alonso is tequila in ginger beer.

1038
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,460
And then current Marvel Editor-in-Chief,

1039
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,380
and C.B. Sapolsky is bourbon in ginger beer.

1040
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,140
But there's a secret menu option,

1041
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,800
and that's if you order the Akira Yoshida.

1042
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,340
That's the same drink,

1043
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,660
but it's Suntory Japanese whiskey instead of bourbon.

1044
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:12,660
Because C.B. Sapolsky famously invented a persona

1045
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,940
named Akira Yoshida to write Marvel comics

1046
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,680
in the early 2000s while he was an editor,

1047
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,760
because they had a policy

1048
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,860
where editors could not also be writers.

1049
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:26,060
So he pulled an amazing grift,

1050
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,340
and it's only fitting that in the era

1051
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,100
of our con man president,

1052
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:35,100
the editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics is a con artist

1053
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,020
who made up a man.

1054
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,100
Okay, yeah, so let's take a second.

1055
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,620
Okay, I think the listeners now have heard

1056
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,140
all the editors-in-chiefs of Marvel's names,

1057
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,100
and now are being, this is real, by the way.

1058
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,940
This is not a bit. This is real,

1059
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,700
and it's not talked about enough.

1060
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,060
It's very funny. Yes.

1061
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,380
The current editor-in-chief of Marvel

1062
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,060
basically created a fake Asian character

1063
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,580
to write under. Yes, to write.

1064
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,740
And to write Wolverine stories set in Japan.

1065
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,180
Right, so there was not only was the character

1066
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:09,460
not the same race of the actual person,

1067
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,260
he was using it to have authenticity

1068
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,220
when he was writing samurai stories.

1069
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,440
Yeah. Yeah, that's insane.

1070
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,300
That is a funny, weird, crazy story. Perfect for our modern era.

1071
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,860
That does, yeah, make a lot of sense now

1072
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,900
in the context of 2018 and 19.

1073
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,540
Yeah, and this isn't even touching

1074
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,740
on C.B. Sapolsky's autobiocomics,

1075
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:32,500
where it's mostly about him being a young man

1076
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,500
and being very horny.

1077
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,540
Do you know about these? I don't know anything

1078
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,420
about the C.B. Sapolsky's horny comics.

1079
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,540
I forget what they were called.

1080
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,820
They were put out by Image,

1081
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:46,820
and young man is horny is an alt-comics genre.

1082
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,140
What other famous horny comics?

1083
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:54,580
Jeffrey Brown, Joe Matt, Robert Crumb.

1084
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,300
There's a weird sexuality

1085
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,300
through a lot of Daniel Clouse's work.

1086
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,540
But most of those people write and draw their own stuff.

1087
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,360
C.B. Sapolsky is not an artist.

1088
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,380
So he had to get other people to draw the horny comics.

1089
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,620
Sure, but they got paid to draw his horny comics.

1090
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,220
Yeah, they did get paid.

1091
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,980
Well, that's good. Yeah.

1092
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,220
Were they upset about it? I'm not saying it's bad.

1093
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,180
I just think it's very funny.

1094
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,740
That the editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics

1095
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,580
is a very good talent scout.

1096
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,940
He's a good talent scout.

1097
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,420
People like him as an editor.

1098
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,260
But that he pulled this grift of Akira Yoshida,

1099
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,540
and that also was like in his spare time,

1100
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,140
was like writing horny comics.

1101
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,980
I don't know, look, I can't judge his horny comics

1102
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,220
until I've seen them.

1103
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,500
Yeah. Have you seen them?

1104
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,060
I've seen bits and pieces of them.

1105
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,460
We'll do a Patreon episode about his horny comics later.

1106
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,380
When Scott goes to Japan again in like a couple years,

1107
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,100
are you looking up his horny comics right now?

1108
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:53,940
Yeah.

1109
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,340
Well, I'm glad.

1110
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,740
I like that your pitch for the restaurant,

1111
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:02,020
you started with stuff named after the editors-in-chief.

1112
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,380
Named after the editors, because here's the thing.

1113
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,900
So you're gonna get to the part where you name things

1114
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,700
after Richard Starkings, the guy who would letter

1115
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,940
all the comics? The letterer?

1116
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,100
I mean, letterers and colorists are kind of like the-

1117
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,660
Unsung heroes. Unsung heroes.

1118
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,820
Especially the colorists.

1119
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,940
What was the colorist who did a lot of those X-Men

1120
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,180
when we were kids?

1121
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,260
You know what I'm talking about?

1122
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,700
I can't think of the name. Yeah, I can't remember.

1123
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,900
It was like a one word name maybe.

1124
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,660
Who colored like my favorite comic artist,

1125
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,900
Joe Madarrera's X-Men?

1126
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:38,900
Famous colorists, do-do-do colorists, uncanny X-Men.

1127
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,020
This is interesting for the audience to-

1128
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,780
Was it a guy or a studio?

1129
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,060
It might've been a studio.

1130
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,420
While you look that up, I have some other people

1131
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,660
I think we need to give nods to.

1132
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,820
These are food entrees.

1133
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,860
Again, a guy who I knew about as I was starting

1134
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,940
to become more aware of people behind the scenes

1135
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,940
at Marvel Comics.

1136
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,380
This dish is called the Bill James.

1137
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,280
Bill James, famously the head of Marvel Comics,

1138
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,140
helped pull them out of bankruptcy with Joe Cassata.

1139
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,740
This is a massive plate of barbecue.

1140
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,260
Just an upsetting amount of food.

1141
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,460
What is your rationale for having a barbecue dish with him?

1142
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,900
Okay, there's a reason.

1143
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,700
It starts very strong, it's very good.

1144
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,900
By the end of it, you are exhausted.

1145
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,900
Again, this is upsetting because he famously,

1146
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,420
by the end of his tenure at Marvel,

1147
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,740
everyone was like, well, I've had enough.

1148
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,580
Right, right, right.

1149
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,940
He was a very good huckster, he was a very good pitch man,

1150
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,380
very good personality huckster.

1151
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,220
Too much though.

1152
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,460
Too much though.

1153
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,100
So you'll have to literally stop the waitress

1154
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,820
from bringing over more food.

1155
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,620
Yeah, and they'll keep it calm.

1156
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,620
Oh, too much.

1157
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,060
Please, too much.

1158
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:51,820
But then I, of course, want to nod to Stanley as well.

1159
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,260
I don't think Stanwiches were enough.

1160
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,140
Because that is, on the original menu,

1161
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:00,380
there was a section called Stanwiches.

1162
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,220
Yeah.

1163
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,700
And you would have multiple different Stanwiches.

1164
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,540
That's real.

1165
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,540
It's gonna be hard for the listener, I think,

1166
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,940
to differentiate between these bits and the real stuff

1167
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,100
because they're interchangeable

1168
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,220
as much as it's absurd for the editors.

1169
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,460
Anyway, so I just want to make sure they know

1170
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,820
because I don't want them to be incorrect.

1171
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:20,100
Because then they're gonna go repeating something.

1172
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,940
They're gonna be like, well, did you know

1173
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,060
there was a Bill James barbecue?

1174
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,180
And somebody's gonna go, no, that's wrong.

1175
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,020
But they'll think, I wanted them to be sure

1176
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:27,860
when they go out in the world

1177
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,540
with all this amazing information.

1178
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,140
I'll make sure to sign my work.

1179
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,100
So all of the drinks so far have been me.

1180
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,260
The Bill James is mine.

1181
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,940
So this, I'm calling this Stan's fave.

1182
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,820
So I was like, I should find out

1183
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,780
what Stanley's favorite food is.

1184
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,980
And it should be on the menu.

1185
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,180
Is it like Walt Disney's favorite?

1186
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,460
Is it like chili or something?

1187
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,500
Or is it like diet custard?

1188
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,780
Well, let me answer.

1189
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:53,620
I went looking and I found an article

1190
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,420
about like a summary of a Reddit AMA he did.

1191
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,700
And someone asked him what his favorite food was.

1192
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,180
And his response was,

1193
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,660
I'm not really good at picking favorites.

1194
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,540
I like Italian if it has a good thick sauce,

1195
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,100
dot, dot, dot, and Chinese.

1196
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,980
So Stan's fave is a big bowl of lo mein

1197
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,220
covered in a good thick marinara sauce.

1198
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:21,180
A real tribute to Stan, getting his two faves in there.

1199
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,100
Well, that's nice.

1200
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,620
Yeah, I mean, it also sounds like

1201
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,500
those aren't really his fave.

1202
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,300
He just kind of had to answer, so he answered.

1203
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,860
But I like the tribute.

1204
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,700
Yeah.

1205
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,500
That's nice to tribute to him.

1206
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,740
Did you look up like Kirby

1207
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,660
or Steve Ditko's favorite food?

1208
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,820
No, I've sort of like, I kind of forgot about that.

1209
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:41,700
Much like Marvel's legacy kind of undersells them.

1210
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,180
Yeah, we didn't really hear about him growing up, you know?

1211
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,020
We just heard about Stan the Man.

1212
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,100
Stan the Man, yeah.

1213
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,780
Okay, so you've honored now, you've honored him.

1214
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,060
Bill James. Bill James.

1215
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,700
Stan. And a handful of editors.

1216
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,500
Not Jack or Steve.

1217
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,660
Jack obviously like the main guy.

1218
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:02,500
The whole thing doesn't happen without Jack Kirby.

1219
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,660
Well, I feel like, I mean, Ditko's kind of an enigma.

1220
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,940
So I really don't know what he ate.

1221
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,460
Kirby, I feel like, was probably sustenance eating.

1222
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,380
Kirby I could see being a big diet custard guy.

1223
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,100
Probably. From the war, you know,

1224
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,460
hard tack, he probably still loved hard tack.

1225
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,940
Yeah, yeah, he was always chomping on a big cigar.

1226
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,900
What's the meat you revealed to us on podcast

1227
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,140
or that you liked that we were shocked by?

1228
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,460
Scrapple? Scrapple.

1229
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,780
Oh, I mean, that's just kind of...

1230
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,580
Jack Kirby had to have been a big scrapple guy.

1231
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,820
Probably a big scrapple guy.

1232
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,100
Your diet in World War II veterans,

1233
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,940
probably very similar growing up is what I'm assuming.

1234
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,180
Well, maybe that's...

1235
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,940
I'll say that, okay, that's Jack.

1236
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,380
That's Jack. Scrapple.

1237
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,940
Scrapple. Plate of scrapple.

1238
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,540
Eggs, however you want it.

1239
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,020
And like really well done toast.

1240
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,460
Yeah, like a little burned.

1241
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,940
A little burned.

1242
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,260
So that's available all day.

1243
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,180
Okay, so have you honored any more?

1244
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:02,820
Do you want to honor just maybe some of the like,

1245
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,420
just like janitorial staff at Marvel or anything too

1246
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,180
before you're out of that section

1247
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,860
or are we stopping at the editors?

1248
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,180
I mean, that's all I had.

1249
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,660
I have different sections.

1250
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,260
Okay, that's that one section.

1251
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,100
Yeah. Okay.

1252
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,860
How many sections do you have?

1253
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,100
Oh my God.

1254
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,220
I've got six more.

1255
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,060
Six more?

1256
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,820
Yeah, we can go fast.

1257
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,100
My ideas, my, honestly, like, I was just like,

1258
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,140
I don't know, an onslaught breakfast,

1259
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:32,420
it's four eggs, four bacon, four sausage, four pancakes,

1260
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,300
hash browns, also roasted potatoes,

1261
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,540
four slices of toast.

1262
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,940
You know, it's an onslaught, it's a lot.

1263
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,780
So there you go.

1264
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,620
I like that a lot.

1265
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,460
That's my pitch on onslaught.

1266
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,300
Yeah, that's certainly a lot.

1267
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,140
Anyway, back to one of your,

1268
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,940
pick one of your segments, sections.

1269
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:49,580
Let's talk about like very now foods,

1270
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:52,140
kind of fashionable foods because again,

1271
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,660
the Marvel medium menu, it's late 90s, early 2000s.

1272
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,140
It's a lot of like TGI Fridays kind of crap,

1273
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,740
but tastes have changed since then.

1274
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:03,780
So how about Man Things avocado toast?

1275
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:05,580
Wait, wait, okay.

1276
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,820
So Man Thing is kind of just to fill in people

1277
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,540
because they might not know all of the things

1278
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,380
we're throwing on.

1279
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,420
Man Thing is basically Swamp Thing.

1280
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,260
Yeah.

1281
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,660
He's a rip off of Swamp Thing.

1282
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,500
Yeah.

1283
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,940
He's just like a monster, a swamp monster.

1284
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,100
Yeah, swamp elemental.

1285
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,180
So why does he have avocado toast?

1286
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,740
Just because he's, avocado is grown in the swamp.

1287
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,340
He's a green creature, he's an earthy creature.

1288
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,300
But wouldn't that be more of like a kale or like,

1289
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,060
avocado is like kind of a fruit.

1290
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:36,740
Well, there is, avocado toast often has like some arugula

1291
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,140
or some radishes on top.

1292
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:41,340
But like an arugula mix makes a lot more sense for me

1293
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,180
for Man Thing.

1294
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,060
I just think you missed the mark here.

1295
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,060
Your editor thinks perfect.

1296
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,700
I'm just saying the Man Thing,

1297
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,900
just you want something a little grittier,

1298
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,220
a little less flavorful, honestly.

1299
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,500
I mean, we're gonna have to keep moving

1300
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,900
or we're gonna need to put in a new memory card.

1301
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,900
Namor's Poke Bowl.

1302
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:57,740
Oh, that's perfect, obviously.

1303
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:58,740
Namor's Poke Bowl.

1304
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,100
Namor of course, Submariner, he's like,

1305
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,420
he was like the original superhero of Marvel,

1306
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,660
like Aquaman, but he's a bigger dick.

1307
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,380
Yes, and that's why the waiter has to read-

1308
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,900
He's a bigger dick, does not have one.

1309
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,740
I don't know about that.

1310
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:10,620
Anyway, continue.

1311
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,700
That's why the waiter has to read a very pompous declaration

1312
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,260
while he serves it to you,

1313
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,420
about surface dwellers destroying the sea

1314
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,820
and he'll get his vengeance.

1315
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,860
But then you have to eat fish after somebody's like,

1316
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:25,060
admonished you for eating fish and destroying the sea?

1317
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,900
Before and after.

1318
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:30,300
So like, he gives you, when the waiter drops it off,

1319
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,740
he yells at you and when the waiter

1320
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:35,020
takes your empty bowl away, he also scolds you.

1321
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:35,860
Okay, great.

1322
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:39,940
So it's like Ed DeBevix or, you know,

1323
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:42,300
one of those fun restaurants where you get yelled at.

1324
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,140
Yeah.

1325
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:43,980
Okay, that's good.

1326
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:46,180
I'm into that, all right, keep going.

1327
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:49,300
Some new, well, this one's a new character,

1328
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,100
or not that new, but more popular in recent years.

1329
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,340
Squirrel Girls Almond Milk Latte.

1330
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,060
Great, makes perfect sense.

1331
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,620
Squirrels Love Nuts.

1332
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,620
And then another thing, you know, chicken and waffles,

1333
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:06,100
I feel like is on a lot of menus now at a lot of places.

1334
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,340
This is a variant of that.

1335
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:11,460
It's Aunt May's Wheat Cakes, served with fried chicken.

1336
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,020
I am assuming Uncle Ben's famous recipe for fried chicken

1337
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,940
probably learned how to cook it in the war.

1338
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:19,820
Is we, that's a canon food, is it not?

1339
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:20,660
That is canon.

1340
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,220
She was constantly serving Peter Parker wheat cakes.

1341
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,460
See, that's what I like.

1342
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,140
I like having the food that the people,

1343
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,060
the characters have.

1344
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,820
Like I want to have the tea Earl Grey hot,

1345
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:34,260
like Picard on a Star Trek in a hotel.

1346
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,420
Like I want that, so that's good, I like that a lot.

1347
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,900
Great, let's jump to the 90s style gym menu.

1348
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,500
Because here's my theory with Marvel.

1349
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,220
Like yeah, we're gonna, people are gonna

1350
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,940
burn out on Marvel movies eventually.

1351
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,860
They're already a little cool on Star Wars right now.

1352
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,940
People love Star Wars, but like it was a lot too fast.

1353
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:56,260
So you gotta reach out to people like me and Mike,

1354
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,540
the older millennials with a little disposable income

1355
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,820
for entertainment.

1356
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:04,500
And let's give some of that 90s flair, baby.

1357
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,900
So this is my tribute to some of the newer X-Men created

1358
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,580
in the mid to late 90s.

1359
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,780
This is good, I like where this is headed.

1360
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,460
Marrow's Marrow.

1361
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,780
Okay, so.

1362
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,620
Yeah.

1363
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,460
Oh sorry, so I assume it's bone marrow.

1364
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,420
It's bone marrow, it's bone marrow served with

1365
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,980
grilled bread and sea salt.

1366
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,260
Traditional serving of bone marrow.

1367
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,380
So let me fill in here.

1368
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:30,860
So Marrow is a character who is a morlock who could,

1369
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,100
her power was that she could pull her own bones

1370
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,060
out of her body.

1371
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,740
Well extra bones.

1372
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,220
Yeah, but she would like grow them.

1373
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,900
Yeah, she would grow them and they would usually

1374
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,220
be in the shape of daggers or swords.

1375
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,220
Yeah, so she then would like stab you with her bones.

1376
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:48,020
She would pull a bone out of her leg and then stab you

1377
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,500
with her leg bone, her extra leg bone.

1378
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,260
I didn't hate, people hated Marrow.

1379
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,620
I don't hate Marrow.

1380
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,900
One time she stabbed Wolverine right through the throat.

1381
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,340
That's like the most iconic Marrow image I can think of.

1382
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,220
So that makes a lot of sense.

1383
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,060
All right, next one.

1384
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,820
She joined the X-Men with a few other characters.

1385
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,060
Like Maggot.

1386
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:07,900
Yes.

1387
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:08,740
Famously beloved.

1388
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,060
I have talked a little bit about on Screen Junkies,

1389
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,900
I think it was at a Comic Con, I talked about Maggot.

1390
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,220
And Maggot was created by Joe Matarera,

1391
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,940
who was my favorite artist growing up as a kid.

1392
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:23,980
And Maggot had two maggots that were his digestive system.

1393
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:28,220
He had two metal maggots that would come out of his body

1394
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,740
and eat anything and that was his power.

1395
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,500
Well, he would throw it at people and they would eat it.

1396
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,100
And then later on they revealed,

1397
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,940
yeah, it was his digestive system.

1398
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,020
So it was like a, so we couldn't eat food.

1399
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,340
The maggots had to eat for.

1400
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,900
The maggots had to eat for him.

1401
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,300
He would throw metal maggots at you.

1402
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,700
They would eat you or something else.

1403
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:50,060
And then he would get nutrients from that.

1404
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,660
Yeah, and was kind of introduced as like a character

1405
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,300
with a cool design and a mysterious backstory.

1406
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,140
Yes.

1407
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,300
And then eventually turned on a dime

1408
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,260
to be a very tragic figure who couldn't eat food.

1409
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,020
Yeah, that part, that bums me out.

1410
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,900
I loved Maggot when he debuted.

1411
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:05,740
I did too.

1412
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,580
I was way into Maggot and I didn't understand

1413
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,780
people hating on him and I still don't.

1414
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,980
Cause the guy throwing metal maggots at you

1415
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:15,220
that are his intestines essentially, cool.

1416
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:18,820
Yeah, and who else did they debut around the same time?

1417
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,500
Dr. Celia Rise.

1418
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,460
Now, yes, these are all in the same era.

1419
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:28,460
Yeah, all around the same like 96, 97 Marvel era.

1420
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:30,300
And you will have to refresh me.

1421
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,860
What is her power again?

1422
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,700
So her power is she kind of has like

1423
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,180
a protective force field around her.

1424
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,420
And she was always really put out to use it.

1425
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,180
Like she was. She was very boring.

1426
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,180
Am I wrong?

1427
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:46,660
She was a very reticent to join the X-Men.

1428
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:47,500
Yeah, so what?

1429
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,340
She was a doctor.

1430
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,540
She was like a trained doctor.

1431
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,100
I did not connect with her at all.

1432
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,260
I liked Mero, I liked Maggot.

1433
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:56,500
Dr. Cecilia Rise, not as interested in.

1434
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:01,180
So, and I don't know how big of a hit this is gonna be.

1435
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:06,100
She, her, the Dr. Cecilia Rise's heart healthy stir fry.

1436
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,300
Shield your heart with the Dr. Cecilia Rise's

1437
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,500
heart healthy stir fry.

1438
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,140
We need something for people a little more dietary conscious.

1439
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:14,980
I get you.

1440
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,420
I'm just like, it's not my favorite character.

1441
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,300
So I'm not gonna order it.

1442
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,700
Cause I like to order stuff that my favorites would want.

1443
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,580
And then finally the Dark Hawk.

1444
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,660
Who was Dark Hawk again?

1445
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:28,540
Dark Hawk was a character who was powered by like a crystal.

1446
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:31,580
He had like a big suit of armor and a claw

1447
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,300
that he would shoot on a rope.

1448
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:38,300
It was a very early 90s attempt to do like an extreme

1449
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,100
image kind of guy.

1450
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,940
Oh yeah, I'm looking at this.

1451
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:43,380
I think there was a nightmare dimension involved.

1452
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:48,380
This dish though is a quail pan seared with its juices.

1453
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:51,220
Wild rice and roasted carrots.

1454
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,100
Quail, have you ever had quail before?

1455
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:53,940
I think I have.

1456
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,860
I think I've had some game birds before.

1457
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,660
Wow, I don't think I've ever had quail.

1458
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:58,860
That's crazy to me.

1459
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,100
I don't know why that might be ignorant.

1460
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:04,100
Yeah, Dark Hawk, pretty generic is my memory of this.

1461
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,580
Yeah, kind of a generic, a kind of a Dark Hawk quasar,

1462
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,860
kind of easy dollar bin finds when I was reading comics.

1463
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,900
So was this the end of section two?

1464
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:12,980
Yeah.

1465
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:15,780
So section three is sort of more obscure characters

1466
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:19,100
in line with the Calypso linguine.

1467
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,220
You've got the Howard the Duck, A la Ronge.

1468
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,060
All right, that's great.

1469
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:22,880
Everyone knows Howard.

1470
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,720
They love him.

1471
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,940
Yeah, great.

1472
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,380
Very fair comment.

1473
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:27,820
Keep him coming.

1474
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,620
D-Man's Pork and Beans.

1475
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:30,460
All right, so D-Man.

1476
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:34,140
So D-Man is famously summed up as the homeless superhero.

1477
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,420
D-Man is like, it seems problematic now that I say

1478
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,220
I hear that said out loud,

1479
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,780
because I believe the joke in that Kurt Busick Avengers

1480
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,780
is like D-Man smells.

1481
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,220
Well, and his costume is like an old Daredevil costume

1482
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:47,740
he found in a garbage can.

1483
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:49,520
Yeah, like that part is funny,

1484
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,740
but the implication that he's homeless is kind of a bummer.

1485
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,260
Yeah, yeah.

1486
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,420
And now that I'm thinking about it, I was like,

1487
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:58,460
I don't know, maybe that's not so funny.

1488
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:59,860
Maybe that's not such a.

1489
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:02,900
His dish is a Pork and Beans served in an old boot.

1490
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,180
Yes.

1491
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:06,860
Not funny.

1492
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,100
So a little more whimsical.

1493
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,340
I went a little more whimsical.

1494
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,160
That's fine.

1495
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,060
I think that's, you would order that.

1496
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,900
Oh yeah, sure.

1497
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,460
Well, I want that souvenir old boot.

1498
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,580
Souvenir old boot, the D-Man boot.

1499
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,540
I don't want to forget desserts.

1500
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,700
So on the dessert menu,

1501
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,660
you can order the Paste Pot Pete Pudding Parfait.

1502
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:28,940
Paste Pot Pete, I believe mostly a Fantastic Four villain.

1503
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,460
He was a big paste pot man

1504
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,940
who shot paste out of a paste gun.

1505
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,820
So he was like a glue, he would shoot glue.

1506
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,060
He was glue-thieved.

1507
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,420
He was a glue bad guy.

1508
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,920
That is real also.

1509
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,820
That is not made up.

1510
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:47,340
And then again, another more, a newer character

1511
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,700
because introduced in the last few years,

1512
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:54,420
Ms. Marvel's doll, D-H-A-L,

1513
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:59,420
a Pakistani dish of lentils often served with rice or naan.

1514
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,140
What character is this?

1515
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,300
Ms. Marvel, Kamala Khan.

1516
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,540
Oh, I thought you said Ms. Marvel's doll.

1517
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,620
Like she had a doll that she carried around.

1518
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,420
Oh no, I can see, yes, that could be confusing.

1519
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:11,260
Yes, I know the new Ms. Marvel.

1520
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:14,100
So this is a tribute to Kamala Khan.

1521
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,260
I believe a huge hit digitally

1522
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,060
and in collections, the Ms. Marvel.

1523
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,940
That's great, I actually have never read it.

1524
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,860
Yeah, so that's the end of the sort of

1525
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,460
more obscure character section.

1526
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:25,300
Okay.

1527
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,300
Add-ons, you know.

1528
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,140
So this is like an.

1529
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:32,340
So this is like add-ons to your meal.

1530
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:35,820
Okay, so like sides, you could also call it, right?

1531
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:38,180
Well, sort of preparation additions, like bacon.

1532
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:40,340
You add, most restaurants like add bacon.

1533
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,500
So like avocado also is something.

1534
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,780
Okay, and sauces like this.

1535
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,860
So this is when I go to Taco Bell

1536
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,020
and I'm choosing on the app because I love the app.

1537
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,540
All that stuff, different sauces and stuff and all that.

1538
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,060
But for today's dining experience,

1539
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:55,100
you've chosen to make Marvel yours.

1540
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,740
So you don't say, can I add bacon to that burger?

1541
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,820
Can I add bacon to that thing?

1542
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:02,260
You say guest starring Wolverine.

1543
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,020
Because Wolverine could show up at anything,

1544
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,860
just like you could add bacon to anything.

1545
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,820
So if you want bacon, you say guest starring Wolverine.

1546
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:10,900
Yeah, and the bacon has a little maple glaze

1547
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,100
as a nod to his Canadian heritage.

1548
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,820
So then you would say, so I would say,

1549
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:18,540
I want the Calypso linguine, guest starring Wolverine.

1550
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,140
Guest starring Wolverine, yeah.

1551
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,420
And you would say, now, would it be so rigid

1552
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:25,260
that the waiter or waitress would not acknowledge it

1553
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,820
if you said just put some bacon on it?

1554
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,020
I think you should.

1555
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:29,860
You think you should stick?

1556
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:30,700
I think you should.

1557
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,900
Can you imagine dads across America,

1558
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,700
if this was obviously a franchise,

1559
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,460
when it would be like, I just want some goddamn bacon.

1560
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,100
And it's like, well, here's,

1561
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,100
let me show you what you're supposed to say.

1562
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:43,420
And then it's like, guest starring Wolverine.

1563
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,340
The Captain America burger, guest starring Wolverine.

1564
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,900
I think you're fooling yourself.

1565
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,060
That's a blue sky idea that would go away

1566
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,620
after a week of operation.

1567
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,700
Okay, well, at least it can be on the menu.

1568
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,780
It can be on the menu, you say it,

1569
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,300
but it's gonna be like Andy's coming or something,

1570
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,140
something that people like, but it goes away

1571
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,220
because it just doesn't make sense.

1572
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:04,060
Well, if it survives as an urban legend, that's fine.

1573
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,740
And then for a minor upcharge,

1574
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:08,540
you can have any steak, fish, or chicken entree

1575
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:11,700
cooked on an oak plank that looks like Groot.

1576
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,340
That's just a- Oh my God, wait a minute.

1577
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,180
Yeah.

1578
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,260
You're cooking meal on Groot?

1579
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,100
On Groot, yeah.

1580
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,420
That's horrifying.

1581
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,740
But you add an extra layer of flavor

1582
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,420
if you cook stuff on wood.

1583
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,460
Or on a person or on a character.

1584
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:30,380
Yeah, but I mean, he's sacrificing himself for flavor.

1585
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,980
In the narrative of this,

1586
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:35,220
is he alive while he's being cooked on?

1587
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,340
Or is he going like, help me while it's happening?

1588
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:39,940
No, I think he's being helpful.

1589
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:40,780
He's dead.

1590
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:41,900
Well- Oh no, he's not dead.

1591
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,740
He's alive, but he's loving it.

1592
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,340
I don't know, I didn't really consider this.

1593
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:45,660
I think he's loving it.

1594
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:49,380
So he is like 400 degrees.

1595
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,740
He's loving it because he's making you happy

1596
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:52,860
with your food.

1597
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:53,700
Yeah.

1598
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,900
Okay, so he's saying, I am Groot.

1599
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,860
He's being helpful.

1600
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:58,180
I am Groot, but he's like, I am Groot.

1601
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,700
He's not going, I'm Groot.

1602
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:00,540
Yeah.

1603
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,380
Okay.

1604
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:05,420
I may say that's a bad idea, but I'll allow it.

1605
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,380
Again, Blue Sky, first week, we'll see

1606
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,020
if any kid is horrified by it.

1607
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,220
Adivine, it's not essential.

1608
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:12,700
Let's talk about TV and movie inspired dishes.

1609
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:15,620
I mean, the first one's a given, an Avenger's Swarma.

1610
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:16,440
Swarma.

1611
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,280
Swarma, excuse me.

1612
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,520
That's given though, right?

1613
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,360
They talk about Swarma in the first movie.

1614
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,760
Yes, I mean, that has to happen.

1615
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,640
It was a joke in the first movie

1616
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,640
because it's a funny sounding word

1617
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,880
and they're in New York where there's a lot of Swarma places.

1618
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,720
And the callback that they shot after the premiere famously.

1619
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,800
They shot after the, yeah.

1620
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,640
Chris Evans in that scene is holding his hand over his face

1621
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,720
because he's got a big beard.

1622
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,800
Does he have a beard, yeah.

1623
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,120
Yeah, he's shooting another movie.

1624
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,600
Maybe Snowpiercer?

1625
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,440
Maybe.

1626
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,760
Yeah, good movie, Snowpiercer.

1627
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,600
Yeah.

1628
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,440
Anyway.

1629
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,680
Jessica Jones, another character invented

1630
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,320
after the Marvel Mania restaurant closed.

1631
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,840
We're right around.

1632
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,920
I'm not sure the timing on that.

1633
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:00,640
Jessica Jones, but a very popular Netflix streaming show.

1634
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,720
The Jessica Jones is a slice of cold pizza,

1635
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,300
a cup of black coffee with bourbon in it and a cigarette.

1636
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:12,040
So there'll be one, you can order a cigarette.

1637
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:15,360
Can you get an a la carte cigarette at Marvel Mania?

1638
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,440
Or does it just have to come with this Jessica Jones meal?

1639
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,200
Hmm, that's a good question.

1640
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:24,600
Is that an additional add-on that you buy a Lucy cigarette?

1641
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,120
Oh, it's an e-cigarette.

1642
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,760
No, Lucy is what you call a single cigarette.

1643
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,280
Oh, I thought you said a loose e-cigarette.

1644
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,560
Oh, a loose e-cigarette.

1645
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,360
So Lucy, I actually don't know that term though.

1646
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:37,320
Oh, Lucy, you go to the bodega to buy Lucy?

1647
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,160
I've never heard of it.

1648
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,000
Buy single cigarettes, okay.

1649
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,320
So that just means it doesn't mean it's not a brand.

1650
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,040
No, no, it's just a loose cigarette.

1651
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,720
Is it named after Lucille Ball?

1652
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,000
No, like L-O-O-S-E-Y.

1653
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:48,840
Oh, a Lucy.

1654
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,000
Like it's loose, yeah.

1655
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,400
With a Y, it's like Lucy Goosey.

1656
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,600
It's a lot of homonyms today.

1657
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,640
Really throwing us for a curve ball.

1658
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,600
Yeah, I know that.

1659
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,760
You call it a Lucy.

1660
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,600
Yeah.

1661
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,320
So okay, when I see a bathroom attendant,

1662
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,560
I'll ask him for a Lucy.

1663
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,400
No.

1664
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,220
Hey buddy, can I get a Lucy?

1665
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,200
Can I get a Lucy?

1666
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,960
That sounds like he's gonna jerk you off.

1667
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,560
Well, that's not this restaurant.

1668
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,920
I don't smoke also.

1669
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:10,760
You're not getting that.

1670
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,320
Hey buddy, can I get a Lucy?

1671
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,240
Legion, popular show on FX.

1672
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,080
Legion, yes.

1673
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,920
Legion, the son of Charles Xavier.

1674
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:18,760
Yes.

1675
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:23,760
Multiple personalities, kind of crazy superhero.

1676
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,640
Legion's crazy appetizer sampler.

1677
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:31,280
Potato skins, mozzarella sticks, chicken wings,

1678
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,080
and a chocolate lava cake.

1679
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,240
The chocolate lava cake is the crazy part

1680
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,760
because that's not an appetizer.

1681
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,600
That doesn't belong there.

1682
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,400
I think this is not crazy enough.

1683
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,520
If you've seen Legion,

1684
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,000
he's constantly shifting back and forth

1685
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,120
between times and realities.

1686
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,540
You need to go, I think you gotta push this farther.

1687
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,720
I think this has to be.

1688
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,520
Okay, good note, good note.

1689
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:55,520
I'm just saying let's have it be like pudding,

1690
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,400
a piece of chocolate cake,

1691
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:02,080
some beef jerky maybe.

1692
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:02,920
That's great.

1693
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,560
Yeah, maybe it's a whole production

1694
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,240
and it comes out at different times.

1695
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,760
And then it's just vitamins,

1696
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,560
just a bunch of B vitamins or something.

1697
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,480
They throw at you.

1698
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,320
They throw a handful.

1699
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,480
They throw at you, yeah, that's good too.

1700
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:17,920
And then, yeah, let's just say those four.

1701
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,880
And there's, so there's gotta be a full,

1702
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,880
there's gotta be a full Deadpool sub menu, right?

1703
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,960
Yeah, well there's gotta be a Deadpool room too, I think.

1704
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,400
There's certainly a Deadpool room.

1705
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,180
That's for the adults to have a party.

1706
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:32,020
Sure.

1707
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,360
To go in and get a Lucy.

1708
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,200
I mean.

1709
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,520
Deadpool, can I get a Lucy, buddy?

1710
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,820
Yeah, that is okay.

1711
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,660
That's the smoking section.

1712
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:41,660
You can smoke in the Deadpool room.

1713
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,860
So if you order the Jessica Jones,

1714
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,100
you can order it anywhere,

1715
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:47,500
but you have to enjoy the cigarette outside

1716
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,500
or in the Deadpool room.

1717
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,060
Of course, yeah.

1718
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:53,180
I guess I'll have chimichangas or some other crap.

1719
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:54,020
It's gotta be.

1720
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:54,860
I haven't really kept up with that.

1721
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:55,680
Okay, well.

1722
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,520
Or Deadpool.

1723
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,420
So that's it?

1724
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:01,500
I mean, that's, is that it for the menus?

1725
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:02,340
Yeah.

1726
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,980
Well, you know, this is a nicer pl...

1727
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:09,260
I think we should need to go to a nicer caliber restaurant

1728
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,540
because, you know, one thing about these plates

1729
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:14,240
that I've ordered, you wanna eat on a white plate.

1730
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:19,240
Like, unless it's like a special thing where you order,

1731
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,980
you know, comes in a special dish,

1732
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,660
I think this is a higher caliber restaurant.

1733
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,700
Overall, or there's a section of it?

1734
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,540
Okay.

1735
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:29,460
And higher caliber restaurants,

1736
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,140
like our beloved Tam O'Shanter,

1737
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,620
they have different like wine nights or whiskey nights,

1738
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:38,460
where people like, it's a special prefix menu

1739
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:42,420
and they paired, each course is paired with something.

1740
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:45,060
So what do we do at Marvel Mania?

1741
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:48,980
We do nights themed to the short-lived publishers

1742
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,760
that as they were going under,

1743
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,760
Marvel purchased the intellectual property of.

1744
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,740
So you have an ultra-verse night.

1745
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:58,300
You have a cross-gen night

1746
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:02,800
where you get limited run items based on like Prime.

1747
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,120
This is the high-end stuff?

1748
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,840
Is these publishers the one in the business?

1749
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:10,840
This is short, limited time only, like one night only.

1750
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,900
This feels like this may be the most alienating episode

1751
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,120
of the podcast we've ever done.

1752
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,480
Yeah, probably.

1753
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,840
People are like, cross-gen?

1754
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,200
I don't know, is this a ride?

1755
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,720
So yeah, these are all publishers.

1756
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,840
This is again, for real, publishers went out

1757
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,920
and Marvel would just buy their intellectual property

1758
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,160
because it was so dirt cheap.

1759
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,120
Yeah, and usually haven't really been reissued

1760
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,720
in collections or ways you could get ahold of.

1761
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,480
I believe ultra-verse slash Malibu, as it was later called,

1762
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:43,120
I think had creator profit sharing involved.

1763
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,440
So they reissued those.

1764
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,480
They'd have to pay the creators a lot more money

1765
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,000
than usual royalties.

1766
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,600
Cross-gen, I think kind of work for hire

1767
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,680
kind of creator involved.

1768
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:58,240
They've done some of the Mark Wade Ruse comic.

1769
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,800
They've done some more miniseries.

1770
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,760
But a little complicated with the rights issues.

1771
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,640
But for one night only, seems very special.

1772
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,520
It's very special for like two people.

1773
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,600
Yeah, well, I think you could come up

1774
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,040
with more than two people.

1775
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,680
I mean, you set this in a major metropolitan area.

1776
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,200
There's a lot of comic stores in LA,

1777
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,320
a lot in New York, a lot in Chicago.

1778
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,240
You can draw.

1779
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,000
My childhood comic store closed.

1780
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,640
So did mine.

1781
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,480
The last year.

1782
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,000
Mine was in a mall that got demolished.

1783
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,600
It's so tragic.

1784
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,280
Mine was just, I don't know,

1785
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,960
it just, I think went out of business.

1786
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:33,800
It's sad though.

1787
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:34,920
Yeah.

1788
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:39,040
So that's my, I mean, that's my elevator pitch.

1789
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,960
That's my hour long elevator pitch.

1790
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,760
I will say here, most of my ideas are

1791
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:48,000
like that onslaught breakfast, which are all great.

1792
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,200
There's a series that's coming out now on,

1793
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,400
excuse me, Disney Plus called What If.

1794
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,440
Yeah.

1795
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,800
And I just think it would be fun

1796
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,720
because What If is about imagining a universe

1797
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,840
where stuff didn't happen like we thought it happened.

1798
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,680
Yeah.

1799
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,680
It's about the first episode of this new What If series

1800
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:09,280
is gonna be like, what if Peggy Carter was Captain America

1801
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,000
and Steve Rogers was in Peggy's role essentially, I think.

1802
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,280
So we're taking what we know

1803
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,120
and we're turning it on its head.

1804
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:21,080
I think you could do a What If night at Marvel Mania

1805
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,120
where things aren't exactly as they seem.

1806
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,600
So you maybe eat your dessert before dinner.

1807
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,440
Nice.

1808
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,280
You know what I'm saying?

1809
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,600
What if a hamburger was on a hot dog bun?

1810
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,440
Can you imagine what that would be like?

1811
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,600
And what if you got a drink

1812
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,680
and you poured it in your hands and not a cup?

1813
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,520
I like that.

1814
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:40,040
I mean, we have a mixing glass.

1815
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:40,880
We can get a mixing glass.

1816
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:41,720
Well, no, we don't need the glass.

1817
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:42,560
This is What If.

1818
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:45,440
You're living in, you're now getting to experience a universe.

1819
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,960
Oh wait, so they're rolling over or bringing over like

1820
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,800
whiskey, mixer, ice.

1821
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,280
What is your order?

1822
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:57,280
You'll say, I want a Bishop, X-Man Bishop's whiskey please.

1823
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,960
They will go over to the bar.

1824
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,880
The bartender will mix it in his hands.

1825
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,000
He will cup his hands, give it to the waiter

1826
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,680
into their hands, come over to you

1827
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,280
and dump it in your hands

1828
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,640
and you will sip from your own hands

1829
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,000
because this is a What If universe.

1830
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,360
What if it was like that?

1831
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,240
And now we're getting to experience it.

1832
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,160
Now we're getting to see what a different universe

1833
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:19,980
would be like.

1834
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,880
I mean, Bishop is coming back from like a dystopian future

1835
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,640
and he was kind of like beat up in age of apocalypse.

1836
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,920
There's no need to rationalize Bishop.

1837
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:27,760
No justification?

1838
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,720
I'm just saying what if is the issue here.

1839
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,880
Yeah, no, that's right.

1840
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,200
I'm saying anyone's drink.

1841
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,920
I was trying to compliment you.

1842
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,520
No, no, no, I don't want to compliment.

1843
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,640
I don't eat a cat.

1844
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,520
I feel like you were skeptical of some of mine

1845
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,000
and you're already leading with

1846
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,680
what if people are pouring spirits into your cup.

1847
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:47,520
But mine is so much fun.

1848
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,320
That's the difference obviously.

1849
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:53,320
Okay, so what if you ate at chairs instead of a table?

1850
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,360
Okay.

1851
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,720
So you're gonna sit,

1852
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:59,120
everyone gets four tables to sit on

1853
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,720
and then you have a chair in the middle

1854
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,160
and you put all the food there.

1855
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:07,560
So you're getting to experience what if a universe existed

1856
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:10,800
where you didn't eat at a table, you sat on a table.

1857
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,720
Okay?

1858
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,540
This is again, this is different night.

1859
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:16,240
This is a different way to experience the Marvel universe.

1860
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,480
Because after you get this what if show,

1861
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,040
people are gonna start speculating on different,

1862
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,880
you know, multiverses and whatever.

1863
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,800
And the last one I have,

1864
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,800
what if you were the waiter and not the customer?

1865
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,640
That's great.

1866
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:30,800
So you come in and then all of a sudden

1867
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,820
they put an apron on you and they give you a little book

1868
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,320
and they go over there

1869
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,840
and there's a bunch of waiters sitting down

1870
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,720
and you go over to them and you take the waiter's orders.

1871
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,760
Yeah, I love that.

1872
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,460
I think you can even have like,

1873
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:47,960
so many comic book characters got their powers

1874
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,060
or abilities from an accident.

1875
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,400
If they like you step into the restaurant

1876
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,080
and they're like, oh no.

1877
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,680
And there's like lights and sound effects.

1878
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,620
It's like, you're the waiter now.

1879
01:08:58,620 --> 01:08:59,600
Yeah, you're the waiter.

1880
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,440
That's great.

1881
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,320
Cause here's the thing.

1882
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,100
Like we have a lot of lofty ideas,

1883
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,400
but this is a restaurant and obviously

1884
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:08,680
they're gonna only be able to run on a small budget probably.

1885
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,820
They're probably on a pizza riso budget.

1886
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:11,720
Let's be honest.

1887
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:14,160
So all of these are things you could do.

1888
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:17,300
I'm not saying we need to have like a crazy electrical storm.

1889
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,360
I'm not saying you need to like ever run anybody

1890
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,040
dressed in elaborate costumes.

1891
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,600
These are practical and most importantly,

1892
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,360
very fun ways to eat a meal.

1893
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,200
This is great.

1894
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,100
Cause I've got like blue sky stuff

1895
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,480
that'll probably get simplified.

1896
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,400
You've got very practical pragmatic solutions.

1897
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,920
Yes.

1898
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,920
Also there'll be an age of apocalypse menu.

1899
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,960
That's the same exact menu,

1900
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,680
but like it's like dressed up a different way.

1901
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,360
Is it dressed up or is it a little more fucked up?

1902
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,520
It's also, the food's a day old.

1903
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,520
Oh, okay. That's great.

1904
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,200
So age of apocalypse, like food is like,

1905
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,640
so it looks a little old.

1906
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:52,480
It looks a little weird.

1907
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,400
Yeah. Little, little hard worn.

1908
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,240
Yeah. Hard worn.

1909
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:58,600
Yeah. Cause that cause age of apocalypse was a crossover

1910
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:02,520
in the nineties where Legion, right?

1911
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:05,080
Yeah. Legion kills his father.

1912
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,880
Well, he accidentally, he goes back in time to kill Magneto.

1913
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:08,720
Yeah.

1914
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:09,920
But he, he, oh, whoops.

1915
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,280
I killed my own father.

1916
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:15,400
Because professor X being a hero jumped in front of like

1917
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:18,520
the energy blast or the psychic sword or whatever.

1918
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,000
And because professor X wasn't there,

1919
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,280
then the mutant villain apocalypse rose to power.

1920
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,800
And it was like a very crazy dystopian future.

1921
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,640
And then like, really the big difference was everyone had

1922
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,800
like more cloaks.

1923
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,840
I feel like everyone was wearing cloaks.

1924
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,040
Everyone had a lot of cloaks and was a little sexier.

1925
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,560
Everyone was a little sexier.

1926
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,240
Cause it's dangerous. Gambit had his own team.

1927
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,280
Gambit had his own team.

1928
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,200
It was Gambit and the Externals.

1929
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,200
Yes. That was the name.

1930
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,040
I would love to do a Gambit and the Externals.

1931
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,840
They were trying to get the M. Kron crystal.

1932
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,920
Yes. They were doing a heist.

1933
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,560
Yes. The M. Kron crystal should be some sort of candy

1934
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,320
as well somewhere.

1935
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:56,640
There should be like an M. Kron crystal or, or a drink

1936
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,320
or yeah, like a shaped ice, like a shaped ice.

1937
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,160
Oh, shaped ice.

1938
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,440
Like at the Carthay.

1939
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,000
There should be an M. Kron crystal in like a drink.

1940
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,400
Yeah. So there should be a She-R.

1941
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,760
She-R is the alien race from X-Men.

1942
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:08,600
Yeah.

1943
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,480
And the M. Kron crystal is what?

1944
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,840
The Phoenix? It ties into the Phoenix saga, right?

1945
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:14,680
Ties into, yeah.

1946
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,680
It's kind of an all powerful non-sequitur,

1947
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,520
like the ultimate nullifier or the infinity gauntlet.

1948
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,360
Yeah.

1949
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,640
You definitely need a drink called the ultimate nullifier.

1950
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,800
That's another thing that'll get you fucked up.

1951
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,520
Yeah. So there's going to be a lot of drinks

1952
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,680
that'll get you real fucked up at this place.

1953
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:31,240
This Marvel mania, what's, here,

1954
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,840
I'll make this point real quick.

1955
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:37,240
I don't think there will be anything this fun

1956
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:40,080
at that new Marvel and in California adventure.

1957
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,120
No. And that, that, that is a thing we've talked about

1958
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,080
before with like the Marvel movies,

1959
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,960
like at their best, they're very fun,

1960
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,280
but at their worst, they're a little stiff

1961
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:53,400
or a little too, a little too conservative

1962
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,880
in the Marvel they're throwing at you.

1963
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,360
Now I like with the introduction of magic

1964
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,760
and the Kree and Skrull and all this stuff.

1965
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,320
Yeah, that stuff's all great.

1966
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,560
Getting a little more weird,

1967
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,720
a little bit of that great Marvel character.

1968
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,680
I just mean, I'm not even saying anything about the movies.

1969
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,240
I'm just saying, and I know that supposedly

1970
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,440
there's an Ant-Man microbrewery, which is fun.

1971
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,280
That's fun.

1972
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,920
So I have to give them credit for that.

1973
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:16,160
But just the look of everything in the new land,

1974
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,160
I do feel like you're not going to get

1975
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:21,120
fin, fang, fume, fruit fajitas,

1976
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,160
which is a real item on this menu.

1977
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,000
Yes.

1978
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
That like, I want like that's insane.

1979
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,600
Blastar, who is a weird Marvel character

1980
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,440
that I don't even remember.

1981
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,240
A fantastic four bad guy.

1982
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:36,360
His Blastar's ballistic Butterfinger bread pudding

1983
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,400
is a real menu item on this old menu.

1984
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:43,400
Like I want to get insane and like get so niche and weird

1985
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,880
with like stuff and menu items.

1986
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,600
But I think they're going to mostly pull from the movies.

1987
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,560
Well, that feels very like, I don't think it's a,

1988
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,560
I think you can safely say that Butterfinger

1989
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:56,600
was the candy bar of the nineties, right?

1990
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,080
Bart Simpson sold it.

1991
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,520
It was extreme.

1992
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,640
It was very extreme.

1993
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,460
It gets stuck.

1994
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,640
I love Butterfinger.

1995
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,600
I don't need a lot of it though.

1996
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,480
No, absolutely not.

1997
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,280
And they just reintroduced it.

1998
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,240
The small ones are good.

1999
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,680
They say they have a new recipe now.

2000
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,000
I don't think it's as good.

2001
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,160
Will it not stick in your teeth?

2002
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,200
What is the difference in the recipe?

2003
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,240
It just tasted a little less artificial

2004
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,280
and I think that's a bad.

2005
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,840
It didn't really taste peanut buttery.

2006
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:20,680
Why, what was it?

2007
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,680
Did they just say new and improved taste?

2008
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:26,200
It's like new formula or new recipe.

2009
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,520
Huh.

2010
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,760
I gotta try this now.

2011
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,600
This is like when they, well, at least they announced it.

2012
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,340
I guess it's like new Coke and stuff.

2013
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:35,180
Yeah.

2014
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:36,680
But so I don't know if we need,

2015
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:40,120
we might be able to cut Blastar's bread pudding,

2016
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,600
but like the original Marvel Mania,

2017
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,680
we do need to sell full bottles of Dom Perignon.

2018
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,520
That is true.

2019
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,360
They did that.

2020
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,560
Dom is on the menu and this is a nice place.

2021
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,920
How much were they?

2022
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,880
Is there a menu price on here?

2023
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:54,800
Oh, I forget.

2024
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,860
You know, there were a couple generations

2025
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:58,720
at least of the menus and that's what's.

2026
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,560
Oh, I have it here.

2027
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:02,240
I have a Don, oh, here we go.

2028
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:05,640
$140 a bottle at Marvel Mania.

2029
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,480
99 to that, pretty good.

2030
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,360
Pretty like a little bit.

2031
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,680
Yeah, about what a restaurant charge is.

2032
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,120
Were there any Marvel, like did they make Marvel wines?

2033
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,240
Cause we're very excited about Star Wars land

2034
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,480
because you can drink the wine that Padme drank

2035
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,360
when she went to Black Spire Outpost.

2036
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:23,600
But was there like a special, I don't think,

2037
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,600
I'm looking at the list here.

2038
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,120
It doesn't look like there was anything

2039
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:29,920
from like Professor Xavier's Vineyard or anything.

2040
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,520
No, it was probably a lot of the same Robert Mondav.

2041
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,160
It was probably a lot of Robert Mondav.

2042
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,480
He also went through a bankruptcy in the 2000s.

2043
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,320
Who didn't?

2044
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,320
Monstrous Martinis, the negative zone.

2045
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,320
These are all real again.

2046
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,840
Asgard, Savage Land.

2047
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,880
Oh man, it's just so crazy.

2048
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,680
It just feels, here's what I think I like about this

2049
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,960
is that it does feel like at least the names,

2050
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:58,960
if not the menu, were written by real nerds.

2051
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,080
Yes.

2052
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,800
Like at the very least maybe the nerds

2053
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,400
gave them all the names.

2054
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,000
I think they came up with some big like simple ones

2055
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,520
like the Captain America burger.

2056
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,720
I think they burned through those for a lot of items

2057
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,520
and then they started going a little deeper.

2058
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,440
I want them even deeper.

2059
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,840
Yeah, I totally agree.

2060
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,720
Let's see, let's throw it out to the listeners.

2061
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:22,800
Listeners always have information.

2062
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,120
Do you know who wrote the Marvel Mania restaurant menu?

2063
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:27,560
Yes.

2064
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,960
And would you know where to look for that?

2065
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,800
Because we would like to bring whoever it is on

2066
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,560
or the team, maybe it was a team of people,

2067
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:37,480
and talk about it and then pitch them some more ideas.

2068
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,560
See what else, maybe what was on the cutting room floor?

2069
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,400
Absolutely.

2070
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:47,400
Was X-Men's Richter, did he have ravioli for instance?

2071
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:52,520
Did X-Man Forge have any dish that was left off the menu?

2072
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,840
I could just go upstairs and get my X-Men cards

2073
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,080
and we could just go through the list

2074
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:02,120
but we're already going long on this one.

2075
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,120
I mean, I'm very satisfied.

2076
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,880
One thing I liked, the actual drink menu

2077
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,440
in the one version of the Marvel Mania menu

2078
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:14,440
looks like a letter page from 90s or 80s Marvel comics.

2079
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:15,520
Very fun.

2080
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,360
Very fun.

2081
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,720
We put some of this online but we'll put all of it on

2082
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:21,560
if we haven't already.

2083
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,880
Yeah, the scans, there's a bunch of scans on the menu

2084
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,920
but they're so scattered on Twitter and Pinterest

2085
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,280
and Imgur.

2086
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:33,080
I am amazed no one has scanned definitively.

2087
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,640
Every now and then the one menu

2088
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,720
because it is comic book shaped shows up

2089
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:40,200
on like midtowncomics.com or My Comic Shop.

2090
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,080
But then it's always out of stock.

2091
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:48,240
All right, well, are we good?

2092
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:49,400
Yeah, I'm good, I feel great.

2093
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,960
All right, well folks, you have survived podcast

We just wanna remind you that Marvel Mania 2

and then Marvel Mania proper will be our new Marvel Mania

2099
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,680
that's about Marvel comics.

2100
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:10,520
Yeah.

2101
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:11,480
Okay, so just keep that straight.

2102
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,640
