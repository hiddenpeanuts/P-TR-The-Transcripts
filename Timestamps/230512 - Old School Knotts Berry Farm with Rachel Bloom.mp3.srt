1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,640
Warning, the following podcast may contain

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,640
un-PC dinosaurs, wind jammers that can't jam in the wind,

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,520
and emotionally charged berry goo.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,880
Rachel Bloom introduces a cavalcade

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,240
of her favorite old school rides from Knott's Berry Farm

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,960
on Podcast The Ride.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,160
This has been a podcast, where you don't lose

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:51,380
a r tropical

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,220
of ready-made grocery store funnel cake.

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,340
My name is Mike Carlson.

13
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,120
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,680
Mm, I have a lot of thoughts on that.

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,780
You think it'd be like a taken-baked pizza?

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,780
Yeah, I do think it would be like a taken-baked pizza.

17
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,480
Okay.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,520
Scott Gairdner, do you think it would be like that as well?

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,580
I guess so.

20
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,780
I don't know enough about the, wait,

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,080
but don't you need the oil and the bat?

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,480
Like, there has to be a big vat at some point.

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,880
Yeah, there's a lot of machinery needed

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,620
in a grocery store to make that.

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,960
So yes, it would be, that's why they're not doing it,

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,060
I think, is because it just takes up too much space.

27
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,320
But you're describing a version

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,520
where we don't need a method at home.

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,680
We don't need a big open vat of oil in our homes

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,320
in order to finish out the process.

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,160
Oh, I see what you're saying.

32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,980
It's not a take home.

33
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,820
Because that sounds dangerous.

34
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,720
Oh, I see, yeah, because what Jason proposed

35
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,580
is that you would have to bring it home and make it.

36
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,580
All right, I disagree with what Jason said.

37
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,460
I think it needs to be made in the grocery store

38
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,280
and you can take it home.

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,920
Well, Scott voiced my concerns.

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,820
Is that like, yeah, a big element of funnel cake

41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,020
is the hot burning oil.

42
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,160
So I'd be concerned, like, yeah,

43
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,460
I don't think you could just do it in an oven.

44
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,760
You just have to get a big drum of oil outside.

45
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,060
It's an outside thing.

46
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,260
It's only if you have yards or patios.

47
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,060
Right, and like you have an artisanal pizza oven

48
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,060
maybe if you're wealthy or something

49
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,460
and now you'll have an artisanal big drum of hot oil.

50
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,620
Big drum of hot oil.

51
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,060
It's like the deep fried turkeys

52
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,900
that always go so well for everyone every Thanksgiving.

53
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,960
Like there's so many wonderful videos of people going,

54
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,160
wow, this is so safe and fun and delicious.

55
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,960
Wow, this is so.

56
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,260
Let's post our success.

57
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,960
Let's post a video of how well it went.

58
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,040
But let's bring her in.

60
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,840
We have very exciting topics to talk about today.

61
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,160
You know her from Reboot and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.

62
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,400
Returning to the podcast, it's Rachel Bloom.

63
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,740
Welcome back.

64
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,000
My God, so thrilled.

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,800
Hey, thanks for joining us again.

66
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,500
Nice to see you again.

67
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,900
Oh no, I just spilled a ton of green juice.

68
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,580
Oh no.

69
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,840
Oh jeez, we're gonna have to vamp.

70
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,280
Okay, so back to see this.

71
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,040
She's illustrated exactly what the problem is.

72
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,580
If you can spill green juice at home

73
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,200
then a big open drum of oil.

74
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,040
That's fine.

75
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,300
It's why a more industrial kitchen like grocery store.

76
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,280
I think you would have to,

77
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,940
you just want it to be available in more places.

78
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,880
Yeah, because it's so theme park specific.

79
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,540
That's okay, don't worry about it.

80
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,080
Seems like it's going fine.

81
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,840
We don't have eyes on it.

82
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,020
We can't see the disaster.

83
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,680
Only Rachel knows what she did.

84
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,920
It was only a shot.

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,840
It wasn't a full 16 ounce bottle.

86
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,220
So it could be worse.

87
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,640
Doesn't it better that she did this here

88
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,280
and not like on a talk show or something?

89
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,120
I think it's hard.

90
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,220
In a limited, in a five minute window.

91
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,720
Now one whole minute of it is gone cleaning up green juice.

92
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,240
Here we can stretch.

93
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,920
She can deal with this

94
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,120
and we can still have a big art conversation.

95
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,620
We're playing it like it's live.

96
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,460
Yeah.

97
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,300
This is what's fun.

98
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,560
I mean it's almost like, you know.

99
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,160
Yeah, no, we're trying our best,

100
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,900
but like Drew Barrymore would have a lot of fun with this.

101
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,660
That could have been bad.

102
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,060
Wait, let me close my door.

103
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,900
Our family won't see.

104
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,060
Drew Barrymore would have a lot of fun with this

105
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,060
and she'd be very reassuring.

106
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,000
All right, luckily my computer was raised.

107
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,900
I just, I recently had fried my computer's motherboard

108
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,460
by spilling hot sauce on it.

109
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,300
Oh no.

110
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,000
You've just been down this road, this exact road.

111
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Listen, I'm not the most graceful, graceful person.

112
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
This tea's probably gonna spill at some point.

113
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh sure, okay, we'll be ready for it.

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,280
We love, you know, you don't get a lot of physical comedy

115
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,880
on a podcast, it being an audio medium,

116
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,200
so we think of pictures.

117
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,040
Nor should you.

118
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,480
I'll be fine, I don't know how funny that'll be.

119
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,480
I enjoyed it.

120
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,280
I hope, as long as it wasn't stressful for you,

121
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,880
you know, we're good.

122
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,720
No, it was great.

123
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,180
I wish I'd given you more of a, whoa, whoa, beep beep.

124
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,320
Baa baa.

125
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,820
We can edit those in, that's perfect.

126
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,660
You gave us ADR, we'll plug those in.

127
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,220
Very, hey, very wacky soapbox racers kind of,

128
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,780
crazy Spike Jonze sounds is what you just did.

129
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,140
Yes. A segue.

130
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,420
So yeah, we're talking about a whole grab bag

131
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,340
of old Knott's Berry Farm rides.

132
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,820
Yes, a delightful request on your end to just,

133
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,180
to say you wanna talk about old Knott's Berry Farm stuff.

134
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,600
You were after our hearts with that.

135
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,520
Well, like, I went to Knott's Berry Farm

136
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,760
as much as I went to Disneyland as a kid.

137
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,080
And you have these, I loved amusement parks

138
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,000
from a very early age.

139
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,400
I think we've talked about this,

140
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,000
and I grew up in Southern California,

141
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,280
which I believe you did too, right?

142
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,120
I did, yeah.

143
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,800
Yeah, but like, Valley, more so,

144
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,360
so it was all a little further.

145
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,680
Where were you again?

146
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,520
Manhattan Beach, we were far.

147
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,980
Yeah, that's not close to any of this, I guess,

148
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,660
but I mean, sort of south a little more.

149
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,420
I'm so jealous though, that Knott's was in the picture

150
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,620
as much as Disneyland's, that's great.

151
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,140
You know, my parents, I think, liked amusement parks.

152
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,140
Also, they could tell how much I loved them.

153
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,380
And I was an only child.

154
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,200
So I didn't have a sibling to compete with

155
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,620
of where we were gonna go.

156
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,220
And my parents just were down to go to amusement parks a lot.

157
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,620
We had a year-long pass to Disneyland.

158
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,440
We never had a year-long to Knott's,

159
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,840
but we went quite a lot.

160
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,280
And when you have these early amusement park memories,

161
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,440
it almost feels like they were a dream, right?

162
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,200
There are these like deep, there are these deep memories

163
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,880
and no one ever talks about them again.

164
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,280
And especially with the thing like a place like Knott's,

165
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,240
Disneyland has so much more of a history

166
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,000
and a lore and a fan base around it,

167
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,700
because Knott's is local.

168
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,380
Very few people are talking about it.

169
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,400
Like I went to Knott's,

170
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,060
I'd forgotten that the Tampico Tumbler closed,

171
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,060
which is one of the rides I listed I wanted to talk about.

172
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,220
And I was just at Knott's with my friend, Sarah,

173
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,460
and I asked an employee, I was like,

174
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,460
hey, do you guys have the,

175
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,820
because I think it used to be called the jumping bean,

176
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,700
but I was like, you know, the ride where you go like,

177
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,500
whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.

178
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,220
I forgot it was called Tampico Tumbler

179
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,020
and they had no idea what I was talking about.

180
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,340
And so there's a part of you that thinks,

181
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,900
did I make that up?

182
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,740
Yeah.

183
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,820
Was that a dream I had?

184
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,840
Because when you're a kid,

185
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,560
you kind of live in a half dream state,

186
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,040
but I didn't.

187
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,560
It existed. Yeah, yeah.

188
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,720
Yeah, everything's, when everything in a theme park,

189
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,080
especially is like big and surreal anyway,

190
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,560
and then memories get hazy.

191
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,000
I feel exactly the same with Knott's especially.

192
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,920
Where, yeah, you're right.

193
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,160
It's not like, up until only very recently,

194
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,280
maybe, are people like really listing out,

195
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,240
here's what all the stuff was.

196
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,360
So like something like Knott's Berry Tales,

197
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,740
I don't know if you got to do that

198
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,660
or if that was gone by the time you went,

199
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,420
but like I had the haziest,

200
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,100
like maybe I went on a ride with bears and berry juice.

201
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,980
And I also, this one's I'm wrong on,

202
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,560
but I had the haziest memory for a long time

203
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,420
that there was a Smurfs ride at Knott's.

204
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,620
And there is a Smurfs ride in the world,

205
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,340
but it might be in Dorney Park, it's across the country.

206
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,400
And I don't think I went there, but who knows?

207
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,540
I sort of like these like hazy, scary,

208
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,120
am I making up this ride or was this a dream?

209
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,960
It's kind of fun.

210
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Yeah, there was one at King's Dominion,

211
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,720
a long, long time ago.

212
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,080
Maybe I went, wow.

213
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,320
Maybe like even before the Paramount ownership.

214
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,880
Okay, huh, huh.

215
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,880
But your memory was you went on it?

216
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,760
I have the vaguest memory of Smurfs

217
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,880
and I remember that they were below me.

218
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,560
I remember like as if they were working in a mine,

219
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,520
but am I just conflating that with the mine ride?

220
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,660
But I don't think I would have confused Smurfs

221
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:39,660
with realistic, ash-covered, like mine workers

222
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,660
like you see in that scary Knott's mine ride.

223
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,500
Weird.

224
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,020
This is where you start to get into Mandela affection.

225
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:53,020
And there are things I remember that my parents maybe don't.

226
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,900
And so then if I bring it up and they don't remember,

227
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,740
I feel crazy.

228
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,460
I mean, that happened directly with Berenstain Bears

229
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,040
when the whole realization happened

230
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,880
on how Berenstain was spelled.

231
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,880
I have distinct memories of my father making jokes

232
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,200
that the Berenstain Bears were Jewish

233
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,260
because it looked like it could be Berenstein.

234
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,020
That's why I remember it was EIN.

235
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,480
And I called my parents a couple years ago and I said,

236
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,160
how do you spell Berenstain Bears?

237
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,740
And they said, STAIN.

238
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,720
And I said, you're not my parents.

239
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,380
I've been switched.

240
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,220
I've been switched.

241
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,040
I'm not your real daughter.

242
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,460
You're not my real parents.

243
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,320
I belong back in the other universe, please.

244
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,160
Wow.

245
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,540
This is your matrix.

246
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,540
This is getting yanked out of the matrix.

247
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,740
Funny example to use because just like last night,

248
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,680
I saw an image going around Twitter from one of the books

249
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,500
that revealed that Mama Bear is 27 years old.

250
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,520
Really?

251
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,340
Yeah.

252
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,180
No, no.

253
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,060
This is as a child.

254
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,440
If you'd asked me as a child,

255
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,460
I would have guessed 54, 62, just off hat alone.

256
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,260
Look, bears used to age differently back in the day

257
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,060
when these characters were created.

258
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,540
Wow, 27.

259
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,820
That's revelation.

260
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,620
Oh, that hat is just so unsexy.

261
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,300
The hat does a lot of the work in the aging.

262
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,700
Look, she looks terrific.

263
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,460
Don't get me wrong, but that hat is wild.

264
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Yeah, I mean bears age pretty well.

265
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,040
Bears don't crack.

266
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,880
Sure.

267
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,040
As they say, bear community.

268
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,600
They sleep a lot of the year too.

269
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,200
She's gotta style herself better to de-age.

270
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,920
Well, she's constantly wearing clothes

271
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,040
that she's going to bed, I feel like.

272
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,120
It looks like she's always going to sleep.

273
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,320
That's the thing.

274
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,500
She's depressed.

275
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,640
She needs to, they don't have antidepressants

276
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,200
in that world, I guess.

277
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,040
That's too bad.

278
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,900
My mom's, somehow I was allowed to read

279
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,740
my mom's teenage diary at one point.

280
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,740
And she said, it's mom's birthday

281
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,580
and my brothers and I just got her some potato chips

282
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,180
and a pillow, because all she does is eat and sleep.

283
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,820
Oh my goodness.

284
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,500
And I'm like, grandma was clinically depressed.

285
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,340
Wow.

286
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Not something to be mocked and needled with mean gifts.

287
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,720
Wow, what a different time.

288
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,940
Different time or just my family continuously.

289
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,160
Anyway.

290
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,360
Has this gift been given since though?

291
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,320
Has this been a generation?

292
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,920
It doesn't sound like the word, honestly,

293
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,280
regardless of that potato chips and a pillow.

294
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,320
Jason, that's a good, you're an expert.

295
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,900
And both very practical.

296
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,660
I feel like my family is very pragmatic.

297
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,860
We all like and give gift cards.

298
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,220
And it's fun to have them.

299
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,340
I think they're fun.

300
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,740
I always thought they were fun.

301
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,740
And now I feel like people use them as like,

302
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,100
oh, it's a toss off gift.

303
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,020
I love a good gift card.

304
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,500
And my parents, okay.

305
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,060
My parents are and have always been huge fans

306
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,700
of Barnes and Noble.

307
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,160
And whenever I had a gift to give someone in high school,

308
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,040
my mom would say, well, if you buy a Barnes and Noble

309
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,600
gift card, you can pay for it on our account

310
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,640
and we'll get points and you'll get a discount.

311
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,480
So for like, all of my senior year of high school

312
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,760
and maybe some of college, my gift to my peers

313
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,600
would be a $20 Barnes and Noble gift card.

314
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,360
And you know, worst case they can go get coffee,

315
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,520
they can get a chachki.

316
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,880
No one was ever unhappy about it.

317
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,540
That was great.

318
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,820
Yeah, when my parents would ask like for extended,

319
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,060
oh, someone wants to get you a gift, is there anything?

320
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,980
I'm like, well, Borders or Barnes and Noble,

321
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,980
it's always fun to go there with gift cards.

322
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,820
Borders you can.

323
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,460
Maybe I'll go to Barnes and Noble

324
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,620
and buy up a bunch of gift cards.

325
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,940
And that's just my gift from now on.

326
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,660
And I'm like, it's also a little bit of a go fuck yourself,

327
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,740
but I kind of like it.

328
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,300
Yeah.

329
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,180
They could get a Funko pop now, you know.

330
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,940
Oh, that's one of the many, many stores

331
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,780
that's converted to the Funko economy.

332
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,600
That's probably one of the main things they sell there now.

333
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,280
It's Starbucks coffee and Funko pops

334
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,480
of like J.J. Abrams or something.

335
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,320
Which I've seen in the store.

336
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
I'm saying that from experience.

337
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,780
Oh, you're not just being flippant, yeah.

338
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,620
No, I'm not being flippant.

339
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,200
I've seen a J.J. Abrams Funko pop in a Barnes and Noble.

340
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,040
Makes sense, gotta stay watchin' out.

341
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,840
What personality he is.

342
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,120
Yeah.

343
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,560
Imagine if you have a toy of him,

344
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,080
all the adventures he could go on.

345
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,160
Sure.

346
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,840
And you know, that Funko pop saw you as well,

347
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,620
cause you know, big glasses.

348
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,480
What?

349
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,340
J.J. Abrams, he has his big glasses.

350
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,420
Oh, he saw me because he did.

351
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,260
Yeah, he saw you back.

352
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,100
This is his big glasses.

353
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,100
All right.

354
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,940
I guess so.

355
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,760
I guess.

356
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,600
All right.

357
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,020
Are you saying that the only people who can see at all

358
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,420
are people with glasses?

359
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,460
Are you saying toys can see humans

360
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,300
if they have big glasses?

361
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,380
Well, I see different level.

362
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,580
I see through your skin to your ligament.

363
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,340
You know, we say the truth, those glasses wearers.

364
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,940
So glasses can show, glasses show toys, humans, I guess,

365
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,180
is really what I'm getting from you.

366
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,020
Yeah, yeah.

367
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,480
I don't know.

368
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,300
We have another episode on that.

369
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,280
Foggy sentence.

370
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,760
We have to unpack what Jason said later, I think.

371
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,600
Oh my God.

372
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,240
Can I ask before we dive into not stuff,

373
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,360
can I ask the parent question,

374
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
cause you have a daughter now, correct?

375
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,520
Oh yeah.

376
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,800
Oh yeah.

377
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,640
Oh yeah.

378
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,720
Are you theme parking it up with the,

379
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,160
are you on the other end of that now?

380
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,520
Are you indoctrinating her, the best indoctrination?

381
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,360
I am.

382
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,180
And I wasn't forcing it, but we brought her to Disneyland.

383
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,780
So she's three and she's been three times already.

384
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,620
Which is a lot.

385
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,700
These are my stats, exactly.

386
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,180
We fit it in three times before he turned three.

387
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,280
So he was free, three, three, free.

388
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,340
Okay, so you get it.

389
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,960
First time she was like,

390
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,340
I was like, how is she liking this?

391
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,900
And then the second time was when she was like, oh yeah,

392
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,740
no, this is on.

393
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,300
And then, so we went for her birthday and she loves it.

394
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,020
And I think what's interesting is seeing her,

395
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,100
the way she reacts to rides,

396
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,720
really taking me back to how I used to react to rides.

397
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,060
That you either, you kind of instantly fall in love with

398
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,900
them.

399
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,420
Well, it's like you instantly fall in love with them.

400
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,340
So when she went on the Astro Orbiter at Disneyland,

401
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,340
we had to ride it for four times.

402
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,620
Wow, wow.

403
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,980
And I thought it would be too fast for her,

404
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,840
but she glimpsed it across the park and she said,

405
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,720
I won't go that.

406
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,920
I said, okay, it's fast and it's high.

407
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,600
And she loved it.

408
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,560
Insisted on going all the time.

409
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,440
And the first time she went on it, she closed her eyes.

410
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,580
She got a little scared,

411
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,520
but then she wanted to go on it again and again and again.

412
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,380
You're always on, I guess what I'm saying is it reminded me

413
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,240
how is it when you go to amusement parks as a kid,

414
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,760
you're always on that tipping point between exhilaration

415
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,680
and fear.

416
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,480
And that's what's exciting.

417
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,540
The fear is what's exciting.

418
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,640
So we took her on Mickey and Minnie's runaway railroad.

419
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,020
Is it runaway railway or runaway railroad?

420
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,860
Railway.

421
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,700
Railway.

422
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,700
That is runaway railways.

423
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,220
Really separates the men from the Ian McKellans.

424
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,160
We took her on that and she closed,

425
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,360
there was some parts she loved,

426
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,060
the Daisy Duck teaching dance class.

427
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,080
She loves Daisy Duck.

428
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,920
She was obsessed with.

429
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,860
And then there's a part where a mallet smashes,

430
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,060
is look like it's gonna smash you.

431
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,520
She got very scared.

432
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,640
And she came off the ride saying, I didn't like that.

433
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,760
But then the next day she just wanted to watch YouTube

434
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,160
videos of that ride.

435
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,560
And I remember that.

436
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,780
I remember you're fascinated by what you fear.

437
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,880
And I had that for years with upside down roller coasters.

438
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,960
I knew all of the stats about big upside down

439
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,900
roller coasters, but I wouldn't go on one.

440
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,560
I was too scared.

441
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,080
And then finally I went on one which was Windjammer

442
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,080
at Knott's Berry Farm.

443
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,760
That was my first upside down roller coaster

444
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,520
because there was one loop.

445
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,120
One of the rare upside down coasters where there's

446
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,840
just one loop, it was very fast.

447
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,080
I remember it.

448
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,080
It was one quick hill going into a single loop.

449
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,840
And it was like once I crossed that Rubicon

450
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,680
I could go on anything.

451
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,520
Wow.

452
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,340
Wow.

453
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,160
That's a cool, I think that's the thing you can rediscover

454
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,580
as apparent is the theme park as gauntlet.

455
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,580
That there are many challenges for all ages.

456
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,980
These are things to strive to at three or at eight

457
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,380
or at 12 or whatever.

458
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,660
Or at 37 to 40.

459
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,940
Yes, as a person who wouldn't go on Splash Mountain

460
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,580
until several years ago, yes.

461
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,580
Sometimes it never ends.

462
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,820
Oh, is that because of the drop?

463
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,180
Yeah, my biggest thing is drop.

464
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,780
And especially, it's easier for me to do a drop

465
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,540
on a track where it still feels controlled.

466
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,860
But I think something where it is pure gravity

467
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,460
feels very naked and vulnerable and uncomfortable to me.

468
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,220
The three of us are scaredy cats going into this podcast

469
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,700
to start a podcast about roller coasters in some ways.

470
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,540
We're scared of them.

471
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,020
And Rachel, I forgot to, I should have brought this up.

472
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,660
Last time you were on, you suggested,

473
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,800
because I was going to Six Flags,

474
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,940
that I do Twisted Colossus.

475
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,860
That was your recommendation.

476
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,540
And I did Twisted Colossus.

477
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,020
And it was one of the scariest things

478
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,580
I had ever done in my life.

479
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,420
And the restraint, the harness also hurt me.

480
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,700
It was uncomfortable.

481
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,780
Oh no, I'm so sorry.

482
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,360
No, I mean, it's good.

483
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,620
Again, you actually encouraged me to get into

484
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,660
part of the gauntlet that I had not gotten into.

485
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,040
And when I go back to Six Flags, I'm going to do it again.

486
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,540
I'm gonna conquer it, somewhat conquer it

487
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,340
next time, I'm hoping.

488
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,080
But it was very funny, because you did encourage me

489
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,300
to do something that I was scared to do,

490
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,980
like go on a crazier roller coaster.

491
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,700
So thank you, I guess thank you, yeah.

492
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,500
This is the only you can decide for sure

493
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,540
if it's a thank you or not.

494
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,740
No, it was, it was.

495
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,460
Because again, it's like, well, I didn't,

496
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,900
it felt like when I was little, and I was like,

497
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,940
oh, should I go on the ride?

498
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,100
Should I go on Big Thunder?

499
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,060
And like, oh, I loved it.

500
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,940
I mean, I was scared, but I made it out.

501
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,220
And that's part of the fun of like going on a ride,

502
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,500
because you're like, am I going to make it out?

503
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,340
Yeah, I did.

504
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,260
Usually.

505
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,740
I'm glad I gave you that experience.

506
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,540
I'm sorry the harness hurt you.

507
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,460
I had that experience the last time I rode X, X2,

508
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,460
at Six Flags, the ride was really bumpy.

509
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,340
And we may have talked about this last time,

510
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,620
but the ride was really bumpy,

511
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,340
and it really fucked up my neck.

512
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,780
God.

513
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,980
And it was like, yeah.

514
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,740
And not even like, well, it was fun, but I'm in pain now.

515
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,020
No, it was a little bit like,

516
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,500
something's wrong with this ride.

517
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,940
Like they need to smooth it out.

518
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,100
They need to get the harness better.

519
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:21,100
Like it didn't feel, it didn't feel safe.

520
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,060
Yeah. Sure.

521
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,380
Like for my body, like, I mean, the ride felt safe,

522
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,700
but like for my body.

523
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,540
Yeah.

524
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,940
As opposed to, so I went on Hangtime at Knott's Berry Farm

525
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,660
when I was recently there, which has replaced Boomerang,

526
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,940
which was one of the rides that I remember.

527
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,740
Hangtime is intense, and you have to keep your head back.

528
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,340
If you don't keep your head back on that ride,

529
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,300
you will get kind of fucked up.

530
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,140
Yeah.

531
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,100
But if you keep your head back, it's awesome.

532
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,180
Yeah, we did, Jason and I did that one.

533
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,060
And that one is fun.

534
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,940
Like that one's fun.

535
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,300
If you're, once you get out of the complete, you know,

536
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,180
on your back. Yeah.

537
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,020
Well, you don't.

538
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,860
Rising up part of it.

539
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,340
I feel like you didn't like the hang.

540
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,860
You didn't like the looking straight down for a beat.

541
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,700
We've.

542
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,380
And I really didn't like the vertical.

543
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,140
We've talked about this on the show, thrills versus chills.

544
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,220
And chills, to me, is the sort of slow acceleration,

545
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,860
the one where they're dangling you.

546
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,780
Psychological.

547
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,020
Psychological are chills.

548
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,420
And I'm not as big of a fan of chills as I am of thrills.

549
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,620
I like thrills.

550
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,780
I like thrills too, but we also, you and I at some point,

551
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,900
rode Ghost Rider at Knott's, which is the wooden coaster

552
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,260
that they built in, goes kind of around the marketplace

553
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,780
and the parking lot.

554
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,580
And, you know, I've ridden a lot of wooden coasters

555
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,380
and I just went on with my glasses.

556
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,340
And like after the first few seconds,

557
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,260
I was like holding them the whole time because it is so intense.

558
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:48,060
I was so caught off guard by that coaster of like maybe one of the,

559
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,220
it's really good, but it's maybe one of the most intense coasters

560
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,820
I've ever ridden and I was not expecting it.

561
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,340
Oh, that's really interesting.

562
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,380
Because I, because when Ghost Rider, I love Ghost Rider so much.

563
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,060
Yeah. And I haven't ridden a ton of wooden coasters because

564
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:09,540
uh, they, I grew up here, so like there wasn't, there wasn't one there.

565
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,500
There wasn't one at Disneyland.

566
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,180
Knott's had this one, but it was like not great.

567
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,620
And then Colossus was like a kind of very smooth roller coaster.

568
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,100
Anyway, I feel like it's one of the great rides out there,

569
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,140
but I can't tell because I haven't been on a ton of other extreme

570
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,540
wooden coasters, but I think Ghost Rider is so good.

571
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,980
Yeah. Yeah.

572
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,740
I grew up on the East Coast, so there was a good amount of wooden coasters.

573
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,300
And I think in the Midwest, there's even more.

574
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,980
But it's like I, as a kid, I could just take the bumpiness,

575
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,940
like the intensity of that.

576
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,340
But yeah, until I was like 12 or 13, I was terrified of going upside down.

577
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,460
I don't know what I thought would happen if I would enter

578
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,060
another dimension or something.

579
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,020
But like, I think I thought I was falling out of the car.

580
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,820
Yeah. When I was a kid, I thought, oh, I'm going to go upside down

581
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,620
and like, I'm just going to fall out of the car.

582
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,300
Like that's I truly just very fundamentally.

583
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,620
That's what I thought might happen.

584
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,500
Yeah. Cartoons just imprinted on.

585
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,900
So like your daughter, we were scared of mallets, anvils

586
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,980
falling out of like the cartoon.

587
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,420
The loop goes, the carriage goes in a loop and then falls into the car.

588
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,140
When it gets back down, you had an actual fear.

589
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,460
See, for me, it was much more.

590
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,420
How am I going to feel when I'm in that loop?

591
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,500
Is it is the feeling going to be unpleasant?

592
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,060
Is it going to be so intense?

593
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,260
But you but that's interesting.

594
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,500
A material fear of I don't like this shouldn't be possible.

595
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,780
It shouldn't be possible.

596
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,500
But yeah, fear of unknown for sure.

597
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,660
Like, yeah, how am I going to feel? Is this really going to be

598
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,620
it's going to be like a tilt of where all where it really like pushes

599
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,780
on your stomach and you feel it or yeah, what is it going to be?

600
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,500
Upside down is, I think, kind of overrated in terms of like it.

601
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,220
I think we all built it up in some way.

602
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,540
And then it's not that crazy.

603
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,700
At least to me, it's not like the craziest thrill in most cases.

604
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,500
It's visually daunting in the way that, you know, Astro Orbiter

605
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,500
from a distance is visually visually very appealing.

606
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:11,180
You know, yeah, it depends how fast you're going on the on the loop, too.

607
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:17,860
Because like the yeah, yeah, I have got I guess the loop is negative G force, right?

608
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,380
And that's negative G's and then positive G's is a hill.

609
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,420
I don't know.

610
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,740
I think positive G's, I think positive G's are like the humps, the airtime

611
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,700
and the negative G's is the pressure on your head.

612
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,820
As I've gotten older, I I'm I

613
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,420
it's not like I don't like it.

614
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,980
I'm just I feel the same way.

615
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,060
It's it's fun, but.

616
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,900
It's not the it's not necessarily the most intense.

617
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,660
Part of the ride, like a good hill going into a steep turn

618
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,300
is just arguably just as kind of thrilling and intense as

619
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,460
as a ride with many, many loops.

620
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,300
That's something that I'm reaching now is

621
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,260
I'm not necessarily afraid to go on any rides, but I am hitting.

622
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,540
I feel my body starting to

623
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,860
feel the weight of these coasters in a way I could I could go to

624
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,940
I could go to not Six Flags in high school and be fine.

625
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,940
And now I have to eat a big breakfast.

626
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,540
I have to be eating throughout the day.

627
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,420
I need to have a stomach that is not hungry or I'll get nauseous.

628
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:27,060
I need protein in my body and I need to space out going on roller coasters.

629
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,980
I can't go on them.

630
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,700
I have to pace it because otherwise I will get nauseous.

631
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,100
And that never happened before.

632
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,500
And I'm glad that I can still go on coasters.

633
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,940
But the pacing, my pacing has slowed down.

634
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,900
Like if I were to go to Cedar Point, which is still one of my dreams,

635
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,180
I would I would have to make it, I think, a multi day

636
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,820
journey. I would I couldn't I wouldn't try to cram all those coasters in one day

637
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,140
because my body can't do it.

638
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,620
Yeah, that makes sense.

639
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,180
I've I've had this thought like, oh, I'm going to have to like train

640
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:05,900
or keep in shape of in some ways so I can go on the rides of the future.

641
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,500
Because I do want to because, you know, there's going to be cool rides

642
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,300
when I'm 70 years old and I want to be able to do it.

643
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,260
So I have to be in some shape.

644
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,260
My neck has to be not like cramping up.

645
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,620
I have to figure out how to.

646
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,100
I don't know if it's just doing more yoga.

647
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,980
I'm not sure what diet you got to think about to. Sure.

648
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,620
Yeah, every facet of it.

649
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,180
It's a little more astronaut for everybody.

650
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,980
We need to we're all kind of astronauts as we are.

651
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,340
Or these are astronaut shape 30s.

652
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,660
Well, and at five one, if I'm not careful, like my head will just ping

653
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,220
pong ball on those shoulder restraints.

654
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,940
And like I can kind of tell the upkeep quality of a coaster

655
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,140
on how much that that's happening.

656
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,180
Sometimes I get off and go like this is going to get refurbished.

657
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,380
I may have gotten a slight concussion.

658
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,460
Let me ask.

659
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,420
So that's one of the.

660
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,700
Oh, good. That's one of my memories about Windjammer,

661
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,260
which is one of the roller coasters.

662
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,660
So Windjammer was, you know, first roller upside on roller coaster.

663
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,820
I went on. It was a roller coaster at knots from I don't know the years, but opened

664
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,580
probably late 90s closed mid 2000.

665
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,580
So so despite being called Windjammer, it would close whenever there was

666
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,980
too high of a wind.

667
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,500
Yeah, it was a it was a badly.

668
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,900
It was a badly made made ride that that unfortunately replaced the

669
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,540
crazy soapbox racers, which was, I think, a bad decision.

670
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,980
And I do have a memory.

671
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,860
The first time I wrote it of coming off of the loop,

672
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,740
my head bouncing against the shoulder restraint.

673
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,740
Luckily, they really padded it because I think they knew it was going to happen.

674
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,380
But but even then, I was like, oh, this is weird.

675
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,260
Yeah, not even three years in.

676
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,820
This seems like the rarest.

677
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,100
I didn't know this story at all,

678
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:57,100
that it was seemingly notoriously bad and resulted in a lot of lawsuits

679
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,660
that kind of ruined the company.

680
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:03,820
I think not. I think nots did not end up winning the lawsuit, but it destroyed

681
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:09,300
the reputation of the company that built it, who also built the New York,

682
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,780
New York roller coaster, which from what I've heard, I haven't been on it

683
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,420
from what I've heard from people who have.

684
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,940
That should be enough to destroy a company's reputation on its own.

685
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,580
That's a terrible role.

686
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,420
Has anybody done it here? Yes.

687
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,540
Yeah, it's fun. It's bumpy, right?

688
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,620
I haven't been on it in a little bit, but if I remember,

689
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,500
it's pretty for a steel coaster. It's very bumpy.

690
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,980
It's pretty bumpy.

691
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,420
Yeah, the company was called Togo International.

692
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,260
It's a big Japanese company, and they they started an international

693
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,340
subsidiary and their main projects were

694
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,980
Windjammer and like New York, New York,

695
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,140
and that subsidiary pretty quickly closed.

696
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,820
And now there is a different company that updated the track

697
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,220
and ride cars on New York, New York.

698
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,140
I don't know that it's any better.

699
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,700
OK. Oh, but they just divorced even from like if they need new parts,

700
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,300
they don't even talk to the place

701
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,300
because I don't think this division exists anymore.

702
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,620
Yeah, this is a thing that happens sometimes.

703
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,260
Like Disney got in this with one of their

704
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,940
maybe primeval or one of Triceratops, something in Animal Kingdom,

705
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,460
where it's like, oh, this ride is closed a lot in recent years

706
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,220
because the company that built it doesn't exist anymore.

707
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,380
So getting replacement parts is near impossible.

708
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,100
Oh, jeez. Weird.

709
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,020
And you went, Scott, you didn't go on this, right?

710
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,180
What on Windjammer? This was two.

711
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,860
No, no, no. And yeah, it was at what?

712
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,580
So I was in like sort of middle school to early high school.

713
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,660
This was a very scaredy cat time for me.

714
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:46,060
So no Windjammer Surf Racer.

715
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:50,100
So in theory, this is supposed to be a racing ride.

716
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:54,100
But it seems like the racing was never really committed to.

717
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,420
They just they did not launch the two cars at the same time.

718
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,660
So you weren't really racing.

719
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,580
I do remember watching the cars.

720
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,260
And it was like you'd ride in these blocks of cars.

721
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,900
It wasn't even like a.

722
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,900
I think that's part of the reason was closed.

723
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,900
It was it was like only kind of one car.

724
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,580
It was it was that

725
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,260
I remember watching these two cars going around the loops

726
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,700
at the same time, and it was very cool.

727
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,420
But I think that's maybe the reason it was shut down is because you didn't have the heft

728
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,060
of a long ride car.

729
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,580
You just had this one little thing.

730
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,860
And it made the why is it when you have a like.

731
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,340
On a crazy mouse coaster,

732
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,180
why are the why are the drops more intense

733
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,700
when you're in just like a one, you know what I'm saying, like a one.

734
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,460
Yeah, as opposed to a smooth, long thing, there's something about that, though,

735
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,140
where you feel it's like good as opposed to like me.

736
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,100
Yes, those are awful to me.

737
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,580
I'm still not a fan of that.

738
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,580
Yeah, I don't know.

739
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,660
They have the less you have with you.

740
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,620
So much of a train, you're so much of that for me is psychological.

741
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,220
Yeah, for some reason, I feel very comfortable when there's a long line

742
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,380
of people, a bunch of friends are on the ride with me in my mind.

743
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,140
And I'm like, well, nothing's going to happen to all of these people.

744
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,220
It's about like, I don't think it is.

745
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,380
I'm saying for me specifically.

746
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,500
Sure. But yeah, there's something movement, though.

747
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,060
There's a I'm sure there's something in physics.

748
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,980
Yes, explains why things are kind of more intense.

749
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,540
It's closer to what I was saying about Splash Mountain that you're for me,

750
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:32,340
where you're in a little log and not the safety of a big long.

751
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,860
Yeah, well, it just feels feels crazier.

752
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:40,180
Goofy's Sky School, which is this like the scariest ride at Disney for me.

753
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,940
That sensation of almost going off the track and it's because you're in a little tiny car.

754
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,980
Yeah. And it's like, I know that's yeah, the idea is that like they're

755
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,460
making you think you're about to fly off the track.

756
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,220
But that's by far the scariest ride for me at Disney.

757
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,940
And Windjammer also had a loop it.

758
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:02,060
So the wild mouse loop combination, not really done very often.

759
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,420
Maybe only this. And that's interesting.

760
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,420
Yeah. Then it didn't work very well on top of that.

761
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,780
So yeah, and it would it seemed like, yeah, you would get a concussion on it.

762
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,820
So people sued because they got brained it like they got brain injuries.

763
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,540
I don't know if any if any individuals.

764
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,140
I think the knots was really unhappy on the Wikipedia.

765
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,380
I'm seeing that the fact that they couldn't operate during medium winds,

766
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:34,300
that wind jammers jammed in the wind, they knots called it an embarrassment.

767
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,020
Yeah. Wow. And then they just left it there and didn't deconstruct it,

768
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,300
but didn't run it for a long time.

769
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,140
And also, I missed this one that at some point on apparel company,

770
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,300
presumably called Windjammers, challenged the coasters name

771
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,660
and they had to change it to jammer for a while.

772
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,940
Oh, that's really funny.

773
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,700
What a combative three years.

774
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,220
This is a disaster, seemingly. Yeah.

775
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,180
Yeah. It's I just looking at the pictures of it.

776
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,940
It's just it seems like it could have been fun.

777
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,380
I just I don't know why.

778
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,820
It was it was fine.

779
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,300
I would say, like on the list of things, I'm sad aren't there anymore.

780
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,020
It's it was like a a pretty like not good roller coaster,

781
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:22,020
as opposed to the the parachute jump, which was awesome.

782
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,940
And and you still have the knots tower with the sky cabin.

783
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,460
Yeah. So I'm like, why not just leave the parachute jump?

784
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,340
Yeah. Why did you do that?

785
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,900
I'm not sure about that. The parish.

786
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,180
Yeah, I kind of miss when I wasn't paying a lot of attention to knots.

787
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,820
I miss that they took out the parachutes, which I always associated with it,

788
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,660
because you can see it or you could see it on the horizon

789
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,620
before you got into the park.

790
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,420
Like it's part of it.

791
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:50,860
It's if there is a not skyline that's iconic at all, parachutes are part of it

792
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,740
is part of all the ads for a while as they celebrated 100 years.

793
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,020
Like those are back in the mix.

794
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,060
Like, remember the parachutes?

795
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:57,940
But it's been a long time.

796
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,300
The beautiful Buena Park skyline. Yeah.

797
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,380
Well, and the great part of the parachute jump was and that's one of the home

798
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,940
movies I found like the great part of the parachute jump is that

799
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,500
it was the first intro to a drop ride that kids could have.

800
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,260
Yeah. Because it was gentle.

801
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,540
You were standing up in a cage like with your parents.

802
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,620
So it didn't drop you that hard, but it just gave you a little sensation

803
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,980
of what a drop ride was like.

804
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,500
And it was super it was super fun.

805
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,780
So I should say I went through my mom years ago, gave me all of our home movies.

806
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,260
So my my mom,

807
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:35,980
my mom and grandpa both videotaped constantly.

808
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:41,460
And I have 72 DVDs worth of home movies that my mom gave me.

809
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,020
And at some point I had them digitized and I put them all on my Google photos.

810
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,380
So I have all of my home movies, including like home movies

811
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,740
from like my my dad's family in like the 40s.

812
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,900
Wow. I have them all.

813
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,900
It's awesome. So I so then Google has like a really cool.

814
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,700
I mean, it's spying on me, but like a really cool thing where I can just put in

815
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,940
amusement park and it'll show me any photo or video that I've had

816
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,100
at amusement park.

817
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,580
So I was able to find home movies at nots.

818
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,700
And one of the ones we have is a parachute jump and like, yeah, it's awesome.

819
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,220
Geez. Yeah. Wow. Wow.

820
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,620
Wait, do you have it? Can we see you?

821
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,020
Yeah, I do. Yeah. Yeah.

822
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,580
Do you want me to share my screen? Yeah, sure.

823
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,740
Please. Yeah. Here we assume technically this is fine.

824
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,220
Yeah. OK, great.

825
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:28,220
All right. So this is me, my dad and my friend Dallas on the parachute jump.

826
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,180
Yeah. Oh, my.

827
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,660
Oh, oh, my God.

828
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,100
I thought you were in the line. That looks like a line cage.

829
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,220
That's interesting.

830
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,340
You're standing up. Yeah.

831
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,100
That's really weird.

832
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,020
Odd ride mechanism.

833
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,660
It's like a it's kind of like you're in a shark cage

834
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,580
and they pull it up into the air.

835
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,980
The opposite of a shark. Yeah.

836
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,900
The direction.

837
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,260
Wow. Wow.

838
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,820
You're on the left or right. Where are you?

839
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,220
I'm on the left of the hat.

840
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,540
Well, you're happy.

841
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,860
You're talking already reviewing it.

842
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,180
So it was once up and one down.

843
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,060
Two big visors, rainbow visors, big visors.

844
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,060
My family also, we are wearing

845
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,180
I don't know if you noticed, we're all wearing matching sweatshirts,

846
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,580
except for my friend, because we went to we'd recently gone to San Francisco

847
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,180
and we did a thing where you could sit on a dinosaur

848
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,940
and look like you were all riding a dinosaur.

849
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,940
And we got that photo put on a sweatshirt,

850
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,740
which I feel like people don't do as much now.

851
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,580
Getting a photo, like getting a photo on a sweatshirt,

852
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,580
considering how many photos we take, we all of our clothes,

853
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,940
when you think about it, could be photos.

854
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,260
It's true. We don't we don't.

855
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,580
Why don't we do that anymore?

856
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,820
Yeah, that's weird, because I feel like Uniclo or H&M

857
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,700
like often will sell just like a baggy sweatshirt

858
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,820
with just a square or rectangular photo on it.

859
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,620
But we're not opting for it at the specialized.

860
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,660
Yeah, because you see at Disney, like the people have like maybe

861
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:19,300
special sweatshirts, but it usually just says like grandma's turn in 75

862
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,340
or something. Yeah.

863
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,460
Like it'll be a custom made sweatshirt, but it won't be like photos.

864
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,180
But that was a thing. Was this just my family?

865
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,940
My parents know my OK, because my parents have a have

866
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,180
numerous sweatshirts of me as a kid on them and they'll wear them

867
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,620
to shows of mine. Oh, really?

868
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,940
Very cute. Yeah, it's very funny.

869
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,780
And I feel like I should start

870
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,780
doing that, like maybe I should get a sweatshirt of my husband

871
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:46,660
that says like my pudding and just and just and just wear it around.

872
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,420
I think, yeah, for sure. You should do that.

873
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,340
He'd be proud. Yes, that's great.

874
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:54,300
Sure. That parachute ride,

875
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,500
I feel like I would have warned my parents out like they would have been like,

876
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,980
all right, it's your turn to go on.

877
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,660
He wants to do it again.

878
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:06,340
But as a looking at it, I'm like, this is a little terrifying drop

879
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,580
getting dropped in this little cage.

880
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,060
Standing. I would have.

881
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,940
I remember the idea.

882
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:16,340
I remember my parents suggesting that we do it and I and just know

883
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,420
like, no, no, no, no, no.

884
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,460
Look, you just get in a cage and then it drops.

885
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,380
You. It's not funny. Stop suggesting it.

886
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,180
Like, yeah, even the badgering me.

887
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,460
I'm like, this is not one of these things that'll be funny that I'm overreacting.

888
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,740
I'm shutting this down, which probably they just made fun of me more. Right.

889
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,100
I did this. This is a hazy memory that came back.

890
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,100
You're thinking about these parachute, the like just a cage.

891
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,580
That doesn't seem I need something to hold on to.

892
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,620
This is why I have the bars of the cage.

893
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,660
I guess so. But that sounds they're just rattling.

894
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,780
That's not safe.

895
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,900
I'd want to go to the ground also.

896
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,060
Yeah, it wasn't.

897
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,300
It probably wasn't safe, but it had been around since like the 70s.

898
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,740
It was the symbol of Knott's Berry Farm. Yeah.

899
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:01,380
It's a thing we like to rides that are kind of intertwined,

900
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,580
like the sky cabin and the parachutes.

901
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:08,700
Like, yeah, there was an original like concept art for Disneyland

902
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,140
in the night that the Indiana Jones ride would be a temple

903
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,820
that the Jungle Cruise boat would be changed to go through.

904
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,500
And that's just two rides going in between each other is so fun.

905
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,620
Oh, I love I love that. And it's so rare.

906
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,460
Yeah. You have the Disneyland railroad that gives you a brief glimpse

907
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,060
of Splash Mountain.

908
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,580
The people mover used to give you a brief glimpse of Space Mountain.

909
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,180
Yeah. And Star Tours.

910
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,780
Yes. And Skyway used to go through Matterhorn.

911
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,940
So a lot of them are used to.

912
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:45,540
Yeah, the Skyway is because they still have that in Disney World, right?

913
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,260
No, it's gone for a while.

914
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,500
Oh, yeah.

915
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,580
So I thought they took it out of Disneyland because people kept

916
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:54,380
opening the doors and and jumping out and getting injured.

917
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,940
But did why did they take it out?

918
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,020
The sky was sky cabin was awesome.

919
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,100
I think the liability on both of those were a nightmare.

920
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:06,620
There was a guy who like jumped out or fell out and ended up in a tree.

921
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,700
Yeah, it wasn't the only reason, but I don't think it helped.

922
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,540
Sky Jump, I don't know, like of, you know,

923
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,940
not to not to bring everybody dead.

924
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,220
There was there in there was a suicide on Sky Jump.

925
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:24,300
The first death that not in 1983 on Halloween night even.

926
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,460
But it was it ran for a long time after that.

927
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,140
So that wasn't why.

928
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,660
It's actually kind of crazy that they just like, well, what do we do, gang?

929
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:37,460
Put our heads together, not adjusted in any way in the wake of the suicide.

930
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,580
Nope. Still a cage. Still good.

931
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,820
No restraints.

932
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,580
When you think about it as the most like, yes, that is the most

933
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,580
suicidable ride probably ever.

934
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,820
Yes, it's a shark cage with the top open.

935
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,460
Essentially, you just got one jump and then you're

936
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,180
nothing holding you in there. No belts, nothing.

937
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,260
And someone had climbed in the last few years, someone climbed to the top

938
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,100
of the sky cabin. Yes.

939
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,820
And then just hung out there.

940
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,100
And then eventually, you know, they got him.

941
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,980
Or was that the other one?

942
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,060
Was that was that Supreme Scream?

943
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,100
And is that the correct name?

944
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,300
Oh, I don't know.

945
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,180
That would be very to climb to the top.

946
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,900
I mean, to climb to the top of any of these would be dangerous.

947
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,340
But Supreme Scream.

948
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,180
Oh, I guess so.

949
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,780
You're never against if you could climb the tower.

950
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,500
The Supreme Scream

951
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,300
cars are never flush up against the pole.

952
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,380
So I guess you'd be fine.

953
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,500
That's so high. That would be so scary.

954
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,340
One of these for sure.

955
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,820
It did happen recently.

956
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,860
And the guy got down safely.

957
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,020
You know what?

958
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,660
I don't know if there's enough time to put a stunt into the new

959
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,740
Mission Impossible dead reckoning.

960
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,180
But a Tom Cruise stunt off of this thing would be really exciting.

961
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,820
Oh, sure. Very high.

962
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:51,860
Well, in getting to see him, you know, go to an amuse.

963
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,380
That's one sequence that we've never seen in a Mission Impossible is a big

964
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,220
in and like, yeah, run amok in an amusement park sequence.

965
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,140
I think we'd all like to see them hunt to that.

966
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,140
Yeah, no, we would.

967
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,260
I don't think they've done that on Fast and Furious either.

968
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,140
Oh, that's true. That's a good point, too.

969
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,220
Like a car riding in the roller coaster track.

970
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,780
Oh, wow. Oh, it's on the. Yes.

971
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,820
Yeah. On the track.

972
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,580
They have to perfectly steer to the contours.

973
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,820
Oh, that's great. Yeah.

974
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,580
Because it also if like it's too twisted, Colossus has two tracks,

975
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,500
like maybe one is the roller coaster and then one is the car.

976
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,900
And like they have to get somebody on the roller coaster.

977
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,660
So like they're trying to jump from the car to the actual roller coaster car.

978
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,180
That'd be well.

979
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,060
Or because roller coaster tracks are much more narrow than cars.

980
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:38,500
But so but if it's a racing coaster, you have two wheels on one track,

981
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,860
two wheels on the other track, and you are the roller coasters right behind you.

982
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,260
Oh, that's good.

983
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,460
You don't if you don't get fast, stay fast enough.

984
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,140
That roller coaster is going to demolish your car. Right.

985
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:54,220
Well, that's like you have to drive faster than gravity to stay ahead of that.

986
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,580
I guess that's what I'm saying.

987
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:59,100
I guess that's what I'm saying, which is a big that's that seems like a challenge

988
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,580
that Toretto in the game, if he was going to do it.

989
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,980
Could do it. Yeah. I'm in the family. Yeah, sure.

990
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:09,260
As long as with the power of family behind them, with the power of family behind them,

991
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,020
it's more powerful than gravity.

992
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:14,060
It does seem like one of the comedy like that Ludacris

993
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,260
would would get up to in those.

994
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,420
He does all the gags and stuff.

995
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,380
I believe ended up in space and enough enough.

996
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:26,180
An old car with a jet engine strapped to it in space in the last one.

997
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,060
OK, great. Yeah.

998
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,700
So, yeah, roller coaster is not washable.

999
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,580
Yeah. Yeah.

1000
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,300
I would have been missed a bit.

1001
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,780
Oh, you know what?

1002
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:40,260
Iconic thing as part part of the sky jump tower, which is still there, but the

1003
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,020
the big knots K, that's an old school.

1004
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,700
Oh, yeah. It's thing which they replaced.

1005
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,540
It's now like it's now an LED K

1006
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,900
so it can flash all these different colors.

1007
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,500
And we were all there for the the opening of the new K.

1008
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,540
What a moment. You were there.

1009
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,460
We got a we saw the K turn on.

1010
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,660
We didn't go on any rides.

1011
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,500
We just saw the K.

1012
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,500
But I I. That's awesome.

1013
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,340
It was special. Well, that was also that was like things are starting to reopen

1014
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:15,660
post pandemic. So truly like a K turning on was like tear inducing.

1015
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:21,220
Well, I have an insane email because I I know the nots PR people

1016
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:25,300
because one time a bunch of crazy ex a bunch of us and crazy ex

1017
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,340
like went to nots for free.

1018
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,540
I have an insane email I sent.

1019
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,740
Oh, boy, this is probably July 20, 20.

1020
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:39,340
So my daughter's three, four months old.

1021
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,100
It's thick of the pandemic.

1022
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,020
I had a very traumatic March 20, 20.

1023
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,740
I gave birth. My friend died.

1024
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,260
Covid a week after she was born.

1025
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,220
I had her. I had a rough go.

1026
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:54,580
And I have an email that I sent to my Disneyland PR contact that says, hey,

1027
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,340
I know the park is closed, but I have to imagine

1028
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,540
that you guys are running the roller coasters.

1029
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,380
Is there any way I can just sit on a ride

1030
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,020
while you're running a roller coaster?

1031
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,740
I haven't been on a roller coaster because I've been pregnant.

1032
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,740
I was pregnant. I haven't been on a roller coaster in almost two years.

1033
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,340
I'm having a rough time.

1034
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:23,300
Can I please just sit on a ride and then I'll go and I'll pay any.

1035
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,180
I'll pay you. I'll pay you like and I won't.

1036
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,620
I don't I'm not going to go around the park.

1037
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:30,340
I'm not I don't expect food. I don't expect the bathroom. But.

1038
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,940
And she got.

1039
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,660
She's like, um,

1040
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,620
I'll check with my contacts.

1041
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,820
I don't think that will be possible.

1042
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:45,020
And it's a it's a it's a crazy thing to ask.

1043
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:48,900
But, you know, you miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take.

1044
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,020
Yeah, it literally never hurts to ask.

1045
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:56,300
The worst thing is they get a little mad and then probably forget about it.

1046
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,620
But also, maybe you made their day.

1047
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:02,260
Maybe that was like, you're not going to believe what happened to me today.

1048
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,340
I got to tell you this story.

1049
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,180
Yeah, and it makes sense, right?

1050
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,660
You have to run the coasters. Right.

1051
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:13,180
Yeah, they're there. There's all some where you have to keep them from being rusty.

1052
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:18,660
Can I just. Yeah, just just sneak onto it. Sure.

1053
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,060
Yeah. And they're making zero dollars as it stands.

1054
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:26,860
It's like, right. I was like, I will pay you full amusement park admission

1055
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,220
just to be on one ride one time.

1056
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,620
Yeah. Yeah.

1057
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,140
Yeah. Yeah.

1058
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:36,060
Well, I was I was the one who was assigned

1059
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,660
the duty of like a 2020 early summer pandemic.

1060
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,260
Me and my girlfriend put in an order.

1061
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,420
They had opened the Nantes chicken dinner restaurant for pickup.

1062
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:53,940
And I went and we went down and it was so surreal to like

1063
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,660
there was only like 10 cars in the parking lot and half of them were workers.

1064
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:01,660
And I was like, I have to walk under the roller coaster to get like

1065
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,780
I hadn't been in a park. I hadn't seen a roller coaster.

1066
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,380
I hadn't used a public bathroom in months.

1067
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,660
And it was just so bizarre.

1068
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,220
And there was just like, yeah, public bathrooms open.

1069
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:14,380
And it was just the cleanest thing I had ever seen.

1070
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,900
But it was just so bizarre to be standing there holding our dog

1071
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,820
underneath Ghost Rider and no one's around.

1072
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,820
And it's like perfectly quiet.

1073
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,780
Mm hmm. Wow. Just being near.

1074
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,460
Just let me touch a roller coaster.

1075
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,220
Can I hug a roller coaster? It was at that point.

1076
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,740
It's like, well, the pie and the chicken will keep.

1077
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,540
I think we can walk around.

1078
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,140
And you would be you, Jason, have been emailing them every day.

1079
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:39,140
Can I please have a chicken, please, please?

1080
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:43,980
Finally, they opened it up chicken while touching a roller coaster.

1081
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,660
I don't even like that much.

1082
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,380
White meat is so dry so often, but I'll take it.

1083
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,260
It got so sad. All those things.

1084
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,500
Did you ever go to any of the things where it's like, OK,

1085
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:57,340
we are opening Disneyland, but not restaurants or stores.

1086
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,620
You can just be in there.

1087
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,580
Nothing is open.

1088
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,940
There is nothing to do.

1089
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:04,340
And it is cold. But you can go.

1090
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,180
I went to one thing like that that was it.

1091
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,580
I think it made me feel worse, actually, then.

1092
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:11,900
But I wanted to.

1093
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,020
I was curious if it would make me feel better.

1094
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:17,180
Yeah, we drove a car through Six Flags.

1095
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:19,020
Oh, right. In Christmas time.

1096
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,660
Oh, they had opened up.

1097
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,180
Oh, yeah, that was the thing.

1098
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:26,580
In 2020, you could drive your car through Six Flags

1099
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:30,140
and they would have like, I don't know, lights.

1100
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,100
There would be some lights.

1101
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,020
The light shows were pretty good.

1102
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,820
And then there would be some people dancing.

1103
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:39,140
And then at the very end, like a sad Daffy and Bugs.

1104
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,580
Well, yeah, but I didn't wait at you said you saw a bug.

1105
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,580
I saw a bug.

1106
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,620
Bugs was on a break.

1107
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,340
And I was like, well, there was no finale.

1108
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,780
And then we just left.

1109
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,220
Although we did get a hunk of fudge on the way in.

1110
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,220
We got complimentary fudge on the way in, which was nice.

1111
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,940
I just delivered to your car.

1112
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:54,980
You're in a mask.

1113
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:55,940
They're in a mask.

1114
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,100
A mask.

1115
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,420
Where a hazmat suit hands you fudge.

1116
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,380
That's where we were at not long ago.

1117
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,060
Yes, I remember it well.

1118
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,300
Did you do any of the like what do you do?

1119
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,940
Or maybe you couldn't get out with with young baby at the time.

1120
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,940
But did you have any like, well, this is a sure a sad attempt

1121
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,060
at trying to get theme park fun.

1122
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,420
I did a drive through drag show.

1123
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,340
OK, cool.

1124
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,580
Sat in sat in our cars and watched a big drag stage.

1125
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:23,860
That was fun.

1126
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:28,700
I did a Sinus Pia drive through with Death Becomes Her.

1127
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,740
That was very fun.

1128
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,860
Oh, that's fun.

1129
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:36,260
That was it. We were really, really careful.

1130
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:36,900
Yeah.

1131
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:41,860
Yet we still got covid in in late December, in December 2020,

1132
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:45,220
because my husband had an eye infection and he had to go to the eye doctor.

1133
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,980
And he wore an N95.

1134
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,140
Geez.

1135
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,940
But he got it. He got covid from there.

1136
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,500
So we all got it anyway.

1137
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,940
We are so cautious.

1138
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,460
We are.

1139
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,500
I mean, we're on the more careful side of people.

1140
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,140
And we have had covid more than anyone we know.

1141
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:01,540
Wow.

1142
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,820
Geez. It's like you're because you're more cautious.

1143
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:05,940
So I don't know.

1144
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,540
It's just karma.

1145
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,580
It's weird. Bad luck.

1146
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,340
But especially

1147
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:15,380
it was rough before we were vaccinated, but post vaccination,

1148
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,260
it's, you know, not as bad.

1149
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,020
Yeah, yeah.

1150
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:24,860
Sure. Let me just make sure we get to more of the nuts stuff.

1151
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:30,140
I, you know, let's I want to make sure we get a little time in for Wacky Soap

1152
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:33,420
Bugs Racers, because as we so what are the sads?

1153
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,500
We kind of went backwards here.

1154
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,020
But the you know, this this problematic,

1155
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,500
multi types of lawsuits.

1156
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,140
Windjammer Coaster opens is gone in three years.

1157
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,940
This is the spot where now it's accelerator, which is the one

1158
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,540
that's like a pretty fast launch.

1159
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:50,540
It's pink and there's like one big loop is the or one big towers

1160
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:51,580
kind of the main facet of it.

1161
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:56,340
But this spot was it was first a motorcycle ride.

1162
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:59,220
It was called Motorcycle Chase until 1980.

1163
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:04,100
And then I guess it's a cursed spot because this was starting to be

1164
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,980
a problematic ride,

1165
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,420
not not in a cultural sense.

1166
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,500
Yeah, it was canceled.

1167
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,500
Yeah. Yeah. No, it was not.

1168
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,700
They didn't have that then.

1169
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,100
Motorcycle Chase. OK. Yeah.

1170
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,860
I'm looking at pictures of it. Yes.

1171
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:20,700
This was you. You were basically up too high.

1172
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,300
Like it was cool to sit on a motorcycle.

1173
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,700
But if this ride came to a sudden stop, you're really screwed.

1174
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,780
Like you're barely you're barely hanging on.

1175
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:32,820
There was a problem with the center of gravity on the ride.

1176
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:36,220
But they wanted to keep the track and they wanted they don't want to start

1177
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:40,660
from scratch. And a guy named Eddie Soto, later an Imagineer,

1178
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:44,860
realized, well, what if we just it's the same track, but you put everybody lower

1179
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,100
and then maybe we can salvage this thing.

1180
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,340
And that was the core of it.

1181
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:52,740
But on top of that, he creates this experience that's this wacky,

1182
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,460
unique, singular cartoon world.

1183
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,300
This is like an auteur.

1184
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,780
This is I really never I knew this thing existed,

1185
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:03,140
but I never looked at it too hard until prepping for this.

1186
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,740
Boy, this ride seems great.

1187
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,580
And you got you got to do it.

1188
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,220
It was awesome.

1189
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,780
It was so fun.

1190
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,380
It was the perfect I wrote this when I was five or six.

1191
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,780
So it was a perfect it was one of the few like family

1192
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:21,380
I think the only thing I'm the only family roller coaster not had.

1193
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:22,460
It was great.

1194
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,420
And and you see you're you're still kind of above the track.

1195
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,820
So it felt a little surreal.

1196
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,180
I loved it.

1197
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,260
It was awesome.

1198
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,020
It seems so fun.

1199
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:37,460
And in theory, OK, so the racing, which often doesn't work on a lot of rides

1200
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,420
and really didn't work on Windjammer, the idea with this

1201
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:46,100
is that it's kind of like a bobsled competition where if everybody works together

1202
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:51,700
and leans and uses their own center of gravity, that you maybe like,

1203
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:54,380
let's work together as a team in the soapbox here.

1204
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:58,300
And we can actually maybe shift our weight and win the race.

1205
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,140
I don't know how true it was.

1206
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:02,980
But it seems like people actually did try.

1207
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:08,340
And what a cool dimension for a ride that you maybe there is an actual competition

1208
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,580
that really works. It's not arbitrary. Yeah.

1209
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:13,180
And tons of painted original characters.

1210
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:17,260
I think there was some animatronics to the there was an announcer animatronic.

1211
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:23,180
Yeah. Of like these animals and cute lions and clients and bears and stuff.

1212
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:24,660
Cats. I did.

1213
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:28,060
It did remind me, too, of the Warner Brothers or not.

1214
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,660
Warner Brothers, the Hanna Barbera.

1215
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,980
That show was just called Wacky Races. Yeah.

1216
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,100
So similar, very similar concept.

1217
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:40,700
But like this is a whole universe of characters exclusive to this ride.

1218
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:44,900
And I think this and Berry Tales are the ones that I hear most about.

1219
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,340
Like, oh, there's commemorative merch.

1220
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,620
There's there's a very thorough.

1221
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:54,980
Eddie Soto has a very thorough Wacky Soapbox Racers website, like Memories Web.

1222
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,660
Check this out, Rachel.

1223
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:59,100
Wacky Soapbox Racers dot com.

1224
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:03,780
It's I have never seen such a complete archive of a website

1225
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,540
from the people who actually built it.

1226
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:09,860
You can see like people painting and prepping all the characters

1227
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:13,980
and what the old ride looks like and why it didn't work and how he fixed it.

1228
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:18,180
I it just and you keep scrolling and scrolling and more and more pictures appear.

1229
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,820
What a great sight.

1230
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:21,300
This is really watching the ride.

1231
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,180
Yeah, you bust through the doors.

1232
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,660
Oh, yeah, this is really.

1233
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,140
Doors fly open.

1234
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:32,100
It has that kind of madcap like the Mr. Toad kind of deal.

1235
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,020
You know what I was saying about I don't know, Rachel,

1236
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,620
I don't know if you've been on the Mario Kart ride yet.

1237
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:42,700
Not yet. We all maybe don't like the ride.

1238
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,980
Maybe we can just be as simple as that about it.

1239
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:45,900
Don't feel the best about it.

1240
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,940
The racing feels arbitrary and it doesn't.

1241
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,140
And it's very slow.

1242
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:53,500
And they're trying to make the race nature of it all happen in the goggles

1243
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,940
that you're wearing. They are goggles.

1244
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,780
And I had been saying, is it a wild mouse?

1245
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:59,380
Is there some jankier way to feel more like Mario?

1246
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,900
I think this is it.

1247
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,300
This seems more Mario Kart than the Mario Kart ride.

1248
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,420
Yes, for sure.

1249
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:08,780
This is yeah, you were kind of mentioned it, but like this feels like

1250
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:12,540
the one of the pieces of not identity,

1251
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,100
basically, that went away when they started like.

1252
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,100
Because it's original.

1253
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,100
It's original kind of IP.

1254
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,700
It's like original lore.

1255
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,780
Right. And the Berry Tales was that way, too.

1256
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:25,980
And now you've brought it back in a less lesser version.

1257
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:29,940
Yeah, we never talked to an episode about it, which might indicate.

1258
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,060
I don't know. We liked it.

1259
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,900
I liked it. Have you done that, Rachel?

1260
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,020
The new the new Berry Tales is like a shooter shooting pies.

1261
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,100
I have I haven't.

1262
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,980
It's maybe I have.

1263
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,580
If I have, it's very forgettable.

1264
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,700
Well, because that took the place of the dinosaur ride.

1265
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:47,020
And the dinosaur ride was awesome.

1266
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,220
Yeah. And that also had its own IP.

1267
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,980
It had its own animatronic character who was a doctor that was like.

1268
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,860
And I remember he go, we go, we're going back back

1269
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,420
50 million years.

1270
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,660
And it was this character.

1271
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,780
It had its own story.

1272
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:06,820
And any ride now that has its own story has been taken out in the place.

1273
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:09,180
Well, I guess Berry Tales is its own IP.

1274
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:11,020
Yeah. And it's been. Yeah.

1275
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,180
And they brought that back.

1276
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,820
But like the only way you're getting not IP in a theme park

1277
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:17,740
is if the theme park can't afford IP. Right.

1278
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,460
So we need our cheap parks.

1279
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,500
We need not to have no partnerships with anything

1280
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,340
or else we don't get these delightful original worlds.

1281
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,020
The story is on a lot of these.

1282
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,700
And I had kind of heard versions of them over the years.

1283
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:34,140
But it's like it all depends on like how well the park is doing financially.

1284
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,900
Who's in charge?

1285
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,700
Like eventually when Cedar Fair buys Nats Berry farm,

1286
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:43,100
the guy is in charge and he makes an effort of like,

1287
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:47,660
we're going to put in dark rides at all at all of these parks.

1288
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:50,900
And I only learned this from an expedition theme park video.

1289
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,660
When Cedar Fair bought Nats Berry farm,

1290
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:57,780
that was their first time running a year round park.

1291
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:02,140
Oh, that had never occurred to me because all the other Cedar Fair parks

1292
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:05,460
are in places with cold winters.

1293
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,260
So they close, you know, for for parts of the year.

1294
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,500
But Nats is open year round.

1295
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:14,340
And he kind of like committed to like, let's get some dark rides in there.

1296
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:17,260
Let's revitalize the ones that are in there.

1297
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,820
And that was part of the big, the big change.

1298
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:24,180
Eventually, the family, the kids, the Nats kids sold off

1299
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:28,980
the park to Cedar Fair and then Cedar Fair kind of they know rollercoasters.

1300
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,660
So they start putting in that stuff.

1301
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,740
And then eventually when this new guy takes over,

1302
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:36,660
that's when you start to see a lot of revitalization efforts at Nats.

1303
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,060
Oh, sure. Yeah.

1304
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,220
Personality put it back in. Yeah.

1305
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:43,460
And yet the Kingdom of the Dinosaurs fell into the crack.

1306
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,020
Like, I didn't realize this thing.

1307
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:47,340
They just let it rot. They stopped running it.

1308
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,620
And then people just started going in there and stealing stuff or

1309
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,020
breaking parts of it.

1310
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,780
Or like, it's very it's awful what happened to the.

1311
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,140
Brett, can we see it?

1312
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:01,780
I think I sent an ad for Kingdom of the Dinosaurs just to go back to the

1313
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:07,260
to happier times, which imagine like it is 1987, I believe.

1314
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,580
And you see you were like this is probably the beginning of kids

1315
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,860
being obsessed with dinosaurs.

1316
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:16,340
It's like I don't know that that exists as much before the 80s.

1317
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,580
Oh, wait, they're not this one.

1318
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:21,660
But the although, you know, while you have it open, this is another.

1319
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:26,060
I like this clip, too, which is weirdly I played a part of this years ago.

1320
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,820
This is this is I don't know one of the hosts, but the other one is

1321
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,620
Gary Owens from Laughin.

1322
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:31,940
Oh, I recognize.

1323
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:35,820
And they they were hosting some dinosaur show and they went through the ride

1324
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:39,060
as part of this, but I didn't play this moment from it.

1325
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:44,340
Just pay close attention to the animal that they point out on the ride.

1326
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,060
A sloth.

1327
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:52,340
There it is. A three toed sloth.

1328
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,580
A sloth. A sloth.

1329
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,420
It's a sloth. Look.

1330
00:58:58,420 --> 00:58:59,500
Oh, it is a sloth.

1331
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,420
Yeah, it's a three toed sloth.

1332
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:05,180
This are we how do you get sloth?

1333
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:09,220
Is the guy just is the guy just dumb or do we not know what that part?

1334
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:13,020
Or is it not a new area mania at that point?

1335
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:16,100
Is it a regional thing?

1336
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,540
Like just a weird I had never heard sloth.

1337
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,540
Oh, it's a Pennsylvania thing.

1338
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,900
No, it's not a sloth.

1339
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:26,060
But that's unusual, because sloth is one of the seven deadly sins, isn't it?

1340
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,340
Like, that's right.

1341
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,180
That's what they want to differentiate.

1342
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,540
Yeah. Oh, maybe.

1343
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,420
Maybe he's like, yeah, he's very religious.

1344
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:36,140
He studies the sins and he's like, surely it can't be sloth.

1345
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,940
That would not be a nice name for an animal.

1346
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:41,820
Like how we learned the planet's name was Uranus when we were kids.

1347
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:44,900
And then all of a sudden it was like Uranus was the way people were pronouncing it.

1348
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,100
And I suspect it's because we have to do something.

1349
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,420
I call bullshit on that. Yeah, it's Uranus.

1350
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,060
It's Uranus. Yeah.

1351
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,180
It's just deal with it. Fuck you.

1352
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:53,740
We give kids a little bit of fun.

1353
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,100
Let them play with the naughty word.

1354
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:58,620
That's a fun day in school.

1355
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,020
When you figure that out.

1356
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:03,220
Yeah, I feel like I pretended for a while.

1357
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,740
I felt like, hey, Uranus, ha ha ha.

1358
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,500
I get it. I did not get it.

1359
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,740
I didn't know what it was.

1360
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:12,220
Yeah. Here's the on a cleaner, more wholesome note.

1361
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,900
Here's this commercial. It's wild. Yeah.

1362
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:21,060
Over 16 million years ago,

1363
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:25,900
the most ferocious creatures the world has ever known

1364
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:29,500
mysteriously disappeared.

1365
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,020
Oh,

1366
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:42,540
introducing kingdom of the dinosaurs.

1367
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,500
Mom, guess what?

1368
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,780
They're not.

1369
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:48,540
That's that. Oh, that's very cute.

1370
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,020
Thank you, pal, missing for that video.

1371
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,340
Yeah. Imagine.

1372
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:56,300
I mean, like, imagine seeing that in that year, if you're a Frady Cat kid.

1373
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:01,340
And the ride does not reflect the that like fast cutting

1374
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:03,180
psycho screen.

1375
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:05,460
And the ride wasn't that the ride was.

1376
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,620
When I went on it, it was we're going back in time.

1377
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:11,220
It wasn't scary. It was look at these amazing dinosaurs.

1378
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:16,020
Yeah, yeah, just very, very gentle, calm, like sort of an eerie air.

1379
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:19,740
But then none of the dinosaurs do anything actually upsetting.

1380
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,380
So that's that's a bit of misrepresentation.

1381
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,700
One of them said off color remarks.

1382
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:26,700
Right.

1383
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:29,300
But if you just plug your kids ears.

1384
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,300
Yeah, it was very weird.

1385
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:35,660
Suddenly, like at the end of the ride, the T-Rex was like, women can't drive.

1386
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:41,580
And it was everyone coming out of the door, like confused.

1387
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:43,620
Everyone's like the very end of the ride.

1388
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:45,260
Did you hear that too?

1389
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:47,780
Do you? Hey, a comet said in for us,

1390
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,860
well, I'm probably whipped by Uranus.

1391
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:53,620
Yeah, they put that on a shirt, though, that in the retro merchandise.

1392
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:54,220
Oh, sure.

1393
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:58,860
Dinosaurs saying women can't drive and millennials wear it now, ironically.

1394
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:04,180
So and they but all the right operators are instructed to say, no, I.

1395
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,740
I didn't know. I never did hear that.

1396
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:07,740
You're crazy.

1397
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,140
Dinosaurs roar is what they do.

1398
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:10,340
I don't know what you heard.

1399
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:12,060
Yeah, I guess they're just so amazed.

1400
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,500
You must be the crazy one.

1401
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,660
Every employee is gaslighting.

1402
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,900
The origin is the first gaslighting ever done.

1403
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:19,940
So yeah, it's very fun.

1404
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:22,940
It was that movie and then the ride.

1405
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,900
30 years later, but so on and on with it.

1406
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,620
Yeah, this was why do really well, I do really quickly.

1407
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:33,620
I look at home movies are mostly boring, but I do want to just play

1408
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:37,460
one more thing that I have, which is the old roller coaster boomerang,

1409
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,260
which is where hang time is now.

1410
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:41,980
Boomerang, which formerly was corkscrew.

1411
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:43,860
And then they changed it to boomerang.

1412
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,920
I don't know if it's a different ride or if they just gave it a new code of

1413
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,580
paint, but this was like

1414
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:51,420
the only multiple upside down roller coaster at knots.

1415
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:54,420
And in 2001,

1416
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:57,700
when I was in eighth grade, I somehow got my dad to go on it with me.

1417
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:00,540
And my dad had been on upside down roller coasters, but he was

1418
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:01,780
he was getting on in years.

1419
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,020
I have kind of an old dad.

1420
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:05,300
So my dad was born in 1945.

1421
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:07,220
So 2001, he was.

1422
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,580
He was his fifth.

1423
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:15,500
He was early 50s.

1424
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,020
So I do want to just play you my dad's reaction after going on boomerang,

1425
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,500
because it's very funny.

1426
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:21,740
So this is all right.

1427
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,660
So this is us here.

1428
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:27,820
It'll be you can edit around the boring stuff, but it is quite fun.

1429
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:30,220
All right. I don't have clips of parents.

1430
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,340
We've done surprisingly little.

1431
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,980
Your song with your mom.

1432
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,140
That's true. All right.

1433
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:37,660
Can you see? Yeah.

1434
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:40,500
All right. So here's me, my dad.

1435
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,260
All right. Let's see.

1436
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,340
OK, sorry, I should have.

1437
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,420
Oh, boy.

1438
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:51,380
So we're joking, huh?

1439
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:52,740
Have they changed?

1440
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:56,180
Anyway, I'm going to sign up.

1441
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:59,340
OK, so my dad and I go on Boomerang.

1442
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:03,900
My mom is filming us on Boomerang.

1443
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,020
Let's see how much you can see.

1444
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:08,820
Can't really see much.

1445
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:15,420
Where are we? All right.

1446
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,180
There's our car. Oh, my God.

1447
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:20,740
I don't know.

1448
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:22,340
I would never go on this.

1449
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:23,940
Did mom always sit it out?

1450
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,580
She said, right?

1451
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,260
She's never been on an upside down.

1452
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:28,260
Oh, OK.

1453
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:31,260
So you can kind of see us.

1454
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:32,700
Yeah. Oh, there you are.

1455
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,460
I just looked it up.

1456
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,660
We're right.

1457
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:37,780
Oh, we're right there.

1458
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:38,780
Yeah.

1459
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,860
Oh, my God.

1460
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:43,500
It's commentary.

1461
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,820
Boomerang, right?

1462
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,300
I don't know where they are.

1463
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,060
I don't know what they're doing.

1464
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:49,660
I don't know. I don't know why they're doing it.

1465
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:50,660
I don't know.

1466
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,420
So here we go on Boomerang.

1467
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:59,140
All right, you'll see our faces drop.

1468
01:04:59,140 --> 01:04:59,940
There we are.

1469
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:03,140
It's a big slow lift back and then it drops you and then you do the thing

1470
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:05,660
and then another then you get stuck again and then you go backwards.

1471
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:13,660
OK, so.

1472
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:17,660
It's my dad getting off the ride.

1473
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:19,340
In the white shirt.

1474
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:20,340
Yeah.

1475
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:24,340
That was worse than I remember.

1476
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,340
OK.

1477
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:27,340
She's out of the will.

1478
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,340
Oh, my God.

1479
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:31,340
No, it was.

1480
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:32,340
Did you see me?

1481
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:34,340
Did you see me on the loop?

1482
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:35,340
Yeah.

1483
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:36,340
What do you say, Alan?

1484
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,340
How was it?

1485
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:38,340
No, you know why it was worse?

1486
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:40,340
No, wait, I'm trying to get his face.

1487
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:44,340
It was an experience that nobody really needs.

1488
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,340
Give her a picture.

1489
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:48,820
They make you up, they shut you up, they took you down.

1490
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:49,820
Oh, my God.

1491
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,820
I'll never be the same again.

1492
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:52,820
OK, bye.

1493
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:53,820
Bye.

1494
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:56,820
So that's what I wanted to.

1495
01:05:56,820 --> 01:06:02,820
It's an experience that no one really needs is like kind of a great way to sum up

1496
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,820
roller coasters in a way.

1497
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:08,820
Yeah, if you look at it, if you look at it, why?

1498
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:10,820
Why would anyone do that?

1499
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:12,820
Why would anyone do this to themselves?

1500
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:17,300
And then later in that movie, I get the camera and I'm like,

1501
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:18,300
Dad, Dad.

1502
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,300
And I'm being playful.

1503
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,300
And he's like, I need to get home.

1504
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,300
He's clearly nauseous.

1505
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,300
He's like, I need to get home.

1506
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,300
Stop filming me.

1507
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,300
Oh, wow.

1508
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:27,300
He's kind of in a bad mood.

1509
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,300
Yeah.

1510
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,300
And he wasn't kidding about the will.

1511
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,300
You guys have revisited this once a decade.

1512
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,300
No, I'm out.

1513
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,300
Yeah, yeah, I'm out.

1514
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,300
Yeah, he meant it.

1515
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:36,300
Yeah, man of his word.

1516
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,300
He said it with a smile, but he means business.

1517
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,300
I mean, there's a few great things about that footage.

1518
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:42,780
One, your dad's reactions are so good.

1519
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:46,780
Like, you can't script lines that good.

1520
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:49,780
The other thing is your mom, like the camera's a little shaky

1521
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:52,780
and then she finds you guys in the car and she perfectly

1522
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:53,780
captures the release.

1523
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:55,780
She perfectly captures the drop.

1524
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:57,780
She killed it.

1525
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,780
Yeah.

1526
01:06:58,780 --> 01:06:59,780
Yeah.

1527
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:01,780
And I don't know, I love home movies.

1528
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:04,780
Like, if I love watching home movies of my own, I love

1529
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,780
watching other people's home movies.

1530
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:09,780
I just think what an amazing time we live in that we have

1531
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,260
ways of documenting.

1532
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:15,260
We have primary sources of our lives.

1533
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:18,260
We didn't have that until really recently.

1534
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:19,260
Yeah.

1535
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:20,260
Oh, yeah.

1536
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,260
Oh, and the grand scheme of humanity.

1537
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:23,260
Yes, really.

1538
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:24,260
That's what I'm saying.

1539
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:25,260
How lucky we are.

1540
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:26,260
It's crazy.

1541
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:28,260
And then it shifts in the fun of like, here's old, here's 2001

1542
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:31,260
DV versus like old 8 millimeter or whatever.

1543
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:35,260
We have the last and we're like the last, we're the last

1544
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:38,260
people that will have like old looking stuff, old looking

1545
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,260
video.

1546
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:42,740
Like in the future, like our kids are like have like

1547
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:45,740
perfectly clear videos documenting so much of their

1548
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:46,740
lives now.

1549
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,740
My kids live fully 4K.

1550
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:49,740
4K life.

1551
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:50,740
It's only going to grow 20K.

1552
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:51,740
Yeah.

1553
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:52,740
50K.

1554
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,740
Yeah, I have a photo of my daughter, like photos every

1555
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:56,740
day in very high quality.

1556
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:59,740
But like, I think it's fun that all our home movies still

1557
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,740
like kind of feel like the past.

1558
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:04,740
And I guess, I guess photo resolution will get better

1559
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:05,740
somehow.

1560
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:08,740
So maybe what I'm saying will be wrong in the future.

1561
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:12,220
I feel like how the 90s, the 80s and 90s did, which is,

1562
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:16,220
I don't know, just a little bit janky.

1563
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,220
Yeah.

1564
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:22,220
I like that our, our, when we were kids feels like old.

1565
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:23,220
I like that.

1566
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:24,220
That's fun.

1567
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:25,220
That's what I'm saying.

1568
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:28,220
It takes a little pressure that it's not like totally crisp

1569
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:30,220
like the evening news now.

1570
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:34,220
Like your, our phone is the same as like some films or

1571
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:38,220
some like broadcast TV, but like watch it doing this show

1572
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:41,700
and like combing through YouTube, like home movies.

1573
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:42,700
I'm so grateful for them.

1574
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:47,700
And it's so cool to see people like loving these attractions

1575
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,700
and stuff, especially for ones I never got to do.

1576
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:51,700
Yeah, yeah, really.

1577
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,700
No, and it's, yeah, it's kind of neat that it's like

1578
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:56,700
archaeology, that there's not like the crispest footage of

1579
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:58,700
wacky soap box or kingdom of the dinosaurs.

1580
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:01,700
But yeah, especially because both those two have similar

1581
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:04,700
stories of like towards the end, they let it go to rot

1582
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,700
a little, like they didn't, they didn't keep it up.

1583
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:10,180
There's other ones like Boomerang stuck around till 2017.

1584
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:13,180
So you can find HD footage of it, which is surreal.

1585
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:14,180
When did we go?

1586
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:17,180
Was it 2016 for the first time I went?

1587
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:18,180
Was 2016 maybe?

1588
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:20,180
No, it was before that, 2014 I think.

1589
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:21,180
Was it that far away?

1590
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:24,180
So I did Boomerang and I think it hurt.

1591
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:26,180
I'm pretty sure it hurt my neck.

1592
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:31,180
It really felt like it like compacted my neck, my vertebrae.

1593
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,180
And I did, like I hated it.

1594
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:34,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1595
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:36,660
Maybe like one of the worst rides I ever went on.

1596
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,660
So you're in Rachel's dad's camp.

1597
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:40,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1598
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:43,660
I was not, so I probably just was like going, ah, afterward

1599
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:45,660
and not saying anything funny though.

1600
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:48,660
If I could, as we're winding down, I have a couple of clips

1601
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:51,660
I like to play that, and especially like to get your

1602
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:54,660
thoughts, Rachel, as a musical person, a musical fan,

1603
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:57,660
because all of this is music oriented.

1604
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:00,660
And we skipped through some different like shooting

1605
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:01,660
eras as well.

1606
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:04,140
I know when we talked about Nott's many, many years ago,

1607
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:08,140
I showed a, they made employee music videos every year

1608
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:09,140
in the late 80s.

1609
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,140
Oh, great.

1610
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,140
And I had showed an I Love L.A., I remember,

1611
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:14,140
but I don't think I showed this one.

1612
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:17,140
Brett, we just call it employee song.

1613
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:20,140
And I'm a fan of this one too.

1614
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:23,140
And it's, the production value is kind of crazy.

1615
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:26,140
Like they got a real crew to come film the employees

1616
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:28,140
singing and dancing.

1617
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:31,140
How many jobs is that true of in 1989?

1618
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:32,620
Good point.

1619
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:39,620
OK, Nott's Berry Farm!

1620
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:41,620
Ghost Town!

1621
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:43,620
Rory Twoniesh!

1622
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:44,620
Count Snoopy!

1623
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,620
Fiat of the Lane!

1624
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:47,620
La Sencha!

1625
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:49,620
Bigfoot!

1626
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:59,620
Calling out around the farm.

1627
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:03,100
Ready for a brand new beat.

1628
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:06,100
Summer's here and the time is right.

1629
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:09,100
While dancing in the street.

1630
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:11,100
Dancing at the May Game.

1631
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,100
Dancing in the street.

1632
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:15,100
Down at old school row.

1633
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,100
Dancing in the street.

1634
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:18,100
In gasoline holly.

1635
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,100
Dancing in the street.

1636
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,100
All we need are smiles.

1637
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:23,100
That's the bulk of it, I'd say.

1638
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:26,100
There'll be good times everywhere.

1639
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:27,100
Wow!

1640
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,100
Yeah, look at that.

1641
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:32,580
The spirit here, fully committed to.

1642
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:35,580
And that's just internal or is that for the public?

1643
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:36,580
I think that's internal.

1644
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:38,580
I think that was for a summer party.

1645
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:39,580
Wow!

1646
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:41,580
To get, to like light it.

1647
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:43,580
Those are camera moves and that.

1648
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:44,580
Yes!

1649
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:45,580
That's a production value.

1650
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:48,580
They got a drone somehow before...

1651
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:49,580
Yeah, yeah.

1652
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:50,580
The first drone.

1653
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,580
That's amazing.

1654
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:53,580
Yeah, yeah.

1655
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:54,580
That's pretty great.

1656
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:58,580
That maybe speaks to the spirit that was around there at that time.

1657
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:01,060
And then you got this and this is just camcorder.

1658
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:07,060
But do you know about the association over the years with Elvira at the Halloween events?

1659
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:09,060
Yes, I remember this.

1660
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:12,060
I've never looked into this too much.

1661
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:16,060
I know Doug Jones has said the Elvira show was so great and I think she only recently

1662
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,060
stopped doing it.

1663
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:21,060
But this is probably late 80s, I think.

1664
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:23,060
But if we could pull up the Elvira.

1665
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:27,060
And I don't, okay, I heard that and I don't know a lot about Elvira to be honest.

1666
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:31,900
This clip makes me like, okay, I need to dig in much further because this is the most kickass

1667
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,900
looking thing ever.

1668
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:37,900
What do I want to do?

1669
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:41,900
I want to be a dragon.

1670
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:45,900
I want to be a dragon.

1671
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:49,900
I want to be a dragon.

1672
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:53,900
I want to be a dragon.

1673
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:56,740
Is that Elvira or an Elvira impersonator?

1674
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,740
No, that's her.

1675
01:12:58,740 --> 01:12:59,740
That is her.

1676
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:02,740
She really did a bunch of shows every year at Knott's Berry Farm.

1677
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:05,740
And in this case, a big dragon head in the back.

1678
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:07,740
It's getting hit with a laser.

1679
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:09,740
Yeah, laser's like carving up the dragon.

1680
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:11,740
Like trying to kill it, trying to blind it.

1681
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:14,740
She was really big.

1682
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:21,740
And it was one of my first, like she dressed with her boobs out and she was sexy and she

1683
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:22,740
was ubiquitous.

1684
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:25,580
I feel like she was everywhere.

1685
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:31,580
And it was this thing where like as a kid, you're just exposed to this like really sexy

1686
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:35,580
woman and everyone's like, okay with it.

1687
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:43,580
And you're like, okay, yeah, I guess this feels, it felt very adult, but coded adult.

1688
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:45,580
Sure.

1689
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,580
And it's also like a Halloween thing.

1690
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,580
So you're like, well, she's dressed for the season.

1691
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:52,420
That's what's like, like I feel like maybe that's part of it as well.

1692
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,420
Maybe that's my headcanon for it.

1693
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:56,420
I don't know.

1694
01:13:56,420 --> 01:14:03,420
The overlap between spooky and sexy is very confusing as a kid.

1695
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:04,420
Yeah.

1696
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:07,420
Did she start the correlation between the two things?

1697
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:10,420
Now I just want to go on an Elvira deep dive.

1698
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:11,420
Yeah.

1699
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:13,420
I've only done, I don't know, I've never seen that movie.

1700
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:15,420
I've just read, she's a lesbian.

1701
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:19,420
She's been with a woman for, her name is Cassandra Peterson.

1702
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,260
Cool name.

1703
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:22,260
Yeah.

1704
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:23,260
I know a little Elvira stuff.

1705
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:24,260
I've seen the movie.

1706
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:30,260
She made a good ad for the, in that universal Halloween award show.

1707
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:31,260
Yes.

1708
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:35,260
You can party with her at universal studios if you won the beer contest.

1709
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:39,860
She's probably, I would guess the most famous horror host of all time, which is a whole

1710
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:45,780
genre of performer that I'm pretty obsessed with, which includes like Svenguli and going

1711
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:51,460
back to many different people like Paul Thomas Anderson's father and stuff, the great Goulardi

1712
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,940
of course.

1713
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:54,460
You have an hour ready to go.

1714
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:56,460
The hour is about to spill out of you.

1715
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:59,700
I would love, it's at the end of the episode.

1716
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:00,700
Many parties.

1717
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:01,700
I know, I want to talk about it.

1718
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:05,940
There's a certain hour where you leave Mike, I'm going to go get another drink.

1719
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:08,380
You come back and he's talking about Goulardi and Svenguli.

1720
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:13,220
Graduate school thesis about horror hosts.

1721
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:16,500
We do need to do more Elvira stuff though in regards to Knott's Barrier.

1722
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,180
I want to know about this dragon show.

1723
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,300
Why is the dragon there?

1724
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:20,300
Is the dragon an enemy?

1725
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,700
Is the dragon a friend?

1726
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,380
Does Elvira have to slaughter the dragon?

1727
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:25,740
Oh the dragon's, come on, the dragon's a friend.

1728
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:26,740
Yeah, that's true.

1729
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:29,740
It's a monster situation.

1730
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:31,660
It's probably a pet.

1731
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:32,660
One more thing really quick.

1732
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:37,060
And this is, I want to see if we all agree.

1733
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:41,700
I labeled this Knott's earnest song and I think you'll agree this is a good title.

1734
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:44,940
And I'm curious if this sums up everybody's feelings about the place of which we're all

1735
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,740
pretty fond at this point.

1736
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:48,540
But boy this song goes for it.

1737
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:51,580
This is from some documentary from 1984.

1738
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:56,660
I couldn't believe the heartfelt nature of this song about this theme park.

1739
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:59,900
But I think we might, I don't know, it might sum it all up for us.

1740
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:00,900
Can we play this, Brett?

1741
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:01,900
You and I must try.

1742
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:02,900
Start up a new life somewhere.

1743
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:06,820
I'm watching parachute footage.

1744
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:09,820
To be a part of the land and sky.

1745
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:22,820
If we're worn out, broke down, tired and hungry, fighting ourselves, and a love for the country.

1746
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:25,820
Not very far.

1747
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:28,820
Not very far.

1748
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:32,740
Not very far.

1749
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:35,740
Not very far.

1750
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:40,740
Then just a slow shot of a bunch of berries barely lit.

1751
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:41,740
Jason, are you okay?

1752
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:42,740
Jason's not going to be here.

1753
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:45,740
He's going to get too riled up here seeing those berries.

1754
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:48,740
This little part.

1755
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:51,740
No mistakes, no regrets.

1756
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:56,740
Together we can make it all the way.

1757
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:59,660
This is the most emotional song.

1758
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:00,660
I love it.

1759
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:02,660
That is a Scott Garner song.

1760
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,660
I feel like that has enough chord changes.

1761
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:07,660
The chord changes are like your chord changes that you like.

1762
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:10,660
There are a little bit unexpected.

1763
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,660
And there's a lot of them.

1764
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:13,660
Synthy noodling.

1765
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:17,660
I was trying to place what that is musically, and I think it's somebody trying to place

1766
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:19,660
a song on a Wings album.

1767
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:22,660
I don't think they accepted it, so you had to rewrite the lyrics and make it about Knott's

1768
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:23,660
Berry Farm.

1769
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:25,660
Is there somebody kind of carpenter-sy about it?

1770
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:28,580
I'm a huge carpenter.

1771
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:31,580
The earnestness of it.

1772
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:35,580
I mean, at this point, that song is how I feel about it.

1773
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:39,580
If that didn't exist, you would have willed it.

1774
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:41,580
That harmony blast is crazy.

1775
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:44,580
Your sheer force of will would have made that reality.

1776
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:47,580
If that song didn't exist, it would have just come.

1777
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:50,580
If I could use AI for good, I would use it to create that.

1778
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:52,580
Maybe I did somehow without knowing it.

1779
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:56,500
And then that whole, no mistakes, no regrets.

1780
01:17:56,500 --> 01:18:01,500
It sounds like she's trying to get someone to have sex with her at Knott's Berry Farm.

1781
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,500
Maybe so.

1782
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:10,500
Look, there's this parachute ride, and we got about, there's nothing in the way.

1783
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,500
No harnesses, no mistakes, no regrets.

1784
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:15,500
We can get up there, have sex really fast, and then drop and have a great experience.

1785
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:19,500
Or it's more innocent than she just wants to split a pie with someone.

1786
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:22,420
Because there's that long shot of the pie.

1787
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:23,420
Oh, that close-up.

1788
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:28,420
It looked very gruesome.

1789
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:31,420
It looked like innards.

1790
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:34,420
Yes, it was not the most appetizing.

1791
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:38,420
That's a pile of organs for a really intense surgery.

1792
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:41,420
But that looked good 50 years ago.

1793
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:43,420
That pie looked good.

1794
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:48,420
There's another part, we're not long after it, there's just a shot of a dark vat, just kind of a dark purple vat

1795
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:51,340
spinning around as the lyrics are like,

1796
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:56,340
We can climb to the sky, anything is possible.

1797
01:18:56,340 --> 01:19:00,340
There's another one about, we can build a home by a model tee.

1798
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:05,340
Start a new life, erase the old one, begin again.

1799
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:10,340
Were they trying to build a Celebration Florida, but just for living in Knott's Berry Farm?

1800
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:11,340
If so, I'm in.

1801
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:13,340
I'm totally in.

1802
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:16,340
Do they have enough land to create a little, or can they?

1803
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:20,260
They've got some kind of dirt lot where they do overflow parking.

1804
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:23,260
If you build into the parking lot, you can make a way.

1805
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:28,260
If that rockin' bruise in Buena Park ever goes out of business, that's a nice plot of land pretty close.

1806
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:29,260
How could it?

1807
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:30,260
Well, you're right.

1808
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:33,260
The sound business plan provided by Gene Simmons.

1809
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:34,260
Sure.

1810
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:36,260
No, it's unlikely.

1811
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:44,260
But that carousel footage, Rachel, earlier you were talking about memories of these places and they feeling dreamlike.

1812
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:48,180
That carousel footage seemed very dreamlike to me.

1813
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:54,180
Seemed very like a child's memory, kind of an askew angle and you're kind of half remembering it.

1814
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:57,180
It's not totally in focus.

1815
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:58,180
Yeah.

1816
01:19:58,180 --> 01:19:59,180
It's beautiful.

1817
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:00,180
Yeah.

1818
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:05,180
It seemed like it was trying to hypnotize us so that she could cook us and eat us.

1819
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:08,180
I mean, that's always on the table.

1820
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:12,180
Look, after that song, I would have done whatever she wanted.

1821
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,100
Whatever is happening, I'm bored.

1822
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:16,100
Yeah, yeah.

1823
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:17,100
Oh yeah, a thousand percent.

1824
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,100
Yeah, that music, that good, yeah.

1825
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,100
If she wants to kiss me, fine.

1826
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:21,100
If she wants to cook me, fine.

1827
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,100
Either way is fine.

1828
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:28,100
Kiss me or cook me either way I'm yours.

1829
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:32,100
Let's go on the soapbox race.

1830
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:36,100
Start a new life there.

1831
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:39,100
Might die to whatever.

1832
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,100
All on the table.

1833
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:41,100
I go with it.

1834
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:49,020
It's the last decade where you could like burn your ID and then drive east or west until you ran out of gas and start a new life.

1835
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:50,020
I live here now.

1836
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:51,020
Yeah.

1837
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:54,020
Well, if that journey took you to Buena Park, then you're set.

1838
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:57,020
Anything closing, Rachel?

1839
01:20:57,020 --> 01:21:04,020
The warm and fuzzy feeling, I assume it applies from your Knotts-laden childhood?

1840
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:09,020
Oh, I'm literally going to go on Etsy right after this and look for a bunch of vintage Knotts t-shirts to buy.

1841
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:10,940
Sure.

1842
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:12,940
Beautiful, wonderful, great.

1843
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:13,940
Glad to get you into that state.

1844
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:15,940
Rachel Bloom, You Survive podcast, The Ride.

1845
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:18,940
Thank you so much for joining us again.

1846
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:21,940
A great pile of stuff to get into.

1847
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:23,940
Exit through the gift shop.

1848
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:26,940
Anything you'd like to plug?

1849
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:27,940
No.

1850
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:31,940
I mean, I'm doing a live show, so check my Instagram to see if it's in your city.

1851
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:32,940
Oh, great.

1852
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:33,940
Yeah.

1853
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:34,940
Oh, you're touring.

1854
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:35,940
Oh, wonderful.

1855
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:36,940
Yeah, a little bit, yeah.

1856
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:37,940
Oh, geez.

1857
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:38,940
Great, great.

1858
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:40,860
Are you in Muppets, man?

1859
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:41,860
I'm on, I'm literally in three seconds of that.

1860
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:42,860
Oh, okay.

1861
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:43,860
Oh, well, they're so, okay.

1862
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:44,860
Well, good.

1863
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:45,860
Look for the three seconds.

1864
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:52,660
Hey, and thanks for everything on The Writer's Strike, too.

1865
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:54,660
Thanks for being outspoken about this stuff.

1866
01:21:54,660 --> 01:22:00,060
I watched the panel you did for the rap with Kate Cannon and other people, and just thanks

1867
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:03,180
for being outspoken about these things because they're important.

1868
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:04,180
My pleasure, yeah.

1869
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:08,740
And it's also like, I don't know where we're at with shouting out things because there's

1870
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:15,180
been a general lack of talking about, okay, well, how do we make the studios hurt the

1871
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:16,180
most?

1872
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:17,780
Where's the line?

1873
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:18,780
So it's confusing.

1874
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:21,140
Yes, yeah, yeah, very much so.

1875
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:27,740
But as you talk about bizarre situations for writers that everybody finds themselves in,

1876
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:31,100
it makes everybody feel less crazy, I think, to pull these stories and share.

1877
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:32,100
Oh, good.

1878
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:33,100
I'm happy to help.
