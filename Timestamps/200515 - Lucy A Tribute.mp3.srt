1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,900
Warning, the following podcast that was recorded

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,900
pre-quarantine contains references

5
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,180
to all your favorite television stars.

6
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,780
William Frawley, Vivian Vance, Gail Gordon,

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,300
and Frank Nelson.

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,100
You know, all of your favorite stars.

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,100
Get back in your time rovers.

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,100
It's Universal Studios, Lucy, a tribute on podcast, The Ride.

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,520
["The Ride Theme Park Theme Song"]

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,880
Welcome to Podcast The Ride,

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,520
where the pressures of producing weekly theme park podcasts

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,480
can start to feel like a never ending

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,380
chocolate conveyor belt.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,360
I'm Scott Cairn here, joined by Mike Carlson.

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,560
That is good, and that is what it feels like sometimes.

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,400
Yeah, boy.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,440
You gotta produce this podcast.

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,240
That's what I tell people when they come up to me

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,520
and ask, well Mike, what advice do you have

22
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,600
for a potential podcast?

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,280
And I say, look, you gotta do it weekly,

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,560
you gotta do it at the same time, you never can stop.

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,920
And it, yeah, it can really pile up,

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,200
and you can feel like you're,

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,120
there's so many episode commitments

28
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,480
that you're having to put them in your apron.

29
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,320
Put them in your hat, yes.

30
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,240
Start chewing them as they go.

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,700
We have a lot of podcasts right now in our hat,

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,080
in our figurative hat.

33
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,120
That's true, yeah.

34
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,960
So we've been recording, and we have them all,

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,800
and they're ready to come in,

36
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,040
and it does feel like sometimes there's an invisible boss

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,840
that comes in and yells at us.

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,320
That's like, keep producing, keep talking, more rides.

39
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,600
And it's like, yes, of course,

40
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,720
and we just have to hide the fact

41
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,160
that we're like a little bit stressed out.

42
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,680
Jason Sheridan is here also.

43
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,520
Yes, I mean.

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,000
I guess you're right, the audience is the boss.

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,140
Oh, that said, this is probably the time to announce

46
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,140
we are switching to the Podcast The Ride Comedy Hour,

47
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,240
which will be 10 hour long episodes throughout the year

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,120
instead of one weekly episode for 30 weeks of the year.

49
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,960
The Scott, Jason, Mike.

50
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,800
Scott, Jason, Mike.

51
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,480
Comedy Hour. Comedy Hour, yeah.

52
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,760
It's unclear if everybody's gonna come back, though.

53
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,200
It may be a new, there's discussion

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,560
of whether I'm too cantankerous and drunk

55
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,840
to continue being on the show,

56
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,720
but we'll see, it depends on contract negotiations.

57
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,780
You were giving a referendum at the start of the show

58
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,100
that you'll never be late, and so far you haven't been.

59
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,100
And I've stuck to that, have I not?

60
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,020
Okay, let's. Give me one example.

61
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,860
Real quick, for the audience right now, listeners,

62
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,340
hands up, who knows what the hell any of that was?

63
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,900
Who knows? That is important to ask, yes.

64
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,680
Because I think there's a lot of listeners

65
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,980
that are younger than us.

66
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,460
Now, we're not that old, but we're old,

67
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,920
so I'm wondering, do all those references make sense?

68
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,300
Obviously you've seen the title of this episode,

69
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,540
but are you as big Lucille Ball fans as we are?

70
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,020
Are you as steeped in television history?

71
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,220
Well. Especially, I'll say, Mike and I

72
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,340
have been preparing for this episode now for three years.

73
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,300
I was thinking, yeah, I didn't do a ton,

74
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,540
and I was like, I think I'll be set.

75
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,980
I think that won't be a problem.

76
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,260
That's okay. I have a feeling

77
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,720
that the other two are gonna go ape shit here.

78
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,740
I think that people know that the show I Love Lucy

79
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,700
had a scene where a bunch of chocolates

80
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,580
were in a factory going very fast.

81
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,820
I don't know if people are super familiar

82
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,520
with the behind the scenes drama involving

83
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,780
actor William Frawley, who played Fred Mertz,

84
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,100
which I assume a lot of this will be about.

85
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,660
This is gonna be a lot about William Frawley.

86
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,860
It's really a William Frawley attribute.

87
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,500
Some of that also could apply to,

88
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,260
because by the end of the production

89
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,680
of the second iteration of I Love Lucy,

90
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,520
the Lucy Desi comedy hour,

91
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,480
Desi Arnaz pretty burned out too.

92
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,600
I think they're all burned out.

93
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,760
They're all burned out.

94
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,120
Lucy and Desi, the divorce papers are filed

95
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,120
five days after shooting Raps in 1960.

96
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,760
So. Ready to go.

97
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,160
This is a real, this is not a Patreon episode.

98
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,400
This is a real, we forced this to be a real

99
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,960
main feed episode. We forced this

100
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,820
just as Universal in Florida put a Lucy attribute

101
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,860
front and center at the park.

102
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,900
It was one of the first things as you came in.

103
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,460
The first things.

104
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,860
I think this one we really owe to explaining what it is.

105
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,140
We've been talking about I Love Lucy, but why?

106
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,260
Because Universal Studios in both Hollywood and Florida

107
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,420
had basically a museum exhibit for many, many years

108
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,860
called Lucy Attributes.

109
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,020
Right.

110
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,620
Where they had collected a lot of her real memorabilia,

111
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,280
her Emmys, her clothing and wardrobe.

112
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,120
And costume.

113
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,960
Yes.

114
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,780
And we'll explain all the things that were in there.

115
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,940
But yes, a long time ago, I think right when we announced

116
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,940
the Patreon, the second gate, I think I said,

117
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,120
as kind of a perfect example of the kind of more obscure

118
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,160
oddity that would be behind the second gate,

119
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,860
that that could include Lucy Attribute,

120
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,580
which I quickly realized was an early act of

121
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,040
Hollywood Gardener heel villainy.

122
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,880
Yes.

123
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,160
That I would suggest that this not be a main feed episode.

124
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,480
It was very much needed to be.

125
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,480
But also just showing the passion that Mike and I

126
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,040
have for all this, just like the passion of Lucy Ricardo

127
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,960
wanting to be in the show.

128
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,200
That's your passion for Lucy Ricardo being in our show.

129
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,040
Yes.

130
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,100
Yep.

131
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,820
I mean, look, now that this is how it's played out,

132
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,460
I die of no problem with it.

133
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,140
I'm very fond of Lucy Attribute.

134
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,980
Sure.

135
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,700
It's certainly not an issue.

136
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,220
And there's more fun to be had at patreon.com

137
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,380
slash podcastsaride.

138
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,100
But in your, I mean, that's a good rationale, I guess.

139
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,800
But like, what is the main argument to put this

140
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,820
in the main feed and not the second gate?

141
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,520
Well, look, this is, I consider this sort of an e-ticket

142
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,240
when it comes to things I like to talk about.

143
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,120
So maybe that's the only rationale I really have.

144
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,000
You maybe were concerned about the fact that sometimes,

145
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,320
occasionally, very sparingly, the second gates are like

146
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,240
only an hour 45.

147
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,080
Yeah.

148
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,880
And you were concerned about the possibility

149
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,480
that this might come up short

150
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,160
and that there wouldn't be the full time.

151
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,820
Yeah, because we generally, yeah, the patrons are like,

152
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,940
yes, as you're saying, 15 minutes shorter,

153
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,780
30 minutes shorter on occasion.

154
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,620
Once in a while.

155
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,460
Once in a while.

156
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,980
But we do need the possibility.

157
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,420
I'm not saying this is two and a half hours here,

158
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,020
but it's possible.

159
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,820
One of the biggest stars of the 20th century, though.

160
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,620
One of the biggest comedic stuff.

161
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,100
I mean, you look at, if this museum,

162
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,420
if this tiny little museum was anywhere else,

163
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,740
you'd be like, what an incredible collection.

164
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,280
Because you just saw how many awards.

165
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,560
Like, she had barely passed away

166
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,440
before she was posthumously given

167
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,240
the Presidential Medal of Freedom?

168
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,080
Like Rush Limbaugh just got?

169
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,560
Yes, yes, that one.

170
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,680
Lucy and Rush Limbaugh have the same award?

171
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,360
That doesn't seem right.

172
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,720
I believe it's the highest honor a civilian can get

173
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,560
from the President.

174
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,200
Well, I guess they both really just gave so much

175
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,600
to the culture.

176
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,440
Yeah.

177
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,100
Love the media personalities.

178
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,420
Yeah, universally.

179
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,400
Multiple formats.

180
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,240
Universally.

181
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,660
Started on the radio.

182
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,800
That's true, yes.

183
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,140
Took it to, I assume Rush Limbaugh sang to

184
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,540
produce albums. Yes, Limbaugh sings the old one.

185
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,860
Rush sings the old ones.

186
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,780
Oh man.

187
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,460
Was an album of him singing Swanee River.

188
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,380
They're very similar types, aren't they?

189
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,660
I don't know politically if they were, but probably.

190
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,620
Circular head, you mean, like,

191
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,940
is sort of what you're talking about?

192
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,360
He hadn't been bald and cantankerous.

193
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,560
Is there a world where there's more conservative talk radio

194
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,760
and William Fowley had his own show, like in the old days?

195
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,600
Maybe.

196
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,040
Lucy was a member of the Communist Party briefly.

197
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,880
Oh really?

198
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,760
Yeah, back in the 30s, like back when it was more of a-

199
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,600
Back when it was cool.

200
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,160
But had to speak, I don't believe named names,

201
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,840
but got polled in front of a closed door meeting

202
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,420
with the House on American Activities Committee.

203
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,620
Whoa.

204
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,620
And I believe saved by the fact that she was, again,

205
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,700
one of the biggest stars in the country.

206
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,940
I Love Lucy was so huge in its time,

207
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,100
I was reading that some businesses closed down

208
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,180
Monday nights.

209
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,020
What?

210
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,980
Because like no one is going to come shop,

211
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,740
everyone will be home watching Lucy.

212
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,060
I know, but I love it.

213
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,900
Sure.

214
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,060
There are so many wonderful like anecdotes

215
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,720
from the museum or from the article,

216
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
like the LA Times when they opened

217
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,160
the Universal Studios Hollywood one,

218
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,040
had an article with some really interesting stuff in it.

219
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,600
Lucy O'Paul, considered for the role

220
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,960
that Angela Lansbury did in the Manchurian candidate.

221
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,480
She's great in that.

222
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,920
I mean, I think Lucy would have been great in it too.

223
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,760
Had done some work like film noir kind of movies

224
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
earlier in her career.

225
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,800
Lucy was not, yeah, like as much of a comedic actress

226
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,600
earlier in her career.

227
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,780
Have you seen any, has anybody seen the non comedic?

228
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,060
I have seen one and I'm trying to remember what it was.

229
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,900
I should really know what that is.

230
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,500
There's one on Canopy where she plays

231
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,900
like a femme fatale I believe.

232
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,440
Never quite the success though

233
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,820
that the sitcom would bring.

234
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,020
No, and she was blonde early in her career.

235
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,860
She was blonde.

236
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,460
She was not a redhead, right?

237
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,660
Yeah, MGM casting I believe suggested she died red.

238
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,980
And that was the iconic look.

239
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,380
Here look, I also want to say this to the listeners.

240
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,040
We've done a lot of good rides for months now.

241
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,440
We've done like mostly rides on the main feed.

242
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,880
We got back to rides.

243
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,200
We made a point of that.

244
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,040
Yes.

245
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,400
So this is months in at this point.

246
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,280
It's finally time for you to listen

247
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,800
to our indulgent garbage again.

248
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,320
Jason and Mike can have a little Lucy attribute

249
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,160
as a treat.

250
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,980
That's right.

251
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,820
As they say on the internet.

252
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,720
On the main feed every four months,

253
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,040
you're allowed to listen to us talk about

254
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,560
some old drunk character actor.

255
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,400
That's what this trade off should be.

256
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,360
Or a whole cast of character actors.

257
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,700
They're all drunks.

258
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,540
Yeah.

259
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,600
They all drank a lot.

260
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,260
That was the time.

261
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,620
They were all depressed.

262
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,340
Hey, no chore for me.

263
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,980
I really liked this thing.

264
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,580
Am I fair and very fond of this thing?

265
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,020
I think if you grew up close to Universal Studios Hollywood,

266
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,500
you're certainly very fond of this.

267
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,300
And I mean we've done an episode also

268
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,540
about the world of Cinemagic show and all that.

269
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,540
And thinking about this attraction

270
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,140
does take me back to how glorious it was

271
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,460
to be at Universal Studios Hollywood

272
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,880
as a kid who's interested in entertainment and TV

273
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,780
and wants to know more about the things that are on TV.

274
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,540
And things like this were such cat nap.

275
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,380
Oh, for sure.

276
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,980
And even in Florida as well.

277
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,980
Universal Studios Florida.

278
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,900
Because this and Alfred Hitchcock back to back.

279
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,740
Yeah.

280
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,820
And every one of my family, we loved both of them.

281
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,820
Because Alfred Hitchcock presents.

282
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,580
You have to remember as this opens,

283
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,820
91 I think in Hollywood.

284
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,700
In the lower lot expansion in Universal Studios Hollywood.

285
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,060
One of the things made possible by the Starway.

286
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,060
The big series of escalators that we did

287
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,380
an entire episode about on the second gate.

288
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,300
Sure.

289
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,300
And then in Universal Studios Florida opened in 1992.

290
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,860
I saw an Orlando Sentinel article

291
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,740
erroneously called an opening day attraction.

292
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,660
Clearly it is not.

293
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,500
Bullshit.

294
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,660
It took over a lot of something called

295
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,140
silver screen collectibles where you could buy

296
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,500
screen worn costumes and props.

297
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,860
Which was also the case at Sid Kowenga's

298
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,580
one of a kind Curios.

299
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,100
That's 100% right Scott.

300
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,740
At the MGM studios.

301
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,580
Yes.

302
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,540
Which I believe is now a help desk.

303
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,420
Like a Disney plus.

304
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,780
Or my magic.

305
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,420
My magic plus?

306
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,940
The Disney band.

307
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,780
The magic band help.

308
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,500
When we went there last year I was like the most.

309
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,540
What took the nostalgia.

310
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,260
Like what gave me such a nostalgia jolt

311
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,740
was looking at Sid Kowenga's for the first.

312
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,820
I know there's nothing in that building anymore.

313
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,660
But I like.

314
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,480
Oh I love it.

315
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

316
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,740
It was a weird thing to be in a theme park.

317
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,220
And I forget, I feel like there were like

318
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,140
it was like old movie posters.

319
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,460
And you could buy like a jacket that was born

320
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,620
in like what about Bob or something.

321
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,740
Like that kind of odd.

322
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,580
Cost of fortune.

323
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,420
Like touch stone kind of.

324
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,260
Yeah, yeah.

325
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,500
And who ever bought anything from there?

326
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,900
Did that work?

327
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,860
I don't know.

328
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,820
And how checked on was it?

329
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,900
Remember there was that spot at downtown Disney.

330
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,460
The movie memorabilia stuff.

331
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,740
The starabilia.

332
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,420
Starabilia that kept having like this is not legitimate.

333
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,660
Like.

334
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,500
God.

335
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,180
This may not be signed by,

336
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,020
may not have been signed by Babe Ruth.

337
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,980
So when this opens in the early 90s, 91 and 92,

338
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,820
especially in Universal Studios Florida,

339
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,660
you have to remember Nick at Night

340
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,460
is airing I Love Lucy every night of the week.

341
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,380
Sometimes all night in the summer.

342
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,020
Well and it was so heavily syndicated.

343
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,860
Oh yeah.

344
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,980
There was definitely, yeah when we were kids

345
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,900
I Love Lucy was still on all the time.

346
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,740
All the time.

347
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,580
So constant.

348
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,420
And like yeah right.

349
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,660
So you have the Lucy attribute right down the street

350
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,540
from one of the Nickelodeon Studios outposts.

351
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,540
And so like that is an early maybe inadvertent synergy.

352
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,580
Oh yeah.

353
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,980
That's kind of like,

354
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,140
it's kind of everything you're watching potentially.

355
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,460
At least us I bet.

356
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,780
We're watching Double Dare when it's during the day

357
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,500
and maybe a little I Love Lucy before you go to bed.

358
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,060
I loved all those game shows

359
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,540
but watching so much I Love Lucy

360
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,540
which is just such a rock solid show.

361
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,660
Like still funny, still holds up.

362
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,020
They shot it on film so it still looks good.

363
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,700
It doesn't look like shit like a lot of TV shows.

364
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,540
Yeah.

365
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,380
They've colorized.

366
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,780
They still look really nice.

367
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,300
Yeah I watched some colorized clips.

368
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,460
It is weird to see in color.

369
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,580
But.

370
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,220
I'm gonna say we're taking an anti-colorization stance

371
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,540
on the hot button issue of colorization.

372
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,900
Do you prefer your I Love Lucy Christmas special

373
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,420
colorized or not?

374
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,220
Let us know.

375
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,140
That'll be a hotly contested debate on Twitter.

376
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,340
I make an exception for that one

377
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,620
because I wanna see the Christmas colors.

378
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,020
Oh okay so the Christmas one is good

379
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,140
but the other ones are bad.

380
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,500
Yeah yeah yeah only but I wanna see

381
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,180
my Christmas reds and greens.

382
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,900
I watched the full clip of Fred from,

383
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,700
I believe it's the first episode that aired.

384
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,380
There was a pilot that they didn't air

385
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,220
but used like the script later on I believe.

386
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,780
Where Fred and Ricky are trying to do housework

387
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,860
and Fred makes the really shitty cake

388
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,780
and then Ricky puts like makes the chickens explode

389
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,940
in the pressure cooker and then says like

390
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,700
do you think a pound of rice is enough for every person?

391
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,340
And it's like oh yeah that sounds right.

392
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,860
And then the chickens explode

393
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,580
and the rice starts bubbling over

394
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,580
and I have never heard still a longer studio audience break.

395
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,020
Maybe Lucy stopping the grapes.

396
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,540
I believe I know one in the longest studio.

397
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,180
It's in a Lucy Desi comedy hour

398
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,340
where she's holding eggs secretly in her apron

399
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,980
and it's like the longest studio laugh I believe.

400
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,740
And then someone gives her a bear hug or something

401
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,580
and they all get crushed.

402
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,060
Something like that and squashes all the eggs under.

403
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,180
I know this I did not like relook this up.

404
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,060
This is just something I have in my mind, my memory.

405
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,900
Wow.

406
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,740
Yeah.

407
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,260
It's becoming clear to me that you guys have the fodder

408
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,020
to just do an entire I Love Lucy podcast.

409
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,860
Podcast?

410
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,700
It's a podcast.

411
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,540
You need an idea for.

412
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,220
And I'll hang out.

413
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,140
I'll contribute once in a while

414
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,860
but I think you'd mainly feel it.

415
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,700
I'm sure there's an audience for it.

416
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,740
I'm sure the public right now is really hoping

417
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,340
we do do that.

418
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,140
Spin off much like, see you've just offered us a spin off.

419
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,980
Much like Desi Arnaz offered William Frawley

420
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,100
and Vivian Vance a chance to have their own Mertz's spin off

421
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,260
which was their last name.

422
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,340
Way predating the Ropers.

423
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,180
Yes.

424
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,660
The cantankerous neighbor spin off of Wait, Please Company.

425
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,780
How long did that last?

426
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,620
Was that very short?

427
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,780
That one I think, I went, wait, was that like a one season

428
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,300
or did it go a little bit?

429
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,420
I was shocked researching this

430
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,900
and looking at some of the exhibit stuff

431
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,780
and then just going out and reading about it.

432
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,540
I knew the Lucy show,

433
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,740
Lucy's second TV show round for a while,

434
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:12,420
here's Lucy, the third show with Gail Gordon and the kids.

435
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,740
Yes, his real life kids.

436
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,420
Her real life kids ran for so many seasons.

437
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,700
I thought that was like a one or two season flop.

438
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,220
It ran for years.

439
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,100
Five or six seasons. Life with Lucy,

440
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,180
Life with Lucy, the 1980s attempt at a comeback

441
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,100
produced by Aaron Spelling died after eight episodes.

442
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,340
Starring Jenny Lewis.

443
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,580
From Rilo Kiley.

444
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,580
Rilo Kiley and Solo.

445
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,660
And there's a really great,

446
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,860
I thought we'd get to this later,

447
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,940
but there's a really great story she has about,

448
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,580
cause she was living with her mom in the valley

449
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,780
and she describes their house as kind of a dump.

450
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,220
And Lucy came in cause they had the wrap party there

451
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,820
and Lucy walked in the door and went, this is a dump.

452
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,660
Oh my God.

453
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,380
Imagine like old 80s Lucy, she's got the oldest voice.

454
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,300
I would throw up on this house, but it might improve it.

455
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,140
Very cantankerous Lucy.

456
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,740
By the way, The Ropers was a two season show.

457
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,420
It was not a big, and only 28 episodes,

458
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,740
but mainly I want to complain about when I Googled Ropers,

459
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,980
they're showing me a bit like fancy boots and shit.

460
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,580
I don't want to, are you kidding me?

461
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,420
I don't want to know about boots.

462
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,660
I obviously want to know about the Threes company spinoff.

463
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,860
Have you, phone, have you been paying attention

464
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,980
to everything else I've Googled?

465
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,940
Do you think I want to know about fancy shoes?

466
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,100
No, I want to learn about Norman Fell.

467
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,020
Yeah, come on phone.

468
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,860
My phone prompts me like,

469
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,980
you probably want to drive to Mike's right now, right?

470
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,300
It's like, come on phone.

471
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,140
Yes, I do.

472
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,820
It is usually when we do this.

473
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,060
You probably want to Google Vivian Vance trivia right now.

474
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,900
Right? Yes.

475
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,580
You just woke up.

476
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,660
The first thing you want to do is.

477
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,660
I'm assuming the Mertzes did not happen

478
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,860
because they did not care for each other.

479
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,500
Right? Well, one of them wanted to do it.

480
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,380
And one of them did not.

481
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,780
Frawley was all in and Vivian Vance said,

482
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,780
no, she did not like him.

483
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,620
Yeah.

484
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,820
So yeah, the main, obviously we've been jonesing

485
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,820
to talk about that the neighbors and the landlord.

486
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,900
Yeah, so let's say what I Love Lucy was about

487
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,500
in case you don't know what we're talking about.

488
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,980
It was a woman, Lucille Ricardo,

489
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,340
married to Ricky Ricardo, who was a band leader.

490
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,420
Neelusiel McGillicuddy.

491
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,260
Yes, that's true.

492
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,260
That was important that you got that in there.

493
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,980
Very important to what I was explaining.

494
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,180
Well, it does illustrate the cultural differences of.

495
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,020
That's true.

496
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,860
Change it.

497
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,820
That's true, you're right, you're right.

498
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,660
And she always wanted to be in his show

499
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,180
because he would play at clubs, he would sing,

500
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,140
then he had his own club.

501
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,260
That's another thing, we'll get into that later.

502
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,100
And that she always wanted to be in the.

503
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,260
Three hours from now.

504
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,460
Put a bookmark in there.

505
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,300
He started the club.

506
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,180
The seed of Club Babalu.

507
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,580
He was at the Tropicana,

508
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,140
and then he moved to the Club Babalu.

509
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,380
You have to realize sitcom characters

510
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,420
had not had children up until that point.

511
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,900
This was revolutionary, four characters to.

512
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,300
You know what, we have not said the words

513
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,980
Universal Studios in two and a half hours.

514
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,380
Now, an interesting fact that this was at Universal Studios

515
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,620
because all the Desi Lu shows were sold to Paramount,

516
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,140
and the production apparatus of Desi Lu

517
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,540
became the backbone of Paramount Television.

518
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,980
Pretty cool, pretty cool.

519
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
All right, got that one out.

520
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,980
A long time, the largest independent television producer.

521
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,380
Okay, okay, now Jason, rest up so you can tell us

522
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,140
the square footage of the studios where the show was taped.

523
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,980
But take a breather first, don't get it out now.

524
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,580
I had to brace myself for the gray paint stuff.

525
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,580
Desi Lu produced Star Trek.

526
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,860
Mission Impossible, the Untouchables.

527
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,700
Pretty good.

528
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,420
I didn't know until going out the door today

529
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,140
that her husband was overseeing a lot of those properties,

530
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,220
and I think a lot of producers were not happy

531
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,500
with him as the head of Desi Lu.

532
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,340
Gary Morton?

533
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,300
Gary Morton.

534
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,300
Right, her second husband.

535
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,860
Her second comedian who she later married, yeah, yeah.

536
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,860
And anytime I watch an interview

537
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,020
where she's talking about Gary,

538
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,940
she never seems that thrilled with him.

539
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,460
She's always mad that Desi was a philanderer

540
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,740
and was running around.

541
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,580
And then she's like, but Gary's fine.

542
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,340
That's the vibe I get.

543
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,140
I have no specific problem with Gary.

544
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,500
Does anyone watch old Lucy interviews

545
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
once in a while on YouTube like I do?

546
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,660
I can't say I do.

547
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,700
It's kind of a bummer,

548
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,340
because she just seems so over it,

549
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,540
and it's just like, oh, hi,

550
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,380
and then she laughs once in a while,

551
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,580
and she just seems tired.

552
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,340
You know what I looked up today,

553
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,420
and I'll describe things that you can't see in this,

554
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,540
but I became aware today on the way out the door

555
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:06,540
of a show called All Star TV Party for Lucille Ball.

556
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,820
I'm not sure that name.

557
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,300
Oh, no, yeah, you know, All Star, I don't know.

558
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,980
It was like a birthday party or something

559
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,260
where everyone, it was in 1984,

560
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,180
and everyone in Hollywood was there.

561
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,020
I haven't seen this.

562
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,900
It's still Rat Pack, it's still Frank,

563
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,540
and Dean Martin, and Carl Reiner, and Cesar are there.

564
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,340
I was trying to find Cesar Romero.

565
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,620
That's what I was trying to come in with,

566
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,220
but I couldn't find that clip,

567
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,140
but I did find this clip where her second husband,

568
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,180
Gary Morton, is giving her a gift,

569
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,860
and I'll explain things as we go.

570
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,580
I've wanted to do this ever since the Olympics.

571
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,660
Do what?

572
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,500
Do what?

573
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,420
He pulls out a metal, a gold metal.

574
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,060
You are truly.

575
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,900
Turn it around.

576
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,020
Always directing.

577
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,100
You are truly a gold metal wife.

578
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,100
Do what?

579
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,860
Turn it around.

580
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,860
You're not putting it on right, Gary.

581
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,860
Perfect timing.

582
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,380
So you, honestly, that illustrates my point.

583
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,580
It's not that I've ever seen her like shit on Gary,

584
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,620
but she's clearly like, okay, what the hell is this?

585
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,820
Yeah, yeah.

586
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,660
Gary.

587
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,500
This is embarrassing.

588
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,900
Gary, you're a.

589
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,260
How long have you had, how much did it cost you?

590
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,980
You probably got it for free.

591
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,740
Gary only knew like playing clubs

592
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,180
and the stages at the big resorts and the Catskills.

593
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,700
Once they were married, she was like,

594
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,580
installed him at Desi Loo, like pretty much was like,

595
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,780
you're learning the television industry.

596
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,660
No more stage antics.

597
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,740
No more.

598
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,740
And starting of, start having business room antics, Gary.

599
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,780
Took me a while to get that out.

600
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,740
I mean, you can see.

601
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,380
The best old Lucy voice is Billy West.

602
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,900
Have you ever heard Billy West do it?

603
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,740
No.

604
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,860
It's like ailing Lucy.

605
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,700
It's like, oh.

606
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,340
There's a really poor taste bit he did on Howard Stern

607
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,020
a long time ago where she's reading cards in the hospital.

608
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,860
She's like, oh, this one's from Tom Bosley.

609
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,980
Oh, what a nice man.

610
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,020
It's just that over and over again.

611
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,220
Anyway, you were saying.

612
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,500
Oh, I mean, you can see.

613
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,860
One of the things that's interesting about Lucy,

614
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,860
the tribute is it does a great job at showing how much

615
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,980
both she and Desi Arnaz were very canny business people.

616
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,220
Like they were focused on making a lot of shows,

617
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,780
making money, hitting the syndication,

618
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,620
hitting the like hundred episodes for syndication.

619
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,260
So really there might not have been a George Clooney,

620
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,380
Anna What's-his-fuck, if not for.

621
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,220
Randy Gerberg.

622
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,100
There wouldn't have been suitcases full of money

623
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,500
if not for these people making the money.

624
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,300
Would Lucy have had a tequila?

625
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,220
Would Lucy and Desi have had a tequila?

626
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,980
Oh, wow. Absolutely.

627
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,020
Maybe a rum, might have been a rum.

628
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,220
Might have been a rum because of the Cuban, yeah.

629
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,020
Yeah. Could they still?

630
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,740
Could the estate still? Oh.

631
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,820
Oh, the Babalu Rum. That's not a bad idea, Babalu Rum.

632
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,580
Yeah. Yeah.

633
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,060
Yeah, so I actually didn't finish my description

634
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,460
of what I Love Lucy was about.

635
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,860
No.

636
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,460
Really all I had to say was basically, yeah,

637
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,740
so Lucy and Ricky.

638
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,380
If they don't, people don't know what the show is,

639
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,900
they have stopped listening 15 minutes ago.

640
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,620
That's a good point, but there might be like some 20s,

641
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,500
like early 20s people that are interested.

642
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,060
So then they had some neighbors and they were up to antics.

643
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,420
They were up to antics.

644
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,340
She always wanted, yeah, she said she always wanted

645
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,180
to do the show. Yes.

646
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,220
I would find this, the official register

647
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,300
with the Writers Guild, one page,

648
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,460
like half a page description, like paragraph long.

649
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,060
This is what this show is.

650
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,860
Synopsis. Did you go to the museum

651
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,620
and pull out the, did you check the description out?

652
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,900
No, I'm saying that was one of the items in Lucy Attribute.

653
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,180
Oh. One of the things,

654
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,060
and along with her, just a staggering number

655
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,380
of awards and superlatives.

656
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,940
Like the, is the gold medal from Gary in the museum?

657
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,660
I don't think so. Oh, I don't think so.

658
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,860
World's number one wife.

659
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,500
When I die, if there's a museum about me,

660
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,980
don't put that stupid medal in there.

661
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,500
And that's my only request, goodbye.

662
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,420
That was in her will. She's gone.

663
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,300
Gary keeps sneaking into the hospital

664
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,140
and putting it around my neck while I'm sleeping.

665
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,780
It's not fair, I can't fight back.

666
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,580
And he puts it on the wrong way.

667
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,860
They did have her medal of valor.

668
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,380
She got that, I think, during Here's Lucy.

669
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,460
The medal of, what is that?

670
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,860
That's a different presidential award.

671
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,260
But Rush doesn't have that.

672
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,220
I don't think so, no.

673
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,060
Not yet. Not yet.

674
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,780
But Trump is gonna work to get that rescinded from Lucy

675
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,180
and given to maybe Hannity, maybe O'Reilly.

676
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,660
Trump will give, I think Trump should start giving out

677
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,620
only military awards to civilians.

678
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,260
Like, Limbaugh should get the Purple Heart and stuff.

679
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,980
He should get pinned, like, medal, like, general status

680
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,300
to Hannity and Tucker Carlson.

681
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,140
Yeah, yeah.

682
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,860
He'll give some gigantic, just like,

683
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:31,220
good guy trophy to Rob Lugovitch.

684
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,940
What if he'll, yeah, number one good guy medal.

685
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,580
Trump should start giving out the Gary Morton medal.

686
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,660
Number one best good guy that ever was.

687
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,140
They're waiting for him to finish the description

688
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,980
he's making up so they can inscribe it on this big trophy.

689
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,620
Oh, that was something we hadn't gotten to yet.

690
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,660
Mike, congratulations to your godfather, Rob Lugovitch.

691
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,180
I know he's a family friend.

692
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,340
Oh, yeah, we haven't talked about that yet.

693
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,980
Trump pardoned Rob, who, if you listen to the live episode

694
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,620
from Chicago, was, what hotel was he at?

695
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,460
I've already forgot.

696
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,580
He was at Saratoga Springs.

697
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,420
Oh, okay.

698
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,660
Yes. Yeah.

699
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:12,020
When he was found out that it was all going to shit for him.

700
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,180
Do you think he'll go stay at Saratoga Springs now?

701
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,020
Celebrating.

702
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,860
Getting out of jail.

703
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,700
I think he will.

704
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,540
A lot of those rooms.

705
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,380
We just did a round of refurbishments at that hotel.

706
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,940
Yeah, he'll be on the Skyliner.

707
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,900
Before we know it.

708
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,060
A little bit better than jail, I gotta say.

709
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,780
Not too shabby.

710
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,860
All right, so, are you still describing what the show is?

711
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,740
We're half an hour into the podcast.

712
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,340
We're still talking about a little bit.

713
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,020
Yeah, we basically, we've sort of said this.

714
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,700
So, yeah, so the show was just about Lucy

715
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,420
generally like fucking things up.

716
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,500
I shouldn't say that, you're right.

717
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,540
We should keep it clean,

718
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,180
because this is a classic TV show.

719
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,020
Lucy screwing things up.

720
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,860
Yeah.

721
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,660
So she, that episode you're talking about,

722
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,460
which is funny, because I believe that's the same episode

723
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,220
as the Chocolate Factory episode.

724
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,660
Yes. Where the roles are reversed.

725
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,420
I believe the lesson of that episode is,

726
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,260
stick to the gender roles, everyone.

727
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,660
Women shouldn't be working.

728
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,340
Men should not be doing housework.

729
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,860
They're both incompetent at it.

730
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,180
Stick to what works.

731
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,860
The war isn't on anymore.

732
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,980
Women don't have to be in a factory.

733
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,100
What are we doing here?

734
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,740
Maybe it wasn't all so progressive,

735
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,620
but that being said, it was funny to watch rice explode.

736
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,900
And they were very trepidatious,

737
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,660
the network at the time of like,

738
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,500
a white woman married to a Latin band leader.

739
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,460
They were worried about that.

740
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,500
They were always worried about something.

741
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,700
They couldn't say pregnant.

742
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,980
Like when Lucy was pregnant with Little Rick,

743
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,980
with Desi, Desi Jr., right?

744
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,060
Desi Ernest Jr., yeah.

745
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,100
Yeah.

746
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,860
Well, on the show was Little Ricky.

747
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,060
Yeah, when she was, yes.

748
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:55,060
The lines of Ricky and Desi are so easy to mess up.

749
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,260
The line is so thin.

750
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,940
But they had to say she was expecting.

751
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,860
Like they thought it was scandalous

752
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,460
to show a pregnant woman on TV.

753
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,820
And they just, in preparation for that season,

754
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,060
they like, the Ricardas bought like,

755
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:17,060
so many tall couches so that her bump was never visible.

756
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,340
Yeah, because that would have offended.

757
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,420
I'm so glad we bought these 16 new couches.

758
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,580
They slept in- All against the one wall.

759
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,900
In separate twin beds in one room.

760
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,020
Let's not forget that.

761
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,140
Yeah, yeah.

762
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,500
They were not allowed to show.

763
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,900
I forget what the first show is

764
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,980
where the couple was allowed to sleep in the same bed.

765
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,020
That is crazy.

766
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,100
I mean, we know that, I've known that for a long time.

767
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,860
They used to say that on Nick at Night as a fact.

768
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,580
But if you really think about it,

769
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,300
it's like the public wasn't able to see that,

770
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,980
even though that's what was happening in every marriage.

771
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,820
They went to religious leaders

772
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,580
to get approval for the pregnancy storyline.

773
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,940
Oh my God, what?

774
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,780
Yeah.

775
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,620
They asked for the approval of the-

776
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,340
They got the approval from multiple religious figures

777
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,940
of like, will this be offensive?

778
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,860
And they're like, no, it's okay to acknowledge

779
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,460
a woman is going to have a child.

780
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,460
It's like they were gonna do like an episode

781
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,540
with just tons of nudity.

782
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,780
Like we had to go and we had to make sure this was okay.

783
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,580
Where it's like, a woman was pregnant.

784
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,220
People were pregnant in public.

785
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,500
It wasn't- Yeah.

786
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,420
The people wouldn't like just stay in their house

787
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,420
while they were pregnant, as far as I know.

788
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,500
It was the 50s, it was a different time, not sure.

789
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,340
It was a different time, but-

790
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,460
Seeing what pregnant woman could go outside.

791
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,220
But the world was weird.

792
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,940
It's still very weird, but-

793
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,780
Lucy had already had a child.

794
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,460
This was the second child.

795
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,020
Like I believe she had the first before,

796
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,500
or maybe while they were filming the pilot.

797
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,140
This will be the episode that my mom will listen to

798
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,900
and have the most corrections.

799
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,940
She will say, you know, Lucy was,

800
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,580
she'll correct like whatever you just said.

801
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,300
I don't know what, if it's wrong or not,

802
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,460
but she'll say, you know, actually Jason was wrong.

803
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,180
She had a child before blank.

804
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,420
Like she'll, this is the one

805
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,340
she will pay the most attention to.

806
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,780
What's the form where we would,

807
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,180
what would be the best for issuing retractions?

808
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,180
Because once in a while we have to do this.

809
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,900
And we've done it on the air.

810
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,060
Yeah, that's a good question.

811
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,540
Yeah, would you like them in print?

812
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,940
Should we tweet that out?

813
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,580
Should we put it in a newspaper?

814
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,380
Or like a YouTube apology video?

815
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,220
Like just sort of-

816
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,060
Hey, we're so sorry.

817
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,260
We're so sorry.

818
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,940
We were incorrect when we were saying

819
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:31,820
that Desi Ernest Jr. was Lucy's second child.

820
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,020
Look, all we can do is try to be better.

821
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,300
We're gonna, you know,

822
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,500
all we can do is make a vow to you.

823
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Are we perfect? No, but nobody is.

824
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,060
The Lucy show had a first, the second show,

825
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,500
Vivian Vance in that show was the first divorced woman-

826
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,340
Oh yeah.

827
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,620
Character on television.

828
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,900
William Frawley was divorced in real life in 1924, I think.

829
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,020
Whoa, whoa.

830
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,420
Somehow divorced before he was married.

831
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,260
Yes.

832
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,340
Not quite sure, somehow.

833
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,060
Came out of the womb divorced.

834
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,900
Yeah.

835
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,060
Well, I mean, all of that was to say

836
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:13,860
that there are two characters and they have neighbors.

837
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,580
The neighbors are cranks.

838
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,420
The neighbors are cranky.

839
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,820
And we've been obsessed for a long time with the,

840
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,580
it's certainly my biggest area of I Love Lucy interest

841
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,020
is William Frawley. Frawley based.

842
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,860
William Frawley, yes.

843
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,700
Yeah.

844
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,740
Because he's an old weird character actor,

845
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,580
not that weird, but like an old curmudgeon-y character actor,

846
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,940
which you have an affection for.

847
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,940
He reminds me in his performance of these old weirdos

848
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,740
who were in theme park rides or Disney movies,

849
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,300
like your Keenan Winds or your Little Ravenscruffs,

850
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,100
but he, there's not always like bad stories

851
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,180
about the personal lives of these people,

852
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,460
but William Frawley seemed like he had a myth.

853
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,740
He's got some, yes.

854
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,140
I didn't find anything so crazy unless you have it.

855
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,180
No, just generally unpleasant.

856
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,060
Just generally an unhappy man.

857
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:05,300
Yeah, an alcoholic was given a referent,

858
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,340
like when they were gonna hire him,

859
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,900
like Desi had to sit him down,

860
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,180
but apparently he was never late for work.

861
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,980
He was always very professional.

862
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,340
A different story on My Three Sons, I believe.

863
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,980
Yes, I think he was drunk.

864
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,060
I heard an interview with one of the children

865
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,340
from My Three Sons saying that they'd have to go get him

866
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,340
from lunch because he would be like drinking

867
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,460
and they'd make the kids go get William Frawley

868
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,660
from the like, whatever, the restaurant down the street

869
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,500
from Paramount.

870
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,340
Yeah.

871
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,500
The My Three Sons story I found was that My Three Sons

872
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,580
was taping on the same lot as the Lucy show,

873
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,820
which Vivian Vance was still a part of for her next show.

874
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:48,300
And as we said, these actors did not get along at all.

875
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,300
And I guess it was still Sour Grapes even after

876
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,220
By Love Lucy.

877
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,020
Oh, I think I did see, I saw this story.

878
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,860
Yeah, yeah, I could keep going.

879
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,860
So he would, when the Lucy show was taping,

880
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:05,860
he would go over and like drop a big stack of film canisters

881
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,420
or knock equipment over during her lines

882
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,100
in the live tapings just to mess her up.

883
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,180
That is one of the funniest things I've ever heard.

884
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,860
Really, really funny.

885
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:25,180
I also, another story I saw was that there was an episode

886
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,380
called Lucy Has Her Eyes Examined.

887
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,860
And Vivian Vance watched William Frawley get the script

888
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,180
for this episode.

889
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,900
And Frawley asked, is this next week's script?

890
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,020
And she said, no, it's this week

891
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,100
and we're filming it in 15 minutes.

892
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,580
He'd never laid eyes on the script

893
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,260
that they were about to walk out and do.

894
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,100
I, it's interesting,

895
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,060
cause I was reading some of those things too.

896
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,620
And I've always read a pro Vance,

897
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,620
like a pro Vance version of the story

898
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,340
where he's like just a cranky asshole

899
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,260
and she's like upset having to work with him.

900
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,900
But then I read some pro Frawley stuff.

901
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,680
It might be pro Frawley propaganda, I don't know.

902
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,060
But apparently early on,

903
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,940
cause Frawley was like 20 years older than everybody.

904
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,580
So she was like upset that she had to be married

905
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,140
to this old guy.

906
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,660
Like 24 is maybe the number.

907
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,100
That's pretty, that's a big insult there.

908
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,420
Supposedly early on she was complaining about it

909
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,300
and he was with an ear shot and she didn't know.

910
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,380
And he was furious.

911
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,340
And like that started it.

912
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,420
And then when she turned down the Mertz's spinoff,

913
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,060
then it was over.

914
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,900
That was it.

915
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,980
He was so upset cause he wanted that show

916
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,820
for himself and her, or not her,

917
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,660
he probably just for himself.

918
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,060
But it's so wild cause they're both so funny.

919
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,820
Especially together.

920
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,940
They're great together.

921
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,820
Yes, yeah, very much so.

922
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,100
I was warned about language in this episode.

923
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,340
I already said enough word though.

924
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,380
So whatever.

925
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,540
Well, but I, you know, I kind of,

926
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,460
I copy pasted this from an article

927
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,140
where they did a censorship and I liked their censorship.

928
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,740
So I'll copy this.

929
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,580
That, you know, she would have a lot of script notes

930
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:08,340
and the head writer, Jess Oppenheimer,

931
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,700
would be called down to the set to mediate.

932
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,780
And, you know, he would say, look,

933
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,340
I know it was her idea, but I like it.

934
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,020
I think it's gonna work and I think you should do it.

935
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,820
And Frawley would say, I'll do it for you,

936
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,620
but not for the witch.

937
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,100
Pfft, cheese.

938
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,220
From this article, Frawley would actually use a word

939
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,820
that rhymes with witch.

940
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,900
Cheese.

941
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,100
I kind of like it with witch, honestly.

942
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,860
Well, witch makes it a little more, yeah, nice.

943
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,740
It's not nice, but it makes it nicer.

944
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,900
Yeah, yeah.

945
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,700
Now was he a pioneer in being the first actor

946
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,700
to call his co-star a word that rhymes with the witch?

947
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,500
I bet no.

948
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,540
I bet that might have been a thing that happened.

949
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,460
Maybe more common in the early 18th century.

950
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,100
Things were, as we said, things were different back then.

951
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,460
Frawley lived at, if you ever visit Los Angeles,

952
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,820
the Knickerbocker Apartments.

953
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,660
I mean, it's a hotel, wow.

954
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,260
It used to be a hotel.

955
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,900
Oh, is it apartments now?

956
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,460
I think it's a retirement home now.

957
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,620
I have 1714 Ivar.

958
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,380
Kind of an infamous location.

959
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,940
This is where Harry Houdini's widow held the 10th seance

960
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,460
after his death.

961
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,540
I believe the final seance that ended

962
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,860
when she tried to contact him.

963
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,740
He insisted on being in contact.

964
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,220
And I think the 10th one was the last,

965
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,420
he said, do it for 10 years after I died.

966
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,740
The 10th one, they thought there was no sign

967
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,420
and then a thunderstorm broke out.

968
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,260
Whoa.

969
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,700
Well, I think that what had happened was

970
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,580
that there was a word he gave her.

971
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,820
Before he died, he gave her a word and he said,

972
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,580
this will prove if this is real or not.

973
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:46,180
And then they did all the seances and he never came

974
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,340
and never gave the word and disapproved

975
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,260
because he didn't like psychics and stuff.

976
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,380
He was annoyed by them.

977
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,460
Oh, okay.

978
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,820
But anyway, the thunderstorm came

979
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,380
and then that gives you a little hope that he is there.

980
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,220
That's what you're saying.

981
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:03,220
That's a Hollywood tower where some ghostly activity

982
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,380
Thank you. has occurred.

983
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,780
E.W. Griffith.

984
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,140
If there was somebody teetering on the edge

985
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,540
of turning this off, you said that and they went,

986
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,740
oh yeah, that's a tower of terror.

987
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,060
Good, good.

988
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,700
D.W. Griffith died of a brain hemorrhage

989
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,660
after being discovered in the lobby unconscious

990
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,740
and Graham Nash was living there when Cass Elliot

991
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,900
picked him up to go to a party where he met

992
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,060
Steven Stills and David Crosby.

993
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,580
Whoa, pretty cool.

994
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,260
I'm trying to figure out if this was,

995
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,780
cause Frawley lived, I believe in the same place

996
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,700
for much of his career and died right outside of it.

997
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,660
And I think it's this building.

998
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,020
The nurse pulled him inside to try to resuscitate him.

999
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,980
I guess he was going with it.

1000
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,100
He was walking around with the nurse.

1001
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,620
He went to a movie apparently and the nurse pulled him

1002
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,100
inside to try to resuscitate him, but it was no use.

1003
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,100
I read somewhere where people think Frawley haunts the bar.

1004
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,300
Sloppy Frawley.

1005
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,740
Yeah, which is, yeah, we like old character actors

1006
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,900
who live in a hotel and have a presence at a bar.

1007
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,420
His star on the Walk of Fame is not quite there,

1008
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:11,420
but very, very close to that, to the spot on the sidewalk

1009
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:15,540
where I guess he, where it happened, where he passed away.

1010
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,260
How many stars on the Walk of Fame

1011
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,860
are right where someone died?

1012
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,420
That's true.

1013
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,620
That's probably the only one.

1014
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,900
Well, it's like unrelated people, you would think.

1015
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,500
But yeah, he might have closest proximity

1016
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,420
between star and dead spot.

1017
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,980
Probably.

1018
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,820
Lucy has two stars, one for TV, one for film

1019
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,860
on the Walk of Fame.

1020
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,780
And probably stars on the Walk, the fake Walks of Fame

1021
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,020
at all of the theme parks.

1022
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,980
Probably, yes, hers, she has one at Universal Florida

1023
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:49,140
right by the Brown Derby, right down the few feet away

1024
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,380
from the tribute.

1025
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,940
In Palm Springs, there's that Walk of Fame they have.

1026
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,780
Oh yes.

1027
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,820
She has to be there.

1028
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,340
We need to do a whole episode on that.

1029
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,700
That'll be Patreon.

1030
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,380
Liberace is there.

1031
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,140
We're just gonna go through the stars.

1032
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,300
Patreon, Patreon.

1033
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,140
Behind the paint wall.

1034
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,940
Palm Springs was sort of a very mid-century.

1035
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,460
Around the time of I Love Lucy,

1036
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,220
Palm Springs, I feel like just booming.

1037
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,340
Hell, the Salton Sea probably still very booming

1038
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,660
in the insane resort community of an inland sea

1039
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:27,660
as a result of irrigation runoff.

1040
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,100
That's now a natural disaster.

1041
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,580
Like it's just a catastrophe.

1042
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,660
That's like a never saved spot.

1043
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,140
We'll get to irrigation behind the paywall.

1044
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,780
But it's crazy to think about the times

1045
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,540
that when Lucy was airing from the early 50s

1046
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,380
right up until 1960, there's an episode

1047
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,980
where they go to Havana because the Bay of Castro

1048
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,420
and the Bay of Pay, all of that hadn't happened yet.

1049
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,820
So it was still the Cuba of Godfather II.

1050
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,100
It was still the gambling mob Cuba.

1051
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,620
Is that the Cesar Romero episode?

1052
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,820
I'm trying to remember.

1053
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,900
He did guest star.

1054
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,220
A lot of great guest stars on the show.

1055
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,620
This also feels like a very Robert Osborn style episode

1056
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,620
that we're doing here.

1057
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,620
Why, and many of our Hollywood friends

1058
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,020
would pop by the show as well.

1059
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,420
Let's bring it back to the museum for a minute.

1060
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,420
Yeah, yeah.

1061
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,380
Not forever.

1062
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,220
We'll get off that.

1063
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,060
That's fine.

1064
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,880
We like the museum.

1065
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,300
Okay, the museum, yeah, was very neat.

1066
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,180
I liked it aesthetically.

1067
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:33,420
It was very old universal with its film reel,

1068
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,020
a trim across the floors and the ceilings.

1069
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,740
One thing that I think was really cool in there

1070
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:46,100
was the recreation of the set, a little model of the set,

1071
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,500
which was some, the thing that's gone away

1072
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,260
from universal a little bit, the education

1073
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,340
about how old Hollywood stuff was made,

1074
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,580
and getting to see that set and realizing

1075
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,260
the way that sitcoms happen now,

1076
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,660
where there's standing sets and maybe most traditionally

1077
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,140
three major sets that don't really move.

1078
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,220
I think in the old days with sitcoms,

1079
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,020
I think sitcom sets used to be much flimsier,

1080
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,420
and they wanted these sets to be way better.

1081
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,620
So this idea of like, here's a line of sets

1082
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,060
and we go down the row and these three never move.

1083
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:24,120
You can add other ones like swing sets down the line,

1084
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,620
but what, I guess the apartment and the club,

1085
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,660
and I'm blanking on what the other one might have been.

1086
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,500
I guess that's a separate idea.

1087
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,620
The kitchen, the bedroom, the living room.

1088
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,580
Would you see the cat or the fire escape or the.

1089
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,420
Yeah, on occasion though.

1090
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,260
I guess you wouldn't go to,

1091
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,100
did they go to the Mertzes very often?

1092
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,940
Once in a while.

1093
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,780
Once in a blue moon, yeah.

1094
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,820
But I don't think that was always, not every episode.

1095
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:49,420
But the, also in the genuine education of that,

1096
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,980
okay, so the way shows are set,

1097
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,180
like the three cameras set up,

1098
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,860
essentially the show pioneered

1099
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,780
and that exhibit taught you that

1100
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,740
and shows you like the types of shots

1101
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,140
that like here's a wide, a medium and a close.

1102
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,700
And so like, yeah, but with the way all sitcoms are done now

1103
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,140
was pioneered by Desi pretty specifically.

1104
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,860
And they bring up in the exhibit, Carl Freund.

1105
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,020
I didn't know any of this until like,

1106
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,880
I reminded myself and saw pictures of the exhibit

1107
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,940
that Carl Freund was the DP of the show

1108
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,260
and he's why it looks so beautiful

1109
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:26,340
and like just glorious black and white film.

1110
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,540
But I didn't know any of this

1111
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,820
that he was the DP of Metropolis and Dracula.

1112
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,860
Oh, I didn't know that.

1113
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,620
Yeah. Major, major.

1114
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,460
That's wild.

1115
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,780
Crazy, like some of the best shot movies

1116
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,780
of the first half of the century.

1117
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,620
Yeah.

1118
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:45,140
And I think he was maybe reticent to do I Love Lucy,

1119
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,540
but Desi really wanted him specifically

1120
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,780
and he's eyeing it and going,

1121
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,940
well, I don't like the way sitcoms look.

1122
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,140
So if I'm gonna do this, I wanna do it my way.

1123
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:57,340
So that standing set thing was partially came off of him.

1124
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,980
Like, I don't wanna be filming these flimsy sets

1125
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,580
for the Wall Shake.

1126
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:03,080
And also he's like, we have to be able to like,

1127
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,340
shoot this fast and make these tapings

1128
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,740
not exhausting for people.

1129
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,940
So all the lights are gonna be going up.

1130
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,620
They're all up on a grid, which was a revolutionary thing.

1131
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,460
And that's the way every show is done now

1132
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,260
from sitcom to talk show or anything done in the studio.

1133
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:21,060
But I think before this, sitcoms are still like,

1134
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:24,060
crazy wires all over the crown and like bringing a light.

1135
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:24,900
And like, I think this was,

1136
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,180
I think I Love Lucy was the invention of the lighting grid.

1137
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,300
Yeah, and a big thing kind of started the trend

1138
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,740
of filming television in California.

1139
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:38,700
Because before this, television shot,

1140
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,020
film shot in California, television shot in New York.

1141
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:44,740
And yeah, a lot flimsier, a lot cheaper,

1142
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,100
a lot more kinescopes.

1143
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,900
But are they like, well, if we're gonna do it,

1144
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,940
we live in LA, it's gotta be done in LA.

1145
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,260
I think that's right.

1146
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:57,260
And he, I believe that same DP figured out a couple.

1147
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,840
One, the set was painted gray.

1148
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,020
Besides the furniture and the props and costumes,

1149
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,500
it was painted gray.

1150
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,380
And like they show you in that model.

1151
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,380
That's a really mind blowing fact.

1152
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,340
So they wanted to get the colors and the shades exactly

1153
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,020
how it was gonna look on the show.

1154
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,180
And he had figured out some sort of viewfinder

1155
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,900
to see what it would look like in black and white.

1156
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:22,300
To see what a shot would look like in black and white.

1157
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,140
There was something I saw, yeah, the newspaper,

1158
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:27,000
the newspaper prop they would read was in gray.

1159
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,940
It was not a normal looking, it was a specific gray

1160
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,820
that would look good on the camera.

1161
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,940
Or look good in the film, I mean.

1162
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,060
So yeah, it is weird.

1163
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,460
It is, if you like your history,

1164
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,880
this is such a significant thing

1165
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,420
in television history, the show.

1166
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,820
Yeah, yeah.

1167
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,220
And I love that in Hollywood it steps away from this show

1168
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,820
that we talked about a little while ago

1169
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,020
that has like, we're gonna talk about

1170
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,740
Hitchcock's filming techniques.

1171
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,580
And I think this was a special thing

1172
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,800
about early universals Hollywood,

1173
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,260
or I mean both universals, that there is a nod to earlier,

1174
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,680
to like classic film and classic TV.

1175
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,500
Now all that's kind of out the window.

1176
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,820
Now it's all like, you know, a lot more Minion content.

1177
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:08,660
There's a lot of Minions.

1178
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,580
And I don't blame, but that's what happens.

1179
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,700
It's not the craziest thing.

1180
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,420
But I liked the tie to real education.

1181
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:17,700
Well, something for mom and dad and grandma and grandpa,

1182
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,940
you know, something classic stuff

1183
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:22,020
that sort of everyone remembers.

1184
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:26,140
Like that you can have multiple generations know of.

1185
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,940
That's why like the Aladdin show that we talked about,

1186
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,540
A California Adventure, like was so well received.

1187
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:35,980
And The Frozen show is like less positively reviewed.

1188
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,860
Guest wise, I think my theory is that because like,

1189
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:44,220
you've had 20 plus years of people watching Aladdin,

1190
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,140
multiple generations developing a fondness for it.

1191
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,380
Frozen is nine years old, I guess at this point,

1192
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,220
eight years old.

1193
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,780
Some people are extremely excited about Frozen,

1194
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:57,460
but some people that haven't even watched it, like myself.

1195
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,620
I have never watched Frozen.

1196
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,940
Sure, wow.

1197
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,380
Yeah, should I watch Frozen?

1198
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,220
If you get around to it.

1199
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,060
Yeah, sure.

1200
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:04,900
It's fine, I like it.

1201
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,580
Frozen 2?

1202
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:07,820
Frozen 2's okay.

1203
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,500
The songs are okay.

1204
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,980
One's better in my mind.

1205
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:13,340
Although I'd also argue though, the reason really

1206
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,860
is that there's no Genie in The Frozen show.

1207
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:16,700
Well of course, yeah.

1208
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,940
Genie is topicality.

1209
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,140
If they just throw Genie in The Frozen show.

1210
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,700
But so it felt like, in early universal,

1211
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,500
I do remember thinking that it did give you

1212
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,580
like pretty good IP out of the gate,

1213
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:31,220
especially when Florida opens that like,

1214
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:35,820
oh, in addition to all these, to King Kong and ET

1215
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,100
and Jaws and everything, like I get to learn,

1216
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:44,700
I get to do an experience about Hitchcock and Lucille Ball.

1217
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,260
That did appeal to me as a kid.

1218
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,100
Yes.

1219
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:47,940
And probably to a lot of parents.

1220
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,900
I brought this book, I don't think I've busted this out

1221
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:54,340
before necessarily, the official pictorial guide

1222
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,500
to Universal Studios.

1223
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,340
Wow.

1224
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,700
From the early 90s, which has all page about the star way.

1225
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,460
This one really, I love this book

1226
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,420
because it's got like photos of filming

1227
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,860
Back to the Future 2, my favorite film of all time.

1228
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,700
Of course.

1229
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:12,220
And, but there's a really good, there's a good Lucy section.

1230
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:17,100
Let me find it right next to, jeez,

1231
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,980
I'm wasting a lot of time flipping through pages.

1232
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,220
I was gonna say, I'll tell a quick brief anecdote.

1233
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,780
When we went, when Lindsay and I went back to,

1234
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,380
we hadn't been to Orlando in years and years.

1235
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:33,060
In 2013, I forgot this was even here, this Lucy attribute.

1236
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,540
And apparently I ran, like I ran.

1237
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:42,700
And then she, there's a picture on her Instagram from 2013

1238
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,380
of me at the kiosk playing the trivia game.

1239
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:48,860
And her comment is like a kid in a candy store.

1240
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:52,260
2013.

1241
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,620
Wow, wow.

1242
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,780
Well, I mean, that's the thing.

1243
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,820
I mean, there's not even much to show you.

1244
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,460
I just really like this display.

1245
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,980
And I love the, I love the paintings of Lucy.

1246
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:01,820
I love the paintings.

1247
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,660
Yeah, multiple modes.

1248
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,580
I especially love that those paintings, yeah, it's like,

1249
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,500
one of her, as you know, were mainly in the middle

1250
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,420
and then four other modes and characters.

1251
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,820
And I love that one of them was a permanent theme park

1252
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:19,060
tribute to the 1985 film, Stone Pillow.

1253
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:19,900
Oh my gosh.

1254
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,500
Where she plays a homeless lady.

1255
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,500
I just love that type.

1256
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,860
Stone Pillow, have you seen Stone Pillow, Jason?

1257
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,340
I haven't, have you?

1258
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,340
I haven't seen all of it.

1259
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,620
I've seen a lot of clips of Stone Pillow.

1260
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,940
I mainly just, I think most people mainly just know

1261
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,860
the beginning where she wakes up in a pile of trash

1262
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,420
and says, well, still here.

1263
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,860
I forgot all about that.

1264
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:47,860
She also plays like a more cartoonish hobo

1265
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:50,700
in at least one or two.

1266
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,740
I love Lucy.

1267
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,580
She was always playing the professor.

1268
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:56,420
She's a tramp right here, right next to Stone Pillow.

1269
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,260
Sure.

1270
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,860
She was multiple types of tramps and hobos.

1271
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,700
Of course, and of course she was very glamorous

1272
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,540
as Auntie Mame in Mame.

1273
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,820
Oh, right.

1274
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,020
I was in a high school production of Mame.

1275
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,420
Oh, here we go.

1276
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:11,620
I know that, right?

1277
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,260
I think it's talked about before.

1278
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,180
What you doing Mame?

1279
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,340
Do that a video that we can see?

1280
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:19,860
Well, no, because the real Broadway musicals

1281
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,580
didn't really give a filming license

1282
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,900
in the way that the other company

1283
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,660
that just grinds out scripts for middle schools to do,

1284
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:31,140
they allow one performance to be professionally videotaped.

1285
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:36,380
The company, whatever the company.

1286
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,220
I forgot the name.

1287
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,940
There used to be bookstores.

1288
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,940
The Broadway book company that licenses the stuff

1289
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,140
usually doesn't.

1290
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,780
So parents would have to like sneak cameras.

1291
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:46,620
Is there a sneaked version of you and Mame?

1292
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:49,100
I don't know if there's a sneaked version.

1293
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:54,820
I played, okay, so in the second act of Mame

1294
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,580
or the end of the first, I forget when exactly,

1295
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:02,460
but her nephew is grown up and gets engaged

1296
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:07,220
to a rich girl and they live,

1297
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:12,220
her family lives on an old southern plantation

1298
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,660
and I played the southern.

1299
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,820
Oh my God, there has to be a video of that.

1300
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,980
Probably the first, but not the last time

1301
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:21,300
I've worn seersucker on stage.

1302
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:25,940
But then also I was definitely in the,

1303
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:31,100
they had to find a dozen ill-fitting red fox hunting jackets

1304
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,100
to do the title song to do Mame.

1305
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:37,940
Wear a bunch of.

1306
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,180
You say this as if we know that,

1307
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,900
you know the fox hunting jackets.

1308
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,740
They go fox hunting at a certain point

1309
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,020
and Lucille Ball, one of those pictures,

1310
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:48,100
she is in like a riding kind of gear.

1311
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,940
Is that why she's in a top hat?

1312
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,380
Yeah, I believe that is from a sequence in Mame.

1313
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,900
Yes, because then she puts on the gear too.

1314
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,700
But it's a bunch of guys serenading.

1315
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:04,100
You make the bougainvillea turn purple

1316
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,740
at the mention of your name.

1317
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,580
And you did that?

1318
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,900
Like in a company.

1319
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,940
They taught. We need this video.

1320
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,940
They taught a dozen freshman boys,

1321
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:17,780
they tried to teach the most complicated dance for that

1322
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,020
and none of us could get it

1323
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,220
and we're all wearing these jackets.

1324
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,140
None of them fit us.

1325
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:28,420
And so we're like, please simplify these steps.

1326
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,460
Like it's so.

1327
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,220
Could you send out a Facebook message

1328
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,620
to all the guys you were in the group with

1329
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:36,460
and does anyone have a bootleg copy of this?

1330
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,740
That's a good question.

1331
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,620
Maybe, I gotta try and remember.

1332
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:43,620
And are they willing to do a fox hunter reunion podcast?

1333
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,460
Oh, for Encore?

1334
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,660
Are we gonna do the Disney Plus show?

1335
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,500
Let's get Encore.

1336
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,340
I know the Encore people.

1337
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,940
Yeah, let's get you on Encore.

1338
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,620
Oh my God, we need to get you on Encore.

1339
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:53,580
Wait, yeah.

1340
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,940
Wait, that or what was the other show

1341
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,780
where you're like a.

1342
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:56,620
The Nazi?

1343
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:57,540
Yeah.

1344
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,060
Yeah, that's more complicated.

1345
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:01,660
That was called Killroy Was Here.

1346
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:02,500
Oh, right.

1347
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,020
And that was the company that just churns out scripts

1348
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,540
with like 30 characters.

1349
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:06,860
So everyone gets to have a part.

1350
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,100
But you have that tape.

1351
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,020
That I have.

1352
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,700
And that's gonna be a Patreon soon.

1353
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,540
We gotta figure that.

1354
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,380
Yeah, we gotta figure that out.

1355
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,200
Well, that's gonna be behind the paywall.

1356
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,940
You're gonna have to pay to see Jason as a Nazi in eighth

1357
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:15,820
grade. Might have to do some sound.

1358
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:19,420
Cause the mics that fed the cameras shooting that

1359
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:23,660
were on a plywood proscenium

1360
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:27,300
and just kids in ill-fitting costumes,

1361
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,380
shoe stomping on this wood is being picked up

1362
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,140
on every microphone.

1363
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:35,460
And I'm like, I can't believe you guys didn't.

1364
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:39,940
I know you're a local video production company in 1995.

1365
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,260
Come on.

1366
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,220
We'll see.

1367
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,060
We'll see.

1368
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:44,900
All right.

1369
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:45,720
Well, that's teasing for the future.

1370
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,580
I realize now that on this Instagram post,

1371
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,020
you're the first one to like.

1372
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,860
Of my Lucia trivia picture.

1373
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:52,700
But is that the first person?

1374
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,540
Beautiful plant of the seed.

1375
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,620
Or is it just, yeah, but my name immediately comes down.

1376
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,460
Funny you're the first person.

1377
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,540
Cause I mean the quiz.

1378
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:00,380
Yeah, okay.

1379
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,220
Let's talk about the quiz.

1380
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,060
Let's talk about the quiz.

1381
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:04,460
You know, in this little description here,

1382
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,260
they tell you everything in this exhibit.

1383
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:08,780
From magazine covers and awards to recreated sets,

1384
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:12,340
home video footage, an interactive trivia game.

1385
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,420
And that is the main, and that's the thing,

1386
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:16,060
my wife Erin is the most fond of.

1387
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:16,900
Oh, the game.

1388
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:17,940
And clearly you as well.

1389
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,340
You ran to the game.

1390
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,100
Push children out of the way.

1391
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:21,920
Yeah.

1392
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,760
Get me to the game.

1393
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,980
Old people and children I shoved.

1394
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:27,540
So this was a very analog push button.

1395
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:31,100
It was like a VCR board game a little bit.

1396
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:31,940
Yeah.

1397
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,740
Although it ran much better than that.

1398
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:36,580
But a trivia game where you answered questions

1399
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:41,580
and your answers got Lucy and Ricky in the game

1400
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,980
across the country from New York to LA.

1401
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,660
Right, so on the Isle of Lucy,

1402
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:49,060
they would do like multi-season arcs,

1403
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,340
which I like a lot as well.

1404
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:53,180
They would go to California when Ricky was shooting a movie

1405
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,620
and they would like relocate for a season or two.

1406
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:56,700
So they did different things.

1407
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,860
They had different locations.

1408
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:00,360
So you were trying to help in this game,

1409
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,940
get the whole gang across the country

1410
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,460
by answering pretty easy,

1411
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:08,780
if you've watched the show, Lucy trivia questions.

1412
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,300
And you couldn't get them wrong

1413
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,820
because then the car would run out of gas.

1414
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:14,860
That was kind of the threat.

1415
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,540
You couldn't get too many wrong answers.

1416
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,380
No, you wanted them.

1417
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,780
You'd have to bail in Colorado or whatever.

1418
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,620
Yes.

1419
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:23,140
You wanted them singing California, Here We Come.

1420
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:23,980
Yeah, that's your reward.

1421
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,900
That's what they sing in the show.

1422
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:28,020
I believe in California, they called the quiz that.

1423
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,500
In the pictures I had, it just says,

1424
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,980
I love Lucy quiz in Florida.

1425
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:33,820
Okay.

1426
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,940
So, but yeah, I would every now and then,

1427
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,460
because some of those questions,

1428
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,500
I mean, yeah, Lucy's made a name McGillicuddy.

1429
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,740
That's pretty easy.

1430
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:43,100
Fight a meat of vegemine.

1431
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,180
Of course. That's pretty easy.

1432
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:46,500
But then there'd be like, how many windows,

1433
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,740
or like how many times did someone do this?

1434
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,500
And it's like, I guess three times?

1435
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,460
I do believe I missed. No.

1436
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:53,820
Four. I missed one or two.

1437
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:54,660
I missed one.

1438
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,500
And I would like, just like had to start over.

1439
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,260
Oh boy, rough.

1440
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,100
You gotta finish it.

1441
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:00,940
There was, yeah, I watched one

1442
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,180
that was kind of a trick question

1443
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,180
about what was his nightclub.

1444
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:07,300
And one of them is Tropicana,

1445
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,740
which he did play at the Tropicana.

1446
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:10,580
That's what I was saying earlier.

1447
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:11,700
But that was not his club.

1448
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,060
Babaloo Club, Babaloo was his club.

1449
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,860
So that might trip you up.

1450
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,540
We should say in case you want some more,

1451
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,660
the songs that the mask, or Cuban Pete,

1452
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:24,820
the song that the mask sings in Jim Carrey's The Mask

1453
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,660
is a Desi Yarnes song.

1454
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,820
That makes it more relevant.

1455
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:28,660
That's what I'm saying.

1456
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,820
A 25 year old film.

1457
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,020
That's right.

1458
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,540
Extremely old film.

1459
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:35,900
I mean, compared to the fact that this show is,

1460
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,660
at this point, what, 70 years old?

1461
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,500
Jesus.

1462
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,420
60 years old?

1463
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,540
Wow.

1464
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:44,620
There is, you know, a lot of,

1465
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,380
that strip of Universal Studios,

1466
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:50,380
Florida, based on actual buildings in LA.

1467
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,380
I didn't realize until reading up on this,

1468
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:55,620
this is based on, I don't know if it's still there,

1469
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,860
but the Hollywood Reporter building.

1470
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:02,420
Kind of had those two silver gongs above it.

1471
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:05,220
And there is even, I believe it's still there,

1472
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:08,700
a plaque on the side, like at the entrance,

1473
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,980
the one of the entrances thing,

1474
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,860
like Hollywood Reporter established

1475
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,780
so-and-so year by so-and-so guy.

1476
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:19,580
So this building is designed after a landmark, even now.

1477
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,900
And they've changed the coloring a little

1478
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,180
since it became a Hello Kitty store.

1479
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:26,780
But that's, wow.

1480
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:30,300
So it's a tribute to the building where the institute,

1481
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,260
it was the beginnings of the institution

1482
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:37,260
that now informs us that Quibi is going to.

1483
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,260
It's gonna be Bafo.

1484
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,100
Blow the lid, yeah, yeah.

1485
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:40,940
Do Bafo Biz.

1486
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,340
That streamer gonna do Bafo Biz.

1487
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:49,300
Quibi might be the first company named in variety language.

1488
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,140
L-

1489
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,740
That's true.

1490
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,020
Cat's a bird to make a Quibi.

1491
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,860
It's a Quibi, quick bite.

1492
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,180
Was the Hollywood Reporter,

1493
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,620
there might be another connection

1494
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:06,300
because a later I Love Lucy guest star,

1495
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:10,020
gossip columnist and miserable person, Hedda Hopper,

1496
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:13,220
appeared on the Lucy Desi Comedy Hour.

1497
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,540
I believe her column may have run

1498
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,500
in the Hollywood Reporter.

1499
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,340
Oh, I don't know that.

1500
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:18,660
I'm not 100% sure on that.

1501
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,180
Sure, we should know that.

1502
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,780
My mom will have that correction.

1503
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:22,620
Yeah.

1504
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,700
To not get too far from the game,

1505
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,220
it seemed like it might be a good idea

1506
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:30,460
for us to play our own version of the game.

1507
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:31,500
Yes.

1508
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,380
I have only one question,

1509
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:36,780
but it might get the job done

1510
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:41,780
because this game is, it's all Bill Frawley based.

1511
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:43,540
The one question is Bill Frawley based

1512
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,820
and your goal is to, the correct answer

1513
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:49,020
will get Bill Frawley from the toilet to the couch.

1514
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,660
If you're ready to do it.

1515
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:53,500
I am ready.

1516
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:54,340
Yeah, sure.

1517
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,100
I hope I do him proud.

1518
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,580
And you should, maybe is your buzzer for this

1519
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:01,020
maybe like a can, maybe you,

1520
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,780
it's a Bill Frawley what?

1521
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,460
You're like, what do you want?

1522
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:06,900
That's your buzzer.

1523
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,300
Okay.

1524
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,340
Okay, the question is,

1525
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:14,740
and you may have run across this answer in story already.

1526
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:18,380
But yeah, that's, you can know the trivia, that's fine.

1527
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:22,380
Why was Bill Frawley fired from the 1928 production

1528
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,580
of the Broadway show, She's My Baby?

1529
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:26,660
Oh my God, I just saw this, oh shit.

1530
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:31,660
Drinking on stage, skipping a show to go to a baseball game,

1531
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:34,220
punching his co-star in the nose.

1532
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:37,500
Forget to buzz in.

1533
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,340
What?

1534
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,460
What?

1535
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:41,220
You got it first, Mike got it first.

1536
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,220
I think punching his co-star in the nose.

1537
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,780
I think it's a baseball game.

1538
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:48,820
Mike, a couch here we come.

1539
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:49,660
Yes.

1540
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:52,820
Bill Frawley has collapsed on the couch thanks to you.

1541
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:56,420
He did punch his co-star in the nose.

1542
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:59,660
Yeah, this was a 1928 Broadway production.

1543
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:02,740
He punched an actor named Clifton Webb.

1544
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:03,820
The way he tells the story,

1545
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:06,220
he spoke nasty to me a couple of times.

1546
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,820
And I told him if he did that again,

1547
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,380
I'd sock him in the nose.

1548
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:10,940
He did and I did.

1549
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,580
And I got kicked out of the show.

1550
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:18,660
Clifton Webb, also important to sitcom history

1551
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:22,020
because in the 40s, he appeared in several films

1552
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:26,620
where he originated the character Mr. Belvedere.

1553
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,140
Oh yeah.

1554
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:31,180
This was a film character who they were trying to get

1555
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:32,860
to be in sitcoms for many,

1556
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,380
they tried it in the 60s, several pilots

1557
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:39,660
and not until a young energetic self-ball crusher

1558
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:44,060
named Christopher Hewitt took on the role in the 80s,

1559
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:44,900
did it occur.

1560
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,020
He sat on his own balls.

1561
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:46,860
He sat on his own balls.

1562
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:47,700
That's a legend.

1563
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:48,540
Yeah, apparently.

1564
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:49,660
Legend of Belvedere.

1565
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:52,540
Well, Mike, I'm wondering if you can go two to two

1566
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:55,060
in a William Frawley based question

1567
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:57,900
that will also set you up for what will surely be

1568
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:00,340
an hour and a half of material.

1569
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:04,580
Who was initially considered for the role of Fred Mertz,

1570
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:07,700
but had already gotten another part,

1571
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:08,540
was already committed to.

1572
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:10,380
I'm waving my arms in the air like a force.

1573
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,220
This is easy.

1574
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,380
Me, me, me, me, me, me.

1575
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,620
Please, what?

1576
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:14,460
I'll say, I'll do it.

1577
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,660
I'll bars in.

1578
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:17,100
Which of course, Gail Gordon.

1579
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,460
Gail Gordon, star of the Lucy show.

1580
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,300
And here's Lucy.

1581
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,140
Yes.

1582
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:26,860
Her longtime collaborator after her contentious divorce

1583
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,180
from Desi Arnaz.

1584
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:31,420
Although it should say Lucy and Desi stayed friends

1585
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:34,500
and he was supposed to give her her Kennedy Center

1586
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:37,740
honor and then he passed away five days before.

1587
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:38,580
Well, geez.

1588
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,620
Robert Stack gave it to her instead.

1589
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:41,460
Oh, geez.

1590
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:46,140
Anyway, yes, Gail Gordon and should I go get lunch

1591
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:46,980
and come back?

1592
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:49,220
Like, how do you wanna handle this?

1593
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:52,460
I don't know, I mean, I would watch the Lucy show a little,

1594
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:55,860
but I did not like it as much as I love Lucy.

1595
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:58,780
But you are a Gail Gordon guy.

1596
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,140
I don't know, you're hyping my Gail Gordon stain.

1597
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:02,540
I really like Gail Gordon,

1598
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:06,980
but the audience is not gonna expect the level of Gail Gordon.

1599
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:08,700
Okay, I don't mean to put pressure on you.

1600
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:11,180
But Gail Gordon played Mr. Mooney,

1601
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:13,780
which I think is a pretty, I don't know,

1602
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:17,820
pretty relevant reference still to this day, right?

1603
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,100
Sure.

1604
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,700
Mr. Mooney being the banker.

1605
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,740
Basically, Lucy worked at a bank

1606
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:25,540
and Mr. Mooney was her boss,

1607
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:28,500
but also seemingly was in charge of her money.

1608
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,860
So they could still do the dynamic of Lucy,

1609
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,980
like Ricky not wanting her to spend money on something.

1610
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:36,340
So he would get upset with her a lot.

1611
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:37,700
And- This was on the second show.

1612
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:38,540
On the second show.

1613
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:39,380
It was on the second show,

1614
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:42,140
which changed concepts a few seasons in.

1615
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:43,980
Yeah, well, Vivian Vance left.

1616
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,260
Vivian Vance left.

1617
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:48,100
Her and Lucy had a falling out at that point.

1618
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,620
And she would come back every now and then.

1619
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:53,820
But the whole thing was that Lucy was a rich widow

1620
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:55,940
and Vivian Vance was divorced

1621
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,980
and they were raising their children together

1622
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,140
in the same house.

1623
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:01,140
And then a few seasons in,

1624
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:03,340
I believe she fired her whole writing staff

1625
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,620
and they rejiggered it.

1626
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:07,980
Gail Gordon had shown up already

1627
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,780
and then they reconfigured it

1628
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:14,180
so that Lucy lived in California now and worked at a bank

1629
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:15,380
and Gail Gordon was her boss

1630
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:18,060
and no longer her money manager.

1631
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:18,900
Right.

1632
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:19,740
It was, yes.

1633
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,540
I have a haziness with this show,

1634
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,780
even though there's episodes

1635
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:26,380
that I remember very specifically.

1636
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:30,020
My mom and family like to watch the Christmas episode,

1637
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:33,620
specifically with Vivian Vance and Lucy,

1638
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,220
where they both, they disagree on how to do Christmas.

1639
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:38,580
So they have like two different trees.

1640
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:40,660
And that's like a family tradition now

1641
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:43,340
is that we watch that show around Christmas time.

1642
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:45,500
I think that might be our only tradition

1643
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,380
as far as watching things.

1644
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:48,780
It might be that episode of-

1645
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:51,420
Should get a second tree in the spirit of that.

1646
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:52,980
I agree, because there's like,

1647
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,900
one of them wants like a white tree.

1648
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,100
I want a colorful tree.

1649
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:00,140
Like they used to have those big like gaudy pink trees

1650
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:00,980
and-

1651
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:01,800
Silver trees.

1652
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,640
Silver trees.

1653
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,480
I like that stuff.

1654
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,580
Anyway, so Gail Gordon,

1655
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:07,260
there's a controversy that I never see.

1656
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,620
I, to bring up Billy West again,

1657
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:11,740
Billy West has a theory, I think,

1658
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:12,860
I haven't seen it online,

1659
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:16,300
is that Gail Gordon stole his whole comedic persona

1660
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:19,740
in delivery from another frequent guest star

1661
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:23,020
of I Love Lucy, Frank Nelson.

1662
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,420
Frank Nelson is the guy who's now been parodied.

1663
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,460
He's been on the,

1664
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:29,300
they've used the voice on The Simpsons many times.

1665
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,340
Is the guy that would go, yes.

1666
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:33,180
It's that guy.

1667
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,380
He was on Sanford and Son.

1668
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:35,740
He would just do this gimmick

1669
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:37,680
on all these different sitcoms

1670
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,100
where you would like try to get it

1671
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,080
like a guy who worked at a store's attention

1672
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,820
and he would turn around and go, yes.

1673
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:44,660
People-

1674
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:46,280
I wonder if it lets you know you're dealing

1675
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:50,220
with the most persnickety uppity man right out of the gate.

1676
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:54,180
It's a hell of a, to use an improv to an initiation.

1677
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:57,340
It's a wonderful character initiation.

1678
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:59,660
Yes, and it is funny.

1679
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:01,540
It works almost every time.

1680
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,180
And Sanford and Son, he's kind of old,

1681
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:06,200
so it's a little, it's maybe a little shakier

1682
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,740
than when he was younger.

1683
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:10,700
But it's the same, it is the same delivery

1684
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,820
as Gail Gordon who would be very much like,

1685
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:16,580
the Lucille, like he has the same cadence.

1686
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:19,460
And maybe he just ripped off this guy's bit

1687
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,100
and did it, like not better maybe,

1688
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,860
but made a lot more money probably

1689
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,340
because he was on regular.

1690
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:28,360
He like wormed his way into parts

1691
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,180
that were more functional on the show

1692
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:32,060
within the stuff he made or did.

1693
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:35,380
A character they needed more often.

1694
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:38,820
Right, and there was no Joe Rogan confronting

1695
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:42,700
Mencia moment ever as far as I can tell.

1696
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,220
You stole my vid.

1697
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:45,060
No I did not.

1698
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:46,340
I never.

1699
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:47,180
I would.

1700
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:48,260
I would rule.

1701
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:50,980
How dare you?

1702
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:53,340
They're at the comedy store.

1703
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:56,380
Both immediately get hit with a bucket of water.

1704
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:58,180
A waiter with two pies.

1705
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:01,020
My tie is spinning at the very thought.

1706
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:05,020
Gordon versus Nelson.

1707
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,620
That would be a good like.

1708
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:11,020
I did, I certainly did not steal your itchy asshole bit.

1709
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:13,700
I never.

1710
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:14,540
I never.

1711
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:20,620
There should be a, like what's the Ryan Murphy

1712
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,260
one that's Feud, Feud.

1713
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:23,340
There should be a Nelson.

1714
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,660
Nelson versus Gordon.

1715
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:28,060
Gordon Feud episode or show.

1716
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:29,940
Well, and now it's funny that you say that

1717
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:33,220
because there was a lot of weird Lucy stuff in the 2000s.

1718
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:38,220
There's the statue in Celeron, New York.

1719
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:39,540
There was a statue.

1720
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:40,380
Celeron.

1721
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:41,260
Celeron.

1722
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:42,300
I believe that.

1723
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:43,180
Celeron.

1724
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:45,660
Yeah, I would guess that's how you say it.

1725
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:51,900
It was the statue that everyone came to call scary Lucy.

1726
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,780
Oh, I've seen scary Lucy.

1727
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:55,220
It's like a statue of her.

1728
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:56,700
It does not look like her.

1729
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,620
So they replaced it with a more,

1730
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:02,940
a better version of her in 2016.

1731
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:04,940
But then because the first one

1732
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:07,980
was such a popular tourist destination now,

1733
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:11,860
the statues sit a few feet apart, like 70 feet apart.

1734
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:15,180
They're both there in this town.

1735
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,780
I've never heard this.

1736
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:18,980
Wow, like the Dueling Christmas Trees.

1737
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:20,180
Like the Dueling Christmas Trees.

1738
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,340
Dueling Lucy statues.

1739
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:22,380
That's very insane.

1740
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:23,980
They should add next to all this,

1741
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:26,820
the Ellen from Ellen's Energy Adventure.

1742
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:31,460
Just have all of the frightening sitcom figures.

1743
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:35,660
But Feud made me think of this fact

1744
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:38,140
that we have not seen yet.

1745
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:40,700
In 2015, it was announced

1746
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,860
that Lucio Ball would be played by Cate Blanchett

1747
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:45,940
in an untuttle biographical film

1748
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:48,660
to be written by Aaron Sorkin.

1749
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:49,500
Oh wow.

1750
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:53,220
So now, I don't know.

1751
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:57,180
I used to really like Aaron Sorkin

1752
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:01,340
and then I think he got away from the power of television.

1753
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:05,220
I think the closer he used to the power of media,

1754
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:06,060
well, not newsroom.

1755
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:07,900
I was gonna say.

1756
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:08,740
I don't know.

1757
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:10,260
I really used to really like Sports Night.

1758
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:12,180
I loved the West Wing when it was on.

1759
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:15,180
I didn't make it my entire political worldview.

1760
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:17,900
But I think the social network is very good.

1761
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:18,900
Yes.

1762
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:21,940
And I think he wrote a play called

1763
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:24,380
The Farnsworth Invention about the invention of television

1764
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:25,700
that's supposed to be very good.

1765
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,860
Well, I think an I Love Lucy project would benefit

1766
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:31,580
from that they're recreating existing scenes

1767
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:35,700
rather than him writing the comedy scenes from Old Cloth.

1768
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,460
Oh, well, that's true.

1769
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:38,300
Assuming that that's the plan.

1770
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:41,580
But if this were to be a Studio 60 scenario

1771
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:45,060
and he was doing I Love Lucy fan fiction.

1772
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:47,180
Wow.

1773
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:48,020
Yeah.

1774
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:50,020
I was thinking, will there be a time when,

1775
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:52,700
because everyone's so desperate to just reuse old TV shows.

1776
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:56,340
Will there be a time when like, I Love Lucy is back

1777
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:59,420
and it's just new people playing the characters

1778
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:00,940
and then they've just written new episodes.

1779
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:04,140
I mean, they've been doing these live TV shows.

1780
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:04,980
That's true.

1781
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:07,300
They have been doing a version of this.

1782
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:08,940
So will one of them just stick

1783
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:11,580
and then we'll get Aaron Sorkin's I Love Lucy.

1784
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:12,660
Well, and they're bringing them back

1785
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:14,660
because in a divided America,

1786
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:17,740
the all in the family sort of matters in a new way.

1787
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:19,500
So maybe you need the relevance.

1788
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:24,500
Like that, can Vita meet a Vegemin somehow be a take

1789
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:29,500
on our frustrating healthcare situation

1790
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,140
and the lies that are peddled by Big Pharma.

1791
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:32,980
Right.

1792
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:33,820
That's good.

1793
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:34,660
Mm-hmm.

1794
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:36,820
That might sort of up the relevance.

1795
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:38,020
Sorkin will write it.

1796
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:42,060
He's gonna do a re, he's gonna do a new pass

1797
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:43,380
on Vita meet a Vegemin.

1798
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:44,500
Yeah, take the old script.

1799
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,780
Cause the old ones are just recreations of old episodes.

1800
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:49,340
I don't know if they change it at all.

1801
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,580
But this one will be a re-imagining of Vita meet a Vegemin.

1802
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,420
Oh yeah.

1803
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,620
For a new political landscape.

1804
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:59,020
And with more Gilbert and Sullivan references.

1805
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:00,540
Yeah, yeah.

1806
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:02,260
That's one of his problems with the old Lucy show

1807
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:03,660
is not enough Gilbert and Sullivan.

1808
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:04,500
Sure.

1809
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,780
And there was plenty of Gilbert and Sullivan.

1810
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:10,180
Did everyone come across the street show

1811
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:11,500
that I don't think was long lived.

1812
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:12,340
Yes, probably.

1813
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:16,100
They would do right outside in Universal Studios Florida.

1814
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:18,620
They would do a show with,

1815
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:21,900
of course you may have seen

1816
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,380
the Lucy Ball Walkaround character.

1817
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:27,940
I learned this, the estate has to approve

1818
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:30,100
everyone who plays Lucy.

1819
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:30,940
What?

1820
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:31,780
Yeah.

1821
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:32,600
The estate, just like the Geisel estate

1822
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:35,060
has to approve all the stuff for Seuss Landing.

1823
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:37,980
And JK Rowling has to approve all the Harry Potter stuff.

1824
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:41,860
The Lucy Ball estate has to approve

1825
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:43,860
the performers who play I Love Lucy.

1826
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:48,820
But, so this had a walk around Lucy

1827
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:52,260
and a walk around Ricky and a band.

1828
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,460
And they fought Wolverine.

1829
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,100
You're bringing up something I do like

1830
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,020
because there's a clip of Lucy getting scared

1831
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:03,420
by Frankenstein at Universal Studios.

1832
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:04,260
That's very fun.

1833
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,180
I love.

1834
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:08,700
But I didn't know that Ricky was a character.

1835
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,220
Ricky was a character.

1836
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:11,380
He would try to play a number.

1837
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:12,220
I saw it, yeah.

1838
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:14,540
Lucy would try to force her way in the show.

1839
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:17,540
And then she would show that she could perform

1840
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:20,780
by doing the Vitamita Vegement performance.

1841
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:23,740
And then she was loopy.

1842
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:25,540
And then the band just starts to play

1843
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:28,540
and she's loopy and she's pulling people around

1844
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:30,020
trying to dance to it.

1845
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,540
Oh, she gets a little loose.

1846
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:32,380
Yeah, she gets a little loose.

1847
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,860
Now it's a little party in the streets.

1848
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:35,740
Right, because the Vitamita Vegement,

1849
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:37,940
the bit was that she was doing a commercial

1850
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:39,860
and she would drink it because it was part of the commercial

1851
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:42,260
but the medicine would get you drunk.

1852
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:43,620
She got very drunk.

1853
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,020
So she was doing that on the stage.

1854
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:46,460
I thought the performers were very good,

1855
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:51,460
very accurate, like Brady Bunch movie level accurate

1856
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:53,860
where you're like, hey, they all kind of nailed the spirit

1857
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:56,460
of the original performance.

1858
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:57,980
Yeah, because Ricky has to sing.

1859
01:12:57,980 --> 01:12:58,820
Yeah.

1860
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:01,060
Thanks to this vetting process, which is,

1861
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:03,540
I mean, that's nice, but it also creeps me out

1862
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:09,220
in kind of a Fox News blonde automaton kind of way.

1863
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:12,660
Well, I'm sure the Monroe estate has to do,

1864
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:17,660
the Marilyn Monroe estate maybe approves that.

1865
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:18,500
Probably.

1866
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,740
Chaplin estate, like, yeah, I think.

1867
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,180
The Austin Powers estate.

1868
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:23,980
The Austin Powers estate.

1869
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:27,580
Dustin Powers' widow has to prove each Austin Powers.

1870
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:30,220
Does Mike Myers have to approve the Austin Powers

1871
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:31,500
in the Universal Singapore?

1872
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,340
Oh my God.

1873
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,700
Does he have to go through a bunch of tapes

1874
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:37,660
or is he there live for the auditions?

1875
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:38,500
Mm.

1876
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,340
I don't know.

1877
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:43,100
And he'll give a yeah baby or a no baby

1878
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,940
or a no that's not my bag.

1879
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:46,820
That kind of thing's not my bag, baby.

1880
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:47,660
Right.

1881
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:50,460
The Austin Powers and the Walkaround Foxy Cleopatra

1882
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,100
do actually do this show.

1883
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:54,260
They do the big band and they do fight to be the best.

1884
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:55,660
Oh, the same thing, yeah.

1885
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:01,180
I will say, I love that Lucy now is part of

1886
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:04,540
the Walkaround IP of, I mean, she has been for a while,

1887
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,500
but the Walkaround IP of Universal,

1888
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,540
which includes Minions, includes Frankenstein.

1889
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:10,780
Groucho Marx.

1890
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:11,620
Groucho.

1891
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:13,540
Some real people in some cartoon

1892
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:15,460
and then like Sideshow Bob.

1893
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,780
Yeah, so Lucy and Sideshow.

1894
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:20,460
Lucy, Sideshow Bob and Woody Woodpecker

1895
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:23,340
could show up together around in the same vicinity.

1896
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,660
They usually, I don't think,

1897
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,620
Lucy usually at Universal Hollywood

1898
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:29,180
is just sitting in like a little director's chair

1899
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:30,380
on the main drag.

1900
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:31,980
What do you call that?

1901
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:34,100
Do they have a name for that street?

1902
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:34,940
Like their main street?

1903
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:36,580
I'm sure there is. Studio Way.

1904
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:37,780
Studio Way.

1905
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:41,860
But yeah, right, with like Beetlejuice.

1906
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:45,060
I think it's possible that for younger people

1907
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:48,520
that the line is blurred, they know what Lucy is,

1908
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,480
but do they know that Lucy is a real person

1909
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,460
or that Groucho is a real person?

1910
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:53,300
Yeah.

1911
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:55,380
And then, okay, well, if they're real people,

1912
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:57,660
does that mean Beetlejuice is a real person?

1913
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:00,020
And the whole gang's gathered on the back

1914
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:02,500
of this very...

1915
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,900
Yeah, who do we got on there?

1916
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,860
Well, they all have to team up to rescue

1917
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:08,180
Chilly Willie from Boris Batonov.

1918
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:11,580
You know, Laurel and Hardy,

1919
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,380
where Laurel and Hardy reel

1920
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:17,420
is the creature from the Black Lagoon reel.

1921
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:19,260
Fievel.

1922
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:21,380
Was Fievel a real mouse?

1923
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:22,420
Well, yeah, it's confusing.

1924
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:23,700
Yeah, Fievel was real,

1925
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:25,940
but playing a character named Fievel

1926
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:29,660
based on the reel on himself, the lines are blurred.

1927
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,900
Is there any, a single Disney walk-around character

1928
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,780
that was real, a real person?

1929
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:38,100
Well, didn't they in Disney of James Studios also have...

1930
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:41,100
Were the Disney of James Studios characters generic,

1931
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:43,360
like, I'm an actress from the 40s,

1932
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,860
or were they real?

1933
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:45,700
Oh, that's a good question.

1934
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:47,540
Were they based on...

1935
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:49,900
Citizens of Hollywood were all more archetypes.

1936
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:52,700
Right, that's the name, the citizens of Hollywood.

1937
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:53,540
Yikes.

1938
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:55,700
But yeah, did they have impersonators?

1939
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,020
I can't remember.

1940
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:57,980
This is a good question.

1941
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:58,820
Who was a real person?

1942
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:00,620
Yeah, Pocahontas is a good answer.

1943
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:02,780
Is that it?

1944
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:03,620
John Smith.

1945
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:05,940
Yeah, I guess he walked around.

1946
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:06,780
John Smith is real.

1947
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:10,860
I remember had a walk-around Lincoln.

1948
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:13,260
Was there a walk-around Lincoln ever?

1949
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,980
I don't know, I don't think so.

1950
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:15,820
I think he stayed in.

1951
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:18,580
I'm sure there used to be a walk-around Davy Crockett.

1952
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:21,300
Yes, yes, good, good, good, yeah, good pull.

1953
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:23,740
And a Mike Fink, was there a Mike Fink?

1954
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:24,580
Well, was there a walk-around?

1955
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,820
Mommy, mommy, I want my picture with Mike Fink.

1956
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:31,100
The river pirate, the unhinged man.

1957
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,420
He'd follow you into the bathroom

1958
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:34,820
and flush your head down the toilet.

1959
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:35,660
Was.

1960
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:36,500
Drown.

1961
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,500
Zorro was not a real person, right?

1962
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,980
Mike, Zorro was not a real person.

1963
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:41,820
All right.

1964
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:44,580
But that's exactly one of those things, I wasn't sure.

1965
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:46,300
I wasn't super confident.

1966
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,460
I didn't think he was.

1967
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:48,620
No.

1968
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:51,140
Zorro was like the inspiration for Batman.

1969
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:53,940
It's like the tradition of Batman goes through Zorro,

1970
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:57,420
which is why Thomas and Martha Wayne

1971
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:59,660
were seeing Zorro with Bruce.

1972
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:03,260
A kid might think that Dracula was real.

1973
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:05,340
That Dracula was like, yes, of course,

1974
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:07,580
I know he's a scary horror character,

1975
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:10,940
but I think he wrote the movie for himself.

1976
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:11,780
Right.

1977
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:15,380
Yeah, it's autobiographical.

1978
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,900
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1979
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,740
And then they saw like.

1980
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:19,940
I want to bring my story to the masses.

1981
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,700
And Trump is gonna give Dracula

1982
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:23,540
some sort of a medal soon, probably.

1983
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:25,700
For all of his great work.

1984
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:28,740
That'll be confusing too.

1985
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:31,060
So he wanted blood, who cares, that's the big deal.

1986
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:31,900
I love drinking.

1987
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,940
Maybe I like blood, maybe I'll drink some blood.

1988
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:34,900
Have we heard about blood?

1989
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,700
Have we heard about this blood?

1990
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:37,780
Wonderful blood.

1991
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:41,340
Everyone's been talking about this blood.

1992
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,980
And we're gonna do it, we're gonna make it happen.

1993
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:46,740
We're drinking the blood, folks.

1994
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:50,060
We're bringing back blood, folks.

1995
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:52,820
We love blood, we love blood.

1996
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:54,660
There's that picture of Trump with Frankenstein,

1997
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:56,940
of course, at Universal Studios.

1998
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,580
Was Frankenstein one of those?

1999
01:17:58,580 --> 01:17:59,420
Wasn't he?

2000
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:00,940
Oh yes, it's Frankenstein.

2001
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:01,860
The minions.

2002
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:04,300
That might be a full, much like our Fabio.

2003
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,980
We might even do the full episode

2004
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:09,020
about his photo with Shrek.

2005
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,740
It's apprentice tie-in, right?

2006
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:12,580
Yeah, because they're all wearing suits

2007
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:14,100
and Trump-esque ties.

2008
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:14,940
Oh yeah.

2009
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:18,580
Will he award Shrek with any sort of medal?

2010
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:20,380
We don't know.

2011
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:21,540
No, they gotta follow.

2012
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:22,780
Sloppy Shrek.

2013
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:25,300
Sloppy Shrek.

2014
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,380
Can't control his disgusting children.

2015
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:30,220
Fergal Fargas.

2016
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:31,060
Except Felicia.

2017
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:31,900
Felicia.

2018
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:34,780
He's kind of an immigrant, too.

2019
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:37,580
He's trying to come from the swamp into the kingdom,

2020
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:39,500
which Trump's not a fan of.

2021
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,740
But yeah, Shrek and Fievel.

2022
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:42,740
Oh yeah, yeah.

2023
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:43,580
Fievel's a big Fievel.

2024
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:45,220
Oh thank God Fievel was out of the park.

2025
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,580
Yeah.

2026
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:51,420
Fred Trump especially would have evicted all of the mice.

2027
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:53,220
Yeah.

2028
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:56,060
Yeah.

2029
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:00,260
And the cats, they're all out.

2030
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:04,500
So what are we talking about?

2031
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,540
Walk around characters?

2032
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:06,660
Oh yeah, walk around Lucy.

2033
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:08,860
There was Lucy Street Show.

2034
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:09,700
What else?

2035
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:11,820
Lucy, I mean you saw, they had a lot of pictures

2036
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:13,580
with Lucy and all our Hollywood friends.

2037
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:15,740
Of course my favorite, Jack Benny.

2038
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:16,940
Lucy and Jack Benny.

2039
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:18,460
Jack Benny doing his hands,

2040
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:19,700
got his hands over his mouth.

2041
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:20,780
Jack Benny, very funny.

2042
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:21,820
I like Jack.

2043
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:22,660
Very funny.

2044
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:23,860
I like Jack Benny more now as an adult.

2045
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:25,740
So I never really watched anything with him.

2046
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:29,700
I don't, see that stuff is like, again, shot on Kinescope.

2047
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:30,900
A little. Yeah, that stuff didn't survive.

2048
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,580
Some of the radio stuff has survived.

2049
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:35,220
Very briefly, you and I got into,

2050
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:38,740
Netflix had like six or seven Jack Benny episodes.

2051
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:39,900
Very small amount, yes.

2052
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:43,060
And we got rightfully obsessed with them.

2053
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:44,580
Because they're just so odd. Yeah, and then they went away.

2054
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:46,020
They're not on there anymore.

2055
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:47,460
They put up like, yeah,

2056
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:50,420
badly transferred Jack Benny episodes on Netflix

2057
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:51,900
for like six months.

2058
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:53,340
And I was like, these are funny.

2059
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:54,420
And then they were gone.

2060
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:55,780
And I don't know where they are.

2061
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:57,060
Like some funny sketches.

2062
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,820
There's some stuff on archive.org.

2063
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:00,780
Actually a lot of the Colgate stuff.

2064
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:01,620
Sure.

2065
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:04,380
The radio shows where he gets a polar bear for no reason.

2066
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:08,180
Yeah, there's some like goofy, weird stuff on there.

2067
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:09,020
Well, a lot of the, I mean,

2068
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:11,300
there's weird rights issues with the Lucy show.

2069
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,980
And not, I don't think all of those are readily available.

2070
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:16,500
But I know due to public domain laws,

2071
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:19,020
that five of them at least are available on VUBU.

2072
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:19,860
Right.

2073
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:20,700
Oh, great.

2074
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,780
Yeah, you guys are into VUBU, right?

2075
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:25,220
Lucy show or I love Lucy.

2076
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,700
Lucy show. Lucy show, perfect.

2077
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:27,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2078
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:29,060
So it's on there with the Craig Healy stuff.

2079
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:31,820
I mean, that's where Quibi is gonna run into issues.

2080
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:32,740
It's just, you know,

2081
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:35,060
VUBU's already saturated the market and it's free.

2082
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:37,660
Yeah, it's free and the bites are bigger.

2083
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:39,300
Yeah, they're not quick bites.

2084
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,620
They're longer bites.

2085
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:41,820
Which is like, some people want long,

2086
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:42,820
some people want quick.

2087
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:45,580
Yeah, I love Lucy's kind of a long bite

2088
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:48,500
or a few quick bites stacked on top of each other.

2089
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:52,620
VUBU's into huge bites, which is what the BU is standing.

2090
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:55,220
That's like a combo of bite and huge.

2091
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:57,060
Yeah. That's what BU means.

2092
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,660
And it's not VUDU.

2093
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:00,340
That's a different streaming service.

2094
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:03,180
That's a different streaming service.

2095
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:04,340
Is that who owns that?

2096
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:05,820
Yeah, I just learned that.

2097
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,220
Cause I think maybe it's getting bought.

2098
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:08,460
That's what I saw, yeah.

2099
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:09,980
It's being purchased by someone else.

2100
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:11,860
VUDU is being purchased, but VUBU,

2101
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:13,700
do you wanna spell it in case people wanna check it out?

2102
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:16,220
V-I-O-O-B-U.com.

2103
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:18,060
And you can see, yeah, I believe.

2104
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:19,900
It's a Lucy show and you know,

2105
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:20,740
Cricut Fix It America.

2106
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:23,140
John Hopkins Science Revision.

2107
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:24,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2108
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:26,540
Armchair Detective, Van Clip Cup.

2109
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:28,020
I mean, all your favorites are there.

2110
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:31,220
Yeah, so be aware of Quibi.

2111
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,860
We did not say Gail Gordon hosts the video

2112
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:36,340
that plays in Lucy Attribute.

2113
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:37,460
Oh, oh yeah.

2114
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:40,060
And I searched for it and maybe I didn't do a good job,

2115
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:43,540
but I searched for just a feed of it.

2116
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:44,700
But I don't believe it exists.

2117
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:47,220
You see little clips when people are walking through.

2118
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:51,020
Clips of the montages of her falling in the grapes

2119
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:52,340
and doing the chocolate.

2120
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:54,940
And doesn't he, he's like very loving, just like,

2121
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:56,540
oh my God. Good night,

2122
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:59,540
you wonderful, wonderful angel.

2123
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:03,420
Yes, he is, yes, very reverential, that's the word.

2124
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:06,260
I'd give you a medal if I could.

2125
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:08,020
Mm-hmm, he probably, I mean, look,

2126
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:10,460
she probably would've married Gail Gordon

2127
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:12,940
and not Gary Morton.

2128
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:15,940
Had to grab as she could at the time.

2129
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:20,940
But he was around, he would do what she said, it was easy.

2130
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:24,900
There's a clip of Lucy on the Dinah Shore show

2131
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:25,740
with Carol Burnett.

2132
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:28,740
I didn't realize they were such good friends.

2133
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:31,700
And they're showing all the clips of Gail Gordon

2134
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:34,220
getting stuff dumped on him on the show.

2135
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:36,100
I believe that was on that clip as well.

2136
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:37,780
I believe there was a montage of Gail Gordon

2137
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:41,460
getting like shit dumped on him.

2138
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:43,620
And I think they played it every chance they could get.

2139
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:45,580
And they ask Lucy, like,

2140
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:46,740
how do you think you've felt about that?

2141
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:49,460
And she's like, oh, you know, it was all part of the fun.

2142
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:50,860
And they're like, do you wanna ask him?

2143
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:53,780
And he comes out and she's so delighted to see him.

2144
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:56,220
She was cantankerous, then she's delighted to see them.

2145
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:57,980
And they're still very funny together,

2146
01:22:57,980 --> 01:22:59,740
even in the late 70s.

2147
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:01,540
There's another, I forget which talk show it was,

2148
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:04,260
where they surprise her with Vivian Vance.

2149
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:06,060
So I guess this was like a common theme

2150
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:08,300
where they'd surprise Lucy with an old friend

2151
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:10,220
she hadn't talked to in five years.

2152
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:11,900
And then they're like, oh.

2153
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,740
The main way she saw any of these people.

2154
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:16,820
That was most of television, just surprising people.

2155
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:20,380
This is your life, celebrity roasts, all those.

2156
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:22,380
I believe a different YouTube clip

2157
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:24,620
where he's talking about Lucy, which is Gail Gordon.

2158
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:26,660
He's on a bench, he's wearing

2159
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:29,580
like a very Vincent Price style outfit.

2160
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:32,220
He looks like Magnum P.I.'s friend.

2161
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:33,580
Oh yeah, yeah.

2162
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:34,420
What's his name?

2163
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:35,260
Higgins?

2164
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,100
I wanted to say Higgins, yeah.

2165
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:36,940
Yeah.

2166
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:38,420
And the clip is, it says,

2167
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:41,420
Gail Gordon always got it working with Lucy.

2168
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:43,420
And then there's just a clip of him getting pies

2169
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:46,260
thrown in his face and water dumped on him.

2170
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:48,860
Do we know about the special that I've just been made aware

2171
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:50,740
of called Lucy Calls the President?

2172
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:53,860
First off, which president?

2173
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:54,740
Come in.

2174
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:56,660
I only know a little bit about it.

2175
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:58,920
It's just that there's, I don't think it's a current,

2176
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,900
it's a made up president,

2177
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:05,900
but Gail Gordon plays Ed McMahon's father on it.

2178
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:07,220
What?

2179
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:09,260
And Vivian Vance is on it,

2180
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:13,620
and it's just like a one-off special from like 1978,

2181
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:16,100
I believe, that we have to do a full,

2182
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:17,060
we'll do a full thing on it.

2183
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:19,620
But I just, like an hour before we started,

2184
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:21,500
I came up on Lucy Calls the President.

2185
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:27,440
You know, if I could bring it back to theme parks,

2186
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,500
and I apologize.

2187
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,140
No, that's okay.

2188
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,540
I'm a little upset, but okay.

2189
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:33,980
I was, okay, so this was like,

2190
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:36,100
we got the show, we got this museum,

2191
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:39,420
there is a Lucy, cool ways to do a Lucy presence

2192
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:41,060
in Universal Studios.

2193
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:43,260
Anybody have any thoughts about if they, you know,

2194
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:45,380
if they were to keep this relationship alive,

2195
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:48,300
and there were to be a more full

2196
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:51,100
I Love Lucy theme park experience,

2197
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:52,660
what that might consist of?

2198
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:55,460
Well, I mean, we've seen the stuff that they did at MGM

2199
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:58,060
where you would be in the sitcom, they would do, you know.

2200
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:59,540
Didn't that, wasn't there I Love Lucy, didn't that?

2201
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:01,180
I believe there was like a.

2202
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:02,020
Oh, you would do the chocolates.

2203
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:02,860
The conveyor belt scene, yeah.

2204
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:04,340
Yeah, you would do the conveyor belt.

2205
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:06,420
So there's been that version of it.

2206
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:08,980
There's maybe like a restaurant possibility

2207
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:10,660
where you're given like a minute,

2208
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:12,780
like a money grab quick booth.

2209
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:13,620
That's good.

2210
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:14,440
And you can have all the chocolate,

2211
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:15,580
like for a certain amount of money,

2212
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:16,860
it's all the chocolate you can eat

2213
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:19,780
as long as you can catch them off the conveyor belt.

2214
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:20,620
That's very good.

2215
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:24,300
I think you could put that in like every Dave and Busters

2216
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:25,300
in the country as well.

2217
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:26,140
Yeah.

2218
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:26,960
That would be.

2219
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,620
Oh, that's a really good, yeah.

2220
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:29,460
Yeah.

2221
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:31,700
Like a repeatable arcade game.

2222
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:34,020
Yeah, turn Jason loose in that game.

2223
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,260
I love it.

2224
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:37,980
That replaces Skeeball, I think.

2225
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:39,920
I think all those aisles are out

2226
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:43,180
and that space is now full chocolate conveyor belts.

2227
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:48,180
I think for sure you gotta replicate Club Babalu.

2228
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:50,520
I think that would be a good dining show.

2229
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,740
First of all, anytime you see it on the TV show,

2230
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:54,460
it's a great show.

2231
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:55,620
Yeah.

2232
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:58,940
Big band singing, restaurant.

2233
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:00,100
So like that's a good thing.

2234
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:02,500
Night there, yes, would be a blast.

2235
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:04,860
I think, I mean, look, Lucy has,

2236
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:07,380
the thing with Lucy is like,

2237
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:08,940
what's the budget on this ride?

2238
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:11,660
It's like, if we're gonna do multiple Lucy rides,

2239
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:12,540
then that's one thing.

2240
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:16,340
But if it has to encapsulate all of Lucy's career,

2241
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:19,240
then we want something that goes from like I Love Lucy

2242
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,060
to Stone Pillow.

2243
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:23,980
We do wanna see some of Stone Pillow.

2244
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:24,900
Oh, you want the whole career.

2245
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:27,060
I was thinking it was just I Love Lucy.

2246
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:29,300
So maybe it starts in the apartment

2247
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:32,060
and then you try to, you do the chocolate

2248
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:35,460
and then maybe you have to dash to California.

2249
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:37,180
Maybe.

2250
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:39,260
So this is kind of a rise of the resistance

2251
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:40,100
where it's sort of all the greatest hits.

2252
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,740
Sure, rise of the resistance.

2253
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:44,580
You stop at one point to stomp the grapes.

2254
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:47,580
Quickly, stomp those grapes.

2255
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:49,620
We haven't even touched on the Harpo.

2256
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:51,100
I don't know who's trying to get, is it maybe?

2257
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:52,220
Oh, it's Gale Gordon.

2258
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:55,580
Oh, sure, okay, he's trying to get money from ya.

2259
01:26:55,580 --> 01:27:00,100
You're evading quick troops.

2260
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:00,940
Gale Gordon.

2261
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:04,100
It's Oscar Isaac.

2262
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,220
He's still Oscar Isaac, yeah.

2263
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:07,380
Quick, we've gotta get out of here.

2264
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:09,380
Gale Gordon is demanding money from you.

2265
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:12,660
He knows you've overspent on some dresses

2266
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:13,780
at the shop this weekend.

2267
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:15,220
You owe him $80.

2268
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:17,700
Hurry, get out of the store.

2269
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:18,540
Look out.

2270
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:19,360
I don't get it either.

2271
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,340
He's not related to you.

2272
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:21,660
It's your money.

2273
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:22,660
It's none of his business.

2274
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:24,140
None of Gale Gordon's business.

2275
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:26,740
Look out, Fred Mertz just knocked over a Keno light.

2276
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:31,420
So yeah, Gale, so if we're using the rise

2277
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:35,140
of the resistance framework, Gale is Kylo Ren.

2278
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:36,460
Yeah.

2279
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:38,380
Gale shows up in the pre-show.

2280
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:39,220
Yeah.

2281
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:40,220
He shows up on the ship.

2282
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:44,140
And does he stab something into the roof

2283
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:45,460
of where you're trapped?

2284
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:46,300
Oh, he.

2285
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,740
I don't know if he had a famous prop.

2286
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:50,940
He didn't really have a famous, I don't think.

2287
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:52,320
Well, maybe his head comes down,

2288
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,260
like the alien in Great Movie Ride,

2289
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:57,140
and your car shoots it with the seltzer bottle.

2290
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:58,300
Like shoots it with water.

2291
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:00,140
Where do you think you're going?

2292
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:00,980
Shhhhhh.

2293
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:01,820
Blblblbl.

2294
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:06,340
Yeah, if you could have, okay, you put water cannons

2295
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:08,620
on the front of the ride vehicle.

2296
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:10,860
I think we have to invent what the ride vehicle is.

2297
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:12,780
I will say that if we're using just the same,

2298
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:15,740
let's just take there that track system and model.

2299
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:17,300
So then I think it's easy to slide in

2300
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:19,860
that instead of the droid, instead of the R5,

2301
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:23,460
it's a cognizant bongo drum.

2302
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:24,300
No, that's good.

2303
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:26,300
And it's spinning around and kind of like,

2304
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:27,140
and he just communicates,

2305
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:28,740
instead of communicating via beeps,

2306
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:31,420
it's just like, brrrrda boop, brrrrda boop, boop, boop.

2307
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:36,300
Do you exit into like, all right everyone, you did it.

2308
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:38,820
You reached Connecticut.

2309
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:41,260
You reached the home in Connecticut.

2310
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:42,980
You made it to the summer house.

2311
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:44,180
Barely even touched on that.

2312
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:45,900
In the last couple seasons of I Love Lucy,

2313
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:50,620
they relocated to Connecticut, including Fred and Ethel.

2314
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:53,100
Who just went back and lived in the back house.

2315
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:56,020
Who went and lived, but the explanation being,

2316
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:57,780
they could afford to do that

2317
01:28:57,780 --> 01:28:59,140
because at some point,

2318
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:04,140
Ricky and Fred had gone in together on an egg business.

2319
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:09,540
And then, and Fred, like selling eggs, I believe.

2320
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:12,620
And Fred also, it's casually mentioned,

2321
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:16,020
is now the manager of Ricky's band.

2322
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:20,540
This cantankerous old landlord.

2323
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:21,700
He sold the apartment building.

2324
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:23,660
Fred sells the apartment because Fred was the landlord.

2325
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:24,900
We forgot to mention that too.

2326
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:26,700
Fred was the landlord.

2327
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:27,540
So yeah, then they just.

2328
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:29,060
Well, he sells the building.

2329
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:30,580
I believe he sells the building.

2330
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:32,740
Or they have somebody else manage it.

2331
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:33,580
One of the two.

2332
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:35,140
I shouldn't, look, I apologize.

2333
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:38,220
But that today is like, that's a Whole Foods location.

2334
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:39,060
Yeah, yeah.

2335
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:40,620
So they really, they cashed out.

2336
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:42,140
All right, so back to the ride.

2337
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:43,940
You have to go through that famous scene.

2338
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:46,940
Like you're in the bedroom with the twin beds.

2339
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:48,220
Well, I was just thinking,

2340
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:50,300
I think maybe the ride vehicles.

2341
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:51,140
Are twin beds?

2342
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:53,220
Yes, because you split in two.

2343
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:55,620
So you're in separate twin beds.

2344
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:56,460
I don't know if that, the gates,

2345
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:58,140
that's what you were about to say.

2346
01:29:58,140 --> 01:29:59,180
No, no, no, that's good, I like that.

2347
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:01,820
And then men and women have to be in separate cars.

2348
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:04,100
Oh yes, quickly, divide up.

2349
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:05,820
Men over here, women over here.

2350
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:08,140
Right, it's just, it wouldn't be proper.

2351
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:13,060
Is it maybe the, the, the, the, the, the Mont Calamari.

2352
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:14,060
What's his, what's his name again?

2353
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:15,180
Lieutenant Becks.

2354
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:17,340
Is that Fred?

2355
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:20,140
Because it's kind of a, it's kind of a scratchy guy.

2356
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:22,220
Hurry, get in the beds.

2357
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:25,260
And then, we can't afford $80, are you kidding?

2358
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:28,100
So yeah, that spot where you're in the transport

2359
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:30,020
on Rise to the Resistance is like an old jalopy.

2360
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:33,500
It's like Fred's old jalopy, and you all load in there.

2361
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:34,780
And then he's like driving away,

2362
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:37,700
but then you get caught in some sort of a tractor beam.

2363
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:39,700
Or he just like runs out of gas,

2364
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,820
because he'd be like, that's ridiculous.

2365
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:43,860
See what they're charging these days?

2366
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:47,100
15 cents a gallon, that's a bunch of hooey.

2367
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:49,020
He gets out and he tries to siphon gas out

2368
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:51,100
with a tube in his mouth from a different car,

2369
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:53,340
but there's not enough time to do it.

2370
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:56,180
And then, and Ethel walks up right behind,

2371
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:58,500
taps him on the shoulder, and then he turns around

2372
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:00,060
and like spits it in her face.

2373
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:02,100
Yes, and then she does a big long take.

2374
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:03,140
And kicks him in the balls.

2375
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:05,540
Well, and then you go around, you would leave them,

2376
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:07,380
and you go around a corner, and the car stops

2377
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:10,580
like really suddenly, and right in front of your car

2378
01:31:10,580 --> 01:31:13,020
is a Harpo Marx animatronic.

2379
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:15,220
And then the car has to mirror

2380
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:18,180
what the Harpo Marx animatronic is doing.

2381
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:19,540
Or you pretend you're him.

2382
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:21,580
Or maybe it splits, maybe one scene

2383
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:23,380
gets the Harpo Marx animatronic,

2384
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:27,780
and then the other scene, the other car gets

2385
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:31,700
like Ricky going, you're Spectin?

2386
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:34,500
And then sings the song, the famous song

2387
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:37,220
that he serenades Lucy with, which is of course

2388
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:41,140
the theme song to the show with words put to it.

2389
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:46,140
That he sings to her when he finds out she is with Child.

2390
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:48,340
So you have-

2391
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:50,660
I think we gotta save the Child for the end, maybe.

2392
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:53,780
Congratulations, you're Expectin.

2393
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:56,580
Look, I'm obviously an idea factory right now.

2394
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:58,420
If we wanna spin I Love Lucy off

2395
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:01,900
onto Disney Plus or something, the Child could be

2396
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:03,700
Little Ricky and not the baby Yoda.

2397
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:07,700
Mandalorian is trying to transport baby.

2398
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:11,700
Cause Little Ricky did have a very cute little bongo drum.

2399
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:13,300
Yes, that is true.

2400
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:18,300
And we've established a good TV baby, a good TV Child.

2401
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:19,500
Oh, great.

2402
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:22,460
Yeah, yeah, I would agree.

2403
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:26,180
Is this ride just still called Lucy a Tribute?

2404
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:30,260
Lucy a Tribute, Lucy Rise of-

2405
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:31,300
Rise of a Tribute.

2406
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:32,580
Rise of a Tribute.

2407
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:33,420
Oh man, that's so good.

2408
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:35,500
You gotta nod to the original title.

2409
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:39,820
So what we're advocating, because if you didn't get to go

2410
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:41,640
to one of these little Lucy museums,

2411
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,100
they were pretty small.

2412
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:44,460
It's buildings that are, as you said,

2413
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:47,180
it's a Hello Lucy, Hello Lucy, Hello Lucy.

2414
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:48,020
I wish.

2415
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:50,300
There's a Hello Kitty store in Florida.

2416
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:53,620
There's Hello Kitty in all the classic Universal movies.

2417
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:56,340
I wish there was a Hello Kitty dressed like Lucille Ball.

2418
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:57,180
Why did they not?

2419
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:59,540
That would have been the perfect way to stitch it together.

2420
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:03,260
It's I think now just like a grab and go restaurant

2421
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:04,100
in Hollywood.

2422
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:06,100
It's just like where you get pre-packaged sandwiches.

2423
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:08,460
It's connected to the Panda, or an old Panda Express?

2424
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:09,300
It's next to it.

2425
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:10,120
Yeah.

2426
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:10,960
Next to it, okay.

2427
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,500
And it was briefly universal, the experience.

2428
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:17,780
It was rotating exhibit of props and mad cats.

2429
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:22,540
So these were relatively small spaces,

2430
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:25,580
and I think maybe it felt inessential and easy to remove.

2431
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:27,700
Let's just put a store in there because it was so small.

2432
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:30,020
What we want is for Lucy Attribute to come back,

2433
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:33,380
but to be a huge two-story experience.

2434
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:36,420
In fact, right essentially behind that spot

2435
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:37,940
where it used to be in Hollywood,

2436
01:33:37,940 --> 01:33:41,300
Universal's putting up a big new ride building.

2437
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:46,060
Now we assume that it's Nintendo, but who knows?

2438
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:47,340
Maybe they'll surprise us,

2439
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:50,040
and they are doing Lucy Rise of Attribute.

2440
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:53,020
We can see in there that they haven't put any robots in yet.

2441
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:55,460
So there is still time for Universal.

2442
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:57,100
We know, look, we know a lot of industry

2443
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:58,500
listens to this show, okay?

2444
01:33:58,500 --> 01:33:59,340
Yeah.

2445
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:00,160
Big time.

2446
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:01,000
So we're just putting it in your ear.

2447
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:01,840
A lot of the orders.

2448
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,200
Yeah, putting it in your ear.

2449
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:04,040
Yeah.

2450
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:04,940
Maybe.

2451
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:06,220
There's gonna be hunger for this.

2452
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:08,860
Forget Donkey Kong, forget Mario and Luigi.

2453
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:09,940
Yeah.

2454
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:13,020
But do remember Frank Nelson, Gail Gordon,

2455
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:14,740
William Frawley, Vivian Vance.

2456
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:18,060
Do we have an equivalent of what's the show stopper,

2457
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:19,820
the giant, the walkers?

2458
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:21,300
Yeah.

2459
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:22,500
The big scale.

2460
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:24,740
I think it's the full band, right?

2461
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:25,580
I think it's Club Abloor.

2462
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:26,420
Well that's a restaurant.

2463
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:28,860
But that's a restaurant also,

2464
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:29,700
and you want that to be a separate experience.

2465
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:30,780
Well that's I think the equivalent

2466
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:32,580
of seeing all the storm troopers.

2467
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:35,660
Like you get off the transport and then you're in the club,

2468
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:38,780
and there's a thousand Cuban musicians.

2469
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:39,620
Not a thousand.

2470
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:40,440
Yes, sure.

2471
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:41,280
No, why not?

2472
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:42,120
A thousand.

2473
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:43,780
Yeah, that's how many were in his band, I believe.

2474
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:44,620
Yeah.

2475
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:48,020
That's how many were in his orchestra was a thousand people.

2476
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:49,500
Yeah, I mean what's the biggest,

2477
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:54,540
what if you see, there's a famous episode of Lucy

2478
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:58,340
where they have George Reeve play,

2479
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:00,780
so he was Superman on the old show,

2480
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:03,980
and Lucy gets him, or Ricky gets him

2481
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:06,920
to come to the little Ricky birthday party,

2482
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:09,620
and then Lucy didn't know he was gonna show up,

2483
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:12,220
so she dresses as Superman to try to impress the kids,

2484
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:13,660
and Lucy's an idiot.

2485
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:18,500
So she gets out on the ledge on the high apartment building

2486
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:20,580
to try to prove that she's Superman.

2487
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:23,620
Doesn't make any sense, and then real George Reeve

2488
01:35:23,620 --> 01:35:26,820
comes in and gets out on the ledge as well,

2489
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:30,300
because I guess he's also very confident and saves Lucy,

2490
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:33,620
and that's like the, so maybe there's a Superman scene.

2491
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:35,380
You're dangling off the ledge of a building.

2492
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:36,220
Yeah.

2493
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:38,500
Yeah, and with the checklist ride vehicle,

2494
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:40,060
maybe that elevator part is replaced,

2495
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:42,060
but you do the grape stomping.

2496
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:43,900
That's like an up and down movement

2497
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:47,060
where the whole vehicle, the bed, is stomping the grapes.

2498
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:48,900
Yes, and it's like, that's very similar

2499
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,580
to a scene in Pooh's Honey Hunt.

2500
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:51,420
Oh yeah.

2501
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:52,740
So, mm-hmm.

2502
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:54,180
And at a peculiar ride.

2503
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:57,560
Now, at Hollywood, during Halloween Horror Nights,

2504
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,500
this just becomes a, what is the movie called?

2505
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:02,820
Is it Hollywoodland about the mysterious death

2506
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:04,620
of George Reeve?

2507
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:05,460
Remember that?

2508
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:06,300
Yes, the Bill and Affleck movie.

2509
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:07,140
Remember that?

2510
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:07,980
Oh yeah.

2511
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:09,100
Within a month of each other,

2512
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:11,300
it's sort of like Deep Impact and Armageddon.

2513
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:14,780
There was the Black Dahlia in Hollywoodland came out.

2514
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:16,900
I don't remember that there was another movie.

2515
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:19,140
I think it was fall like 2006 or so.

2516
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:19,980
So, Ben Affleck played-

2517
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:20,820
There was a pair of movies.

2518
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:23,300
Ben Affleck has played Superman and Batman in a way.

2519
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:24,140
In a way, yeah.

2520
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:25,260
Oh, yeah, weird.

2521
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:26,100
Yeah.

2522
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:27,540
Interesting.

2523
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:30,500
This is a show, so this is a, this is a neat ticket ride.

2524
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:31,340
Yeah.

2525
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:32,340
Yeah, I would just, the only, I would just say

2526
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:35,140
is we got a few more Frawley animatronics in the ride.

2527
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:35,980
For sure.

2528
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:38,020
Which like, we've inadvertently spoiled

2529
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:41,260
Rise of the Resistance now, not giving a spoiler.

2530
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:43,100
But-

2531
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:43,940
It's been a while.

2532
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:44,760
Yeah, it's in all the commercials.

2533
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:45,740
It's all been confusing enough.

2534
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:48,780
And a lot of people bailed, you know, after minute seven.

2535
01:36:48,780 --> 01:36:49,620
A couple, yeah, yeah.

2536
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,860
To not understand what we're talking about.

2537
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:54,420
I found out there's still a little bit of Lucy

2538
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:55,380
hanging in the park.

2539
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:58,260
Apparently the one shop, which I thought I went in this shop,

2540
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:00,540
I forget what it's called, at Universal Florida,

2541
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:03,540
in the like New York streets has like a Lucy display

2542
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:06,620
of merchandise, which I didn't see or else I probably

2543
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:09,180
would have bought a coffee mug.

2544
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:12,220
But then, in the pressed penny machine,

2545
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:16,900
at Hello Kitty, you can still get either the classic

2546
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:20,740
I Love Lucy logo or a Vitamita Vegemin pressed penny.

2547
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:22,780
And I'm so mad I missed that.

2548
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:23,620
Oh jeez.

2549
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:24,840
Because I definitely would have gotten those

2550
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:25,820
when I was there.

2551
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:26,940
Yeah.

2552
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:28,500
I do think we're winding down here.

2553
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:29,820
I have two other little things.

2554
01:37:29,820 --> 01:37:32,620
There's one quick, a story I really,

2555
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:34,340
or these are two quick little stories

2556
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:36,620
and then one way to go out, I think.

2557
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:38,100
Okay, okay, good.

2558
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:41,100
So when, supposedly, according to legend,

2559
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:44,900
when William Frawley died, Vivian Vance heard the news

2560
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:47,300
and shouted, champagne for everyone.

2561
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:48,140
Oh man.

2562
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:51,700
Which, you know, who knows if that was fully true,

2563
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:53,620
but I'm sure the sentiment is similar.

2564
01:37:54,580 --> 01:37:58,420
And then there was a story of a guy who was like

2565
01:37:58,420 --> 01:38:01,100
obsessed with Lucy and he considers himself Lucy's

2566
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,500
number one fan.

2567
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,500
Did anybody come across this?

2568
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:07,740
Was he the guy who gave Universal some of the stuff

2569
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:09,220
to use in the music?

2570
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:10,060
It was like a-

2571
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:11,060
I think, do you have the guy's name?

2572
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:11,900
I'm of course not.

2573
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:12,720
I think that was just-

2574
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:13,560
Is it Bowman?

2575
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,700
That was a lot from the estate and everything.

2576
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:20,060
But there was a big fan who became friends

2577
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:22,100
with Lucy Ball when he was younger.

2578
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:23,860
Yeah, and I'm trying to, of course,

2579
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:26,460
can anyone vamp while I find this stupid thing?

2580
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:28,580
The story that I missed, the Bill Frawley story,

2581
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:31,340
one of my answers in that trivia game

2582
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:33,820
was based on reality, which is that it was

2583
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:38,060
in exchange for he agreed to, Frawley agreed to behave

2584
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:40,180
and show up on time and not be drunk,

2585
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:42,140
but he did have one stipulation,

2586
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:44,400
which is if the Yankees are in the World Series,

2587
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,780
I don't have to do the show.

2588
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:46,620
Right.

2589
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:48,500
And this was the 50s, so the Yankees were in the

2590
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:50,060
World Series a lot.

2591
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:53,280
So very many times he was not around.

2592
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:55,300
I think it didn't end up, they just, you know,

2593
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:56,940
had to be creative with how to get him in,

2594
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:59,740
but there were two entire episodes in which he does

2595
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:02,940
not appear because the Yankees are in the World Series.

2596
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:04,980
This is similar, when I read that,

2597
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:07,660
this is similar to Nicholson shooting Batman,

2598
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:09,100
and I'm assuming other movies.

2599
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:13,020
Nicholson would not work if the Lakers were playing,

2600
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:13,860
I believe.

2601
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:14,680
In town.

2602
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:17,100
In town, yeah, in town, so he could go to the game.

2603
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:18,820
So he had that built in.

2604
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:19,660
Wow.

2605
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:23,700
I like how today, like, if you dare take the mantle

2606
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:26,640
of playing the Joker, you have to go to the darkest place

2607
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:28,800
you've ever been, you have to live as the Joker

2608
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,660
for 10 straight months, and Jack is like,

2609
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:33,380
peacing out, Laker time.

2610
01:39:33,380 --> 01:39:35,060
I can see the Lakers.

2611
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:36,640
And then Coe just comes back the next,

2612
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:38,300
all right, what the fuck was I doing?

2613
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:39,380
No, that's right.

2614
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:41,380
Teehee, I'm the Joker.

2615
01:39:41,380 --> 01:39:43,220
Like Harrison.

2616
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:44,060
There was no difference.

2617
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:46,020
Yeah, that was better.

2618
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:47,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2619
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:49,180
Oscars be damned.

2620
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:50,020
I think it was better.

2621
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:53,460
He had a scary smile, and he just, like, you know.

2622
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:56,140
Thing is, I'm a scary guy.

2623
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:58,460
He just put a little more, a little more juice

2624
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:01,620
on his normal voice, like 5%.

2625
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:03,460
All right, I gotta get out of here in 10.

2626
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:05,400
Gentlemen, let's expand our minds.

2627
01:40:07,820 --> 01:40:09,500
That one work, okay.

2628
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:12,700
Cook, Frintz, I'm hanging with Kareem tonight.

2629
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:13,780
I think he would have them all taped,

2630
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:16,220
the game's taped too, and then he would watch,

2631
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:18,660
like, no one could tell him what happened.

2632
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:19,500
Oh, sure.

2633
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,260
I'm assuming, yeah, I wonder if he did,

2634
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:24,460
does he do that on, like, the Departed set?

2635
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:25,740
Or is it like, Batman's like a big,

2636
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:27,900
he wanted to do Batman, but it's like, you know.

2637
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:29,580
Well, it wasn't Showtime anymore.

2638
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:31,740
He might have put it in a more ordering show.

2639
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:34,260
You got Frawley, great Yankee team.

2640
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:37,100
Like Harrison Ford being asked, what is,

2641
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:38,860
do you think you were a force ghost?

2642
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:41,020
He goes, what is a force ghost?

2643
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:41,860
Did that happen?

2644
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:42,680
Yeah.

2645
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:45,020
Yes, good for him.

2646
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:48,940
People were also pointing out,

2647
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:50,220
they think he probably does know,

2648
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:51,940
and he's just, like, being an athlete.

2649
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:53,500
Which is funny, which is funny.

2650
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:54,340
I like it, I'm saying.

2651
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:55,660
Have fun.

2652
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:56,820
What is that?

2653
01:40:56,820 --> 01:40:59,460
He'd probably also be frustrated to be promoting, like,

2654
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:03,900
the call of the wild based on a work of American literature

2655
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:05,900
that is not coming out at a time of year

2656
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:08,740
that people have optimistic thoughts on movies,

2657
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:10,220
and you're like, what star,

2658
01:41:10,220 --> 01:41:12,220
we've got a lot of Star Wars questions.

2659
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:14,180
Did you see, has everyone seen the clip of him

2660
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:17,540
with the CGI dog that's actually a man?

2661
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:18,740
That's a guy walking around.

2662
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:19,580
It's a guy walking around,

2663
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:21,180
so they have the clip of Harrison

2664
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:23,580
with the guy who's playing a dog.

2665
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:27,260
My dad was like, did you see this clip?

2666
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:30,300
He's like, this is so, kind of funny.

2667
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:32,420
And I was like, yeah, I saw that clip.

2668
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:33,980
I woke up in the morning,

2669
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:36,020
and Mike had already sent it to me.

2670
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:36,860
Yeah.

2671
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:39,580
It had just aired on CBS this morning,

2672
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:41,860
and Mike had already passed it along.

2673
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:43,460
So this guy, I found the story.

2674
01:41:43,460 --> 01:41:45,660
So this guy was just like, I'm Lucy's number one fan,

2675
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:48,220
and through whatever means, he met her and talked to her,

2676
01:41:48,220 --> 01:41:52,740
and he was, and she comes up to him, and she goes,

2677
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:55,220
be my number one fan, I like you,

2678
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:57,980
but get a job, get a life.

2679
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:59,180
Yes.

2680
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:00,020
Yeah, I read about that guy.

2681
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:01,020
Good for her.

2682
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:02,980
I mean, yes, correct.

2683
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:05,220
It's not a job to be a fan of her.

2684
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:06,980
That's nice, but what are you doing?

2685
01:42:06,980 --> 01:42:10,860
She gave him her cast from when she had broken.

2686
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:12,220
She's like, do you want this,

2687
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:14,300
or should I throw it in the garbage?

2688
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:16,020
He's like, of course I want it.

2689
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:17,140
I found this guy's Twitter.

2690
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:17,980
He's still all in.

2691
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:18,820
Oh, great.

2692
01:42:18,820 --> 01:42:19,660
Wow.

2693
01:42:19,660 --> 01:42:20,480
Oh, he's around.

2694
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:21,320
Yeah, yeah.

2695
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:22,160
He was like, young at this.

2696
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:22,980
He was pretty young.

2697
01:42:22,980 --> 01:42:24,380
I have a feeling she might hear

2698
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:26,820
about what we're doing and say, all right,

2699
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:31,020
be the top theme park fans, but get a real job, too.

2700
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:31,860
Get a life.

2701
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:32,940
Who knows a Patreon net?

2702
01:42:32,940 --> 01:42:34,020
Now, what's that?

2703
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:34,860
What are you talking about?

2704
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:36,460
What are you doing?

2705
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:38,060
Learn a trade.

2706
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:41,540
Just get a TV show and did the 100 episode syndication.

2707
01:42:41,540 --> 01:42:44,180
Just cross the syndication line.

2708
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:47,220
Just make 200 episodes and you'll be set forever.

2709
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:48,180
Hollywood is frustrating,

2710
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:49,980
but if Lucy gave us advice right now,

2711
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:52,100
would it set everyone's problems?

2712
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:55,340
Would we all find that following whatever advice Lucy had

2713
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:56,980
for us individually, she would know?

2714
01:42:56,980 --> 01:42:57,820
She might.

2715
01:42:57,820 --> 01:42:58,640
Most likely.

2716
01:42:58,640 --> 01:42:59,480
She seemed very smart.

2717
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:02,460
Her and Desi both seemed pretty smart about the business.

2718
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:05,580
The anecdote I had about, that I had to mention,

2719
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:09,180
I said that Carol Burnett and her were very close.

2720
01:43:09,180 --> 01:43:11,900
It seems like it was a real mentor-mentee relationship.

2721
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:15,680
And apparently, Carol Burnett always got flowers

2722
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:19,100
from Lucy delivered to her on her birthday.

2723
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:21,460
And Carol Burnett woke up,

2724
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:25,020
I believe it was her 56th birthday,

2725
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:29,740
1989 when Lucy woke up and found out Lucy had died.

2726
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:32,580
And then that afternoon, received a bouquet of flowers

2727
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:35,860
with a note that said, happy birthday, kid, love Lucy.

2728
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:38,060
Because clearly they were ordered ahead of time.

2729
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:38,900
Wow.

2730
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:42,500
Kind of a mix of spooky and sad and charming.

2731
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:43,340
Jeez.

2732
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:44,680
Yikes.

2733
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:45,520
You were saying?

2734
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,420
I was just gonna say,

2735
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:49,340
we had talked earlier on an episode,

2736
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:51,580
and this is not, don't get too excited

2737
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:54,820
because I don't have it fully realized yet.

2738
01:43:54,820 --> 01:43:56,980
But it will have to happen at a different time.

2739
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:58,540
I was trying to figure out if I could find

2740
01:43:58,540 --> 01:44:01,900
a really good karaoke track to force Jason to sing

2741
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:04,380
an old classic song that Bill Frawley

2742
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:06,180
covered on his classic album,

2743
01:44:06,180 --> 01:44:08,280
Bill Frawley Sings the Old Ones.

2744
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:09,120
Oh, that's right.

2745
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:10,340
We kinda hatched this plan.

2746
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:14,420
I couldn't, I found a karaoke track of Swanee River.

2747
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:15,240
Yeah.

2748
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:17,140
But it sounds bad.

2749
01:44:17,860 --> 01:44:19,420
I don't know, we could try it now.

2750
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:20,340
Oh, I think.

2751
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:21,420
You think we should try it now?

2752
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:23,260
Do you have the lyrics to Swanee River?

2753
01:44:23,260 --> 01:44:24,100
Well, it's karaoke.

2754
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:26,860
We'll take a couple minute break and come back.

2755
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:28,320
Oh, okay.

2756
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,940
Just to give you a little time to prepare.

2757
01:44:30,940 --> 01:44:32,500
Isn't it a karaoke though?

2758
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:33,340
Does it have the work?

2759
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:34,940
Can you go along with the lyrics?

2760
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:35,780
But does that mean the lyrics?

2761
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:37,540
It doesn't mean the lyrics aren't appearing.

2762
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:39,820
It's just a YouTube of Swanee River.

2763
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:40,660
Okay.

2764
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:41,780
So there does have to be a bit of,

2765
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:44,220
I was trying to see if we could just completely,

2766
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:46,300
is what you're saying, is just spring it immediately.

2767
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:48,780
But there has to be a little bit of preparation here.

2768
01:44:48,780 --> 01:44:50,380
Okay, okay.

2769
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:52,720
Well, then here, let's do that.

2770
01:44:54,220 --> 01:44:57,780
Am I ready to say you survived podcast The Ride,

2771
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:00,660
Lucy attribute edition,

2772
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:02,780
perhaps the episode with the least content

2773
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:04,980
related to the actual attraction,

2774
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:07,860
but hopefully a fun launching point

2775
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:09,660
to talk about all this Lucy nonsense.

2776
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:10,980
In some way that you could argue,

2777
01:45:10,980 --> 01:45:14,620
the most applicable to the.

2778
01:45:14,620 --> 01:45:17,180
Well, it's like we created an audio museum.

2779
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:18,020
That's right.

2780
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:18,840
That's what I'm saying.

2781
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:21,840
So essentially, and an idea for a great new attraction,

2782
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:23,260
Lucy rise of a tribute.

2783
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:26,980
So then as we said earlier,

2784
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:28,780
this did not end up behind the paywall,

2785
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:31,500
but there's a lot of other fun stuff behind the paywall.

2786
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:34,860
The second gate at patreon.com slash podcast The Ride.

2787
01:45:34,860 --> 01:45:38,580
And as always follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

2788
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:40,140
So now we're at the point,

2789
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:41,840
we shouldn't do too much prep.

2790
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:42,980
No, no, no.

2791
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:43,800
We shouldn't.

2792
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:44,640
And as we go at the lyrics,

2793
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:47,800
I do want to say just a heads up,

2794
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,440
I will do this,

2795
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:54,440
but I do not endorse still a long and for the old plantation.

2796
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,920
I am not still a long and for the old plantation.

2797
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:58,880
Yeah, yeah, very good.

2798
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:01,040
I think that's the main problematic thing.

2799
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:03,560
I think so many of these old songs are really problematic.

2800
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:05,280
You don't even do that lyric.

2801
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:06,120
Is there another, can you,

2802
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:07,760
we replace it with something,

2803
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:11,080
you know, like get around with station.

2804
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:12,440
Is there like a food station?

2805
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:14,520
Still long and for the Lucy tribute.

2806
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:16,440
Still long.

2807
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:17,600
We'll see.

2808
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:18,420
We'll figure it out.

2809
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:20,080
Yeah, we'll give you a little taste right now.

2810
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:21,880
Lucy and syndication.

2811
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:22,720
That's great.

2812
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:23,540
Great.

2813
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:24,380
You can fit that in.

2814
01:46:24,380 --> 01:46:25,320
Check out my TV.

2815
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:26,440
I believe me TV.

2816
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:28,240
I believe they have, I love Lucy.

2817
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:31,760
Wait, so it's not a karaoke.

2818
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:32,880
No, no, this is, I'm just playing this.

2819
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:35,640
So the audience knows the Folly version real quick.

2820
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:36,480
Oh, here.

2821
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:39,600
He's really milking it.

2822
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:40,840
Voice of an angel.

2823
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:45,440
That's where my heart is turning,

2824
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:47,720
heaven.

2825
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:51,800
That's where the old folks pay.

2826
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:59,720
And this is now pictured with this Fred Mertz

2827
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:01,360
in a straw hat.

2828
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:02,200
No, no, no.

2829
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:03,020
Smiling like a big smug.

2830
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:03,860
Barbershop.

2831
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:05,320
Yes, very barbershop mode.

2832
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:06,640
So now.

2833
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:07,480
Hold on a second.

2834
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:10,120
Picture Jason in the same getup

2835
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:14,200
and perhaps we'll add with a fox hunter uniform.

2836
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:18,840
So officially called Old Folks at Home,

2837
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:21,280
the Wikipedia, the first sentence.

2838
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:22,120
Oh no.

2839
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:23,720
Old Folks at Home is a minstrel song.

2840
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:25,120
All right, yeah, you're right.

2841
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:26,640
All right, fine, maybe we do a different song.

2842
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:27,480
No.

2843
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:28,320
Wait, wait.

2844
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:32,360
But since 1935, it has been the official

2845
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:35,180
state song of Florida.

2846
01:47:35,180 --> 01:47:36,020
Great.

2847
01:47:36,020 --> 01:47:37,440
With the lyrics having been changed.

2848
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:38,280
That doesn't make it better.

2849
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:39,520
Oh sure it does.

2850
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:40,360
The whole of our favorite parts.

2851
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:42,760
Lyrics were revised in 2008,

2852
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:44,440
so I will see if I can find.

2853
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:45,440
The revised lyrics?

2854
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:46,280
The revised.

2855
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:47,480
How about we could also just do it

2856
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:49,280
in a song called Pretty Baby.

2857
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:51,240
But he doesn't, I bet you don't know Pretty Baby.

2858
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,080
You don't.

2859
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:53,080
It's gonna be a real mess.

2860
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:54,040
Yeah.

2861
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:55,800
I don't see a problem with Swanee.

2862
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:57,720
All right, well, if we get canceled,

2863
01:47:57,720 --> 01:48:00,140
it's, we'll find out.

2864
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:02,640
No one's, well the good thing is.

2865
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:04,040
It's all, it's, it's,

2866
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:08,600
it depended on you finding the 2008 lyrics.

2867
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:12,200
Who wrote new, was someone's job to come up with new.

2868
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:15,680
Bernie Toppin came up with new lyrics.

2869
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:21,320
Swanee River 2008, my favorite updated song

2870
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:22,920
since Candle in the Wind 97.

2871
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:25,640
I've got it on the official

2872
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:27,840
Florida Department of State website.

2873
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,380
Oh my god.

2874
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:31,400
This is a government written song.

2875
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:33,400
These new more progressive lyrics.

2876
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:34,920
Destroyed the country.

2877
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:38,200
But also gave us.

2878
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:41,880
Check the lyrics to make sure they're not worse.

2879
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:46,920
There's a chance the lyrics were worse than the old one.

2880
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:49,640
Which is already problematic.

2881
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:50,480
Very.

2882
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:51,320
There's a lot about.

2883
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:52,160
There's a whole song now.

2884
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:54,380
Sarah Palin's newspapers.

2885
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:57,480
2008, baby.

2886
01:48:57,480 --> 01:48:59,500
The good thing we know though is that no one's listening,

2887
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:00,400
so we'll be all right.

2888
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:01,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2889
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:04,840
This got as sloppy as drunk episodes are.

2890
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:07,360
And we're just drunk on Lucy.

2891
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:08,920
We're drunk on Vitamita Vegemin.

2892
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:09,920
This is wholesome.

2893
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:10,760
Yeah.

2894
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:11,600
Are we ready to do it?

2895
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:12,920
I guess we can go right into it.

2896
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:14,000
All right.

2897
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,920
Let's see how the track is.

2898
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:18,720
Well, so here to take us out.

2899
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,560
What's the name of the album?

2900
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:21,380
You just put Jason's name in it?

2901
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:24,160
Oh, Jason Sheridan Sings the Old Ones.

2902
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:26,600
Jason Sheridan Sings the Old Ones.

2903
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:27,600
Where do you start?

2904
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:28,600
Wait, I heard us go back.

2905
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:29,440
We gotta go back.

2906
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:30,260
We gotta go back.

2907
01:49:30,260 --> 01:49:31,100
Screw it up.

2908
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:32,100
This one's awful.

2909
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:35,100
There's not a ton of karaoke tracks for Swanee River.

2910
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,100
Go.

2911
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:39,100
Way down upon the Swanee River.

2912
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:40,100
Oh, it's faster.

2913
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:41,100
You're doing the Mertz version.

2914
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:44,100
Way down upon the Swanee River.

2915
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:47,100
Way down upon the Swanee River.

2916
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:50,100
Way down upon the Swanee River.

2917
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:53,100
Way down upon the Swanee River.

2918
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:56,100
Way down upon the Swanee River.

2919
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:57,600
It's the Mertz version.

2920
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:00,600
It's way, yeah, it's twice as fast.

2921
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:01,600
Yeah, yeah, hold on.

2922
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:02,600
Okay, let's one more time.

2923
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:09,600
Way down upon the Swanee River.

2924
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:14,600
Far, far away.

2925
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:18,600
That's where my heart is turning ever.

2926
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:22,600
That's where the old folks stay.

2927
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:27,100
All up and down the whole creation.

2928
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:31,100
Sadly, I roam.

2929
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:35,100
Still longing for my childhood station.

2930
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:39,100
And for the old folks home.

2931
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:40,100
Yeah.

2932
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:41,100
All right.

2933
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:42,100
Wow.

2934
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:45,100
Best end of an episode I can think of.

2935
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:46,100
Wow.

2936
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:47,100
You know, we'll get a mastered version.

2937
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:49,100
We'll get a real studio cut.

2938
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:52,100
That was the demo.

2939
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:53,600
We'll nail it.

2940
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:54,600
We'll knock it down.

2941
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:55,600
But pretty good with no prep.

2942
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:56,600
That was wonderful.

2943
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:58,600
Thanks for listening, everybody.

2944
01:50:58,600 --> 01:50:59,600
Wow.

2945
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:01,600
I feel like I'm on the river right now.

2946
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:02,600
You took me there.

2947
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:04,600
Yeah, I feel like I'm in Florida.

2948
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:05,600
All right.

2949
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:06,600
Sure.

2950
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:08,600
California, here we come.

2951
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:09,600
Goodbye.

2952
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:12,600
Forever.

2953
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:13,600
Dog.

2954
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,600
This has been a Forever Dog Production.
