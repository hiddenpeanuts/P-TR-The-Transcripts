1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,260
Alright, finally we're gonna talk about something I like on the show.

2
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,260
Oh wow, finally.

3
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:31,020
It's unprecedented for Scott Gertner to get his way, Mike Carlson and Jason Sheridan.

4
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,460
I'm here, I'm happy for you, finally it's been three years or so.

5
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,420
Oh I know, it really, that's how it feels, it's been three years of suffering through

6
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:49,620
arduous materials like Jay Leno and the Beach Boys and a Kenny G trip report and the just

7
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:57,160
very taxing task of getting to Blue Sky, Tomorrowland.

8
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,640
It's been a rough run for old Scotty and I've finally caught a break here on my birthday

9
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
shot episode.

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,900
Well, happy birthday, finally.

11
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:11,120
Yeah, it's about time some recognition comes my way.

12
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,620
You guys are in the dark currently on what I have chosen, which is a fun way to do it,

13
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,980
I don't think we always have to do it this way, but I figured why not, and let you guys

14
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:26,500
chill out, you know, like this is, you know, birthday is a time to give back, too.

15
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,220
That's right, yeah.

16
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,620
And there's no reason to say this, but boy was there a heated political conversation

17
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,740
going on right before we started, and I love that I get to take you guys on a trip to something

18
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,420
that has nothing to do with any of that, although it is about, it is a topic that is about America,

19
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,420
but in a way that I think is easier to get behind.

20
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:54,180
That celebrates two American art forms mashed together, maybe that gives you a guess or

21
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,180
a preview.

22
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:02,460
Sure, hopefully a lot less freaks, or at least the freaks that are like fun and pitchy.

23
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,780
The Houdini freaks that come out at night is kind of the sort of the area that I'm going

24
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,780
for.

25
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:16,060
That's what I didn't go for in considering an especially indulgent birthday episode.

26
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:22,660
Because Club 3 voted for a Beach Boys topic recently, I'm not doing Beach Boys 2, so thank

27
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,620
you for taking care of that for me and pairing it with Full House, an excellent pair.

28
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,020
The best, ah, the best wine and cheese pairing there could have been.

29
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,620
I really thought about, and I would plan a flag in the future for an episode about a

30
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,420
big passion of mine, which is legendary music producer and cockiest man on earth, David

31
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,420
Foster.

32
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,700
I feel like there's an episode there, but it's harder to wrap my head around than today's,

33
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,180
which came very naturally.

34
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,900
I've also, there's one more that I want to shout out, and maybe you put it in the category

35
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,620
of threaten, but the biggest swing I could have taken is something that I've had an obsession

36
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:07,420
with for a long time, which is a 1980s deep south soul singer named Marvin Sees.

37
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,020
You ever come across Marvin Sees or have I referenced Marvin Sees before?

38
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,220
I don't think so.

39
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,140
Kevin Tully knew what Marvin Sees was.

40
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:23,820
I think he was encouraging me off the ledge on this one, but I think the time's not now.

41
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,340
What's interesting about Marvin Sees is that his entire discography is all music that is

42
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,740
really blatantly about Cunnilingus.

43
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,740
Really?

44
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:37,820
Just like the most, not even, none of it, it's not double entendre, it's just straight to

45
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,820
the heart of the matter.

46
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,500
He has a song called I Ate You For My Breakfast.

47
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Whoa.

48
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Wow.

49
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,980
He has a song called Put Your Condom On Your Tongue.

50
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,980
Nice.

51
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,980
Yeah.

52
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,700
That's how you gotta be safe.

53
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,180
It's the same thing with my discography.

54
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,020
I'm gonna have to fucking sue this guy.

55
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,980
We hit you with this Jason Sings The Old Ones thing, but really the music you've been cooking

56
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,420
up all these years is blatant oral sex music.

57
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,420
Yeah.

58
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,420
Right.

59
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,420
I didn't want to start-

60
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,420
Go down with Jason.

61
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:14,860
You know, on the Bears, the new Bears episode, you said something about like three hosts

62
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,180
uncongerable with their sexuality, and I'm like, well, we're about to rock, but I want

63
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,220
to sidetrack it and go, well, two hosts.

64
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,580
Wow.

65
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,420
One of these big Jason brags.

66
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,460
I do read, and I am very comfortable.

67
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,460
All right, wait.

68
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,460
All right.

69
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,460
I'm changing it.

70
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,660
Well, one of us recognized our sexual beingness, you know.

71
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,660
All right.

72
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,820
Because it's my birthday and I can do what I want, I'm putting, I'm pushing some of this

73
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,820
to the side.

74
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,220
I would like, Jason, you would take one minute of what you would have said about sexual comfort.

75
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,220
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,540
You have one minute of space to talk about anything you want to say involving you in

77
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,540
sex.

78
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,580
Just that it's awesome, and I have a lot of fun, and it's a great way to communicate

79
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,140
and connect with your partner.

80
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:03,980
To be clear, Jason, Mike and I have both made children.

81
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,780
If that indicates anything about our feelings about sex.

82
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,020
We could have gotten it thrown across the room and somebody had, like, it could have

83
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,540
been artificial, I suppose.

84
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,540
Yeah, that's true.

85
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,020
We haven't actually, we haven't disclosed, yes.

86
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:22,220
The common artificial insemination technique of throwing it across the room will slap.

87
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,980
Well, that was, yeah, that was a colloquial way to refer to artificial insemination.

88
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,980
I interrupted, though.

89
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,180
You were saying that sex, this is news to me.

90
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,180
Oh, yeah, no, it just rolls.

91
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,740
I was a late bloomer, so, you know, still probably playing catch up.

92
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,660
Are you telling me, just to be clear, are you telling me that sex is a great way to

93
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,060
connect with my partner?

94
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,060
Because I've been looking for one of those.

95
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,060
Yeah.

96
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,060
This is news to me.

97
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,060
I've heard this for the first time.

98
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,980
I accidentally set the timer for an hour, so I guess you're going to have to finish.

99
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,980
Oh, no, you put it next to my head.

100
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,860
There's no way to fix it.

101
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,500
Would you, Jason, would you say you're a jealous, or not jealous, excuse me, upset that Kevin

102
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:02,100
Smith usurped your sort of feelings about this type of thing with his tweet, with his

103
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,100
famous tweet?

104
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Oh, the famous tweet?

105
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,100
Yeah.

106
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,860
Was that something that you had tweeted before and you feel like he's just more famous than

107
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,860
you at the time?

108
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,860
Oh, yeah, it was stolen word for word.

109
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,860
Okay, all right.

110
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,860
Oh, jeez.

111
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,620
He just didn't want to threaten legal action, you know, he's more, he's got to be more

112
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,620
lawyered up than you.

113
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,860
I was already selling t-shirts that say clit brown t-teria.

114
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,860
Oh, I remember that now, yeah.

115
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,860
They weren't selling so well.

116
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,860
Do you feel good?

117
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,860
I feel good.

118
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,860
It's your birthday.

119
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,860
I don't mean to usurp.

120
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,860
Also, you're probably, you're probably getting horned up talking about it, too.

121
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,860
Yeah, that's true.

122
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,860
We can't see, we can't see his leg is blocking his tent area.

123
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,860
We can't see how much of a pitch is happening.

124
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,860
Well, no, this is-

125
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,860
Happy birthday.

126
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,860
Oh, I'm very happy, but this is a birthday thing.

127
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,860
Anyway, well, Marvin sees is somebody for you.

128
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,860
Maybe that'll come up in the future.

129
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,860
But here's what, here's why I chose what I chose today is because somebody once asked

130
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,860
or somebody had an idea for a party where a bunch of people like, you act like it's

131
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,860
a conference.

132
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,860
It's like, you know, it's a bachelor party where everybody goes to a hotel or something.

133
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,860
But then the fake business of the party is that everyone has to do a presentation about

134
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,860
something and something that's fun enough that you feel like you could sort of, you

135
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,860
know, wouldn't be arduous to do it.

136
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,860
And I was like, you know what?

137
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,860
I know exactly what that would be if that, and that party hasn't happened.

138
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,860
So the party's happening now.

139
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,860
But something that's like a Ted talk that I could essentially do in my sleep.

140
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,860
And it is this.

141
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,860
And I think I've sort of alluded to wanting to do this on the show before.

142
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,860
And it is football wraps.

143
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,860
That is what we're doing today.

144
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,860
Right, right, right.

145
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,860
You recall football wraps being addressed in the past.

146
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,860
Great, great.

147
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,860
As I said, a mashup of two great American art forms.

148
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,860
Football's an art, but whatever.

149
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,860
I think you could say it's an art.

150
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,860
It's an American form of something.

151
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:56,860
And what I mean is that there was a trend in the late 80s with the rapid popularity

152
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:04,860
of rap music and of MTV of entire football teams putting out songs that are braggadocious

153
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,860
about their football skills.

154
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,860
I would venture a guess that everybody can think of one of these.

155
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,860
And for a long time, I was under the impression that there was one of these.

156
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,860
I didn't realize that it was an entire genre.

157
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,860
And that is where the obsession began is realizing that just the sheer volume of full

158
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,860
football team braggie rap music that's out there.

159
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,860
Kind of a cousin, I feel like, of what you did, Mike, for your birthday shot.

160
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,860
Oh, yeah.

161
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,860
And actors doing music kind of thing.

162
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,860
I think this is a fascination with everybody's, you know, people trying a form that is not

163
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,860
their inherently trained form and the fun that can come from that.

164
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,860
I would like to see Jason do a braggie rap about cunnilingus.

165
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,860
A really filthy Jason rap, yes.

166
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:58,860
I would be, I mean, I also don't want to just, I think that it'd be in my birthday power

167
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,860
to say, Jason, excuse yourself, go to the lobby and write that rap for an hour.

168
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:10,860
You put one hour on the clock and come back and do the going down rap.

169
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,860
Hey, he's done musical improv before.

170
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,860
He could do it right now off the top of his head.

171
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,860
I love doing musical improv.

172
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,860
You know that I'm very comfortable.

173
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,860
Yeah, something you're less comfortable with.

174
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,860
All right.

175
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,860
Well, it's really easy.

176
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,860
Just do it here.

177
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,860
Quick freestyle or rhyme of cunnilingus.

178
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,860
Oh, hmm.

179
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,860
When you're flying air lingus.

180
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,860
Don't go so fast and we'll all have a blast.

181
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,860
The joy it brings.

182
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,860
No, no, no, it has to rhyme with cunnilingus.

183
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,860
The joy it brings us.

184
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,860
Oh, that's good.

185
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,860
That's good.

186
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,860
Wow.

187
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,860
Yeah, that is good.

188
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,860
Oh, geez.

189
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,860
Well, even with your, you put a wholesome Mike-esque spin on a dirty Jason thought.

190
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,860
Boy, I like cunnilingus.

191
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,860
Boy, it's great to do it.

192
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,860
It's the joy that we get from it.

193
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,860
How far can this pleasure bring us?

194
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,860
These are.

195
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,860
You two are the music guy, you know.

196
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,860
With RBS.

197
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,860
This is what we bring to the show.

198
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,860
Two music guys and one fucking guy.

199
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,860
Freak.

200
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,860
Nasty little freak.

201
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,860
One fucking freak who thinks partners can connect via sexual activity.

202
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,860
You gotta get your testosterone tested.

203
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,860
We have to find out.

204
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:27,860
I, you know, I have had a lot of tests done.

205
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,860
I will have to ask the doctor.

206
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,860
Yeah, we gotta get it done.

207
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,860
We gotta get it done.

208
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,860
Are my T levels in there?

209
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,860
Oh, yeah.

210
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,860
In there?

211
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,860
In the results.

212
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,860
In the results.

213
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,860
You have them already, you're wondering?

214
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,860
Because they give you, you can read so much in like the mind chart apps and stuff.

215
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,860
You send me a link to your mind chart.

216
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,860
I'll take a look.

217
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,860
My biggest birthday wish is to not hear about charts and quest diagnostics.

218
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,860
All right, fine.

219
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,860
But you want to hear about T.

220
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,860
So it's in the family.

221
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,860
I do.

222
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,860
I do.

223
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,860
But that's, I want to cut to the end result.

224
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,860
I don't even know how we got it.

225
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,860
Fine.

226
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,860
Well, we'll find out.

227
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,860
I'll go to the doctor's office and I'll look.

228
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,860
The U.S.C. medical system has a whole other similar variation of it.

229
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,860
Give me your doctor's phone number.

230
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,860
Give me your doctor's phone number and I will call after this and we will find out.

231
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,860
Here now, on the air.

232
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,860
Yeah.

233
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,860
You know what?

234
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,860
I'll just log in to the private messaging.

235
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,860
That's the most efficient way to get a hold of them.

236
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,860
Yeah, but it's less fun.

237
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,860
Okay.

238
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,860
I want to talk turkey with this guy.

239
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,860
All right.

240
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,860
Well, I got a whole page of phone numbers.

241
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,360
Look, I've been working with this guy for a long time.

242
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Level with me.

243
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,860
What is the size of this guy's sack?

244
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,860
Yeah, I have some questions.

245
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,860
I have some other questions, yeah.

246
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,860
Sack size, I don't think necessarily, you know, figuratively maybe associates with T

247
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,860
levels, but.

248
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,860
It's about the motion of the ocean, not the flapping of the.

249
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,860
Of the sack.

250
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,860
Of the sacking.

251
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,860
How many, have you tested how many darts per minute his tongue can do, doctor?

252
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,860
I just want to know how, how athletic is his tongue?

253
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,860
Please.

254
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,860
My God, his tongue could be used to mix up medicines.

255
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,860
What's that, Mr. C?

256
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,860
Oh, yeah.

257
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,860
Like a centrifuge.

258
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:03,860
It's like a collider can destroy atoms.

259
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,860
Okay.

260
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:10,860
Look, well, not to distract from the macho men here in the room, but we're here to talk

261
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,860
about some incredible athletes doing a different kind of athleticism, and that's artistic and

262
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,860
musical.

263
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:25,860
So, you know, when I bring this up, what probably everybody goes to is the most famous

264
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:32,860
example of this by far, which is the Super Bowl shuffle, the song done by the 1985

265
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,860
Chicago Bears, who seemingly, and maybe you can speak to this, Mike.

266
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,860
I mean, this is right as you're born, but I don't know if there was still kind of like

267
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:50,860
crater a little bit in Chicago of the, like just the like overly sized pop culture impact

268
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:57,860
of this team, because it seems like kind of a couple years before the Bulls, who are bigger

269
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:04,860
than the city they're in, it's like people know Dick and Walter Payton and William the

270
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,860
Refrigerator Perry.

271
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,860
And so a lot of it's from the song, but I don't think they would have done the song

272
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,860
if there wasn't already.

273
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,860
Could you feel like still would you go into restaurants and like, all right, here's pictures

274
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,860
of Super Bowl shuffle.

275
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,860
Here's these guys.

276
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,860
Here's Dick.

277
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,860
I will say that I don't know that I knew the Super Bowl shuffle until later.

278
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,860
I knew who Dick was.

279
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,860
I knew Walter Payton.

280
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,860
I knew Refrigerator Perry, but it was not on my radar like the Bulls was.

281
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:37,860
I was very much stuck in my own world of anthropomorphic characters at this point.

282
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,860
And the real world was not so interesting, but they were around.

283
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,860
I remember them being around.

284
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,860
Sure.

285
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,860
Sure.

286
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,860
Yeah.

287
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,860
I feel like in a VH1, I love the eighties kind of way.

288
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:53,860
Something like kind of like weird color that exemplifies the time.

289
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,860
Teddy Ruxpin, Rubik's Cube, that kind of thing.

290
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,860
Where's the beef?

291
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,860
Just eighties oddities.

292
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,860
It is very possible that you see the Super Bowl shuffle in there.

293
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,860
Yeah.

294
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,860
And it exemplifies the kind of song that I'm talking.

295
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,860
It sets the standard for what becomes a genre, certainly in the wake of this,

296
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,860
which is this kind of rap that's very, my name's this and I like to this.

297
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,860
Introductory rap, the kind of rap that is still what my dad thinks that it is,

298
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,860
which I find very charming because in this case, I need to be introduced to all of these people.

299
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,860
I don't know who they are.

300
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,860
I don't know who they are.

301
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,860
Football is the sport that I follow the least by far.

302
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,860
And that's saying a lot.

303
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:41,860
So all of the names in this song, you know, Richard Dent and Mike Singletary,

304
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:46,860
people who are, they're icons to me entirely from their being in this song,

305
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,860
which I think I always knew about, but sometime in high school, I'm like,

306
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,860
I really need to meditate on this, on the Super Bowl shuffle.

307
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,860
This is such a funny, odd thing.

308
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:02,860
Also something in this song, it's in a lot of what is to come, saxophone.

309
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,860
There's definitely sax solos in a lot of them, as in all the best rap songs.

310
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,860
Yeah.

311
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,860
If we all just conjure all of what we think of the best hip hop songs ever made, probably sax solo.

312
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,860
Yeah, and the artier, maybe the artier ones these days have a sax in there.

313
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,860
They're probably, yeah, but I bet occasionally.

314
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,860
In the classic ones though, yes, you're correct.

315
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

316
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,860
No, always.

317
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,860
Go through them all in your head.

318
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,860
Be a sax guy.

319
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,860
Yeah.

320
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:32,860
And also probably, you know, the toughest thing with these songs is like cutting it down, right?

321
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,860
There's so many, there's dozens of players on the team.

322
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,860
They can't all get a rap, even if they're all pretty short.

323
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:44,860
So probably you're getting eight to ten who get kind of like spotlight verses,

324
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,860
and then everybody else is on the back line pretending to play instruments in sunglasses

325
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,860
and having a ball back there.

326
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,860
Jason, just to be clear, Jason, have you ever like, you certainly know this thing or not?

327
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,860
I don't know.

328
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,860
Have you ever watched the Super Bowl shuffle?

329
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,860
Oh, yeah, a number of times.

330
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,860
Sure, sure.

331
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,860
Yeah.

332
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,860
So, you know, I don't need to go into a lot of detail about this.

333
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:12,860
The Chicago Bears shuffling crew being fairly iconic, I feel.

334
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:19,860
But let me do, I'm also not going to play a clip of it for reasons that I will soon explain.

335
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,860
Okay, what I'd like to do, and I think I can do it, but maybe I'll fall on my face,

336
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,860
is I'm going to text you guys a list of everybody who does a verse in the Super Bowl shuffle.

337
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,860
All of the vocalists in the Chicago Bears shuffling crew.

338
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:39,860
Well, one of you pick a name, and I'm going to close my laptop so you know that I'm not cheating,

339
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,860
just to show you how deep-seated this is.

340
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,860
This is like a magic trick.

341
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,860
And I don't know if I can guarantee getting the whole thing, but I'm certainly going to try.

342
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,860
Just pick a name.

343
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,860
Steve Fuller.

344
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,860
Okay, wait.

345
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,860
I always forget how this one starts.

346
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,860
Okay, okay.

347
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,860
But then you picked one of my favorites, and you picked a white guy, which is very helpful.

348
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,860
Oh, good.

349
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,860
They say Jimbo is our man.

350
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,860
If Jimmy can't do it, I sure can.

351
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,860
This is Steve, and it's no wonder.

352
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,860
I drive like lightning.

353
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,860
It sounds like thunder.

354
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,860
So bring on Atlanta.

355
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,860
Bring on Dallas.

356
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:15,860
This is for Mike and Papa Bear Hallis, but I'm not here to feathers ruffle.

357
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,860
I'm just here to do a Super Bowl shuffle.

358
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,860
There you go.

359
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,860
Pretty good.

360
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,860
Got it.

361
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,860
I got it.

362
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,860
That's one of my favorites to do, I would say, because he has kind of the...

363
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,860
I believe what he...

364
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,860
And again, I'm just taking context from the song, because I don't know anything about the team.

365
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,860
I know that they won the Super Bowl, and they were a very good team.

366
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,860
Besides that, I don't know much.

367
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,860
I believe that...

368
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,860
I don't know.

369
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,860
I'm not even...

370
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:43,860
I think Jimbo is main quarterback, punky QB, Jim McMahon, and Steve is the backup quarterback, I believe.

371
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,860
It's kind of odd that a backup quarterback gets a verse in a team song.

372
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,860
That's a good point.

373
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,860
But I can see why.

374
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,860
This guy's got a...

375
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,860
He's got a Kenneth the Page charisma.

376
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,860
Kenneth the Page as a football player is a funny pitch.

377
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,860
That's a funny...

378
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,860
He's swimming in those shoulder pads.

379
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,860
Can I pick one?

380
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,860
Yeah, yeah, please.

381
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,860
Yeah.

382
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,860
Okay.

383
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,860
Thank you.

384
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,860
Shut your laptop.

385
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,860
Yeah, yeah.

386
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,860
Oh, thanks.

387
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,860
Mike Singletary.

388
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:14,860
I was a little bit worried about a mic coming up because I get confused in these and there's

389
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,860
two mics.

390
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,860
There's LA Mike, but this is Samurai Mike.

391
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,860
I'm Samurai Mike.

392
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,860
I stop them cold.

393
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,860
Part of the defense, big and bold.

394
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,860
I've been jamming for quite a while, doing what's right and setting the style.

395
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,860
Give me a chance, I'll rock you good.

396
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,860
Nobody's messing in our neighborhood.

397
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,860
We didn't come here looking for trouble.

398
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,860
We just came to do the Super Bowl shuffle.

399
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,860
Wow.

400
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,860
I mean, very impressive, regardless of what you might...

401
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,860
I had to think about it.

402
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:49,860
When I had this idea, I was like, the mics are what's going to trip me up, but I also

403
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,860
wanted to do it without literally running flashcards because that'd be an insane way

404
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,860
to spend my life and spend my birthday.

405
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,860
Nobody needs me to prove this that much, but okay, thank you for...

406
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,860
And excellent choices, too.

407
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,860
I think those are some of the...

408
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,860
The one that I...

409
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,860
Because I was going to just do...

410
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,860
Is it Gary Fencek?

411
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,860
Yeah.

412
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,860
Yeah.

413
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,860
Because I like his a lot.

414
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,860
He's got probably the voice most similar to mine with kind of like a twang and a little

415
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,860
bit...

416
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,860
He's just like hard diction.

417
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,860
It's Gary here and I'm Mr. Clean.

418
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,860
They call me Hitman.

419
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,860
Don't know what they mean.

420
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,860
I'm on my man.

421
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,860
One-on-one.

422
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,860
Buddies, guys, cover it down to the bone.

423
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,860
That's why they call us the 46 Zone.

424
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,860
Don't know what that is.

425
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,860
Don't know what it means, but I don't care.

426
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,860
This is like...

427
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,860
It's such a dip into...

428
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:44,860
I might as well just be hearing about what life is like on the other side of the world.

429
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,860
It doesn't matter to me.

430
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,860
It's like people singing English songs in Tokyo.

431
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:58,860
So, if that shows you my fondness for the song, and I've just loved any and all references

432
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,860
to it.

433
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:05,860
I remember there was an Onion article, like early Onion, that like fleshed out an entire

434
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,860
behind the music, like what was up...

435
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:14,860
A full musical ecosystem of the Chicago Bear Shuffling crew and solo careers that never

436
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,860
took place.

437
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,860
And my favorite part of that is that there's a guy...

438
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:22,860
One of them is named Willie Galt and he does a line, I'm as smooth as a chocolate swirl.

439
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,860
And Onion made up that he had a minor R&B hit with the song Chocolate Swirl.

440
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,860
That's what I'm smooth as.

441
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,860
The show got me obsessed with.

442
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,860
And I don't think I knew the song when I read it.

443
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,860
I'm just like, ah, all of these little phrases.

444
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,860
I love it.

445
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,860
I love that these guys did this.

446
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:43,860
I love that then you start looking into the history of it and that they did this months

447
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,860
before they were even going to be in the Super Bowl.

448
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,860
This is not a victory lap for winning the Super Bowl.

449
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,860
This was a cockiest call of a shot that we will be in it, we will win it, and we will

450
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,860
then do the Super Bowl shuffle.

451
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,860
Could you imagine if they had recorded this and then lost?

452
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,860
Oh my God, the humiliation.

453
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,860
Yeah.

454
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,860
Yeah.

455
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,860
Then, well, it's not quite the same because it's not the person who did it, but it would

456
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:14,860
be a similar feeling to when you watch the Lin-Manuel Miranda rap about Tim Kaine in

457
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,860
the membrane.

458
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,860
Oh yeah, yeah.

459
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,860
He's at some function.

460
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,860
What is the rest of that?

461
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,860
I mean, that's the one you remember the most.

462
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,860
Yeah.

463
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,860
Tim Kaine in the membrane.

464
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,860
Jason Chenoweth.

465
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,860
Tim Kaine in the brain.

466
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,860
And it was days before the election.

467
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,860
Yeah.

468
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,860
He also, he was doing a lot of election rapping because he went on SNL and passed by a framed

469
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,860
photo of recent host Trump and did a little rap about, never going to be president, never

470
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,860
going to be president.

471
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,860
No.

472
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,860
Weeks later.

473
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,860
So yeah, it's a dangerous game to call your shot via rap.

474
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,860
No, it's not anybody do any, I mean, I don't think anybody is going to do any cocky raps

475
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,860
at least not on the Democrat side.

476
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,860
This year, I don't think anybody's feeling too cocky.

477
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:02,860
He should rap for Trump this year to reverse, to reverse the like mojo.

478
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,860
Yeah, reverse the curse.

479
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,860
Yeah.

480
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

481
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,860
Yeah.

482
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,860
I think get everybody, that it seems like probably the best way is to get everybody

483
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,860
who did Super Hillary's raps like Lin-Manuel and Lena Dunham.

484
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,860
Right, right.

485
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,860
That seems like the best way to insure Trump loss.

486
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,860
That's right.

487
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,860
Democratic raps, the most cursed genre.

488
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,860
Yeah.

489
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,860
Much, much more so than football.

490
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,860
That's Jason's birthday shot.

491
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,860
Democratic, yeah.

492
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,860
Democratic raps.

493
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:37,860
Ironically, the most sexless choice from who I guess we've determined is the most sexual

494
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,860
man.

495
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,860
I think I've settled on mine.

496
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,860
I had a few in my head, but I think I've decided.

497
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,860
Really?

498
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,860
It is unfortunately very wholesome.

499
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,860
It is not freaky at all.

500
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,860
It's not like porno or some porno with Jason Jordan.

501
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,860
No, it's not porno, no.

502
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,860
Tongue flicking.

503
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,860
That's just for me.

504
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,860
Okay.

505
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,860
All right.

506
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,860
Well, in that episode, we will acknowledge you as a non-sexual being.

507
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,860
Okay.

508
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,860
Also a non-sexual being.

509
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,860
A wholesome being.

510
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:16,860
So anyways, some things that you might not know about the Chicago Bears Shufflin' Crew.

511
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,860
One is the, I mean this song was such a massive hit.

512
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,860
This is like a million seller.

513
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:28,860
It was so huge, just far beyond the Chicago bubble to the point where it was nominated

514
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,860
for a Grammy in 1987 for best R&B performance by a duo or group.

515
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,860
That's crazy.

516
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,860
The Chicago Bears were all, I don't think they were there.

517
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:44,860
I don't think all of the Bears were at the Grammys in Texas rubbing shoulders with Quincy Jones.

518
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:52,860
That award incidentally was won ultimately by the song Kiss by Prince and the Revolution.

519
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,860
Okay.

520
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,860
Perhaps a superior song.

521
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,860
Maybe.

522
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,860
Even to equate top five groups of the year.

523
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,860
Well, you'd have to say Prince and the Revolution and you'd have to say a bunch of football players

524
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,860
wearing fedoras and sunglasses pretending to play the bass.

525
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,860
That's good.

526
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:15,860
They all should have gone to the Grammys and they all should have been wearing their jerseys.

527
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,860
And like pads.

528
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,860
Oh yeah, oh with, yes, and then tuxes over that.

529
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
That's great.

530
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,860
Yeah, yeah.

531
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,860
I would have said pads over the tuxes, almost like the Road Warriors, the wrestling tag team.

532
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,860
They had the big shoulder but they had spikes on them over their singlet or whatever.

533
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,860
Well yeah, that's, I really like it.

534
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,860
My only note is to how to get it fancier and my suggestion would be bow ties on every spike.

535
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,860
Yeah, okay, great.

536
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,860
Yeah.

537
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,860
That's the sharpest style I could possibly imagine.

538
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:50,860
The other thing that is interesting about this song is the long history of litigiousness surrounding it.

539
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,860
So this song, to quote Walter Payton in the first verse,

540
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,860
we're not doing this because we're greedy, the bears are doing it to feed the needy.

541
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,860
This was a charity song.

542
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,860
Right.

543
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:07,860
I think while the understanding was always that some percentage would go to the people putting it together

544
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:12,860
and to the bears themselves that the majority of it would go to charity.

545
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:17,860
Years go by and I don't think the money has gone to charity

546
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,860
and it becomes an issue for the Illinois Attorney General.

547
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,860
He has to get involved.

548
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,860
Wow.

549
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,860
And there's a discussion of, well we were thinking 50-50 split, how does that sound?

550
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,860
The Illinois Attorney General says, well the state standard is 75%.

551
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,860
Anything that's going to charity minimum is 75.

552
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,860
Meanwhile, the company that put it together had been thinking 15.

553
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,860
So nobody had any clue and then it was just settled.

554
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,860
They just gave like one big lump sum to what charity?

555
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,860
I'm not entirely sure.

556
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,860
But that was that and that closed it out and no more money was given to charity.

557
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,860
Meanwhile, the song continues to rake in a lot of dough.

558
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,860
It's oddly a big money generator.

559
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:08,860
And at some point six of the Shufflin crew had to get together and do the litigation shuffle and sue.

560
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,860
We are here to feather your ruffle.

561
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:18,860
They had to sue the company that put it together for like going back on their promise

562
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,860
and not continuing to give money and royalties to charity.

563
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,860
Wow.

564
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,860
Which was also a sticking point because individually they all got $6,000.

565
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,860
Every player in the song got $6,000.

566
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,860
Which was fine if the rest of the money is going to charity, but it wasn't.

567
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,860
So they're like either more to charity or pay us because this is neither here nor there.

568
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,860
Wow.

569
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:46,860
Also, litigiousness has come over the years from the song by the...

570
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:52,860
So the wife of the woman who put it together now controls the rights.

571
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:59,860
She appears in the video as a referee who blows the whistle when the characters...

572
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,860
The characters.

573
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,860
When the football characters are about to curse.

574
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:10,860
That's why some end up on their poop and it cuts to like she's doing a penalty.

575
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:17,860
So the female referee who is in the music video is now literally a whistleblower

576
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,860
for illegal use of the song that her husband put together.

577
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:27,860
This has left this strange world where the song is really hard to find.

578
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:32,860
It's out of print as a piece of music and as a video.

579
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:38,860
If it goes up on YouTube, it is probably pulled down very quickly with the announcement.

580
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:43,860
This video has received a copyright strike from female referee.

581
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,860
And I don't really want to say the name and I'll say why.

582
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,860
Because why do I know about any of this and the copyright strike situation?

583
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,860
Because she went after me.

584
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,860
Wow.

585
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,860
I had a run in with female referee.

586
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,860
Wow.

587
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,860
Again, I don't...

588
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:06,860
Even behind a paywall, I want to be careful here because I've run afoul of this person.

589
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:14,860
You guys know and the listener might know that I did a video a while back called the Sex Offender Shuffle.

590
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:19,860
It is inspired by this area of video and music.

591
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:27,860
The idea is that it is a bunch of people who are not the best at rapping introducing themselves via rap.

592
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:32,860
But it is because they are registered sex offenders moving into a neighborhood.

593
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:39,860
And therefore, this video will reduce the need to have to do the awkward door to door.

594
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,860
We can just send the video to everybody so that they know what sex offenders are moving into their neighborhood.

595
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,860
This was a big hit for me and continues to be.

596
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,860
It's got kind of this odd wave of views.

597
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,860
It just like belongs to the internet now.

598
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:02,860
It's so far outside of anything I can do with it or it even being attributed to me.

599
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,860
But if the listener knows it or if you haven't seen it, a lot of familiar faces.

600
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,860
I'm in it. Aaron's in it. Nick Mundy is in it.

601
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,860
Playing a bad man before he became a bad man.

602
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,860
In real life, yeah.

603
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,860
Yeah, yeah.

604
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,860
On this show.

605
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,860
With his sector shuffle.

606
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,860
On this show.

607
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:28,860
So anyways, I mean, you know, the Super Bowl shuffle was an influence, you would say, on my video, The Sex Offender Shuffle.

608
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,860
But it is not the music.

609
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:37,860
There is nothing copyright about this that this person could go after.

610
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:43,860
So when I just suddenly and this is how YouTube works, it's kind of terrible that you just get you're seeing with Disney a lot lately.

611
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,860
You just get a strike and there's no chance.

612
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,860
Sometimes there's no chance to even fight back.

613
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,860
Right.

614
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,860
Because nobody's on the receiving end of that.

615
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,860
You know, it's all bots answering all the responses.

616
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:01,860
Luckily, when I logged in and saw that my video had been pulled, there was a chance for me to make my case.

617
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:10,860
And I was like, this is not I know that I don't know much about the law, but I know that this is a it's it's parody.

618
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,860
Very clearly a parody.

619
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

620
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,860
And it's not even like, you know, compositionally, you'd have nothing to hit me for.

621
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:28,860
It's just like, you know, if you if you can copyright the word shuffle, then we then the English language uses a great loses a great word word that's open to everyone.

622
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:37,860
So, yeah, I and then I'm so then I'm like Googling and like, oh, my God, there's been articles about ESPN wrote an article about this person.

623
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:45,860
And she described herself as like, you know, when you get a rock in your shoe and you can't shake it out and you just got to do everything you can.

624
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,860
And that rock is going to be so annoying.

625
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:53,860
That's me. That's me with the copyright to like, OK, so clearly this is a she sued Viacom four times.

626
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,860
It's a whole thing. But I just knew I was in the clear here.

627
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:00,860
So I made my big case and I pointed to like counter examples.

628
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,860
And thankfully, I thank YouTube for this, that they did restore it.

629
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:09,860
No questions asked. And there was never any other, you know, problem there.

630
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:25,860
But the thing that really frustrated me about the situation, if it had gone the other way, is that not only do I know that it's parody and it's a style thing, but I also knew that the Super Bowl shuffle was not even the main basis of that video.

631
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:31,860
There's an entire other thing that was way more what I was going for.

632
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,860
It's the best of the genre by far.

633
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,860
And I'm going to close with that because there's no way to top it.

634
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,860
Right. One of the best videos I've ever seen anywhere for any reason.

635
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,860
I'm excited to share it with you guys and the listeners.

636
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,860
But with that, I'm going to keep going to other football songs.

637
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:59,860
And here's one where I'm a little less concerned about playing clips because the OK, so I believe that.

638
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:11,860
Oh, wait. Well, first of all, in response to the Super Bowl shuffle, the New England Patriots had to scramble and put out their own song.

639
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:19,860
It is clearly we need to show strength and shit like where we are definitely going to lose this thing if we don't get a song out real quick.

640
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,860
They put out a song as quickly as they could to counter the Super Bowl shuffle.

641
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,860
And that song is called New England, the Patriots and we.

642
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,860
Here's a clip.

643
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:43,860
It's terrible. It's dog shit.

644
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,860
It's not good. And I think it's why they lost.

645
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:56,860
I think, you know, I mean, OK, if you're preparing for the Super Bowl, I guess one school of thought is that you should prepare for the Super Bowl, you know, get in shape and such.

646
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,860
But, you know, run drills. Yes.

647
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,860
But whatever. Yeah, whatever. Well, that's for Jason to tell us as a team manager.

648
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,860
Oh, yeah. What's the sort of thing that a football team should be doing?

649
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,860
Well, the fundamentals. Ah, yes.

650
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,860
You can't lose sight of the fundamentals. Never.

651
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,860
Even if you're in the Super Bowl. That's right.

652
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,860
Fundamentals are more important than ever.

653
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:23,860
But I would say you're trying to come up with even like a goofy competitive song.

654
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,860
You shouldn't make it sound like a tourism ad jingle.

655
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,860
Yes. Yeah, that one does feel like come visit our city.

656
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:38,860
Mm hmm. Yeah, this was one where they like they thank the mayor for like, you know, the mayors like do bets and stuff.

657
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,860
Oh, yeah. Yeah. One of those like thanks for thanks for the peaches.

658
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:50,860
Mayor Bradley, sort of from a previous something with an Atlanta mayor that went their way.

659
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,860
It's a little too friendly.

660
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:59,860
I guess that's maybe a component of the football rap is that there has to be something a little bit tough and challenging about it.

661
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,860
Yeah, these are extremely friendly songs overall.

662
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,860
However, that one is really friendly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

663
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,860
Much. Yeah, they seem like pushovers. Right.

664
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:13,860
Yeah, that's not winning you any games. Yeah, no, no.

665
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:21,860
And if and sure they put like, you know, for the listener, it's like a bunch of like, you know, like locals with a lot of spirit all singing.

666
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,860
That's not what it's about. Right about the we have to be building up the players. Right.

667
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:31,860
They're the stars. Yeah. You can't do a football rap without the players and without rap.

668
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,860
That's really the big mistake. Rap is the correct genre. That was the genre at the time.

669
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:40,860
They were bucking the trend. Yeah, maybe they thought they were being creative there, changing it up.

670
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,860
But it was a mistake. I think so. Yeah.

671
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,860
Yeah. Why mess with the good thing?

672
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,860
But it had been less than that. Again, this is only the second one of these.

673
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:54,860
So we're still figuring it out. Now, I think the next year, the genre was perfected.

674
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,860
And I don't think I'm just saying that due to local allegiance.

675
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,860
But I do think that the genre was perfected in Los Angeles by the L.A.

676
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,860
Rams. And sexual being Jason over there will be excited to hear that the song is called Ram It.

677
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,860
What does it sound like?

678
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:30,860
It was that kind of what's we're sort of near Rockwell.

679
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,860
Somebody's watching me. Yeah, yeah. A little bit.

680
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,860
But then that didn't didn't didn't didn't. I don't know.

681
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,860
I guess it's a little pointer sisters or something.

682
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,860
I mean, this is this is jazzy. This is catchy. Yeah, that's good.

683
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:52,860
It's good uniform. They are also they're just in the stadium and they're all packed together so tight with their vibrant blue and gold.

684
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,860
And they are the dance, I think, is really good.

685
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:01,860
They do they kind of like go backwards and do sort of a like arm pump.

686
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,860
That's they don't know. They look like proud pirates or something.

687
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,860
They smell like smooth operator or something. What am I thinking of?

688
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,860
I'm trying to think a little a little bit. A little bit.

689
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,860
It also sounds like we could fit out of our smart kids.

690
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,860
It could be on smart kids. You know what?

691
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,860
Well, that's well, that's you just my highest praise.

692
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,860
Yeah, you would put it in the. Yeah, I would have loved an L.A.

693
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,860
Rams. Come on and ram it.

694
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,860
Say no to drugs collaboration.

695
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:30,860
That'd be awesome. Or him or a response song.

696
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:36,860
The L.A. Rams abused their position in the city by taking their name and putting it into a double entendre.

697
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,860
Double entendres are no good.

698
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:46,860
If you're going to say sex thing, say it in private, not over the airwaves.

699
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:53,860
And the song should have been a more clear cut phrase like the Rams are here and they want to win.

700
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:57,860
It's less catchy, but it's also less filthy.

701
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:01,860
Double entendres confuse the brain. It makes it work too hard.

702
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:06,860
Don't wear out your brain trying to figure out what a double entendre means.

703
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:13,860
Ask your parents to vote against double entendres in any legislation intended to make them illegal.

704
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,860
Thank you, Mr. Dan Quayle, for signing on to this new bill.

705
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,860
This important initiative.

706
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,860
Also, entendre is French, I think.

707
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:26,860
So it should be illegal in America on those grounds alone.

708
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,860
Call an entendre a meaning.

709
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,860
That's what it is. A meaning.

710
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,860
Use an American word.

711
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:39,860
The sexual the sexually charged French language seeks to seduce our children.

712
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,860
A country of perverts and cigarette smokers.

713
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,860
Parents, take the pledge to never allow your children to go to France.

714
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,860
Put up a wall.

715
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:55,860
I don't know how it'll work, but put up a French wall that prevents Americans from going in.

716
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,860
They should have moved the Berlin Wall.

717
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,860
Move the Berlin Wall to France.

718
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,860
That's the idea. We want that down.

719
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,860
Reagan says tear down that wall.

720
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,860
McGruff says put it back up around filthy France.

721
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:16,860
Launch a satellite into orbit that will suck all the horny energy from the French people into space.

722
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,860
We don't need it. We don't need that energy around here.

723
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:22,860
Maybe some alien freaks have some use for it.

724
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,860
It has no place here on Earth.

725
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:32,860
Also, support making Ronald Reagan the king of Earth forever.

726
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:39,860
Grow him new organs in a lab somewhere so we can replace his dying old organs with new fresh ones.

727
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,860
So this man may reign for 300 years.

728
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,860
Octopus tentacles could be cool too.

729
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,860
If we're blue-skying what cool amending to Reagans could be.

730
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:54,860
Add animal parts to him. Doesn't matter where.

731
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:59,860
It should be kind of a random shuffling. That's the most fun probably.

732
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,860
Give him the xenomorph tongue from Alien.

733
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:08,860
Human-animal mutant hyrids are okay.

734
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,860
Double-entronters are not.

735
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,860
Take it from me. I am one.

736
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,860
My life is pain.

737
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:22,860
Give him ram-orns. Just don't make any double-entronters about him.

738
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,860
Anyway, I think these are great. It's the best dance.

739
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,860
I'm sorry the listener can't see the dance.

740
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,860
Let's get a taste of some of their...

741
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,860
Yeah, yeah, definitely. We can because we're not going to get sued by that whistleblower referee.

742
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,860
Okay, here's a little of the rapping.

743
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:50,860
Well, maybe it's not. Maybe it's just them making strong arms and doing fist pumps.

744
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:56,860
But let's see. I mean, you're going off of my imitations of the bears and not the real deal.

745
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:01,860
All right. Well, let's not even compare. Just compare the rams to all hip-hop artists you've ever heard.

746
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,860
Okay.

747
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,860
Don't worry that the rams are rapping. When game time comes, we'll get back to...

748
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,860
Jabbing?

749
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,860
Jabbing?

750
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,860
I don't know. I don't know. What did they say?

751
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:28,860
He's rapping very fast. He's rapping at sort of an Eminem pace there when Eminem goes real fast.

752
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,860
Yeah.

753
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,860
Or Twista is another guy.

754
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,860
I think if you cut the beat like Forgot About Dre, I think this guy's plowing through.

755
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:38,860
I think he's got a natural rhythm. It's a lot faster than the Super Bowl shuffle.

756
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:43,860
So it's a more vocally dexterous piece that they're trying to pull off here.

757
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,860
But what is he... All right. Don't worry that the rams are...

758
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:50,860
This is important to address. They need to focus on the games. But what do they say?

759
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,860
In my head, it's jappin?

760
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,860
I don't want to even speculate.

761
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:04,860
It's a football term that I don't... Is it jabbing? Like ram horns?

762
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,860
Maybe, yeah. Let's say it to that.

763
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:11,860
Okay. Yeah. I guess so. For now. I need some peace with this.

764
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:40,860
There's so many things there. This is Limousine Willie. My moves are like dreams.

765
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:47,860
Also, I know they used to use chalkboards when drawing on football plays and stuff.

766
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:53,860
But seeing a wrapping in front of just like a green chalkboard with nothing on it.

767
00:41:53,860 --> 00:42:00,860
Yeah. Unless the VHS... I mean, I see some writing. Maybe it's just some... It's really hard to see through the...

768
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:07,860
Well, and then the next one just walks out of like the, you know, closet and locker room.

769
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:16,860
He's fully in a locker and then steps out of it. Yeah. I also like this one a lot because of the staging.

770
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,860
I think the Super Bowl shuffle looks great. I like the soundstage that they filmed on.

771
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:26,860
However, I think there's some clever use of the environment. I don't know where they were playing at this point.

772
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:32,860
This might be at what is now Angel Stadium because that's where they were for a long time.

773
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:37,860
It was a weird hybrid stadium that was kind of awkwardly sized until it became baseball only.

774
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:45,860
So we might be in Anaheim here. I'm not totally sure. I feel like there's one more good bit of staging.

775
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:50,860
Let me see. There's some saxophone, of course. Let me see what we have here.

776
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:10,860
That's it. Okay. This guy's on a motorcycle. That's great. In the dressing room. It's parked.

777
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:16,860
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. He's no, he's not doing donuts. That would ruin it permanently, I would think.

778
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:26,860
I like that one though, a lot where he says, and stopping me is like stopping a train. Really pleasant. Stopping a train.

779
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:32,860
None of them are doing it. None of them are like acting tough. No, really.

780
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,860
Yeah. It's definitely a different vibe than you would get.

781
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:40,860
Because you think it would be like pro-wrestler style.

782
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:48,860
Like you could feel the grating of their teeth. No, everyone's like, hello there. I'm a man. Nice to see you. Yes, I can.

783
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:56,860
I think that's something I love about it is the smiley-ness. I mean, they aren't all the, and we'll get to ones that are, I guess, a little bit tougher.

784
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:04,860
Yeah. But I don't know. Yeah, this Rams one is just so, so goofy, so upbeat. Yeah. You got like the female singers in it.

785
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:16,860
We're gonna ram it. Let's ram it. It might, however, have worked against them because not only did the Rams not go on to win the Super Bowl,

786
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:25,860
I don't think any other team that did a song ever won a Super Bowl. I think there was this, like the Bears got in there.

787
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:34,860
They rode the song cockiness all the way to the trophy. I think from here on out, it's a curse. I think the song never did anything for you.

788
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:41,860
I also like when they, later they're all like in an office park, which is also very adorable.

789
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:46,860
I think that's, you know, adorable is not a word I would usually apply to a bunch of football players.

790
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:53,860
And that's some of what I like about this is that, here, you'll see what I mean here. They're all hung up in an office park lawn.

791
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:04,860
It's cute. It's like everyone's being cute. Yeah.

792
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:12,860
Because everyone's like a high school assembly or some like energy of just like, Oh, can you believe these silly guys are doing this?

793
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:19,860
Did you guys like rallies that high school where like the football players are doing skits and stuff?

794
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:25,860
Well, I certainly had a little bit of a chip on my shoulder about like other people doing like skits and stuff.

795
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:36,860
That's exactly where I was. Yes. But as I've explained on the show, then in senior year, we did our Batman stuff, which is a high point to my life.

796
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:48,860
Glory days. Yeah, yeah. No athletic glory days except for tennis. But taking over two rallies. Yes. Especially one big rally.

797
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:56,860
Uh huh. Uh huh. Yeah, I didn't. I didn't. I never crossed into rally. I just didn't ever feel like stuff was going to play in the arena setting.

798
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:02,860
It's tough. You had to go big. It remains tough to this day. Only the Maniscalcos of the world can handle it.

799
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,860
Yeah, that's why you had to put on like a live Batman stunt show like we did. Well, you did. You did it right.

800
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:14,860
Yours was not about, you know, verbal and clever. It was. It was big. It was. You used your theme park brain. Yeah, action.

801
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:20,860
What's going to play. It was all action. Yes. Yeah. Did you ever play in the band at any of these? All of them.

802
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:30,860
Okay. Did you guys have like a casual ensemble? Because I just remember the band sitting in one set of bleachers, all of them in black t-shirts and khakis.

803
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:37,860
We just had a band shirt. A band t-shirt. Okay. And pants. Yeah. You were asking about the look. We weren't wearing marching band outfits at a pep rally.

804
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:44,860
The casual black tee and khaki, like you're going to fix their cable kind of look.

805
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:51,860
That would scarcely be appropriate for a marching band, I wouldn't think. I just think it was like a maroon band shirt. Okay.

806
00:46:51,860 --> 00:47:03,860
I want at least a little bit of, I want mild tassel. You don't need tassels on all your shoulders and elbows and you don't need 12 sets of tassels, but I'd say at least two.

807
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:10,860
There might have been a tassel hanging from the little, the thing that held the little sheet music I would play that you could stick on top of your trumpet.

808
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:15,860
There might have been a tassel hanging off that. Okay. Then at least, yeah. So something would flow.

809
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:22,860
Tassel care I feel is a very difficult area. Those things get sticky. Yeah. They bunch.

810
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:27,860
I think there's a reason why people don't casually wear tassels day to day very often.

811
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:34,860
Well, marching band I worked, I had tassels. I was tasseling. Did your mom have to clean tassel clothes or was this a special job?

812
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:39,860
Dry clean. Okay. Yeah. So they would clean the tassels. No, best leave it to the experts. Yeah.

813
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:49,860
Those things, yeah. They were, we did not buy them. They were used many years. Yeah. You think still, you think anybody, maybe even a podcast,

814
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:59,860
The Ride fan is unknowingly putting on Mike Carlson's superhero cape equivalent. If they're still using that 20 years later,

815
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:12,860
I hope the school is having funding issues. Wow. I hope. They're playing like, hey, Mike Carlson's marching band. Yeah, it's possible.

816
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,860
Tassels. I would love to know what the set list is as far as pep rallies now. Yeah.

817
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:21,860
Well, what's the most recent song that has made it to marching band?

818
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:27,860
You know, it feels like a very theme park area where you're probably not getting a hit from this year in the marching band.

819
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:37,860
But maybe, maybe, you know, it's the Bruno Mars kind of level. We want it to become a wedding song so that it can become a Bruno Mars.

820
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:44,860
When I See You Again from the Fast and the Furious after the Fall Walker.

821
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:50,860
Is that a marching band? For marching? You know, you never know.

822
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:55,860
Well, that's if you're a band. We would have killed for a song that was 10 years old at these pep rallies.

823
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:02,860
We were playing Give Me Some Lovin' and the Peter Gunn theme. That's what we were doing. I'm not saying they were bad. It was fun to play.

824
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,860
Jason would have killed for a song that's 150 years old. Well, right. And he usually got them.

825
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:13,860
Oh, let's have another cup of coffee. Let's have another piece of pie. What's that one?

826
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:21,860
It's like an old song. Let's have another cup of coffee. Let's have another piece of pie. Hang on. What's that? Yeah. What's this?

827
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:29,860
Can you say any other details about it or is it just from the world? Let's have another piece. Let's see. How old do we think it is?

828
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:33,860
What if we figure out, though, that it's a Jason original? Oh, my God, I hope.

829
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:40,860
Let's have another cup of coffee song by Fred Waring. OK, let's see. OK.

830
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:49,860
Let's have another cup of coffee song by Irving Berlin appearing in the musical comedy Face the Music, which opened in 1932.

831
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:56,860
So it's almost 100 years. Wow. Wow. Just around the corner, there's a rainbow in the sky.

832
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,860
Let's have another cup of coffee and let's have another piece of pie.

833
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:11,860
The hit version was released in 1932 on the RCA Victor label by Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians with vocals by Chick Bullock with the Three Waring Girls.

834
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:16,860
So how about it? Chick Bullock. There are beauties and I'm not just saying that because they're my daughters.

835
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:23,860
Charles Chick Bullock. September 6, 1898 to September 15, 1981. Lived pretty good. Lived a long life.

836
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:29,860
I had definitely heard the name Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians before.

837
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,860
You know about his Three Waring Girls? I didn't know about the Waring Girls.

838
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:38,860
Well, if you're in Pennsylvania, they occupy the cultural space that the Chicago Shufflin crew does in Chicago.

839
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:42,860
They were a supreme court for a long time.

840
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:49,860
Burl Ives included the song in his album Burl Ives Sings Irving Berlin. Oh, so how about that? That sounds like a corker.

841
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:57,860
1960. Do you think we are at least the only comedy podcast that probably once a year references Burl Ives?

842
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,860
Probably. I don't know.

843
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:05,860
Paul of Tompkins I feel like might say Burl Ives once in a while. Yeah, that's a good guess.

844
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:09,860
I'm guessing. Yeah, I don't think it's frequent. I don't think it's happening often.

845
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:15,860
Yeah, it's up to all of us to keep his name alive. Yeah, he's got a great voice.

846
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:21,860
Any future child I have will be named Burl. It hasn't been a Burl in a while.

847
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:28,860
Has Burl had his voice in a theme park ever? Do we know? Burl Ives was America Sings. America Sings, yeah.

848
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:33,860
Of course. That's why I kept him in my head. God, I'm going to edit that out so I don't look foolish.

849
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:37,860
Of course it is. That's why I thought that.

850
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:43,860
Okay, where were we? I think that was all the Rammet clips. Rammet is my favorite.

851
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:52,860
That's where I got excited. It's not just this. People actually took the baton and went further with it, deeper with it.

852
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:59,860
Unfortunately, Rammet I think is the only other superior song.

853
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:07,860
There's moments that I like in other ones, including, actually, Jason, we're going to take it over to Philly.

854
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:14,860
We're going to the Philadelphia Eagles. They did one in 1988 called Buddy's Watching You.

855
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:23,860
Do you have any new Buddies? Is he somehow a local character enough? I can't really place it.

856
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:28,860
I think he was the coach at the time, Buddy Ryan potentially.

857
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:40,860
It's a little exclusionary to put him in the title. They're not getting on MTV with this. That's a little too specific.

858
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:49,860
I am a fan of the individual personalities in this thing. I feel like this one's a little tougher in general,

859
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:56,860
maybe save for the guy who looks exactly like Will Arnett with sunglasses and a fake mustache.

860
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:04,860
I think the Eagles do go harder. I'm going to play a little of the chorus and then it goes into the verse from The Kicker,

861
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:08,860
which I've never forgotten about in many years.

862
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:26,860
They couldn't have fixed that in post.

863
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:40,860
He got through it before the spacing. Yeah, that wasn't easy to do.

864
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:47,860
He admitted he was nervous. Am I nervous?

865
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:54,860
Yeah, I suppose. A lot of these things inspired individual moves in my video, The Sex Offender Shuffle.

866
00:53:54,860 --> 00:54:02,860
That happens in that for that reason. Somebody gets through it too quickly and then doesn't know what to do and coughs with the extra face.

867
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:06,860
This is like when you see Quentin Tarantino talking about Kill Bill and he's like,

868
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:12,860
I took this from this movie and I took this from this samurai movie and I took this from this kung fu movie.

869
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:16,860
You're doing that with the different shuffles.

870
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:20,860
If I had his film knowledge, maybe I'd be further in the film world.

871
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:28,860
I think I really did corner the market on tributing football raps. I found a way to acknowledge all of them.

872
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:35,860
More than you'll know because you'll hear at the end where really the basis was graphically and everything.

873
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:45,860
I'm excited to give it some love. As for other rap pieces, it starts to get a little inessential.

874
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:51,860
Besides Rammet, I think it gets a little sloppy. The San Francisco 49ers did one.

875
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:57,860
I think it's just called We Are the Niners. I don't think it's much to write home about.

876
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:02,860
Notable though that Sheila E.'s dad and brother put the song together.

877
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:06,860
Sheila E. was around. She's in the video, I believe.

878
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:18,860
I think they brought her in like, hey, can you just teach these guys how to be good on camera and dance and move and not look mad?

879
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:25,860
Which I think she tried to do to mild success to no success.

880
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:32,860
There's an oral. A lot of these songs are like, at least there's a local pride to them.

881
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:37,860
A lot of them have had articles written about them and this one did in some San Francisco press.

882
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:48,860
I like the detail of it. Weird coincidence, Joe Montana is not available for the video shoot.

883
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:54,860
Joe Montana is going to be busy, I'm afraid. Jerry Rice did it.

884
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:59,860
There's not always huge names in them for the Bears.

885
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:09,860
Yeah, but ooh, no, Joe would love to do this rap. He's got sick kids to meet and stuff.

886
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:12,860
But you can't ask him to say no to the sick kids.

887
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:21,860
I wonder how high you had to be on the food chain on a team to be able to turn something like this down.

888
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,860
Ooh, yeah.

889
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:27,860
You know what? That's also some Super Bowl shuffle behind the scenes.

890
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:33,860
Walter Payton originally said no and Punky QB Jim McMahon originally said no.

891
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:38,860
Then they got talked into doing it because I think it turned out pretty well and all the players were like, come on.

892
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:42,860
And I think they thought they'd sorted out the charity thing more and they're like, all right, fine.

893
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:46,860
So they did it on green screen later, which is why they're on green screen.

894
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:54,860
If you've ever been wondering why the Walter Payton shots and the Jim McMahon shots look different, well, I'm at the hot scoop.

895
00:56:54,860 --> 00:57:00,860
This is like the MCU stuff where you go, oh yeah, a lot of it's green screen. I didn't realize that.

896
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:07,860
Even if you have a united team like the Avengers or the Guardians of the Galaxy, sometimes you have to resort to green screen tactics.

897
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:17,860
Like Quentin Tarantino, you should now, after you retire from making content of any kind, making TV or movies, you should just write criticism books about shuffles.

898
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:25,860
You should just write thousands and thousands of words on each shuffle and what the shuffle is, what's good about it and how it was made.

899
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:29,860
Yeah, yeah, and how it moved the shuffle art form forward.

900
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:34,860
And you're right to say that. I do consider them all shuffles, whether or not they say the phrase shuffle.

901
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:39,860
Technically, yeah, they're not necessarily shuffles, but they fit into the genre.

902
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:43,860
I also don't know musically if it's correct to call any of it a shuffle.

903
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,860
What is a shuffle technically?

904
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:56,860
Well, I feel like there is a type of music that you would call a shuffle, but I don't know enough about percussion and meter to say that.

905
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:01,860
I feel like they define it as the dance that they're going to do when they are at the Super Bowl.

906
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:06,860
Right. The shuffle rhythm is a specific eighth note rhythmic feel.

907
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:10,860
I always think of it as like we're shuffling.

908
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:14,860
Sure. Oh, I think that's right. Maybe you're using brushes on the drums.

909
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,860
You could do, yeah, I think that's possible too.

910
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:28,860
Well, that's, I mean, that's a whole chapter there is how the Super Bowl shuffle turned the genre on its head by not being a shuffle, but at the same time redefined what everybody, everyone's notions of what a shuffle is or could be.

911
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:33,860
I'm really excited to write these books and I'm really excited for three people to read them.

912
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,860
Not my own family, even out of politeness.

913
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:42,860
Can you get a 33 in the third book on just the Super Bowl shuffle?

914
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:49,860
I think it's deserving of it, but I'm going to have to make peace with the family in order to have any official.

915
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,860
Right, right.

916
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:58,860
Because that's the whole, like, you know, like also why I didn't play any clips is that she's also said we licensed the song.

917
00:58:58,860 --> 00:58:59,860
We will do it. Right.

918
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:02,860
And, you know, it's we just price it out to be fair.

919
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,860
You know, it's like a thousand dollars a second.

920
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:16,860
And then if you do that math, you're like, wait, so it's like, I mean, wait, I might be wrong, but it is it gets some somehow it gets into being four hundred thousand dollars to use the full Super Bowl shuffle.

921
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:19,860
There is one or two that survived on YouTube.

922
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,860
Yes. So you want to see it.

923
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,860
I know. I don't know how those have made.

924
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,860
Yeah. But there was a long time where it would just suddenly be a black screen.

925
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:28,860
And I'm sympathetic to her.

926
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:36,860
I've had to do this a number of times every once in a while, like once every quarter, I go on YouTube and eliminate versions of my video.

927
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:43,860
I don't eliminate it if it does something like, you know, putting I don't know.

928
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:48,860
There's one where they they deep fake like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and do it.

929
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,860
That's fine. It's something to it.

930
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:56,860
But if you're just going to repost it and say that you found it, I actually had to kick it off of Spotify.

931
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,860
It is now up on Spotify.

932
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:07,860
My own official version remastered by the composer, Alfred Montejano, did a great job and he played the saxophone on it.

933
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:10,860
But yeah, I've had to look, I am in the shoes of this referee.

934
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:12,860
I am sympathetic to her plight.

935
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:16,860
Just in that case, I did not agree with her ruling and neither did YouTube in general.

936
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:18,860
You should team up with her.

937
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:21,860
Maybe you can become an ambassador or something for the song.

938
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:22,860
Oh, yeah.

939
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:26,860
Well, as a I don't I don't want to say this, but the numbers don't lie.

940
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:32,860
I think I have one of the more popular shuffles out there as a later day entry into the genre.

941
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:39,860
So, yeah, are not the the two, you know, bastions of the shuffle genre and not.

942
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:40,860
Uh huh.

943
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:42,860
Don't we need to get together?

944
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:47,860
You should stop being stubborn and she should much in the same way the U.S.

945
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:48,860
government.

946
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:51,860
If they catch a hacker, they will sometimes say, hey, you know what?

947
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:53,860
Actually, let's just get the hacker on our team.

948
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:54,860
Yeah.

949
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,860
Let's just recruit the hacker for our purposes.

950
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,860
So she should do that to you.

951
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:09,860
You can partner with the surviving member of LM FAO because they have that part of party rock anthem where they go every day I'm shuffling.

952
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:10,860
Wow.

953
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:11,860
Every day I'm shuffling.

954
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:12,860
Gosh, that's right.

955
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:13,860
Yeah.

956
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:19,860
Well, they thank you for alerting me to some of the other great shufflers out there.

957
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:20,860
Every day.

958
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:23,860
Even I can't say that every day I'm shuffling.

959
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:26,860
That's that's impossible to compete with.

960
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:28,860
Did you say there's one of them dead?

961
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:29,860
What did you just say?

962
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:30,860
Yeah, one of them passed.

963
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:31,860
Is that right?

964
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,860
Yeah.

965
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:33,860
Oh, wow.

966
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:34,860
I think we never acknowledged it on the show.

967
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,860
We didn't do a full LM FAO.

968
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,860
I don't think that's true.

969
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:39,860
I swore.

970
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:44,860
Red Fu and Sky Blue, they both appear to be alive.

971
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,860
I swore one of them passed away.

972
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:47,860
What a thing to throw out.

973
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:48,860
No, I swear to God.

974
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,860
That one of them is dead.

975
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:54,860
Is it because the Wikipedia says past members?

976
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:56,860
I think that's just because the group seems to be not together.

977
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,860
Actually, well, it's the group that's dead.

978
01:01:58,860 --> 01:01:59,860
I don't think I knew that.

979
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:00,860
I didn't know.

980
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:01,860
I'm not an LM FAO expert.

981
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,860
I just I feel like I would have heard if one of them died.

982
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:09,860
I think the band is they like they're defunct right now or they're not doing new LM FAO music.

983
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:13,860
I didn't know that Red Fu is the youngest son of Barry Gordy.

984
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:14,860
Yeah.

985
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:15,860
Oh, yeah.

986
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:22,860
Barry Gordy's son was the aforementioned Rockwell who did the song Somebody's Watching Me that I referred to earlier.

987
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:23,860
Here's what.

988
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:27,860
Okay, Jason, I think this is what you're thinking.

989
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:32,860
Are you thinking of the band LFO who did the song Summer Girls?

990
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:37,860
Oh, that would be fitting if I was.

991
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:41,860
But no, I swore a member because two of those people are dead.

992
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:44,860
Rich Cronin from LFO is dead.

993
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:48,860
I think somebody else powered Stern clip.

994
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:49,860
Yes.

995
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:50,860
Yes.

996
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,860
Describing Lou Pearlman trying to trick them.

997
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:53,860
Right. Yes.

998
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:57,860
Doing untoward acts in his thick Boston accent.

999
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:59,860
I won't go into it now, but oh, my God.

1000
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:00,860
Disturbing.

1001
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:01,860
So, yes.

1002
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:05,860
Are you sure LM FAO and LFO were not mixed up?

1003
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:06,860
I think that feels right.

1004
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:07,860
I think that's what you're thinking about.

1005
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,860
I mean, Jason, you don't seem sure about that.

1006
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:10,860
No.

1007
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:11,860
But yeah.

1008
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:12,860
I mean.

1009
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:13,860
You're not going to.

1010
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:14,860
They're alive.

1011
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:15,860
I don't know if you're still looking to see if they're dead.

1012
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:16,860
They are alive.

1013
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:17,860
They are both alive.

1014
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:21,860
But I swore there was something where it was a duo and one of them passed.

1015
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,860
And now I can't remember what I'm thinking.

1016
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:24,860
You're thinking of the Dorsey brothers.

1017
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:25,860
They're all passed.

1018
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:26,860
You're thinking of Burr Alives?

1019
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:27,860
You're thinking of Burr Alives?

1020
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:28,860
Are you thinking of Burr Alives?

1021
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:30,860
He's dead, too.

1022
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,860
Burr Alives Jr. is still going strong.

1023
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:34,860
He's also an LM FAO.

1024
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:35,860
Yeah.

1025
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:36,860
Very Gordy.

1026
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:38,860
It's a future Jason or future Mike thing.

1027
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,860
And for a while, I was working for Burr Alives Jr.

1028
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:42,860
Cricket.

1029
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:43,860
Cricket.

1030
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,860
89 year old Burr Alives Jr.

1031
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:46,860
I wish.

1032
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:47,860
Oh, God.

1033
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:48,860
I wish.

1034
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:49,860
All right.

1035
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,860
What have I not gotten to?

1036
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:55,860
Oh, I mean, there's so many of these that are just coming in.

1037
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:56,860
I was like, I need to scan.

1038
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:57,860
OK.

1039
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:58,860
Raiders did one.

1040
01:03:58,860 --> 01:03:59,860
Silver and Black.

1041
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:01,860
I don't think there's anything terribly notable about it.

1042
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:03,860
But if you're a big fan of that, I apologize.

1043
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:06,860
There's ones I didn't know about until this morning.

1044
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,860
The Dallas Cowboys did one called Living the American Dream.

1045
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:10,860
Whoa.

1046
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:11,860
But it's a little too singy.

1047
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:12,860
I don't think it's.

1048
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:15,860
I think I do think these have to be hip hop.

1049
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:19,860
I think a fairly successful one is one outside of the NFL.

1050
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:22,860
This is by the Florida State Seminoles.

1051
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,860
It's called Simply Seminole Rap.

1052
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:30,860
It's a little unfortunate in that there's a lot of white guys in this one.

1053
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:31,860
There's a lot of guys.

1054
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:33,860
It's kind of in the zone.

1055
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:36,860
You know, the Lonely Island Just Two Guys?

1056
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:37,860
Yeah, yeah.

1057
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:38,860
Yeah, yeah.

1058
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:41,860
The especially awkward rap, Akiva and Yorma.

1059
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:46,860
I think the two quarterbacks are kind of a proto Just Two Guys.

1060
01:04:54,860 --> 01:05:23,860
He says, eat steel for lunch.

1061
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:26,860
And then there's a shot of him taking a bite out of a barbell.

1062
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:27,860
That's good.

1063
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,860
Yeah, that's really good.

1064
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:33,860
That guy also, the second guy, it's like two like oddly kind of slight guys.

1065
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,860
I feel like this is the slight whites.

1066
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:39,860
And then I mean, I'm sure they're vastly stronger than me still.

1067
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:41,860
But then the other guy is such a bull that they cut.

1068
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:43,860
Yeah, yeah.

1069
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:44,860
It's very fun seeing him.

1070
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:52,860
That's that's what I want is like the ideal to me is kind of good music, kind of clever.

1071
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,860
Writing, if possible.

1072
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:58,860
And then like just an enthusiasm cap on who's doing the performing.

1073
01:05:58,860 --> 01:05:59,860
That's the best recipe.

1074
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:04,860
If all they give, the highest they can get to is, hey, I'm Gus and I do this.

1075
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,860
Throw it long and I'll run fast.

1076
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:13,860
It's just there's a sweet spot between somebody who, whether it's like acting,

1077
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:19,860
whether it's like Walnut Show, Paul T. Goldman, where Paul acts in his own movie.

1078
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:24,860
There's a sweet spot between somebody who completely doesn't know how to do the thing they're doing

1079
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:27,860
and is really good at it for some reason.

1080
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,860
There's a middle spot that I love.

1081
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,860
And I think you're describing the same thing where it's like they're OK at it.

1082
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:37,860
And there's things that will happen in the performance that are just surprising and funny.

1083
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,860
Choices that a regular actor would not make.

1084
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:47,860
Right. And that's like for certain brains, I think our brains, that is really enjoyable depending on who it is.

1085
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:49,860
Yes. It's basically just what you're saying, choices.

1086
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:55,860
It's just choices and maybe a little bit of nervousness or hesitancy that does something to the performance.

1087
01:06:55,860 --> 01:07:01,860
So whenever it's like this or whether it's the room, whether it's something,

1088
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:08,860
it's like that is sometimes just really fun to watch somebody who is not polished do something creative.

1089
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:09,860
Just take their best shot at it.

1090
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:13,860
You played a lot of the Batman music in your birthday episode.

1091
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:18,860
And I just like not that this is the ultimate version of one of these, but that Bert,

1092
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:22,860
it's like it's a romantic song to one of your biggest fans.

1093
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:25,860
OK, got it. Hi, it's me.

1094
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:28,860
The boy wonder.

1095
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:29,860
Why are you shouting?

1096
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:30,860
Was that the choice?

1097
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:31,860
Yeah.

1098
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:32,860
You don't want to be.

1099
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:34,860
But I'm so glad he did it.

1100
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:35,860
Yeah. Yeah. It's surprising.

1101
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:36,860
It's fun.

1102
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:40,860
Now, there's a guy in the Seminoles who has it clearly.

1103
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,860
I mean, not what we're talking about.

1104
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:43,860
He just has it for real.

1105
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:46,860
He's a star because this is a young Deon Sanders.

1106
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:47,860
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1107
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:30,860
I didn't even check to that one.

1108
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:31,860
That's really good.

1109
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:32,860
All right. Here's a guy.

1110
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,860
Here's a future star, obviously.

1111
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:35,860
Yeah, yeah.

1112
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:37,860
A little less enthusiastic.

1113
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,860
A little more nervous.

1114
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:41,860
Yellow poles.

1115
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:44,860
I was like, I just want to like lay back and do this rap.

1116
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:47,860
You're like, you're like, isn't that's not the I want to get out there

1117
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:49,860
and I want to dominate the football field.

1118
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:51,860
It's like, no, I want to chill out.

1119
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:53,860
The rap is a chill out part of the rap.

1120
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:56,860
The rap is the chance for them to have some fun and they deserve it.

1121
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:58,860
A hard season.

1122
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:02,860
Deon Sanders, incidentally, full rap album,

1123
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:06,860
which he made them let him do on Saturday Night Live.

1124
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:08,860
I didn't realize that.

1125
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:11,860
He hosted it in one of those horrible seasons,

1126
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,860
the one where there was afterwards,

1127
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:17,860
there was the full reset with Will Ferrell and everybody.

1128
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:20,860
Deon Sanders was the host and Bon Jovi was the musical guest,

1129
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:24,860
but he still carved out towards the end of the show

1130
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:28,860
where maybe they're going like, well, maybe we'll have to cut.

1131
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:31,860
Maybe we'll run short on time, but they did not.

1132
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:35,860
He's on the musical guest stage doing a song called Must Be the Money

1133
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:39,860
in a bright pink suit, the craziest suit.

1134
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:40,860
What year is that?

1135
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:42,860
Ninety-five.

1136
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:43,860
Ninety-five.

1137
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:44,860
Yeah, yeah.

1138
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:48,860
In the same episode where there's a just unwatchable,

1139
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:52,860
homophobic, alien probing sketch

1140
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,860
where Chris Farley's pants come fully off.

1141
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:55,860
Oh, I've seen that.

1142
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:56,860
I've seen this episode.

1143
01:09:56,860 --> 01:10:00,860
I don't remember the Deon Sanders musical performance.

1144
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:01,860
That's the deepest.

1145
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,860
Well, I don't think this clip is going to be shown

1146
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:04,860
at the 50th anniversary.

1147
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:09,860
No, but I vividly remember that sketch.

1148
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:10,860
Yeah.

1149
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:13,860
From watching it live or soon after, yeah.

1150
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,860
It's a rough one.

1151
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:19,860
But anyways, so he did rap for real.

1152
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:21,860
You could see the start there.

1153
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:25,860
But what you start to see is sort of like a going through the motions,

1154
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,860
kind of a lack of innovation in this area.

1155
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:30,860
We're going to do raps and it's all going to end with,

1156
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:33,860
we're going to do the such and such rap, seeing it done.

1157
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:37,860
There's only one team that tried to do something vastly different,

1158
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:40,860
and that is the 1986 Cleveland Browns.

1159
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:43,860
They made a piece that does involve music,

1160
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:48,860
but it is not a music video per se, and it is not a rap.

1161
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:51,860
It is, in fact, a 17-minute short film.

1162
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:54,860
It is called Masters of the Gridiron.

1163
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:55,860
Whoa.

1164
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:59,860
It is inspired by films such as Conan the Barbarian.

1165
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:00,860
Wow.

1166
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,860
And properties like He-Man.

1167
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:05,860
What happened here is there's a guy,

1168
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,860
I think this guy was a fan of Conan the Barbarian,

1169
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:10,860
Mike Babb was a player on the Browns,

1170
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:12,860
and he thought, what if we made this all?

1171
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:13,860
Let's just do something way different.

1172
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,860
Let's make a little Barbarian movie,

1173
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:18,860
and we'll say that the team are the Babbarians,

1174
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:20,860
and we got to go, let's just go find a castle,

1175
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,860
and we'll run around, we'll storm the castle,

1176
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:24,860
and we'll tell a whole little story.

1177
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:25,860
Wow.

1178
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:27,860
And this happened, this was made,

1179
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:30,860
and again, whenever I found out about all of this,

1180
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:32,860
this is really where I got excited,

1181
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:35,860
because holy shit, Masters of the Gridiron,

1182
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:37,860
here's a taste of Masters of the Gridiron.

1183
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,860
Your quest to bring the ring to the great city

1184
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,860
will be hard and filled with many dangers.

1185
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:47,860
You will have to do battle with the mysterious Lord's Beasts,

1186
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:51,860
beasts such as bears, rams, and falcons.

1187
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:54,860
But once you are victorious, the ring will be yours,

1188
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:57,860
and the city by the lake called Erie will be home

1189
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:00,860
to the Masters of the Gridiron.

1190
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,860
I, ruler of our great city,

1191
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,860
I shall undertake this quest to bring back with me

1192
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:07,860
the ring worthy of the Masters of the Gridiron.

1193
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,860
Wow, I've never heard of this.

1194
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,860
This is, oh.

1195
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,860
I've wanted a place to talk about

1196
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,860
Masters of the Gridiron for so long.

1197
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:19,860
The camera quality is like, I don't know,

1198
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:22,860
it'd be like polished for a porno.

1199
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:25,860
It'd be like, here's a really good looking 1986 porno.

1200
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:27,860
But they try their best.

1201
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:29,860
It's like shots of just a guy's mouth.

1202
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:34,860
And then Bab puts on war paint, and he's in a good,

1203
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:36,860
he's got a big sword on his back.

1204
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:37,860
Yeah, he looks good.

1205
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:38,860
Yeah, he looks like Schwarzenegger.

1206
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:39,860
It's great.

1207
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:41,860
They tried so hard on this.

1208
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,860
This one I don't think had any Joe Montanas.

1209
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:44,860
They were like, no thanks.

1210
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,860
I think everybody did it.

1211
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:49,860
Apparently they all asked, do I get a line,

1212
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:51,860
and am I going to look stupid?

1213
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:53,860
And all but two of them did it.

1214
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:55,860
And then the next day everybody was so raved.

1215
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:56,860
Wow, that's so great.

1216
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:57,860
That was awesome.

1217
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:00,860
And the two didn't do it really mad and continue to be mad.

1218
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:02,860
They didn't get to be part of it.

1219
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:06,860
So they have to go storm a castle.

1220
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:08,860
And somehow Cleveland has a castle.

1221
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:10,860
There's something called Squire's Castle.

1222
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:11,860
Wow.

1223
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:12,860
And they went and filmed there.

1224
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:14,860
And then there's a lot of, basically he gets hit on the head

1225
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:17,860
during a game, kind of a dark acknowledgement

1226
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:20,860
of the senior underbelly of the NFL.

1227
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:22,860
But in this case, rather than, oh well,

1228
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:24,860
maybe accompanying permanent brain damage,

1229
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:26,860
he gets to have a fun little medieval adventure

1230
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:28,860
when he bumps his noggin.

1231
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:30,860
And he, oh sorry.

1232
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:33,860
So he gets a fantasy basically that he's having or no?

1233
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:34,860
Yeah, yeah.

1234
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,860
He's playing and then he gets hurt.

1235
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:38,860
And then like, Mike, wake up.

1236
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:40,860
Mike, Mike, Mike.

1237
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:42,860
And then he's zooming to his head and he imagines

1238
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:45,860
that all of his teammates are his barbarians

1239
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:47,860
and they got to go fight for the ring.

1240
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:49,860
There's a guy named the Lord of the League

1241
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:51,860
who they have to watch out for.

1242
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:52,860
And then you watch all of them.

1243
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:53,860
The Lord of the League.

1244
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:54,860
Oh, get ready for.

1245
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:57,860
The Lord of the League is a celebrity cameo.

1246
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:58,860
Whoa.

1247
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:00,860
I don't think there's any way you could guess.

1248
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:07,860
But I'm really happy to say it is a 1960s weird talk show relic.

1249
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:10,860
So excited that this is around the corner.

1250
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:13,860
My first guess was because it was like Bronson Pinchot.

1251
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:14,860
Earlier, 60s.

1252
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:15,860
Yeah, 60s talk show guy.

1253
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:16,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1254
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:17,860
Okay.

1255
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:18,860
Anyway.

1256
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:20,860
Jason, do you know 60s talk show guy?

1257
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:21,860
You have a guess?

1258
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:22,860
Can you guess?

1259
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:27,860
Musical weirdo oddity man.

1260
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:28,860
Musical weirdo.

1261
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:30,860
Something I don't think we really talk about, though.

1262
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:35,860
But you had a famous talk show moment in the 60s.

1263
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:36,860
Interesting.

1264
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:39,860
Not Tennessee Ernie Ford was before that.

1265
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:40,860
Not Tennessee Ernie Ford.

1266
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:41,860
Darn.

1267
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:42,860
It's more mainstream.

1268
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:44,860
Odd energy, odd hair.

1269
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:46,860
What year is the Gong Show?

1270
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:47,860
Frank Zappa?

1271
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,860
No, but kind of a Zappa look.

1272
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,860
It's not Chuck Barris, is it?

1273
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:52,860
Not Chuck Barris, no.

1274
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:53,860
Okay.

1275
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:58,860
Well, basically, we were going over maps of like in here.

1276
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:05,860
From the mines of Offensia comes so-and-so and the Hamlet of Interceptus.

1277
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:06,860
It's so good.

1278
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:07,860
Wow, that is really good.

1279
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:08,860
It's really good.

1280
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:09,860
I really like that.

1281
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:12,860
And then it becomes, so it's kind of a Lord of the Rings thing where it's a quest for

1282
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:14,860
the ring, but it's Super Bowl.

1283
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:15,860
Super Bowl.

1284
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:18,860
And then we get to, all right, here's the Lord of the League.

1285
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:24,860
I'm curious if you recognize the Lord of the League on site or for the listeners by voice.

1286
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:26,860
Is this too obscure of a person to even know?

1287
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:27,860
Interesting.

1288
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:30,860
Oh, great warriors, please do speak.

1289
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,860
I know you've traveled far.

1290
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:34,860
What is it that you seek?

1291
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:39,860
We mean to have the ring of the masters of the great eye.

1292
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:40,860
Is that Tiny Tim?

1293
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:41,860
Tiny Tim.

1294
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:42,860
Yeah.

1295
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:46,860
Tiny Tim who I, like, what are the basics of Tiny Tim?

1296
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:47,860
I don't even really know.

1297
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:52,860
Oh, he sang Tiptoe Through the Tulips and kind of a high tip toe through the tulips.

1298
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:53,860
Yeah.

1299
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:55,860
He got married on the Johnny Carson show.

1300
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:56,860
Right.

1301
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:59,860
That was the highest ratings they ever got.

1302
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:06,860
I think he got remarried on the Leno Tonight show, you know, which no, but that may have

1303
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:09,860
happened on the night that I was on it on Halloween.

1304
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:10,860
Oh, really?

1305
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:13,860
I think that also maybe was occurring.

1306
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:14,860
Big episode.

1307
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:15,860
Tiny Tim still alive, Jason?

1308
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:16,860
What do you think?

1309
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:17,860
No, I don't think so.

1310
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:18,860
You think he died?

1311
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:19,860
I don't think so.

1312
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,860
I feel like I know him as like a reference.

1313
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:22,860
Yeah.

1314
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:26,860
Like as I started seeking out comedy when I was very young.

1315
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:34,860
I would hear people reference Tiny Tim and I would know it was not like Christmas Carol

1316
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:36,860
Sick Boy Tiny Tim.

1317
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:37,860
Yeah.

1318
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:43,860
There are references I learned pretty early on between old movies and like Looney Tunes

1319
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:46,860
moments parodying stuff.

1320
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:47,860
Yeah.

1321
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:50,860
You know him as a ref through the filter of reference.

1322
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:58,860
Anyway, yeah, he's in like a cape and he looks scary and he's got like big eye makeup on

1323
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:05,860
and then it becomes like you, you must go, you must fight for your, you know, to rule

1324
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:06,860
the league.

1325
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:08,860
And then like, okay, so who are they going to fight?

1326
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:09,860
Another football team?

1327
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:10,860
No.

1328
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:17,860
When it gets to who they are fighting, it is again, this is like a warrior movie, a barbarian

1329
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:18,860
kind of movie.

1330
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:21,860
And then it cuts to a field of ninjas.

1331
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:23,860
And that is the context of this.

1332
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:26,860
And I also a little bit of music kicks in.

1333
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:27,860
Here we go.

1334
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:29,860
Your enemies await you.

1335
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:41,860
This could be coming out of our shells.

1336
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:42,860
Yeah.

1337
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:43,860
Yes.

1338
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:55,860
Also, I like that little, uh, that part is really nice.

1339
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:56,860
This is apparent.

1340
01:17:56,860 --> 01:18:00,860
This was like a very popular band in Cleveland called the Michael Stanley band.

1341
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:01,860
Wow.

1342
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:06,860
This guy, like a very much like singer of his time, kind of like serious guy in a suit

1343
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:09,860
with beard, sort of Michael McDonnelly.

1344
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:14,860
And it's, it, he's playing in an empty stadium and it's a lot of shots of him like turning

1345
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:19,860
around, back turned to camera and then singing the line or they'll do like the journey separate

1346
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:23,860
ways shot or all this, all the band members are lined up kind of staggered.

1347
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:24,860
Right.

1348
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:27,860
Uh, this is just a definition thing.

1349
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:30,860
Are those samurai as opposed to ninjas?

1350
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:32,860
I've saw, I've seen it listed as ninjas.

1351
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:33,860
I'm not sure.

1352
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:34,860
Oh, okay.

1353
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:35,860
I don't know if they knew.

1354
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:39,860
I mean, they're doing, it's like hand to hand combat with sticks.

1355
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:40,860
Right.

1356
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:42,860
Is what we're, what we're dealing with here.

1357
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:51,860
Uh, let me, let me play a little more taste.

1358
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:52,860
Really?

1359
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:58,860
The song has nothing to do with anything that's going on.

1360
01:18:58,860 --> 01:18:59,860
It's not about football.

1361
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:00,860
It's not about fighting.

1362
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:04,860
I, it's like, it's very like Trey Parker rock.

1363
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:05,860
It's very America.

1364
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:06,860
Fuck.

1365
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:07,860
Yeah.

1366
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:09,860
Oh yeah.

1367
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:11,860
It's a little less aggro though than that.

1368
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:12,860
Cause it's still a little moody.

1369
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:13,860
A little more soft.

1370
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:16,860
We get, well, it's, I think he comes out of the gate with such a, this is the kind of

1371
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:23,860
shit I like, like in our, in the, uh, sky dome episode, this kind of like stupid anonymous

1372
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:26,860
grunt rock, like glass tiger.

1373
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:28,860
Ladies and gentlemen, the Michael Stanley band.

1374
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:29,860
But yeah, you're right.

1375
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:30,860
It gets a little moodier than that.

1376
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:34,860
And then I just, okay, this is the moment that I really love and it's a little softened

1377
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:39,860
by not being able to see it, but when it gets to the chorus, which is about like lovers

1378
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:44,860
and clearly not about fighting, and then there is a moment, this is just, this is genuinely

1379
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:47,860
one of my favorite moments in media I've ever seen.

1380
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:54,860
If, if like, we weren't cooking enough with this dumb band and a football player gladiators

1381
01:19:55,860 --> 01:20:02,860
fighting ninjas, they're like, how can they top it while they find a way?

1382
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:22,860
There's a bear in there, a real bear.

1383
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:27,860
A shirtless football player in a loin cloth is fighting a real bear.

1384
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:28,860
Oh my God.

1385
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:31,860
Does not, there's no distance between them.

1386
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,860
The bear's mouth is on his arm.

1387
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:35,860
They're hugging each other.

1388
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:37,860
Yeah, they're kind of slow dancing.

1389
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:38,860
It's really slow.

1390
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:39,860
Yes.

1391
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:40,860
Yeah.

1392
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:42,860
So it's not like they actually, I, it's supposed to look like they're fighting, but I think

1393
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:47,860
it looks like they're just hugging and the bear is like sucking a honey off of his shoulder.

1394
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:49,860
It's very, yeah, they're playing.

1395
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:52,860
It's very tender, especially given the, the song.

1396
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:55,860
There won't be another lover.

1397
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:56,860
It's still dangerous.

1398
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:59,860
Yeah, but the bear looks like it's having fun.

1399
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:00,860
Yeah.

1400
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:03,860
Well, the bear might be like sort of aroused.

1401
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:04,860
I don't know.

1402
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,860
There's possibility there that the bear is feeling amorous.

1403
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:12,860
Well, they do kind of a turn in their little slow dance and the turn does not reveal a

1404
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:17,860
big erect bear penis, but also there's not such fidelity to this footage and you know,

1405
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:18,860
he's just black down there.

1406
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:21,860
I don't know what, I don't know the color of a black bear's penis.

1407
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:23,860
I don't know if it's also black.

1408
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:26,860
Also though, animals sometimes get aroused in different ways.

1409
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:30,860
So it's, I don't know if a bear has a traditional human looking correction.

1410
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:31,860
Doesn't it?

1411
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:32,860
I don't know.

1412
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:33,860
Of all the species.

1413
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:34,860
It might.

1414
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:36,860
Is man not an animal?

1415
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:37,860
Yes, that is true.

1416
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:38,860
I agree with that.

1417
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:43,860
I just don't think I've ever heard that a bear is one that has like a weird little spiral.

1418
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:46,860
Yeah, but a horse, a horse, I've seen it.

1419
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:47,860
I know what it looks like on a horse.

1420
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:49,860
I know what it looks like on a dog.

1421
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:51,860
I just, I haven't seen it with a bear.

1422
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:52,860
That's all I'm saying.

1423
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:53,860
I'm sure.

1424
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:54,860
You don't doubt that.

1425
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:55,860
Yeah.

1426
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:59,860
I'm just saying that maybe it looks different than I think it does.

1427
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:04,860
That's why you failed the animal husbandry elective you took at your college.

1428
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:05,860
I'm just being curious.

1429
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,860
Have you ever seen a bear's erection?

1430
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:08,860
No, I can't say that I have.

1431
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:09,860
Of course.

1432
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:10,860
Okay, Scott.

1433
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:11,860
Have you ever seen a bear's erection?

1434
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:12,860
Well, now I have.

1435
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:13,860
Okay.

1436
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:14,860
But not up until this moment.

1437
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:16,860
I think we're pretty standard.

1438
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:18,860
I think yeah, we're pretty standard here.

1439
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:23,860
Also, when you Google erect bear penis, you get headlines like

1440
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:28,860
penis bones of ancient bears suggest they had long lasting sex sessions.

1441
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:29,860
Okay.

1442
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:30,860
Nice.

1443
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:31,860
The bears and Jason both.

1444
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,860
Jason's carrying out the tradition of the bears.

1445
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:34,860
That's nice.

1446
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:37,860
Really, it's not even about, you know, about sex.

1447
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:38,860
Let's not think of it as tawdry.

1448
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:41,860
I'm just, I am being as the bears were.

1449
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:43,860
I like to think of it as a long conversation.

1450
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,860
That's the way I think of it.

1451
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:48,860
Connection with a partner through hard ramming for hours and hours.

1452
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:50,860
Speaking through ramming.

1453
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:52,860
Speaking through gyration.

1454
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:53,860
Gyration.

1455
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:55,860
That's sort of the way I.

1456
01:22:55,860 --> 01:23:00,860
I got, when I searched bear erection, I got a.

1457
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:01,860
Erection.

1458
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:10,860
No, I got a pill called boner bears for sale at the Hustler Hollywood online store.

1459
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:12,860
Male enhancement and it's.

1460
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:13,860
Boner bears.

1461
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:18,860
Two of the grateful dead bears kind of entwined.

1462
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:19,860
You think it's licensed?

1463
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:21,860
No, I don't.

1464
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:22,860
Okay.

1465
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:25,860
But it's easiest way to communicate it in an audio medium.

1466
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:26,860
Okay.

1467
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:27,860
All right.

1468
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:28,860
Wait, what's the name of it again?

1469
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:31,860
It's called Boner Bears Male Enhancement.

1470
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:34,860
And why are they not a sponsor of this show?

1471
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:37,860
Should we do a practice ad right now?

1472
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,860
We would be happy to do it.

1473
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:40,860
Yeah.

1474
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:41,860
Hey there.

1475
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:44,860
You know, we're not always comfortable talking about sexuality on the show.

1476
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:47,860
Luckily, one of the hosts definitely is.

1477
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:51,860
He taught us earlier today that sex is a way to connect with a partner.

1478
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,860
And ever since he said that, I've been wanting to connect with mine more.

1479
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:57,860
That's why I turned to Boner Bears Male Enhancement.

1480
01:23:57,860 --> 01:24:09,860
If you're looking for a session that's as long as the film or August 14th, 1976, you want boner bears.

1481
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:11,860
That's a thing, right?

1482
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:14,860
Grateful Dead fans are always talking about specific things.

1483
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:18,860
Well, yeah, they showed it at Sphere.

1484
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:23,860
I don't feel like they're so ripping off the Grateful Dead bears.

1485
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:26,860
I mean, I guess it's of the same style family.

1486
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:28,860
Okay, now I need to eat boner bears.

1487
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:30,860
Oh, Mike, they're gummies.

1488
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:31,860
Okay.

1489
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:32,860
You like that shit.

1490
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:34,860
You know, you love gummies.

1491
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:35,860
You love gummies, too.

1492
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:36,860
Yeah, wait a minute.

1493
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:37,860
I did.

1494
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:38,860
I ate a few handfuls.

1495
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:40,860
I finished off a Haribo bag last night.

1496
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:42,860
Hey, freak, you love that gummy shit.

1497
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:45,860
Cut to Jason with an entire giant rainbow bag in his house.

1498
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:49,860
On my nightstand, like, I just got to finish this.

1499
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:51,860
It's been sitting here for a few days.

1500
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:52,860
I've just been picking at it.

1501
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:57,860
There's different style of boner bear cartoon mascots, too.

1502
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:59,860
And there is, I see what you're saying.

1503
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:02,860
It's a little bit more like that.

1504
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:03,860
I'm comparing two of them.

1505
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:08,860
I guess Jason's not wrong about the, yeah, we're in the design area, I guess.

1506
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:11,860
The female enhancement one's much more generic.

1507
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:14,860
But of course, the male one looked like the Grateful Dead.

1508
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:17,860
You got to appeal to Dude's favorite music, the Grateful Dead.

1509
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:19,860
Yeah, Dead and Co.

1510
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:21,860
That's Sphere.

1511
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:26,860
Sphere just announced an EDM show by an artist I've never heard of because I'm not a big EDM guy.

1512
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:32,860
But it's got like, it's apparently an EDM show with all these original weird looking CGI characters.

1513
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:40,860
And they promoted it by showing a character on the outside of Sphere that bursts through.

1514
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:42,860
And for a second, it looked like Aura.

1515
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:45,860
I really should show you guys a video of this and probably not on the end of this episode.

1516
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:46,860
Aura the Sphere.

1517
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:49,860
It's not Aura, but it looks like Aura.

1518
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:53,860
And I was like, oh my god, are they doing something where Aura breaks out of Sphere?

1519
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:55,860
But it's not. It's a different character.

1520
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:56,860
Breaks out of her Sphere jail.

1521
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:57,860
Yes, I should.

1522
01:25:57,860 --> 01:25:59,860
Take that, Dolan.

1523
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:02,860
Doesn't this look like Aura at first glance?

1524
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:03,860
Yeah.

1525
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:04,860
And she breaks out?

1526
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:05,860
It's not her, though.

1527
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:07,860
It's a different character from an EDM artist.

1528
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:08,860
Oh.

1529
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:09,860
Oh, that they brought to the table.

1530
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:10,860
Right.

1531
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:16,860
And then there's a New Year's EDM show with these original scary looking CGI characters.

1532
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:21,860
This is so insane that people look out their windows and watch a big full animation of a robot climbing out of a building.

1533
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:22,860
Yes.

1534
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:23,860
It's like Anya is the name?

1535
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:24,860
Is it Anya?

1536
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:26,860
Anyama.

1537
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:27,860
I don't know how to pronounce it.

1538
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:28,860
I should have done it before.

1539
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:30,860
And then they break out of it.

1540
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:34,860
But apparently there's just a ton of scary looking characters that play during this EDM show.

1541
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:39,860
Which is something I would want to go to if I was young and had more free time.

1542
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:41,860
I could see doing that.

1543
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:45,860
You'd get an apartment overlooking Sphere.

1544
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:47,860
You'd want Sphere proximity.

1545
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:48,860
Yes.

1546
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:52,860
The kind of places that people have moved out of because it's too bright to be there now.

1547
01:26:52,860 --> 01:27:00,860
You'd be in there because you'd essentially, you know, you can't literally live at Sphere, but you do the next best thing.

1548
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:02,860
Yes, I would do that.

1549
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:12,860
I think when the Horror Nights attraction opens in Vegas, they should have all of the Horror Nights icons on the Sphere.

1550
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:14,860
They should have Jack the Clown.

1551
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:15,860
Sure.

1552
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:17,860
The director, the caretaker.

1553
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:20,860
They should have a scary version of Woody Woodpecker.

1554
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:22,860
Chilly Willy on the Sphere.

1555
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:23,860
Little Moon.

1556
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:26,860
I've been saying for years, Chilly Willy on the Sphere.

1557
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:27,860
I agree with you.

1558
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:29,860
Chilly Willy on the Sphere.

1559
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:31,860
That's something I've been protesting.

1560
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:32,860
Hot Stuff the Little Devil.

1561
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:33,860
He's already a devil.

1562
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:34,860
Hot Stuff on the Sphere.

1563
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:35,860
I agree.

1564
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:41,860
There needs to be more Harvey characters being promoted on Sphere, not this EDM dance music.

1565
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:43,860
Maybe Baby Huey.

1566
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:48,860
You guys don't actually like Baby Huey, do you?

1567
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:49,860
Baby Huey sucks.

1568
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:51,860
I kind of like Baby Huey.

1569
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:52,860
Baby Huey's a fucking creep.

1570
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:53,860
He's a scamp.

1571
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:55,860
I kind of like Baby Huey.

1572
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:57,860
He's an adult diaper fetishist.

1573
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:58,860
He's not a baby.

1574
01:27:58,860 --> 01:27:59,860
Scott, you would hate that.

1575
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:03,860
These are some of the creepiest looking gross CGI characters.

1576
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:04,860
Yeah.

1577
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:05,860
No, I'm not a fan.

1578
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:08,860
It feels very, yeah, it's in the AI zone.

1579
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:10,860
These are the EDM original characters.

1580
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:14,860
Yeah, but I mean, I'll look in to see if they all have names and stuff.

1581
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:15,860
Yeah.

1582
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:18,860
And if it's worth doing an episode of EDM original characters.

1583
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:19,860
A-N-Y-M-A.

1584
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:20,860
Enema?

1585
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:21,860
Enema?

1586
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:25,860
I have to find out the pronunciation of it.

1587
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:30,860
Well, I know the artists that I would like to play Sphere the most.

1588
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:36,860
I don't think it's going to be possible because I am sure they have all passed away.

1589
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:40,860
But let me get to the end that I built up here.

1590
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:45,860
And again, I've already played one of my favorite pieces of media with the bear

1591
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:50,860
fighting the football player, but it does get better in the shuffle genre.

1592
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:51,860
And it is this.

1593
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:55,860
And this is truly where I pulled all my inspiration from.

1594
01:28:55,860 --> 01:29:02,860
So there was something called the Southern Food Brokerage Corporation.

1595
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:06,860
We probably not talked about the Southern Food Brokerage Corporation yet.

1596
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:07,860
I know.

1597
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:11,860
It's got a name dull enough that it's asking for attention from us.

1598
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:16,860
Sponsored a buffet at Disney World for the first month it opened or something.

1599
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:17,860
Wait, this is your way.

1600
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:18,860
That's really the...

1601
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:20,860
You actually know about the Southern Food Brokerage?

1602
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:22,860
No, no, I'm making something up.

1603
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:24,860
That seemed confident.

1604
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:25,860
Jason's a fan.

1605
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:29,860
No, those first five years of Disney World, like the first few years of Disneyland,

1606
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:31,860
it's a little strange.

1607
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:32,860
Sure.

1608
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:33,860
Yeah.

1609
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:37,860
Well, I was not previously a fan, but I certainly am now.

1610
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:39,860
The video just throws you into it.

1611
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:43,860
And you're just forced to assume from context clues that this is some kind of a group

1612
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:49,860
that is a middleman between products, food companies like Planters and Ortega,

1613
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:54,860
and empty supermarket shelves needing products to carry.

1614
01:29:54,860 --> 01:30:01,860
And it's seemingly this group is a lot of like very earnest older Midwesterners.

1615
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:02,860
Oh, my.

1616
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:06,860
And I don't know if they were doing some kind of an event, a trade show,

1617
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:11,860
a company-wide meetup, or if this was just some like morale building tape

1618
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:13,860
to send around through the company.

1619
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:16,860
But this group got together, and God bless them,

1620
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:21,860
made something that I can never unsee that inspired me so much.

1621
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:26,860
And that is a piece called the Super Broker Shuffle.

1622
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:28,860
Whoa.

1623
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:33,860
I'm Laura Moser.

1624
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:34,860
I'm Patsy Hughes.

1625
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:35,860
I'm Jan Bradshaw.

1626
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:36,860
And we're all in clues.

1627
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:41,860
We're the Ortega Build Back office crew bringing the Super Broker team to you.

1628
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:45,860
We are the best sales rep crew doing the Super Broker Shuffle for you.

1629
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:48,860
We're so bad, but know we're good.

1630
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:50,860
Nobody messes with our neighborhood.

1631
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:52,860
We didn't come here looking for trouble.

1632
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:54,860
We came here to win the Super Broker Shuffle.

1633
01:30:55,860 --> 01:31:00,860
Before I get to the verses, I mean, this thing is incredible in general.

1634
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:03,860
Big sign that says Southern Food Broker Corporation,

1635
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:08,860
shot in a real sound stage that's so dull, that's so beige.

1636
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:10,860
They're all wearing beige.

1637
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:13,860
They're all wearing this like really boring,

1638
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:17,860
but kind of like old Epcotty logo in a way where it says SFB,

1639
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:22,860
and then there's like kind of burnt orange, very 80s orange,

1640
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:25,860
and the outline of a supermarket cart is in it.

1641
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:31,860
And then they're all in white shirts with the same logo and khakis,

1642
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:33,860
just a wall of khakis.

1643
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:38,860
And they're also in front of a bunch of like jars, except for the girls.

1644
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:43,860
The girls are up front, and they got pom poms, and they got little skirts,

1645
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:46,860
and they do the fun little rah rah intro.

1646
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:47,860
I'm Laura Moser.

1647
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:48,860
I'm Patsy Hughes.

1648
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:50,860
Jan Bradshaw.

1649
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:51,860
I love these people.

1650
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:52,860
I love this vibe.

1651
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:55,860
There's something kind of King of the Hill about it.

1652
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:57,860
It's so earnest.

1653
01:31:57,860 --> 01:32:04,860
And I enjoy this long rap of them not really syncing up as they clap back and forth.

1654
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:10,860
But where this thing really gets great is where you get to meet the individual brokers.

1655
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:12,860
I love all of these people.

1656
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:14,860
I want action figures of all of them.

1657
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:15,860
This is great.

1658
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:19,860
Layer Channel, I'm here to say.

1659
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:21,860
If you listen to me, I'll talk all day.

1660
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:23,860
Have a lot of bread rabbit on your cakes.

1661
01:32:23,860 --> 01:32:25,860
The best thing you'll eat, for goodness sake.

1662
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:27,860
I didn't come here to pop my bubble.

1663
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:30,860
I came here to win a Super Broker Shuffle.

1664
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:32,860
Hello, everybody, I'm Charlie Carson.

1665
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:34,860
When the time will sell, I freak like a Parson.

1666
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:37,860
Where my swedish, she can be.

1667
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:39,860
Find me sir from a maple tree.

1668
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:41,860
I didn't come here to stand in a huddle.

1669
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:43,860
I came here to win a Super Broker Shuffle.

1670
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:45,300
What's the line about Parson?

1671
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:47,460
Preach like a little everybody.

1672
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:48,660
I'm Charlie Carson.

1673
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:49,860
Time to sell.

1674
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:51,140
I preach like a person.

1675
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:54,460
The finest serve for the maple tree.

1676
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:54,620
Yeah.

1677
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:55,620
That guy's the winner.

1678
01:32:55,940 --> 01:32:57,180
Hello everybody.

1679
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:03,140
I, and they all like this differing levels of comfort.

1680
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:07,140
Larry Tanner at the top has a little bit of swagger to him.

1681
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:09,660
Charlie Carson looks so scared.

1682
01:33:09,660 --> 01:33:10,020
Yeah.

1683
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:10,300
Yeah.

1684
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:11,820
So unhappy to be there.

1685
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:17,340
And this is what inspired my video because the idea of, I just said, like,

1686
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:18,980
it looks like they're doing this at gunpoint.

1687
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:21,460
It looks like some entity is forcing them to do this rap.

1688
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:24,660
I'm like, wait, well, that's a whole, okay, wait, if you're being made to do

1689
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:26,060
something, what do people have to do?

1690
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:28,020
Well, I have to go door to door and say their sex spenders.

1691
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:30,180
So that's where the whole thing came from.

1692
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:30,460
Yeah.

1693
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:30,980
Yeah.

1694
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:34,900
If, if anybody should do a copyright strike and please don't, but if you

1695
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:38,860
somehow are involved in this, in the Southern fruit brokerage corporation,

1696
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:39,700
Hey, you got me.

1697
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:40,460
What can I say?

1698
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:45,580
Uh, I, but it's so funny, like in what other circumstance are you going to see

1699
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:48,500
a 70 year old man rapping and scared?

1700
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:53,220
He is so, they feel, and there's, there's others.

1701
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:56,660
I feel like there's one more who seems mildly humiliated.

1702
01:33:56,780 --> 01:34:02,340
The next guy, similar to the kicker from, but he's watching you is he

1703
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:03,580
just kind of wants to get through it.

1704
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:06,740
So he's going, sometimes when you're nervous, you just go a little too fast.

1705
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:11,420
I came here to win the super broker shop, call me Niles land and say, I'm married.

1706
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:13,100
I've touched when it comes to selling.

1707
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:13,940
Call me Mr.

1708
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:14,340
Clutch.

1709
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:14,740
Great.

1710
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:16,340
Poop con is full of spice.

1711
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:17,380
Spread it on a sandwich.

1712
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:18,340
It tastes so nice.

1713
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:20,460
I didn't come here to drop my duffel.

1714
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:22,500
I came here to win the super broker shuffle.

1715
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:25,980
Uh, come, come.

1716
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:27,460
Are we done?

1717
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:27,860
Are we done?

1718
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:29,460
Uh, drop my duffel.

1719
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:31,220
No, no, not here to try my dough.

1720
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:33,660
It's like he's, it's almost like they told him, like you got to get it

1721
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:35,620
in before the beat is over.

1722
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:36,140
Yeah.

1723
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:38,580
Like a big glove is going to punch you.

1724
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:39,620
Jackass style.

1725
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:43,460
If you don't get this done on time by my duffel.

1726
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:44,420
Terror.

1727
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:45,740
He's just filled with terror.

1728
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:50,780
It's like a slight, it's like a slow down, but only a little bit of boom.

1729
01:34:50,780 --> 01:34:51,380
How are.

1730
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:52,420
Yeah.

1731
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:54,940
If you could understand boom, how are a little bit better.

1732
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:55,420
Yeah.

1733
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:56,300
Dang old.

1734
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:56,940
All right.

1735
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:59,340
I didn't come here by my dang old duffel.

1736
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:02,900
It also definitely also something I took from this and the super bowl

1737
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:05,860
shuffle does it too, but these kind of, they mostly just end with like, I

1738
01:35:05,860 --> 01:35:07,860
didn't come here to looking for trouble.

1739
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:08,660
That's usually what it is.

1740
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:12,540
But I was like, no, I'm going to think of a different tortured shuffle

1741
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,540
ride to pop your bubble.

1742
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:16,780
I'm going to think of one every fucking time.

1743
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:17,660
I'm going to change it up.

1744
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:19,260
It's cheating to just do trouble.

1745
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:21,660
Cause I didn't come here to huffle or buffle.

1746
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:22,220
That's good.

1747
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:22,500
Yeah.

1748
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:24,260
It's almost as hard as thinking of rhymes for cuddling.

1749
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:27,380
Yeah.

1750
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:28,860
We'll get to that for God.

1751
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:29,620
They should have done.

1752
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:32,340
I love the show Friday night lights and they should have really done a

1753
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:35,220
Friday night lights shuffle the perfect thing.

1754
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:38,340
What great viral marketing would have been damn.

1755
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:38,940
Yeah.

1756
01:35:38,980 --> 01:35:40,460
There's been comedy shot.

1757
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:44,300
I mean, besides mine, I like all of the super bowl shuffle guys all did a

1758
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:46,220
reunion for a super bowl ad at some point.

1759
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:51,060
And we made that made up for the lack of money they made doing the original thing.

1760
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:53,420
Um, here's okay.

1761
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:54,300
There's more.

1762
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:54,620
All right.

1763
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:55,820
Here's my, here's my other.

1764
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:56,900
And you know what?

1765
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:57,380
And we sent it.

1766
01:35:57,380 --> 01:35:58,620
Well, it comes up every once in a while.

1767
01:35:58,620 --> 01:35:59,780
What do you want action figures of?

1768
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:00,340
Truly.

1769
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:04,500
If I could somehow, if I had a hookup to get an action figure of everybody

1770
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:07,540
in the super broker shuffle, uh, here's, here's another good one.

1771
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:14,580
Cecil Bozeman is my name supervising sales is the way to fame blue

1772
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:16,220
bonnet margin's hard to stop.

1773
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:18,220
If it's up to us, we'll put it on top.

1774
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:20,460
I didn't come here to try to muffle.

1775
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:22,580
I came here to win the super broker shop.

1776
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:25,220
I'm Jesse Frank from the Delta land.

1777
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:27,420
I put your heads where it stands.

1778
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:29,100
That guy's like bald.

1779
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:31,500
They all look like old Disney CEO.

1780
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:33,580
They look like who ran the company in the seventies.

1781
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:37,460
That guy looks like, uh, uh, Dick Van Dyke show character, Mel Cooley.

1782
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:39,100
He looks like Mel.

1783
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:39,540
Yes.

1784
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:41,500
Big, big, crazy glasses like that.

1785
01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:45,740
Cecil Bozeman is my name supervising sales.

1786
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:49,980
It makes me laugh as hard now as it did the names are great years ago.

1787
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:52,820
Those two are probably the best salesman because they just have

1788
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:54,660
a quiet confidence about them.

1789
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:55,620
Yeah, you're right.

1790
01:36:55,620 --> 01:36:55,980
Yeah.

1791
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:57,060
There's none of that sweatiness.

1792
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:59,980
They're not rushing Cecil Bozeman might be the guy.

1793
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:03,140
If any, if we're judging them as salesmen, he's, he's lit.

1794
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:05,660
It's like we're, we got plenty of time.

1795
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:07,780
Cecil's worried about glasses guy.

1796
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:08,740
No, Cecil's the one.

1797
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:09,420
He's the guy before.

1798
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:09,700
Okay.

1799
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:10,060
Yeah.

1800
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:10,940
Just solid.

1801
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:16,060
They all remind me of my long ago, ex-girlfriend's father who

1802
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:18,540
sold medical equipment in Ohio.

1803
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:23,100
It was just the most like nicest guy, sharp shooter, you know, he's not a

1804
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:26,260
guy who like, you know, we're not doing a bunch of jokes and bits together.

1805
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:29,740
Just like Scott, how's it going to, well, I'm so glad to hear it.

1806
01:37:29,740 --> 01:37:30,380
You deserve it.

1807
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:35,660
It's been a long school year and you have just like, if, if my ex's

1808
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:38,220
dad was in this, it would make all the sense in the world.

1809
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:39,660
They're all very likable.

1810
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:42,340
I, and it's just, it's so funny.

1811
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:43,660
They have to do this thing.

1812
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:48,260
They, this guy has a hard time mustering the confidence, not the confidence.

1813
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:51,060
He, you just, he just can't fake that he does not want to be rapping.

1814
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:03,420
To cool and cuddle, I came here to win the super broker shuffle.

1815
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:05,980
Call me Gary Ballard, I'm solid as a rock.

1816
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:09,420
Big jockeys better buy my brand.

1817
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:10,540
It's how Wallions hunt.

1818
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:12,860
When it comes to other drinks, I'll eat your lunch.

1819
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:14,780
I didn't come here to huff or buffle.

1820
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:15,940
Look at that hair.

1821
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:17,020
I came here to win the super broker shuffle.

1822
01:38:17,260 --> 01:38:19,140
Ronnie Acker from the Cajun State.

1823
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:21,020
Wow.

1824
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:25,420
I like Tim because he had like a rhythm I've never heard before.

1825
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:27,260
That's an innovative rhythm.

1826
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:27,540
Yeah.

1827
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:28,300
That's like a...

1828
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:29,060
Call me Mr.

1829
01:38:29,060 --> 01:38:29,420
Clutch.

1830
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:32,260
Like when you hear little Wayne for the first time and you go, wow, he's really

1831
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:36,380
doing something like different, I've never heard anyone do hip hop like this.

1832
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:37,540
Yeah.

1833
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:38,380
What does he like?

1834
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:39,260
He's like, mm hmm.

1835
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:41,740
He's like sling blade a little bit, French fried potato.

1836
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:43,100
I was selling French fried potatoes.

1837
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:45,700
Is he got a toupee on or is that a dye?

1838
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:46,620
Is that dyed hair?

1839
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:47,180
I'm not sure.

1840
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:49,740
Yeah, it is kind of like thick black, isn't it?

1841
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:52,500
Yeah, that's, he is too old for having that darker hair.

1842
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:56,140
Just kind of got kind of like a wide froggy face and kind of like puffs the

1843
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:58,140
head back to call me Gary Ballard.

1844
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:00,420
You don't want to, he's the one I want to fuck with the least.

1845
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:01,140
Yes.

1846
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:02,660
I hope he doesn't own the rights.

1847
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:07,180
The, the other guy, if they, if they don't like it, they can go to hail.

1848
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,900
I also love hearing about all of these brands.

1849
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:14,300
Like you're left to imply like, okay, I guess there was a rare rabbit syrup.

1850
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:15,100
That was, yeah.

1851
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:15,740
My question.

1852
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:19,340
Weishman's merge, like kind of not all the brands are around.

1853
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:21,260
That's the whole part of the mystery of this.

1854
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:25,340
Um, and then just one more shout out to the girls.

1855
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:28,100
I mean, they already got their time, but I love the girls.

1856
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:30,020
I want to give them some shine.

1857
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:31,860
I'm Laura Mosley.

1858
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:32,900
I'm Patsy Hughes.

1859
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:34,020
I'm Jan Bradshaw.

1860
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:37,620
And we're all enthused with Gina wine and planter snacks and

1861
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:39,660
royal desserts to eat grocery sacks.

1862
01:39:39,860 --> 01:39:41,820
We didn't come here asking for trouble.

1863
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:43,860
We came here to win the super broker show.

1864
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:48,420
I'm Bob Berman and I'm mighty proud to be a member of this super proud.

1865
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:54,620
There's something, let me just, all right, to go a little Jason's direction.

1866
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:57,940
I think I can admit, I think I there's some, there's, for

1867
01:39:57,940 --> 01:40:01,060
some reason I'm attracted to the, like the sedateness of these women.

1868
01:40:01,660 --> 01:40:06,580
Just the like, the kind of just like, so they're just so down here.

1869
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:08,140
I don't know what it is.

1870
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:13,260
I, I don't know, like so like they're hard to get, you know, like what does

1871
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:15,060
they're playing it cool ultimately.

1872
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:15,460
Yeah.

1873
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:15,980
Yeah.

1874
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:19,460
I particular, I would, I would say Laura Mosley primarily.

1875
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:21,500
You want, oh, I'd have to see them full.

1876
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:27,260
I, but I, the vibe wise vibe wise here, let me, if they laughed at your

1877
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:30,780
joke with that vibe, you would feel like maybe you accomplished some, like.

1878
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:31,340
Yeah.

1879
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:34,300
Like if I could get them out of the vibe, if they're, you know, they're sort of,

1880
01:40:34,340 --> 01:40:39,380
you know what, actually, you know who I was similarly attracted to because she

1881
01:40:39,380 --> 01:40:41,540
seemed so like dead inside.

1882
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:41,820
I don't know.

1883
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:47,180
It's hard to explain why I felt this way, but, uh, uh, Dakota Johnson in, uh,

1884
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:50,980
Madam Webb is so like, she's got that vibe in general.

1885
01:40:50,980 --> 01:40:51,100
Yeah.

1886
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:52,020
Like, what is it?

1887
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:53,620
It's so like flipping.

1888
01:40:54,020 --> 01:40:58,140
I was like, I don't know why, I don't know why that's appealing somehow.

1889
01:40:58,740 --> 01:40:59,300
Yeah.

1890
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:02,020
Well, that would take a second for me to psychoanalyze.

1891
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:08,700
She's so odd and standoffish and doesn't want to be in the movie.

1892
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:10,100
There's an energy.

1893
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:12,940
I can't tell like this is deep psychology here, I guess.

1894
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:13,260
Yeah.

1895
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:18,420
Well, you felt a lot of sympathy for her after you learned about what happened

1896
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:20,900
when her mom was studying spiders in the Amazon.

1897
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:23,460
That's part of it too, for sure.

1898
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:28,340
So there's some empathy, there's like, oh, she's being so vulnerable telling

1899
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:30,380
us about their mother's spider.

1900
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:31,620
Did you guys ever watch it?

1901
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:32,540
Not yet.

1902
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:35,140
Recommended, highly recommended.

1903
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:37,540
That is almost like a new room type.

1904
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:42,780
Like the villain of the movie has that, like, oh my God, the spiders.

1905
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:44,620
I'm going to get my spiders back.

1906
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:45,180
Oh good.

1907
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:49,260
They have my spiders and I need to regain my spiders.

1908
01:41:49,540 --> 01:41:52,140
He never says spiders in a normal way.

1909
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:54,940
She's so, she hates being there.

1910
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:56,620
Sydney Sweeney hates being there.

1911
01:41:56,620 --> 01:41:57,020
Yeah.

1912
01:41:57,060 --> 01:41:59,700
I don't know what it is, but here, one more time.

1913
01:41:59,700 --> 01:41:59,980
Okay.

1914
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:01,300
So tell me if I'm wrong.

1915
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:03,380
I'm Laura Mosley.

1916
01:42:03,380 --> 01:42:04,460
I'm Patsy Hughes.

1917
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:05,620
I'm Jan Branchoff.

1918
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,380
And we're all in through Regina.

1919
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:08,660
Pick your fighter.

1920
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:13,820
They're all, first of all, they're all probably 25 years old.

1921
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:15,460
Yeah, maybe.

1922
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:16,180
Yeah, I'm not sure.

1923
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:19,340
In this clip, just cause people look different in the old days.

1924
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:21,300
People styled themselves in an older fashion.

1925
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:21,620
Yes.

1926
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:26,460
I was watching a clip, of course, of Matlock, which, because I, of course,

1927
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:29,580
recently discovered Don Knotts had a recurring role on later seasons of

1928
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:31,540
Matlock and they're goofing around.

1929
01:42:31,780 --> 01:42:34,780
And I looked it up and I'm like, these motherfuckers look like they're 80 years

1930
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:36,140
old and they're both in their sixties.

1931
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:38,540
They're like a couple of years away from Tom Cruise right now.

1932
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:42,980
And Andy, and Don Knotts just looks like he's a skeleton man about to

1933
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:44,580
like go right into the ground.

1934
01:42:45,020 --> 01:42:46,260
You showed me one of it.

1935
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:47,180
Oh, I showed you the other day.

1936
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:50,820
It's the worst stage fighting I've ever seen.

1937
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:54,260
He accidentally, Andy accidentally punches Don Knotts in this scene.

1938
01:42:54,620 --> 01:42:57,780
I think, Mike, your dream would be that years from now, there's a podcast

1939
01:42:57,780 --> 01:42:59,220
that talks about old kitschy things.

1940
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:01,820
And one of the things that they talk about is podcast the ride.

1941
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:03,380
We have podcast the ride guy growing up.

1942
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:03,980
I was, yeah.

1943
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:07,580
You know, what's crazy to look back on is that Mike, Mike, you always thought,

1944
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:08,700
didn't, how old do you think he was?

1945
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:10,260
17, I'd say 17.

1946
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:11,020
That's what I thought too.

1947
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:16,140
I always thought that was a 17 year old with two 45 year olds, but it turns out

1948
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:18,140
actually, if you look up their age, they were all the same age.

1949
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:18,620
Yeah.

1950
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:19,020
Yeah.

1951
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:20,220
But that's crazy to me.

1952
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:21,940
Cause I always thought he was so young, youthful.

1953
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:22,860
This is my dream.

1954
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:24,780
I would be so happy about this.

1955
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:26,820
I would be, what's the opposite of rolling in your grave?

1956
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:30,460
What's the up clapping in your grave or shuffling in your grave?

1957
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:33,060
That's what I would be shuffling in your grave.

1958
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:34,020
Uh, yeah.

1959
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:35,900
Uh, but I want to be frozen.

1960
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:38,220
So I wouldn't be able to move so well.

1961
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:43,700
Um, but yeah, those, those, the, uh, that like unaffected thing.

1962
01:43:43,740 --> 01:43:45,660
I mean, Jimmy, Jimmy Garofalo had that.

1963
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:48,340
I was of course, yeah, of course.

1964
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:48,620
Yeah.

1965
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:49,940
So there's something about that.

1966
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:50,460
I think, yeah.

1967
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:52,980
Said droll, maybe maybe it's funny.

1968
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:54,860
And yeah, I mean, I don't know that these women are funny.

1969
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:56,020
Jimmy Garofalo is funny.

1970
01:43:57,860 --> 01:44:01,060
I don't know all these women in the work in this food supply company.

1971
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:01,300
Yeah.

1972
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:04,460
There may be only one piece of media with Laura Mosley.

1973
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:04,860
Yeah.

1974
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:08,580
Uh, um, but any, but there's obviously there's some, something weird that

1975
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:13,180
Erin was the, was in sex benefit shuffle and that she has that energy that I'm

1976
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:14,620
like, you cast her in the role.

1977
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:15,060
Yeah.

1978
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:15,860
I didn't know what you did.

1979
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:16,340
Vertigo.

1980
01:44:18,180 --> 01:44:19,700
Wait, wait, refresh my, what is it?

1981
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:25,660
Vertigo is like Jimmy Stewart, like remakes Kim Novak to look, I mean, it is

1982
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:30,980
her, but he like remakes her to look like the woman that he actually loves.

1983
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:36,260
So you really love the woman in this video and you remade Erin to look like

1984
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:44,820
the woman that you actually love pulled a vertigo because of the show, this,

1985
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:46,940
this, uh, food service shuffle.

1986
01:44:46,940 --> 01:44:52,100
You had a vibe of kind of a more, uh, I don't know, kind of low on enthusiasm.

1987
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:53,660
So crazy Southern food.

1988
01:44:53,660 --> 01:44:54,580
Jimmy Stewart so creepy.

1989
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:56,900
So I want your hair to look like this.

1990
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:58,740
And he's like making sure her hair is right.

1991
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:01,460
And he buys her the clothes and like, he's obsessed.

1992
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:03,300
He needs to recreate this woman.

1993
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:07,620
Like this is his complete, like he's, he's been, well, I mean, this isn't the

1994
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:12,620
same thing, but I guess it's related that, uh, just in, in this era of early

1995
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:15,500
Scott Garner videos that there's that.

1996
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:20,300
And then also I, I made a couple of videos where I play Michael McDonald and I made

1997
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:25,460
these partially because the first one was a birthday video for Erin and she had

1998
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:28,780
remarks, she was looking at footage of old Michael McDonald's early seventies,

1999
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:31,740
Michael McDonald and like, like, boy, he was attracted.

2000
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:33,540
Boy, he was a sharp looker back then.

2001
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:38,980
And I was like, hmm, go to store by beard image of Michael.

2002
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:39,700
Yeah.

2003
01:45:39,860 --> 01:45:41,060
Associate myself.

2004
01:45:41,140 --> 01:45:43,780
You have announced one person you were attracted to.

2005
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:45,660
Then I'm dressing up like him.

2006
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:53,340
Oddly threatened by the former mode of a singer from long ago.

2007
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:57,220
Uh, so weird psychology abounds, but I shouldn't open myself up to

2008
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:59,300
this analysis on my, my birthday.

2009
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:02,300
Uh, this would be a little, little simpler.

2010
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:03,620
Don't pick me apart.

2011
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:04,660
It's my birthday.

2012
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:07,500
I've had a beard and mustache for over a decade.

2013
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,100
Cause Lindsay told me to do it.

2014
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:12,020
Oh, I like it.

2015
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:12,980
I prefer it now.

2016
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:13,900
I would.

2017
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:14,220
Yeah.

2018
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:16,820
I want to, I want to look like Michael McDonald.

2019
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:19,740
I want to look like Carl Wilson, favorite beach boy, heart of the band.

2020
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:22,700
I want to so much revealing a lot here.

2021
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:23,700
Yeah, really.

2022
01:46:23,780 --> 01:46:26,660
They ended this really ended up in an interesting spot.

2023
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:28,500
It started at an interesting spot.

2024
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:29,460
I would say.

2025
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:30,500
Yes indeed.

2026
01:46:30,620 --> 01:46:31,020
Yeah.

2027
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:33,020
A spot I would like to explore more.

2028
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:35,340
Uh, but that's for another episode.

2029
01:46:35,380 --> 01:46:40,940
I think for now, thank you for letting me do the full lineage of shuffles as I see

2030
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:45,300
it, um, uh, you know, from the one that everybody knew to what I think is the,

2031
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:50,740
the absolutely superior one of the genre, uh, a lot of fun, right?

2032
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:57,180
A lot of fun characters, great ways for people to, um, and the only thing is,

2033
01:46:57,780 --> 01:46:59,660
uh, you know, we're on our way.

2034
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:02,460
Let me, I'll say you survived podcast, the ride second gate, uh, you know,

2035
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:03,300
keep it tuned here.

2036
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:04,580
More birthday shots coming.

2037
01:47:04,780 --> 01:47:10,140
Uh, you can upgrade to our VIP tier, uh, club three, uh, for even deeper nonsense.

2038
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:15,460
I would see if we could really quick, at least think of a couplet to acknowledge

2039
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:18,860
Jason's time as a football team manager.

2040
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:22,660
Is there something that you could tell us that you thought you were good at or

2041
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:27,820
that was part of the duty that you think could be if you had to do, if you had to

2042
01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:31,700
think of a braggadocious rap about being a football manager?

2043
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:35,180
Um, okay.

2044
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:42,260
Uh, one thing I remember in particular was filling up the water cooler, not

2045
01:47:42,260 --> 01:47:49,420
with water, but with ice from the one like teacher's lounge and you can't,

2046
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:55,180
uh, a grown man should not be carrying a full, like you could really hurt yourself.

2047
01:47:55,180 --> 01:47:56,220
This was your memory.

2048
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:56,900
Well, this is it.

2049
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:59,460
And we realized when you manage a team, it was mostly just, you were

2050
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:01,020
being like a PA for the team.

2051
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:02,220
Yeah, I was a water.

2052
01:48:02,260 --> 01:48:03,500
Yeah, I was a water boy.

2053
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:04,380
You were the water boy.

2054
01:48:04,420 --> 01:48:06,020
I was the water boy.

2055
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:08,700
You were Bobby Boucher, the water boy.

2056
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:13,060
But I said we would fill this cooler with ice and they're like, oh, if it's too

2057
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:14,940
heavy, just use that hand truck.

2058
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:22,900
And I was pretty good at pulling the like, um, uh, uh, cart, you know, the

2059
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:26,260
cart that you kind of like kick up and then you were good at it.

2060
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:26,740
Yeah.

2061
01:48:26,740 --> 01:48:27,500
I liked it.

2062
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:28,580
I liked it.

2063
01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:29,020
Yeah.

2064
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:33,780
I liked doing it and I didn't knock it over, you know, by my memory.

2065
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:37,180
And then I, it's why it's ice.

2066
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:41,220
Uh, it's ice because it's so that it can melt.

2067
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:46,100
I think cause it, yeah, it would melt or people would like scoop some out for

2068
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:50,620
like an ice pack is something hurt or, uh, to cool down.

2069
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:51,620
It was too hot.

2070
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:55,100
Uh, I think I got it.

2071
01:48:55,540 --> 01:49:00,340
Uh, just somebody give me one of those like shuffle bubble hustle.

2072
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:02,180
Uh, wait, okay.

2073
01:49:02,180 --> 01:49:08,020
It was the, um, I am here to share, uh, I'm what was saying?

2074
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:08,740
What's the name of your team?

2075
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:10,500
The Eagles.

2076
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:13,260
Okay.

2077
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:15,180
And wait, what's the school?

2078
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:19,300
Uh, shy Chester middle school.

2079
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:20,540
Sorry.

2080
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:25,740
All right, here we go.

2081
01:49:25,940 --> 01:49:27,940
Jason here, manager King.

2082
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:30,140
Acknowledge me as a sexual being.

2083
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:33,580
You want your cooler with not water, but ice scoop it up later.

2084
01:49:33,580 --> 01:49:34,620
It'll taste so nice.

2085
01:49:34,820 --> 01:49:36,820
I'm here to show some hustle.

2086
01:49:36,940 --> 01:49:37,660
I'm here.

2087
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:39,860
I'm also here to do the Chichester shuffle.

2088
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:50,380
A little too fast, like type, type, type, type, type, type down, but I got, yeah.

2089
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:51,260
Well, it's in me.

2090
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:52,060
It's in my blood.

2091
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:53,940
I love shuffling every day.

2092
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:57,620
I'm shuffling and I'm proud to be as alive as LMFAO is.

2093
01:49:57,620 --> 01:50:00,060
So I can be shuffling every day.

2094
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:03,540
We're in remember listeners every day is an opportunity to be shuffling.

2095
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:04,300
My name's Mike.

2096
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:07,980
I am, uh, I like to drive LMFAO is alive.

2097
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:13,700
Blew it there, but I got it.
