1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When your town has let you down

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When your porch has fallen short

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
When you're too worn out to run

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And need some ribs or a Cinnabon

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You need a place, a place for rock

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A place for roll, a place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A sublime hot topic and billabong

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A place where you can purchase a candy thong

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So let's go take a walk

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's all go to City Walk

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Tonight, tonight...

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The next chapter is Sector 14. Blaze Pizza, Starbucks, Hard Rock Cafe. Please don't discuss the retail store. Samba Brazilian Steakhouse. Good luck, boy!

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm upset. It's not that I'm having a bad time. It's just Day 14. We've been at it for a while. I see the light at the end of the tunnel and I want to keep heading to the light.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm willing to meet Scott halfway with my speed, I think, and Jason, I think, is willing to meet us at his own pace.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's right, Michael. Look, that's what people like for me. That's what they want.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I think people would be interested in what...

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
My normal bullshit.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
People would be interested in you at a peppy rate.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I think I'm reasonably peppy.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Really? It's all slowing down.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So I went to the Blaze Pizza. I had never been to the Blaze Pizza before. At this location or any of them, I tend to like this to make your own pizza, like this flash fire pizza trend. I like pizza rev. I like pizza press.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Somebody pointed out to me, though, when they say make your own pizza, everything's to make your own pizza. Every place is make your own pizza.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah, but the Chipotle model.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The Chipotle model. You point to the ingredients basically as they're making the pie and then they put it in. You don't get to have that at Pizza Hut. You just call and tell them and they do all that magic behind the scenes.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes, so that's correct.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's the difference between Blaze and...

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So you can also say a little extra of this or a little less of this or you drop the Band-Aid onto my slice. Please take it off.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So I went to the one at City Walk before we were going to see a movie and I tried. So I tried the designer of pizza. I got a sausage, pepperoni, a little bit of basil and ricotta cheese.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Ricotta cheese, you're not really supposed to use a lot of like that's first off, that's an expensive ingredient. Second off, like a little bit of ricotta cheese goes a long way. They put so much ricotta on my pizza.

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I very quickly did not get any bite that wasn't mostly ricotta cheese.

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Can I ask a question? Why do you not put lots of ricotta on just because it's...

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's just kind of an overpower. It's kind of like...

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I had it before. I just don't know what you're talking about.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's a very mild cheese and it also like usually doesn't have a lot of tang or a lot of flavor to it.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So you're saying it takes up too much space for not having a lot of qualities in it.

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's not too spicy, it's just boring.

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's boring. And so when you put it on a pizza, you usually make it in the shape of like a little ball and then as it cooks, it kind of flattens out into like circles or ovals.

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So there'd be like one ricotta ball per slice is what I... Like if you see a picture...

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Essentially, and then it just melted down to till it was mostly ricotta and like I couldn't even taste the rest.

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So I was just kind of a bummer. So I guess that was... I guess I should have said that's enough at some point, but he was just like putting on...

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Did you know the ricotta was going to be a problem as you were watching him make it?

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No, I didn't because I get it all the time at these flash fire places and it's usually not an issue.

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You get ricotta cheese on the pizza all the time?

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah, ricotta cheese on a pizza is great. Ricotta and sausage.

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay. I just... I truly don't know that combination. I've had ricotta cheese before and I never started to think twice because it's not...

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You see it in stuffed shells. It's the main thing that... And this will come up later.

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
One of the main things that separates a stromboli from a calzone. Calzones have ricotta cheese, strombolis have mozzarella.

50
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
One more time.

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I didn't know that.

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, one more time.

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Calzones have...

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Mozzarella? What do you say?

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes, strombolis have mozzarella cheese.

56
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh, strombolis have that.

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And then calzones can have mozzarella cheese, but usually the main cheese you're getting is that ricotta.

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Is that Pinocchio character stromboli named after that meal?

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
No, I think the stromboli, which I learned today, originates in Philadelphia.

60
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Very impressive.

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's named after that or an area...

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You're very proud of that, I think.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I was. I didn't realize it either. It's very popular pizza places in Philadelphia.

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Is the Philadelphia flag a stromboli?

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No, I mean, it's going to be a cheesesteak. Let's be real.

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah, you're right. Fair enough.

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But the animal is a cheesesteak with legs and a snout and it has a stromboli inside it.

68
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
A stromboli and a little side of Scrapple.

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay.

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What was that we mentioned in an earlier segment?

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Scrapple's back.

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So the other thing with Blaze, I mean, it always seems to have a crowd.

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It seems to be a big crowd pleaser with families when I walk by.

74
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
When I was there in the late afternoon, early evening, the restaurant had kind of looked like it had been in a fight.

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And I feel like a few city walks. It looks a little dinged up.

76
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Like a Chuck E. Cheese or something.

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah, like a Chuck E. Cheese.

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
A lot of action has been seen there.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So I think it was probably a busy day and the dinner rush hadn't started yet.

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So it was a little...

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I find the Blaze pizza, and I haven't been a ton. I've been like once or twice.

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And I find this so kind of boring. I find these places boring.

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Like with Chipotle even, there's something specific about the taste of Chipotle that I like.

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And I like the bowl. I like the burrito.

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Even there's a place called Qadoba that there's specific stuff where I go, oh, that's the taste I like from that place.

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's true. It's not just that they create a burrito for you on this.

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah, they've developed their own brand.

88
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Right.

89
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Stuff that you're after.

90
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And even garbage pizza like Pizza Hut or Domino's, I can imagine the taste in my head.

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's maybe not necessarily the best ingredients, but it is more specific than this Blaze.

92
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Than the couple times I've had Blaze.

93
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's just nothing. I feel like it's nothing in Blaze.

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Blaze was even, I found it more boring than the other kinds of pizza places in this sort of thing.

95
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Sure. There's no, this is what I'm saying. Blaze has no identity.

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It doesn't.

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
There's no taste. There's no, I don't know why these places are expanding.

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's got a flame as the logo. That's pretty strong branding, wouldn't you say?

99
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Sure.

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Well, I guess that's, I'm trying to think of another pizza place with a flame in the logo. I guess that might be the only one.

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I think it's hopping on like the fast casual trend, you know, that Chipotle sort of started.

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But I think you're right with this entire genre. I actually do, I find like the logo boring. I find the brand boring. All these pizza riffs.

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There's nothing specific about it.

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And especially it has no identity because it's letting average customers choose ingredients, which as I've said on the, about Yogurtland, I don't like the, you tell me what's good. You give me your special recipe.

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That's not how I feel about Yogurtland because I think it's a novelty to get to put gummy worms next to Rocky Road. And maybe it doesn't make sense, but it's weird and fun.

106
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That is better.

107
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Pizza though, your primary meal, I am with you. I would rather somebody who knows what they're doing create a flavor combo for me.

108
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Because if you design, design it quote unquote, if you put, ask for too many toppings, it's going to be too much moisture and it's going to, it's going to lead to a soggy pizza.

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah, that's true.

110
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You could easily fuck it up.

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Design your own burgers also can lead to chaos.

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yeah, I've had some real bad times at the counter.

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah, I don't like that place either.

114
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No.

115
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's too much. Like it seems fun. It seems fun to mark down on a checklist what you want, but ultimately it's not rewarding and it's not going to give you something memorable.

116
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And the way that buffets also are kind of more fun to imagine than they are in practice and you almost, a lot of the time, maybe most of the time would rather just pick a good breakfast item.

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It would be 90% of the time because then you have to make like 90 items that are all memorable as opposed to just like having 15 menu items that are all good.

118
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So I had a very different experience. Can I do this now? This update?

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Well, did you get special permission from the sector?

120
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The sector keeper gave me permission to cover this breaking news.

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He gave you the stone of permission.

122
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He gave me the stone of permission.

123
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Can you pull it out and show it to us?

124
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Show us the stone of permission.

125
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It also looks like a city walk. Gold.

126
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Sounds like you're making it up and you're holding it.

127
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay, I'm making it up. I don't have the stone of permission. But he said I had permission.

128
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
If you can get him to produce it when he's around and at least let you hold it for a second, then I believe you.

129
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Anyway, what you're getting at is...

130
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What I'm getting at is I went to the newly opened Vivo Italian kitchen.

131
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Which technically should have been part of sector two nine weeks ago whenever that was.

132
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And we just referred to it back then as future Italian restaurant. We didn't know it was going to happen.

133
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
As you know, there's also been some chicanery with Camaccio's closing.

134
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Look, this whole thing has been in flux.

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I feel like we're in a newsroom in the Trump era where facts are changing all the time.

136
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But we got to go to air.

137
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's 5 p.m. and we got to go on.

138
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Sure.

139
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yeah. And you got to respond to changes as we go.

140
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So, you know, the shop cycle moves much faster today than it ever used to.

141
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So what can you tell us about Vivo?

142
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So I wanted to bring this up in this sector because this was like kind of the opposite of my disappointment at Blaze.

143
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I was delighted by Vivo.

144
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Really?

145
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I thought it looks it looks very nice inside.

146
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Again, it's brand new, but I had great service.

147
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I went like for a late lunch.

148
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I went to go do some work up there because I've discovered recently the Wi-Fi is very good.

149
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That free Wi-Fi where you Xfinity Wi-Fi, the Xfinity Wi-Fi.

150
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Is there a password on that thing?

151
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
No, no, there's no email in, I believe.

152
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Put your email in and my phone like reconnects every time I go out there.

153
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's like, yeah, so does mine.

154
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah. You're not on the Wi-Fi at CityWalk?

155
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
No, I didn't know.

156
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I didn't know about this Xfinity thing.

157
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And also it works at other Xfinity hotspots.

158
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
My phone connects at Dunkin Donuts.

159
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Now they don't send you like spam emails that get in the way of important emails from places like Francesca's, do they?

160
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No, no, I don't.

161
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Well, if they do, I've probably already signed up for most universal mailing lists.

162
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So I haven't put the show account.

163
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But look, I look forward to those Francesca emails every day.

164
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This was a Twitter thing.

165
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I was having a little fun on Twitter.

166
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, this came up on Twitter and not on the podcast, but you pointed out that we have our show account because I ordered a $9 shot glass that we've gotten emails from Francesca's every single day since then.

167
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yeah, it's like getting emails from a lover who is off at war.

168
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I guess it's like that.

169
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's just like that.

170
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But there's also great deals.

171
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You don't find the daily nature of it comforting the way that the City Walk Saga has been a comforting first thing in the morning arrival in everyone's podcast inbox?

172
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You know, some days I do, some days I don't.

173
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You're not having Francesca's some days.

174
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Love isn't always easy.

175
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
There are ups and downs.

176
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There are ups and downs. You got to work at it.

177
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Okay, so Francesca's, I went for a late lunch.

178
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There were people sitting on the patio.

179
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It was 89 degrees out, so I opted to sit inside, had the whole restaurant to myself.

180
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Wow. They started me off with this lovely little kind of crusty sourdough roll, which I ate about half of.

181
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Well, yeah, I was going to say, what's the size? What do we got size wise on that?

182
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Softball?

183
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yeah, I'd say softball.

184
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Wow. And some dipping olive oil.

185
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Delicious.

186
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Dipping oil.

187
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I ordered this. This is what I was, so I ordered essentially it was a stromboli. They just call it stuffed bread.

188
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Italian salami, pepperoni, sharp provolone, arugula, roasted red peppers wrapped in pizza dough.

189
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Again, more delicious fresh bread. It came in this little darling little shape.

190
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The arugula and balsamic just kind of drizzled on top.

191
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
How would you describe that shape? It's kind of a volcano.

192
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I was going to say volcano is how I would describe it.

193
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
A bunch of arugula exploding out of it. Arugula lava.

194
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's kind of like a square with like a raised X. The arugula was just kind of like draped on top.

195
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So I ate that off and then cut it in half.

196
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's like a temple. It's like a little Indiana Jones temple kind of thing going on there.

197
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's beautiful.

198
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah, it's beautiful.

199
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It was beautiful. I got a little marinara on the side and it was delicious. It was really good.

200
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The cheese and the meats and the peppers and onions, very good.

201
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I could easily see, you know, getting this, cutting it in half or in fours and sharing it with the table.

202
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Should Mike and I go up there and put Vivo in serious contention?

203
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Well, I feel like any time I find a restaurant or something I really like and really enjoy and I tell people, oh, you should try this.

204
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
They're always like, yeah, it was fine. So I don't want to get people's hopes up.

205
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
For my taste, I think this might be easily the best food I've eaten at CityWalk.

206
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh my gosh.

207
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The bar is rather low. So I think by being passable, I think a B to B plus range restaurant is maybe going to sneak in.

208
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I think an 86 percent is probably the best you're getting up there.

209
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I mean, I thought it was very good. They seem to really be pushing like, oh, they make the dough.

210
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You know, they make a lot of the stuff fresh. Although look, a few days prior to this, I was up there for different events,

211
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
which we will discuss on a future episode after this saga is over.

212
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And I had a lovely sandwich at Ludo. And I know you weren't super fond of Ludo.

213
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I wish I wouldn't call it lovely by any stretch of the imagination.

214
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Messy sandwich at Ludo, whether you like it or not.

215
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So, yeah, I don't know. But yeah, I liked Vivo a lot. The design was good.

216
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
They were playing lots of Italian music. Sometimes like, you know.

217
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You mean like Lady and the Tramp music?

218
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Sometimes Lady and the Tramp music. And then like sometimes it'd be Italian like techno or house music.

219
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh, wow.

220
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Which was very, a very funny switch. But it seemed like they had a stocked bar and yeah, lots of pizza, pasta, meats.

221
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I was into it.

222
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I wish I had footage of you in an empty restaurant eating while the Lady and the Tramp song was playing.

223
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Pounding water.

224
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Because it's 89 degrees.

225
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And sunny. Yeah.

226
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'll try to get the security camera footage.

227
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't want to go out of order, but since you said empty restaurant, this might be my end to start talking about Samba Brazilian Steakhouse,

228
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:32,000
which I went to at two in the afternoon recently. And I was in fact the only person in the restaurant.

229
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Well, not I mean that and the people that I went with our friend, Andrew Grissom and another friend of the podcast, Buzz Buzz.

230
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And speaking of Buzz Buzz, there were also a lot of flies running around the restaurant.

231
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh, no.

232
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Unrelated to Buzz Buzz.

233
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Wait, on the patio or inside?

234
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Literal and figurative bugs. No, inside.

235
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Ah.

236
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll post some photos on the Twitter of what the full breadth of the restaurant looked like with basically just me inside.

237
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So, you know, that's what I will set the stage there that I walked into an almost empty restaurant.

238
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The hostess slash waitress who was lovely, wonderful, gave us a great time, clearly like very bored because nobody was going in there and kind of like hung out and talked with us for a while.

239
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And rightfully so. I think there was nothing else for her to do.

240
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But I think she told us we were the third customers of the day. And in fact, they fired up the rotating meat skillets or whatever. What do you call it? The giant shish kebab, the rotating.

241
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What's that actual term?

242
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The spit?

243
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yeah, I would say a spit unless it's like the shaped kind of like the shawarma.

244
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Rotisserie situation.

245
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Like there was a lot of stuff all in that range, but there was just nothing going when we walked in and they turned it all on for us, which I felt really I felt guilty about the entire thing.

246
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I think we could have given the staff the afternoon off.

247
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Oh, wow.

248
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Had we not walked in. I think they were having a real easy time.

249
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I went at 5 p.m. and sat on the patio and for happy hour and had the similar experience of like no one else is here.

250
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The difference between this city walk stuff and like downtown Disney, for instance, is City Walk is almost a ghost town in the day. All these like a lot of these restaurants are empty.

251
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Where did you go?

252
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Like when business districts peak in cities like lunch.

253
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But I'm saying.

254
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Lunch and dinner.

255
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yes, although some cities like downtown clears out what you're right. Downtown Disney. There's there's never a time of the day where it's not packed.

256
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Right. People are like excited to go to downtown and I may be not excited, but they're like willing to just go to all the restaurants at any time of day.

257
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
There's always more than 10 people at the what's the bar in the middle. Your favorite bar.

258
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The bar. Yeah, as opposed to. Yeah, when we we kept walking into different sectors. Apologies to the sector keeper.

259
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But yeah, we like passing by that center area with the five towers stages, which we'll talk about and also and then the big screen playing weird local music videos and whatever.

260
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:37,000
There's just no one there. Yeah, it is such an empty space with nothing to distract from that. It is a big empty space and no one there at three in the afternoon.

261
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's not such a bizarre. No time because you would think people would be going like, well, let's just have a break from the theme park because it's also close.

262
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Like it's very close. It's not. They try to make it act like like like it's a very far walk. It's not. It's like seven minutes to walk back to there in the theme park.

263
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And you've gone all the way down all the escalators and you're in. I mean, that's like miles to get from that's all the way from the end from the Transformers ride up to Samba Brazil.

264
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That is an hour and a half walk. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's very it's very exhaustive. Maybe that is what it is in terms of workout for a week.

265
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But I guess what maybe is odd is now while two o'clock is not a strange time for lunch, it maybe is a strange time for an all you can eat Brazilian meat buffet.

266
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That's how it works. It's it's it's similar concept to Fogo de Chow, probably a more popular iteration of this.

267
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You you walk in, it's just it's a twenty five dollar flat rate is a big lineup of cold salads and rice and, you know, and different amenities to go along with your meats.

268
00:20:45,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But then you just pay you just meat keeps coming and coming and coming. And you've got a weird little like a little rod thing that you have to either make green if you want meat to keep flowing and bread if you want meat to stop going.

269
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's similar to the sign system at Bubba Gump just down the road.

270
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So several places at City Walk with a stoplight system. But I guess I can understand.

271
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It seems like kind of thing to be a lot more fun for dinner. Pretty odd to be just a couple of guys having a quiet lunch that entails people got the same guy going back and forth with swords over and over again.

272
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yeah, because that if it's empty, that takes away part of the allure of just like people wandering around with the swords. Do you want some of this? Do you want some of that?

273
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You feel like you're at a party with hors d'oeuvres and they're just flowing and like, oh, I couldn't possibly.

274
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Oh, I guess I will if everyone else is. But yeah, being in there alone, pretty odd.

275
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
One guy do it just doing runs like one. Yeah, one sword wielding man who is making the food and then bringing you the food.

276
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And also, we all only took just one piece of meat every time and we were still, you know, totally stuffed and probably a little sick by the end of it.

277
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:17,000
How many different types of meat? I think we I think lunchtime you get six. OK, I think we had all six and I should have remembered all of the types.

278
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But I don't know. You know, the types of meat.

279
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And then there's all the salads, because like this is too many to name too many. We there is one in Burbank that does it by the pound.

280
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I think that's a good way to do it, where it's like you dinner by the power.

281
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yeah, I don't know. That was weird. No, I don't. I don't.

282
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
We were there to get we've been at like two different Brazilian.

283
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Well, right. We were one in Vegas for a bachelor party and you almost fell out of your chair when you saw how much it cost.

284
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's a lot of money and it's like a buffet. It's a glorified but it's a buffet with a little more of an experience on it.

285
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah, that one had like 12 different meats or something. That was crazy. That it's so many.

286
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And it was like sixty dollars. I think at night you're getting more meats.

287
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I would recommend I, you know, look, I had a good time. I really I shot him in the leg talking about emptiness and flies.

288
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:16,000
But the the the food was very good. Hostess was was fantastic. Great service. The the drinks were were great.

289
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
What do you what do you call it? That's a Kyper in Kyper in. Yeah.

290
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Did you guys have those? Yes. Those are excellent. I thought wonderful.

291
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So made with a so that is like a it's a relative of sangria, but it's made with Brazilian.

292
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It's a rum. Rum like made with sugar cane.

293
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Kasha. Yeah, I looked up the pronunciation.

294
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Shassa guide. Kasha. And that was delicious. Yeah.

295
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Legitimately very good drinks. I think if you're talking kind of odd off the beaten path, the drinks at City Walk, you probably can't go wrong with Kyper.

296
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So I have a lot of good things to say about this. And I believe on the weekends they have Samba dancers and that kind of thing.

297
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Yeah. And they also said it's a great place to have a quinceanera.

298
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Should either of you guys be in the market to do so? Maybe one day we wanted they were going to let us tour the second floor.

299
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But that was right when the health inspector was doing it to. Yeah, we got to see the City Walk health inspector.

300
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Wow. And you didn't get an exclusive with him for the show. Oh, God, I'm sorry.

301
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I would have been a score. I missed the ultimate. I should have just barged in. I should have had a microphone with me or my iPhone voice memo.

302
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Just shoved it in his face. I want answers. What the hell happened to Camacho's? What did they do?

303
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Also put him on the spot about how would you feel if you saw a bunch of boba and orange slices and fruity pebbles clogging a toilet?

304
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Would you wish that that person had dumped it out into a planter or was the right move made?

305
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I would have asked him about I would have tried to get Johnny Rockets in trouble when Jason was talking about how wet his burger was.

306
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Ah, you're right. And how wet the ketchup was. He should have really he should know about that to investigate.

307
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,000
You know, this is all stuff that he probably missed him. I feel like over all these episodes, we have perhaps a lot of health complaints.

308
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Maybe we all together, maybe we fire file our first podcast lawsuit against the City Walk organization. Yeah, that's three counts as a class, doesn't it?

309
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yeah. Is he sure? I think. Yeah. OK.

310
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:39,000
OK. Verena was fine, but I should have had words with that health inspector and I think he could have easily paid me off with, you know, picture of Capri.

311
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yes. Half off at a happy hour.

312
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Oh, they're happy hours like so. I also say a bunch of Brazilian beers I've never heard of that look very good.

313
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And I think I was there, a crowd came up and said the bartender, oh, we're going to take a table. And they said and they asked you to Kyberinius and the bartender was like, yeah, they're like, oh, great.

314
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,000
We're from Brazil. Oh, so stakes are high. Very curious to hear their opinion because I thought it was delicious and refreshing.

315
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
They didn't like shout their opinions. They didn't yell good or very bad. No.

316
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:23,000
On the on the website, it does not list the actual price of the buffet because I assume the price goes up at dinner. It does. Twenty five for lunch is what I've ever lunch.

317
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
What is it? You know what it is for like 40 or something at dinner, probably?

318
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yeah, that this is very similar to the Disney World meal, Ohana. If you've ever had that at the Polynesian. OK.

319
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But that only is like three or four meats. I'm looking here just if you guys maybe this happened to Jason, you can add a half pound of extra large prawns to your meal.

320
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
But that's premium. That's a premium. It doesn't say how much that is either.

321
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But there's the all you can eat Brazilian barbecue.

322
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
And then it also doesn't specify what meats. So the meats must be changed up as well.

323
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And then I think there are seasonal meats. Yes. I think they explain that.

324
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:09,000
OK, so probably ones for Christmas sausages with red and green flakes inside reindeer.

325
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Very prevalent in Brazil and very popular. Valentine's Day. It's like the hearts of animals.

326
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's just mostly heart. In St. Patrick's Day, it's all there.

327
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
They're all miniature. It's all leprechaun sized meat pieces, of course, from tiny cows.

328
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And you can get a big kid's meal, which is all you can eat for six to twelve. Six to twelve year old. Jason's smiling.

329
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Jason's remembering where he put his little beanie hat. His beanie with the spinner. The old kid's meal grift that you pull out once in a while.

330
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah. Well, just remember where you put your razor as well. Get rid of that beard.

331
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Well, sure. Now you're talking. So I don't know. I don't have a lot like funny to say about this place.

332
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I think what I will say is I think they need to offer some kind of perhaps small lunch item option because just just having buffet available, I think, probably turns a lot of people off.

333
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
My other complaint is that on the outside of it, there's a little path that leads to nowhere.

334
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And I think we saw people go into the path and then look confused and then leave. This happened to me. Yeah.

335
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I went down the path. I sat on the patio outside. That was what I was going to. Yeah. I wasn't sure how to get out.

336
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Oh, because the bar is two sided. So the inside bar, they go through a doorway and it becomes the outside bar.

337
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And there's just like a pane of glass dividing it. This is some real. This is some inception shit.

338
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Yeah. And I went through the door to go outside and I had I thought it was like I was leaving the rest and they're like, oh, no, just go right for the patio.

339
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:07,000
But the patio is kind of fun because you can watch soccer on the screen while you hear the music from Jimmy Buffett from Margaritaville directly behind you bleed going on.

340
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Bleed central. The caipirinha sat very, very well and very light with that Vivo Italian Kitsch and meal.

341
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,000
That heavy meal is a very nice, refreshing drink. You know, the caipirinha also put me in the mood for some entertainment.

342
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And I bring this up. This is far from the sector that we're talking about. Apologies to the sector keeper.

343
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
But I feel more comfortable talking about this because he's not here. And you got the permissions. He'll give me the permission.

344
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,000
He'll give me the permissions. Also, this is so chill. This is adjacent. Yeah, sure. Yes. This is adjacent.

345
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Surrounded by. Did you say this is adjacent? Oh, well, wait, wait, wait. Well, actually, I'm not talking about the stages.

346
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:55,000
What I'm talking about is that during my time up there with our friend Buzz Buzz, we ran with bellies full of caipirinha.

347
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:04,000
We ran into for the first time since we started going up there, a television taping at City Walk. Now, this happens a lot.

348
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I think we talked a little about how they film extra with Mario Lopez up there.

349
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But this was a different show and we had to stand around for a minute to tell what it was.

350
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But it was the show Street Smarts Street Smarts was a syndicated man on the street type show, kind of a cousin of Jaywalking, the Jay Leno, Jaywalking bit where he people, how dumb random people are.

351
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Their their dumbness is put on display. So we ran into just a real like a big field of of lights and flags and bounce boards.

352
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It was it was very bright. It was like a mirage. We realized it was for a TV taping and we stood and we watched it for a minute.

353
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
The show where regular people are harassed for not having information.

354
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And we walked up right as the host of the show who is OK.

355
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:05,000
So first, I think I'm breaking the news here that streets Street Smarts is coming back because this show was on from 2000 to 2005.

356
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And it is now this has not been published anywhere. I don't believe. And we heard the guy say, oh my God.

357
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Well, you know, it should be on next year, I hope. Fingers crossed. Oh, my.

358
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
So I maybe have a little industry inside dope here for Street Smarts fans out there.

359
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
This is going to get picked up by Deadline and Variety as soon as we put this episode out.

360
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
This is a big breaking news. This is a hell of a told. It's like a Harry Knowles 1998.

361
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Ain't it cool news scoop as far as I'm concerned here? Here.

362
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm very excited. One of the great franchises finally back on television.

363
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And we so we got to walk right up as a, you know, a very dumb regular person was given an item.

364
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And I believe she was holding a, you know, like a nostril trimmer, an electric nostril trimmer.

365
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And the guy's asking what it is. And she says, well, was it a taser? And you're like, oh, that's stupid.

366
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
How could you think that that's a taser?

367
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Then they cut and then the host said, hey, that was great.

368
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So maybe try one more time and just really hit the word tase. I just want to make sure that like that really comes out.

369
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So in addition to the scoop, it's Street Smarts is coming back. Street Smarts also is a lie.

370
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It's it's all for show. And also also spoil some of their bits in that we watched the guy and another hilarious game of do you recognize this item?

371
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
He leaves, comes back around to the set and now he's wearing a mullet wig.

372
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:38,000
He looks ridiculous. The balls of this guy to put himself out there and wear such silly hair on camera.

373
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I mean, you couldn't catch I wouldn't be caught dead wearing something like that.

374
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
What is the movie Point Break?

375
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It was sort of Point Break-esque.

376
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
That's crazy.

377
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yeah, he looked he looked so stupid, man. But, you know, I laughed.

378
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I was having a good time watching it. So look forward to this mullet joke.

379
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
But also it really seemed implied that they didn't know when and where Street Smarts was going to air.

380
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So I wish I could get more specific than that.

381
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,000
But if you want to put your Smarts on the line, head up to City One and where they are casting people just walking by.

382
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
None of us were brave enough to do it.

383
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And thank God, because I didn't want to end up in one of those mullet wigs.

384
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Man, you look you look silly.

385
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I don't think I would ever come back for you. My bros from high school saw me looking like that.

386
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
No way, man. Having this dumb hair and shit.

387
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Well, that'd be the end of me.

388
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Yeah, for sure, man. For sure.

389
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
They never had me back to do a shot ski with them again.

390
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,000
How would you road your ass at the homecoming game that you all still go to?

391
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
This now that I think about you, you've unlocked a city walk memory of mine real quick.

392
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And I will be very quick about it.

393
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:56,000
One of the first times I ever went to city walk, they were filming or shooting a show there over by like kind of where the globe is, where they do shoot extra.

394
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Jason may know where I'm going with this. I know where you're going with this.

395
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
They were shooting a game of slam ball.

396
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Slam ball, of course, is trampoline basketball.

397
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It was on Spike TV for a year or two.

398
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I hear it's still kind of big in China, but we walked over from city walk and I went, oh, my God, they're playing slam ball.

399
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And it was official slam ball, too. It was not some knockoff league.

400
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It wasn't some JV slam ball league or whatever.

401
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Tramp basketball or something. It was official licensed slam ball.

402
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
The sport of kings.

403
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And I was so excited. I went there and we watched part of a game.

404
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You didn't jump into the game.

405
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
You didn't grab a tramp, jump over the rails and get in there yourself.

406
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Believe me, I want to.

407
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
But that's just such a highly skilled, you know, that's too it's out of my abilities.

408
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
You haven't spent enough time on the tramps.

409
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah, I haven't been on the tramps enough. So I'm not going to leave it to the professionals.

410
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Professional slam ball. But if they if in the success of street smarts and they start filming more stuff up there and they bring back when they do celebrity slam ball.

411
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
But then the level, the stature of celebrity we will all have from the city.

412
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
The city walk series.

413
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yeah, we're going to be so big just at can you imagine once these are all out going back up to city walk and the kind of welcome we'll receive from all these stores now that we've made all of these cashiers famous, the people in all of these restaurants, we've turned them all into celebrities and we ourselves will be the biggest celebrities.

414
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Right. It'll be like walking through like the old country and everyone kind of is like outside the owners all are outside of the restaurant.

415
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
They're offering us like they're great, like their loaf of bread and they'll be like, Jason, Jason, come here, come here.

416
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Try the new voodoo donut that has a Snickers bar inside.

417
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
If I must insist.

418
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I guess it's the Simpsons joke where they're like Don Homer, Don Homer, Don Jason, Don Jason.

419
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,000
There's a new there's new Cinnabon bucket. It has cinnamon bites, but they have pepperoni on them.

420
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
No, I draw a line.

421
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Scott, we have a new McComby maybe shot glass. This one is a double please.

422
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Put some cappuccino in it please.

423
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Michael, would you like to see the new Marvel movie?

424
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It's six months. It's a rough cut, but please come inside and see it.

425
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
That's too good of a deal.

426
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Those movies, City Walk movies cost $48 each. They're not giving that away for free.

427
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Discount for dollars off and a dollar off at the McGuffins we have here, whatever we call it.

428
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
$1.75 off parking. The bill is only somewhat crumpley.

429
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yeah, that's more realistic.

430
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

431
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Well, that'll be great.

432
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And all that to say, get in the game. Get slam balling.

433
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
All right, well, I will.

434
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Star of celebrity slam ball coming 2020.

435
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
As Jason knows, I know the guy who created it.

436
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yes, Mike does know the creator of slam ball.

437
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Oh, that's right. Why is this the case?

438
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I worked on some clip shows with him many years ago.

439
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Oh, this is the second discussion of the clip shows.

440
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
We'll get them on. It doesn't make any sense for a theme park podcast, but neither does City Walk really.

441
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
No, this episode has been entirely slam ball and the street smarts.

442
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Yeah, no, all of it pretty well.

443
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
To me, that's the universal Hollywood ultimate experience, seeing a television show.

444
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
You're right.

445
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
That seems related.

446
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
But, you know, while we're moving past all of the perfunctory stuff, how about we get Starbucks out of the way?

447
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Yeah, it's a Starbucks in this sector.

448
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
There's a Starbucks. Always had good service there.

449
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
That's good.

450
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yeah.

451
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It is one of those things I think I've said maybe on prayer episodes that you get that surcharge.

452
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Everything's costing you a buck, buck 50 extra.

453
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Oh, the theme park tax.

454
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
The convenience.

455
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
The theme park, whatever you...

456
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
The magic tax.

457
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Yeah, the magic tax, sure.

458
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I felt a lot of magic, certainly, in that.

459
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Yeah.

460
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yeah, you feel it more than some regular shit Starbucks.

461
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
That's always crowded.

462
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
You do wait a while. It gets pretty crazy.

463
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Look, it's necessary that there be a Starbucks there.

464
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Right.

465
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I think it's funny that Starbucks can straddle the line.

466
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
They're in Disneyland. They're in Universal Studios proper.

467
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
They transcend the theme park.

468
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Nobody had to settle for a coffee bean or a Peet's.

469
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Starbucks, I guess coffee bean is not settling.

470
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
There used to be a coffee bean at Upstart Crow.

471
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
At Upstart Crow.

472
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
That's correct.

473
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
That was pretty good too.

474
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
They both coexisted.

475
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Starbucks ran them out of town.

476
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Yeah.

477
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I do wish there was some sort of...

478
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Because the Starbucks in California Venture and Disneyland are nicely themed because

479
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Starbucks on Main Street where the Market House used to be, it is the Market House still.

480
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Nicely themed in there.

481
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Also, California Venture, nicely themed.

482
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And in the Florida parks, very nice.

483
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Yes.

484
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
We could make this Starbucks a little bit like the movies or something.

485
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Let's have a little something in there.

486
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
That's my only note for it.

487
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I agree with that.

488
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
It's kind of a normal Starbucks.

489
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Let's make it. Let's fancy it up.

490
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I know it's not in the park.

491
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Isn't there a little scene in that Menchies?

492
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Aren't there a bunch of frozen yogurts that are alive and starring in a movie or something?

493
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Oh, wait.

494
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Is that right?

495
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Yeah.

496
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It's something like that.

497
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Anyway, do that.

498
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Do that.

499
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Yeah.

500
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
We have a bunch of mochas all up starring in a film.

501
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,000
He's auditioning and he's trying to make it in the business, but it's very hard.

502
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Yeah.

503
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
It's starting to get discouraged.

504
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It's a big cup of Teavana tea.

505
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
He's holding his headshot, but he's in a row of seven other Teavana teas and they all look

506
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
essentially the same.

507
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It's all digital now.

508
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
They really didn't need to bring that headshot.

509
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
They just have a software.

510
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It's a formality.

511
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
He's murmuring to a cup of cappuccino next to him.

512
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Why did I pay for this?

513
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Do you have a cheaper headshot guy?

514
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
They're all trying to get drunk by people.

515
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
That's their analog.

516
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
They're not trying to be in Hollywood.

517
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
They're trying to be, customers are going to drink them.

518
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
That's their show business is being consumed by us.

519
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
That makes sense because the one in Universal Park is very Art Deco-y.

520
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
That one, I think, that one looks nice.

521
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yes.

522
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
They should plus up the City Walk one like that.

523
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I agree.

524
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Yeah.

525
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,200
I think they have zero reason to do so with the issue because it's probably a very profitable

526
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,200
enterprise.

527
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,200
Yeah, just as it is.

528
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,200
It will not affect their bottom line.

529
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
Let me ask this.

530
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,200
Do they have the sippy cup lids for cold drinks there yet?

531
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,200
Do you know what I mean?

532
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,200
No.

533
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Oh, well, Starbucks was...

534
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,200
I don't know if they...

535
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Sippy cup.

536
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Do you know about this?

537
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,200
Do you know about this?

538
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,200
They were saying they were going to get rid of straws and there was a different kind of

539
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,200
plastic that looks like a clear plastic lid, but it looks like the hot beverage lid.

540
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,200
I know what you're saying.

541
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
So it's kind of got that shape, but it's clear plastic.

542
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,200
And it looks like a sippy cup for a child.

543
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,200
Yeah.

544
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,200
It kind of looks like a sippy cup for a child.

545
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200
And they were like, aha, we've gotten rid of straws.

546
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:07,000
The only issue is that kind of lid uses more plastic than the lid with the straw.

547
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,040
There's all sorts of problems with the straw ban, as we know.

548
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,040
There's all sorts of like...

549
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
Well, it doesn't really make sense.

550
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,200
Still have the straws when I saw it.

551
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,200
Okay.

552
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,560
Are we pro paper straw or anti paper straw?

553
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,800
Paper straws I'm fine with.

554
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,180
Yeah, paper straws are better.

555
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,160
But I mean, like, for instance, like Disney, like there's so many countries, like they're

556
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,760
going to get rid of straws, but then those plastic bags are going to be handed out at

557
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,760
Splash Mountain.

558
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:34,760
So like there's just, there's other things too that would help more as far as plastic

559
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,760
consumption.

560
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,280
Well, at least they have cut back on the big thing that they used to do seemingly constantly

561
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,280
in the eighties.

562
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:47,360
And one of Doug Jones' fantastic mashup videos shines a light on this, that there were all

563
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,920
kinds of Disneyland events in the eighties where they do gigantic balloon releases.

564
00:41:51,920 --> 00:42:00,720
There's 500 and everybody proudly watches them go, fly away, fly away friends, brighten

565
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,400
the sky, brighten the throats of birds.

566
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,600
And the small propeller blades.

567
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,720
Brighten power lines by making them explode when you crash into them.

568
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,840
Those are the days.

569
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,840
Yeah.

570
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:23,440
I mean, Disney's made some progress, but when will Universal make progress and make this

571
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,880
Starbucks 2% more themed?

572
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,080
The answer is never.

573
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,080
Never.

574
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,280
But I think that, I think the Starbucks does have, unless it's on the other side, I'm not

575
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,280
totally sure.

576
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:40,800
Can you guys confirm somewhere around there, there's like a neon light that says Cruisin'

577
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:48,280
and then like kind of an angular guitar-ish car and a headlight.

578
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,600
Yeah I can picture that.

579
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,600
I can't picture where it is.

580
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,280
So that is theming I guess.

581
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,280
I love that.

582
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,280
Yeah, that's good.

583
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,280
Yeah.

584
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,560
That's probably City Walk 101, like first generation.

585
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,600
You think that's like a leftover basically?

586
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,600
Probably that makes sense.

587
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,600
I think that's probably been there.

588
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
Yeah.

589
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,000
I don't think since the beginning because this whole zone, don't forget, is post 2000

590
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
expansion.

591
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Oh, you're right.

592
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,520
I think that's Starbucks was there, though I could be wrong, I don't exactly know the

593
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,520
confines.

594
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,360
I don't think the Starbucks was there, but are you saying it was there whatever, is the

595
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,880
Starbucks a wholly new place?

596
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,360
Didn't it replace something?

597
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,360
Man, now we're looking like real rubes.

598
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,360
No.

599
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,360
Or has that been there the whole time?

600
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,360
I think the Starbucks has been there.

601
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,840
I don't, I wouldn't be so sure.

602
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,840
I don't know offhand.

603
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:33,160
I mean maybe not since 2000, for as long as I've been going there, I remember a Starbucks

604
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,160
presence.

605
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,160
I want to rock this up.

606
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,160
I can sense it.

607
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,160
I feel like you're going to have to do a lot of Googling here.

608
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,160
Yeah.

609
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,320
That's one thing we've really learned.

610
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,080
There's not a lot of CityWalk history.

611
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,080
There's not a lot of-

612
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:51,160
No one's keeping tabs on this except for someone in the Universal Enterprise, but as we said

613
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,120
before, they did not help us out.

614
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,680
We're not interested in that.

615
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,640
This will become the biggest record of that.

616
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,140
This is how people will tell their children, their children's children about the history

617
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,140
of CityWalk.

618
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,440
They're providing the ultimate history.

619
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,440
Is it spotty?

620
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,440
Yes.

621
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,440
But is that our fault?

622
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,440
No.

623
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,080
We could have been helped out by the actual people.

624
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:18,080
Because they didn't help us out, we are going to throw their parking garages under the fucking

625
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:23,800
bus in about five days or so.

626
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,200
That's not a big spoiler.

627
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,560
It's just, you know, that's what I was saying.

628
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,360
Perhaps the general attitude.

629
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,920
And hey, Universal clock's ticking.

630
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,240
You got five days.

631
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,680
If you don't want us to reveal everything we know about your parking garages.

632
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,720
Well, look, if you're saying that, I'll say this.

633
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:49,600
I searched for a term on Google today, trying to like reconfirm something from one of the

634
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,880
very early episodes in this series.

635
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,840
And one of the results on the first page was our show.

636
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,840
Whoa.

637
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,400
We're immediately to the top of Google with this?

638
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,520
We're a source.

639
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,520
Which thing?

640
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,520
The burger place?

641
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,520
KWGB?

642
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,240
World's greatest burger?

643
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,160
I searched CityWalk radio station restaurant and our show was on.

644
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,880
It was like six or seven.

645
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,040
But it was also the results before it were not what I was looking for.

646
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,400
It was mostly like Yelp stuff of like restaurant.

647
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,780
CityWalk.com.

648
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,780
That's cool.

649
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:30,120
And I don't mean to plow just past that because that's an immense achievement that we've all

650
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:35,200
pulled off, but I'm not going to be happy until when you go to Google and you type in

651
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,100
CityWalk, the auto fill in is not universal.

652
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,100
It's not Hollywood.

653
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,100
It's not Orlando.

654
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,680
The auto fill in is SectorKeeper.

655
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,960
I want this to be popular enough that that is what Google assumes that you want to learn

656
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,960
about.

657
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:57,360
So everyone out there with a blog, with MySpace pages and with the angel fires and GeoCities,

658
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,400
start talking about the SectorKeeper and help us build his legend.

659
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:06,800
And tell us in words or drawings what you think the SectorKeeper looks like.

660
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,520
Oh yeah, that's kind of in question.

661
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,160
We've, yeah, we've seen him.

662
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,160
Yeah, we've seen him.

663
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,160
It's a fun exercise is basically what it is.

664
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,160
It'd be cheating to tell you.

665
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,040
It'd be cheating to tell you and then sometimes I get the feeling that we're all seeing something

666
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,040
a little different.

667
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,960
Well, he is a Christ like figure and everybody has, you know, kind of their different views

668
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,840
of what God might look like.

669
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,760
Do you any specifics you guys want to say about how you see the SectorKeeper?

670
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,680
Oh, well, sure.

671
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,880
I see him.

672
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,720
He's, he's like a kind of a projection.

673
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,760
So he's like, he's big, you know, he's like, oh, you think he's big.

674
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,960
He's a Snoke.

675
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,480
He's kind of a Snoke, right?

676
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,680
Because like Snoke in Force Awakens is very big, but in reality, he's not.

677
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,680
He's just normal size.

678
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,600
He's like a hologram or something.

679
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,680
Yes, I see him sort of like a Force projection or a hologram, Star Wars, like hologram, whatever.

680
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,680
Either way.

681
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,480
I see him very small because as you know, I'm afraid of giant things in small rooms and

682
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,880
he would never want to, you know, alarm me.

683
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,520
He wants me to be comfortable with him.

684
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,360
So I see him small.

685
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:20,720
He tailors his appearance based on the soul of who he that to whom he speaks.

686
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,120
Oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense because like he's in mine.

687
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:30,120
He's wearing like a gold robe and he is horribly disfigured too.

688
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,640
So he is like just Snoke, which by the, I guess now they think about it.

689
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,720
Snoke is my favorite character from those new movies.

690
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,200
So I guess he sort of knows that.

691
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,320
So like he's making me feel good whenever I look at him, which honestly that's very

692
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,320
nice of him to do.

693
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,320
Wow.

694
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,320
I really appreciate that.

695
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,320
Huh?

696
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,560
He, mine has, I see him with pepperonis for eyes.

697
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,840
It's very similar to those that you ate at Wetzel's.

698
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,600
That's got to be adjacencies too though.

699
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,320
I well, yes.

700
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:02,800
I mean the, my Vivo meal was the, the redemption of pepperoni.

701
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,160
When you look at Scott and I, do you see humans or food?

702
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,440
Well, I haven't eaten a lot today.

703
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,720
So at the moment it's kind of right on the right on the line.

704
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,200
Do my arms just look like big pieces of pretzel dough to you?

705
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,200
What about me?

706
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,480
Do I stand, I'm a tall kind of slender guy.

707
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,480
Is it sort of a beef jerky kind of thing?

708
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,440
I don't think I've talked about this yet because the other sectors were so packed full of stuff,

709
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:34,620
but that Wetzel's pretzel sector fucked up my stomach for like three days.

710
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:40,880
Like I was just, I was just lying around the house the day after that experience.

711
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,000
You say this with some surprise in your voice.

712
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I was a little surprised cause like pretzel like that has never, I think it was the combination

713
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,200
of the pretzels and the sugary drink.

714
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,200
What food has made you guys feel the worst so far?

715
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,560
That's Jason's answer I would imagine.

716
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,560
Oh yeah.

717
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,200
Mike, I feel like you're steeled up enough to this bullshit that you don't, none of it

718
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,840
makes you feel bad, but I could be wrong.

719
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:07,560
Well, I'm trying to think what the worst one would be.

720
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,800
Mine was, Buka didn't sit great, but also.

721
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,160
Yeah, Buka wasn't great.

722
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,600
What's the, oh Ludo, you guys are crazy with Ludo Bird.

723
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:22,400
I felt like a million bucks after I ate at Ludo the other day.

724
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,240
I look, so I talked about the hot chicken craze has been sweeping for years now and

725
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,720
I can't, when I eat Ludo I go, this is fine.

726
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,120
I don't dislike it, but it's not nearly as good as something like that.

727
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,120
It's not in the ballpark.

728
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:39,080
The first meal, first worst meal that pops into my head is one I believe I ate with Jason,

729
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:42,440
but it was not during the research specifically for this.

730
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,680
It was a couple of years ago we were at Hard Rock.

731
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,920
Oh that fucked me up too.

732
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,800
Yeah, we both got sick from the.

733
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:54,640
So I guess this is a good transition and this was not planned, but it was like two or three

734
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:00,440
years ago and they had like some sort of special barbecue kind of thing, spicy sandwich thing

735
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,440
going.

736
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,280
Yeah, we got like, it was the pulled pork, which they've always had ribs and pulled pork.

737
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,880
That's what Nat and burgers have been since they opened.

738
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:13,440
The Hard Rock definition, which as I've said many times is very hard to pin down, but I

739
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:20,840
guess food wise, yeah, it's like just meat sandwiches and some barbecue sorta.

740
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,980
Their corporate history, I think it was the story was like the guys were living in London,

741
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:29,360
but they wanted a little more of like kind of American like bar and they also really

742
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,040
liked music and they kind of combined that all together.

743
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,800
And they liked making people sick.

744
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,800
Yeah.

745
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,800
And we like tearing apart stomach lining.

746
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,000
And we were at jalapenos on it like regular pulled pork.

747
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,880
I've eaten since I was a kid and it was always good.

748
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,280
It's always fine.

749
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,960
I didn't throw up, but I think it came out fast.

750
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,960
It was like dumb.

751
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,960
Yeah.

752
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,640
As soon as we got down the hill, I had to go to the bathroom cafe.

753
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,800
I didn't throw up, but I think it came out fast.

754
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,440
I suspicious that is the riffs from a Van Halen record.

755
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,560
The other thing that's made me ill is the adjacent Wetzel's pretzels.

756
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:10,080
But I eat at the Hard Rock Cafe in Atlantic City, which is very odd.

757
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,880
They just redid.

758
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:16,440
This is a whole thing, but the Hard Rock Cafe in Atlantic City is located in the new Hard

759
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:22,700
Rock Casino, which used to be the Trump Taj Mahal Taj Mahal themed Casino on the boardwalk

760
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,840
in Atlantic City run by a bad man.

761
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,320
And they full on.

762
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,880
So the Hard Rock used to be in one location.

763
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,440
Even when the Taj closed, the Hard Rock was able to stay open because they were like sort

764
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,120
of in the front of the building on the boardwalk.

765
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:42,780
When the Hard Rock took over the whole facility, they moved the Hard Rock to the other side

766
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,080
of the building.

767
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,720
And that original location became something else.

768
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,160
And my family and I were just like, this feels weird.

769
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,160
Right.

770
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,160
And it's like a very minimalist.

771
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,580
Like, yeah, why did they bother?

772
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:58,200
It was a very weird minimalist Hard Rock like the Johnny Rockets.

773
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,720
So, but I ate there felt fine.

774
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,360
But the Universal City Hard Rock.

775
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:08,480
Yeah, we we Mike and I both kind of got fucked up there a few years ago from food to not

776
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,480
from drinking.

777
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:15,640
Let me keep the excellent segues going by saying that I found some literature about

778
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:20,320
if you wanted to rent the Hard Rock up there for a party or something.

779
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:25,480
And they point out in the official literature that they consider that location to be a Taj

780
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,960
Mahal influenced building.

781
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,960
Really?

782
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,280
In did that occur?

783
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,520
That the city walk location they think is kind of like the Taj Mahal.

784
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:38,800
Did that occur to either of you and anyone listening that that is anything like the Taj

785
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,800
Mahal?

786
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,800
No, I know.

787
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,040
It's just a building with a dome that doesn't count as Taj Mahal.

788
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,120
That it was painted white.

789
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:50,500
But I always associate it that they kind of like expanded or were roughly inspired by

790
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,400
the mission style architect like the missions of California.

791
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,760
It's much closer to a mission than the Taj Mahal.

792
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,760
Yeah.

793
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,760
OK.

794
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,760
So that that's what I associate.

795
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,480
It's kind of more of a teardrop shape.

796
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,480
Right.

797
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,480
This thing does not have to say that.

798
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,080
That's a bunch of bullshit.

799
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,520
There's other bullshit in this description.

800
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:14,820
It's 1996 Hard Rock Cafe Hollywood since 1996 Hard Rock Cafe continues to rock Universal

801
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,820
City Walk.

802
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,820
That's not correct.

803
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,720
And is it since a date?

804
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,080
It continues.

805
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,080
Not right.

806
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,320
Since blank blank has been rocking.

807
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,320
Yeah.

808
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,320
I think.

809
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,320
Right.

810
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,320
Yes.

811
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,000
It has been copious rocking.

812
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Yeah.

813
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Right.

814
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
The denizens of City Walk Hollywood.

815
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,720
Giant Fender guitar fountain.

816
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,080
I can't argue with that one.

817
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,720
You know, that's the interior.

818
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,600
That's a Van Halen guitar we've talked about.

819
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,600
Oh, yeah.

820
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,600
OK.

821
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,600
Specifically a recreation.

822
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,200
I mean, I don't know if it's supposed to be looking like it at Lyft.

823
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,600
Maybe it's copyrighted and it's supposed to be a knockoff, but it is.

824
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,480
That's what it's for sure inspired by.

825
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,480
All right.

826
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:58,960
As you enter past a Stone Temple Pilots guitar or clothes worn by Velvet Revolver in their

827
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,960
first video.

828
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,960
Uh huh.

829
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,960
Oh, boy.

830
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,960
They are speaking my musical language.

831
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,600
And then you enter past like obviously you stop and you look at the Velvet Revolver clothes

832
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,960
for 25 minutes minimum.

833
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,220
But if you can pull yourself away, then you keep going into the restaurant and you see

834
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:19,040
a big revolving Cadillac.

835
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:26,920
There's a big pink Cadillac, which makes this the second unorthodox elevated pink Cadillac

836
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,500
at CityWalk.

837
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,240
There are two and I'm not sure if it's still pink.

838
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,600
I couldn't tell you exactly.

839
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,600
Yeah.

840
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:40,200
Either way, this adds to the seemingly endless array of unusual vehicles that are lifted

841
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,960
high above where vehicles usually are.

842
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,680
Seems a little redundant, but I guess it's a cool centerpiece.

843
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:52,320
Then you see one of my odd things with the Hard Rock Cafe is what's up with like rock

844
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,320
the planet?

845
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:57,560
There's all this weird environmentalism that's not committed to and what does it mean and

846
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,880
how do they actually help?

847
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,840
Was or is one of their charitable causes.

848
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,840
But they're mysterious.

849
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,200
Like, yeah, what is corporate?

850
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,840
It doesn't exist outside.

851
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:11,840
They do the very specific political action of rocking the rainforest.

852
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,840
Yeah.

853
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
That's, it's easy to chart.

854
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,400
Funny because there's a lot of wood.

855
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,120
This is one of the Hard Rocks covered like there's a lot of old or a lot of dark wood

856
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,120
fixtures.

857
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:29,160
And they said they switched to wood straws when everybody else was switching for plastic.

858
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:33,360
Yes, you reuse those and they made and there's a little note on it that says entire tree

859
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,560
killed for this single straw.

860
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,720
Rest of wood thrown out.

861
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,120
But that is the thing I like about.

862
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,360
I like the wood.

863
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,720
I like how just a sheer assault of music memorabilia.

864
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,320
This in the Orlando ones are what I think of when I think Hard Rock Cafe.

865
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:54,720
Not like pure white cocaine-y whatever Atlantic City is going for.

866
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,000
Yeah, I've seen I'm looking at the pictures of them.

867
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,520
The one in Orlando is like the ruins in Greece.

868
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,040
They're like the exterior.

869
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,040
I love that.

870
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,040
Yeah, that's pretty silly.

871
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,040
I like that.

872
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,640
Yeah, that's even though I'm not sure what that has to do with rock and roll.

873
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,640
Yeah.

874
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:18,840
I will not argue in the same way that's Devin Susser just said about how do you argue with

875
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,440
the giant King Kong?

876
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,360
A big guitar is a lot of fun.

877
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:30,120
It adds to the skyline of some of the bizarre touristy places that Hard Rock is in, which

878
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:35,400
if you look at the entire list, it's like 750 locations.

879
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,880
It's in every major city across the globe.

880
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,880
But why?

881
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,120
Why are people demanding this specific restaurant?

882
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,840
I don't understand the hunger for it.

883
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:49,960
And how could they possibly have enough guitars and picks and velvet revolver shirts to populate

884
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,960
all of them?

885
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,720
I think some of those are lies is what I think.

886
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,960
I think we talked about that.

887
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:54,960
I just have a lie.

888
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,360
I just don't trust this brand.

889
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:02,480
Would the CityWalk health inspector be able to also identify a counterfeit velvet revolver

890
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,480
outfit?

891
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,480
Maybe?

892
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,600
Is that a different part of the government that has to be checking into stuff like that?

893
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:15,880
If it maybe he tests it for like fluids or like, yeah, was is there like sweat for who's

894
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,640
the which one's velvet revolver?

895
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,640
Was that Scott Weiland as well?

896
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,520
No, this had two Scott Weiland bands.

897
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,520
Yeah, I think that right.

898
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,760
Isn't velvet revolver Scott Weiland?

899
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,760
That's really weird.

900
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,880
Well, because it was slash for sure.

901
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:32,720
It was part of Guns N' Roses with velvet revolver because at the same time, it's also confusing

902
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,440
as audio slave was happening, which Chris Cornell, which two of both of these singers

903
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,960
have passed away.

904
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:45,440
So it was Chris Cornell and Rage Against Machine was audio slave and then velvet revolver was

905
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,920
Scott Weiland and Guns N' Roses.

906
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,080
This is I'm so confused.

907
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,720
They were in the Scott Weiland game, I guess.

908
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,720
Maybe.

909
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,720
I don't know.

910
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,280
It is interesting, though, that they point out those two bands.

911
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,280
Yeah.

912
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:04,400
If you really ran the numbers, it is quietly 85 percent of the merch at all 750 locations,

913
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,880
all Scott Weiland stuff.

914
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:12,320
They just have every item of clothing he ever wore, every all the boxer shorts, every sock.

915
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,000
Is that Harper Ray's boyfriend?

916
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,480
Scott Weiland?

917
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,040
Oh, Harper.

918
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,080
Well, then Harper's had a rough.

919
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,080
Poor Harper.

920
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,080
Gee whiz.

921
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:27,480
No, Harper is dating Duff McKagan, I think, from Guns N' Roses.

922
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,480
He's much more stable.

923
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,480
Much more stable.

924
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,480
Very talented.

925
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:39,400
So a couple other things to say about this specific location, it is perhaps part of why

926
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:46,920
you think of this location when you think about the brand is that don't forget this

927
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:52,720
specific Hard Rock F.A. used very prominently in the opening sequence of Keenan and Kel.

928
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,320
Oh, sure.

929
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,320
To the opening.

930
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,320
Yeah.

931
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:01,880
In which you're warned to watch out for Keenan because Keenan be scheming.

932
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,000
That is all under the backdrop of the Hard Rock Cafe.

933
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Also a little cameo from our old pal, the giant King Kong.

934
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,420
He factors in there.

935
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:18,640
So outside of Honey, I Blew Up the Kid, one of the most prominent film uses of a Hard

936
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,900
Rock Cafe.

937
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,720
So good on you.

938
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,720
That's good.

939
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,720
This location.

940
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,760
And also Jersey Girl.

941
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,680
That's where they have the record release party that Ben Affleck has put together.

942
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,680
Is that right?

943
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,680
Really?

944
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,680
No, no.

945
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,680
Just a Hard Rock Cafe.

946
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:33,680
I don't think it's this one.

947
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,680
I think it's a Tines Square one.

948
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,680
Sorry, sorry to get your hopes up.

949
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,680
Because then Jersey Girl takes place in Jersey.

950
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,680
Takes place in fucking Jersey.

951
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,680
A fucking city walk.

952
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,280
Is it the Atlantic City location?

953
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,760
No, I don't think it is.

954
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:47,640
I think it's in New York because that's before he's got to give up his big career.

955
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:54,000
Yeah, that's before he learns that he has to go back to the suburbs or whatever.

956
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I think so.

957
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,880
It's getting silenced for me on the Jersey Girl.

958
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,200
I saw it in the theater.

959
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,200
Yeah, I did too.

960
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,200
Wow.

961
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,200
Yeah.

962
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,840
Did it invalidate the rest of the View-esque universe?

963
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:07,840
It's not part of the View-esque universe.

964
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:08,840
It's not part of the View-esque universe.

965
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:13,200
But did it make you not enjoy the previous films, as Mudd did admit?

966
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,200
No, time did that.

967
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,200
No, no.

968
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,520
Clerks 2, much more damage.

969
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,640
I thought Jersey Girl was fine, honestly.

970
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:23,760
I thought that was a pleasant little movie.

971
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,720
Oh, okay, he's trying a different thing.

972
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,440
Jordan Harlan's nice in that.

973
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,440
He's nice.

974
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,440
He's very nice.

975
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,440
He's very nice.

976
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,440
He plays Ben Affleck's nice dad.

977
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,840
It was good to see George Collin be nice.

978
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,840
It was.

979
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,840
It was.

980
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,560
He usually says a lot of very offensive words.

981
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,640
It stings the ears of us, the good boys.

982
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,280
That's right, but it was very good.

983
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,920
He kept it in his pants in this film.

984
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:51,800
But there's one bit of history, which I think I've alluded to in prior episodes, but this

985
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:58,680
Hard Rock Cafe, very important to me because it was the location of my very first date

986
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:02,120
in my whole life.

987
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,280
Wow.

988
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:08,920
Just as I revealed, City Walk factored heavily into my eventual marriage.

989
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:16,440
This also the very beginning bookend of my romantic career, so I'm very fond of it.

990
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:21,360
I talked about this a little bit on my Dough Boys episode about the Hard Rock Cafe.

991
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:29,000
I was doing the math also and realizing that the Dough Boys episode about Hard Rock Cafe,

992
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,680
two episodes about the Hard Rock Park, we talked about the retail store two days ago,

993
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,680
then there's this episode.

994
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:40,040
And when Wallinor was back here, Hard Rock Park came up again.

995
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:45,640
So this is the sixth podcast on which I've discussed the great brand Hard Rock.

996
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:50,400
We will do another two episode arc with Hard Rock Park, I assume.

997
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,800
Oh no, I don't think we covered it all.

998
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,800
Yeah, there's too much.

999
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,600
We haven't even barely touched on freestyle music park.

1000
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,600
I know.

1001
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:02,280
So we'll get, so this is, we're still early in the amount of eventually.

1002
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:08,160
I hope by the end of my podcasting career, there will be minimum 55 podcast episodes

1003
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:16,280
where, but my first date on which I was very nervous about it and my dad coached me about

1004
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:21,840
how to, I'd never just paid for someone at a restaurant, so my dad talked me through

1005
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:25,240
it and he said, well, just the bill will come and you give them a card, it's very easy.

1006
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,920
And then you have to put down the tip.

1007
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,920
And I said, oh, how does that work?

1008
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,600
And he said, oh, you know, you just, you know, you just give them, you know, like, like 10%

1009
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:36,920
of what my dad's date advice was shitty tipping.

1010
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:37,920
Oh yeah.

1011
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,760
He continues to be a shitty tip.

1012
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,760
Wow, really?

1013
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,760
Yeah.

1014
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,200
What is the, Jason said, what would you, do you say yes, affirmative to the 10%?

1015
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:52,360
Was that a yes of, oh no, that was yes, that's good for my snow, especially California.

1016
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,480
You give at least 11 or 12%.

1017
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,000
Oh stop it.

1018
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,800
I tip appropriately.

1019
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,680
I was going to say California, it's a little easier because in a lot of places it's practically

1020
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,680
10%.

1021
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,040
So you just sort of like double the tax and round up.

1022
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,160
You end up to about 20%.

1023
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:10,680
It saves you some mental anguish to just go to 20.

1024
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,040
But anyway, my dad gave me that advice.

1025
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:18,600
I was very nervous about the whole endeavor and in fact, I did not tell this girl that

1026
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,320
it was a date until we were dropped off.

1027
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:26,680
Oh, she was visiting for the summer and I had arranged this whole scheme and we had

1028
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,920
done a lot of touristy stuff already.

1029
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:33,000
So my mom took us and she assumed the whole time that we were going to be walking around

1030
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,920
with my mom until the door opened and all right, have fun guys.

1031
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,960
So this is misleading.

1032
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:46,560
Yeah, what a great move off the bat to bum rush the person with that date.

1033
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,560
Important to note, I was 15 years old.

1034
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,600
She was 13 years old.

1035
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,600
Oh my gosh.

1036
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,800
The most romantic ages that exist.

1037
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:59,880
Jason looks a little stressed out about this.

1038
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:05,600
Although the meeting, the getting to the location and trying to figure out it was a date, sometimes

1039
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,600
that doesn't go away.

1040
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:11,200
You don't have to worry about that anymore.

1041
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,200
But yeah.

1042
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,200
Thank you.

1043
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,880
I became such an expert dater thanks to all of these great city walking counters.

1044
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:21,480
I got to just blast through it, got to marriage as quick as I could.

1045
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:27,280
But thanks to dates like this hard rock date going so perfectly because spoiler alert,

1046
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:32,000
after all was said and done, we went back to my parents' house in Woodland Hills and

1047
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,200
the sequence of events of that evening led to my first kiss my whole life.

1048
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,200
So city walk.

1049
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,200
Wow.

1050
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:45,640
Sitting walk in your belly is a VHS copy of the Winslow boy playing on TV.

1051
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,200
I was just trying to estimate about what would have been out that time.

1052
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,200
I don't know.

1053
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,200
You can suck it in.

1054
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,200
I'm not sure.

1055
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,320
This is the year 2000.

1056
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:58,440
I think I might have gone on a date to see AI with her around that time as well.

1057
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,240
Well yeah, what a great, what a great day.

1058
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:04,520
But then you got out of the car and it was apparent your mother wasn't going with you

1059
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,700
guys.

1060
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:09,960
Did you announce it's a date or was it just sort of assumed and you didn't speak about

1061
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:10,960
it?

1062
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:11,960
No, it did not come up.

1063
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:12,960
Right.

1064
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,520
After the fact, we talked on the phone about it and like, yeah, that was, I don't know,

1065
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,640
that was like my little plan or whatever.

1066
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,080
Well, you got me.

1067
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:26,960
Another moment of this date that I don't think I talked about when we talked about Hot Topic

1068
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:32,360
was that we passed by the Hot Topic on the way to the Hard Rock Cafe and she said, oh,

1069
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:37,440
they have these back in my hometown of Houston.

1070
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,480
This store is pretty weird, like you.

1071
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,240
And I was like, eh, yeah.

1072
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,240
And you took it as a good thing.

1073
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,640
Oh yeah, no, no, no.

1074
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,680
That meant like, I was like, you know, I was adventurous.

1075
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,680
You were as cool as Hot Topic was.

1076
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1077
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,880
An old Hot Topic that was more focused on anthrax shirts.

1078
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:54,880
Yes.

1079
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,280
And I was like, oh, I'm as cool as that.

1080
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,280
And I took her in there and I said, oh yeah, I don't know.

1081
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,280
Maybe I'll try to find something.

1082
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,280
And I found a shirt.

1083
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:06,680
I found a spinal tap shirt that had it was a good shirt because it had all the tour dates

1084
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:11,000
on the back of the film and they all get canceled as it goes.

1085
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And I'm super playing up, you know.

1086
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Yeah, it's this little movie.

1087
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Like, have you heard of it?

1088
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Maybe you haven't heard of it.

1089
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Yes.

1090
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I'm going to do like waiting for golf.

1091
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
It's like, yeah, totally cool.

1092
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Like, yeah, like not everybody knows about it.

1093
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I know about it.

1094
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,800
I saw that movie five years ago for the first time.

1095
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,800
I'm not kidding.

1096
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,920
How was it to not grow up with it?

1097
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:28,920
It was good.

1098
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:33,440
I think it's the last Guffman movie or the last guest movie.

1099
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:38,160
Or no, I never saw the movie studio one, whatever that was called.

1100
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,160
That's fine.

1101
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,160
That one's fine.

1102
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,120
And I can't think of the name of it.

1103
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,120
Yeah.

1104
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,480
But yes, that's great.

1105
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:53,200
I really got to show off my very deep cult film, the mental archives.

1106
01:06:53,200 --> 01:07:00,640
But yeah, so super nervous the whole time, but felt pretty good about it.

1107
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:04,600
Didn't throw her with this whole first date switcheroo.

1108
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:11,440
We got back home and the sequence of events that led to the first kiss was that I was

1109
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,380
like playing her CDs and whatever.

1110
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:18,800
And I put on like a slower song and then we started dancing.

1111
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,800
We started slow dancing.

1112
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,800
That's like a fucking movie.

1113
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,880
Yeah, well, that's because that's all I knew.

1114
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,400
I was like creating really contrived like movie moments.

1115
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:32,040
Yeah, it doesn't go away if you when you're 32.

1116
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,720
Your dates are like my dates at 15.

1117
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,720
That's delightful.

1118
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,720
Except you don't have braces.

1119
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,640
No, just fucked up teeth.

1120
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,920
You just let them grow out.

1121
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:44,920
And you drive.

1122
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:45,920
Character actor teeth.

1123
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:50,040
You drive with a girl to a place with another person and then you make the other person

1124
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,840
go away and go, hey, it's a date.

1125
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,840
Just kidding.

1126
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:56,840
I find it comforting to know that there's a chaperone at least a chaperone.

1127
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,840
What do you say?

1128
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:00,840
Chaperone.

1129
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:01,840
Chaperone.

1130
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,840
That's what all people say.

1131
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,460
Yeah, that's how you pronounce it.

1132
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:06,120
Because there's no other.

1133
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,120
It's not a macaroon.

1134
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,200
Are you thinking of macaroons?

1135
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,080
I mean, always.

1136
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:14,160
We're playing this old chestnut, huh?

1137
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,160
This old flute.

1138
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:19,160
It's one of the best songs we know.

1139
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:23,360
Why don't you give a shout out to the listener who sent us a picture of the original Hot

1140
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,360
Topic facade?

1141
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,360
Oh, that's right.

1142
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,360
While we're talking about it.

1143
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,160
Oh, it was so weird back then.

1144
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,160
There were gargoyles and flames.

1145
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,160
Gargoyles and ghoulies and flames.

1146
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,160
Oh my gosh.

1147
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,160
It really is a darker.

1148
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:35,360
That's like all the angst I had inside me at 15.

1149
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,760
It's as weird as you were.

1150
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:37,760
Yeah.

1151
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,760
Yeah.

1152
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:39,760
I kept it pretty weird.

1153
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:40,760
Pretty weird.

1154
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,600
I also had hair twice as long as I currently have and braces.

1155
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,360
So picture all that.

1156
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:52,280
So we get into this slow dance situation, but the slow dance is in my sister's bedroom

1157
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,360
as is my sister.

1158
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:59,120
And the entire point, so this was a childhood friend who came out and was being set up to

1159
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,680
be a friend of my little sister.

1160
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:05,800
And instead she got lured in by the charms of her older brother.

1161
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,080
This is hard.

1162
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,520
It was a rough week.

1163
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,700
My sister was jealous and mad about the whole thing.

1164
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:17,420
And then we started slow dancing and my sister's reaction was to yell, oh gross.

1165
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:24,040
And then she left the room, slammed the door, opened the door again, slammed it again, opened

1166
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:25,760
the door again, slammed it again.

1167
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,760
Rule of three is very funny.

1168
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:28,760
Incredible.

1169
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,640
There is a Kramer exit.

1170
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:36,720
You've done this genre before, but this is like an imagine the Wes Anderson version of

1171
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,720
this whole date.

1172
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,720
Yeah.

1173
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:42,480
So you've got like you're straightening a bow tie in the mirror and then you've kind

1174
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,800
of like planned the record and you put the record down.

1175
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:48,160
It's an overhead shot of the record for the slow dance.

1176
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,680
But except it's a CD, it's a fetishy shot.

1177
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:56,120
It's a Wes Anderson style shot of a CD being put down, the lid being closed, me putting

1178
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,360
it on random mode.

1179
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,360
Right.

1180
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,360
And it's like you into the mirror.

1181
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,160
I have a crush on a girl.

1182
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:04,720
Like, it's perfectly, I can imagine this.

1183
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,960
Declaring how weird I am the entire time.

1184
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,960
I'm pretty weird.

1185
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:11,600
I'm a, but everyone's very emotional in the background.

1186
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,600
Sure.

1187
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:13,600
Yeah.

1188
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,320
And I was wearing the braces as an affect.

1189
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,320
It was a joy.

1190
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:21,160
It was like a little, it was an endearing little touch of flair.

1191
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:25,240
So anyways, these are just, these are all the events surrounding my first date.

1192
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,240
You are madness.

1193
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,240
Wow.

1194
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,240
Yeah.

1195
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,240
That's something.

1196
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:34,440
Shout out to at SC Jacka, who sent us that picture of the original hot topic.

1197
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,120
I'm glad we got to mention it.

1198
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,120
Absolutely.

1199
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,120
Thank you.

1200
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:43,840
Where we, we just see, you know, the show was just slowly painting pictures for people

1201
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,560
of like, oh, here's why these men are like this.

1202
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,560
Yeah.

1203
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,040
Well that's, I thought that's all important context.

1204
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,120
Spinal tab shirt braces.

1205
01:10:52,120 --> 01:11:00,040
This is, you know, now, now you know this about me and the, I think, I think what's

1206
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:05,240
really going to make the city walk saga persist in people's minds is how much we opened up

1207
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,480
and revealed our truth.

1208
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:08,480
Yeah, sure.

1209
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,680
And, and it's easiest for you of course, because this is, you lived your whole life at city

1210
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:12,680
walk.

1211
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:13,680
I really have.

1212
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:17,880
When you think about it, thinking about how I saw a mission impossible two and then many

1213
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,440
years later, six, right on the same location.

1214
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,440
That is crazy.

1215
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,440
It's like my whole life.

1216
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:28,200
I've been standing still and city walk has been changing in fast motion all around me.

1217
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:32,560
It's a garden state style, fast motion shot.

1218
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,480
The world just keeps spinning.

1219
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,480
It's kind of beautiful.

1220
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:43,760
That one rock named Ethan hunt has been the only there for our sins.

1221
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,760
He's changed.

1222
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,400
He's got lots of different haircuts.

1223
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,480
So is city walk, Ethan hunt and city walk.

1224
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:53,120
They've always been there and they always will be there, but they go through changes

1225
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,800
like everything does.

1226
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:59,000
So those are really the only two constants I can think of in life in the world, in the

1227
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
world anywhere.

1228
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Yeah.

1229
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,880
It's off the top of my head.

1230
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:09,600
City walk has stood strong in its political tumult.

1231
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:16,720
Presidential term after presidential term, it just keeps on rocking and that velvet revolver

1232
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:20,840
shirt just keeps on glimmering in the window.

1233
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:27,060
And waitresses at the Hard Rock Cafe keep bitterly looking at 15 year olds checks where

1234
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:30,160
they got stiffed on the tip and throwing them down in anger.

1235
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,560
You did tip 10%.

1236
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,160
I think I may have on my dad's command.

1237
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,540
I didn't know any better.

1238
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:39,640
When did you learn that that was a little bit underwhelming for it?

1239
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:45,080
With much later girlfriends who were like mad when they found out.

1240
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:51,140
I think, yeah, I think I very late in life left like a dollar on something that should

1241
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:52,140
have been much more.

1242
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:55,000
My girlfriend's like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

1243
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Wait a minute.

1244
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,440
What card were you putting down?

1245
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,280
I must have borrowed one from my dad.

1246
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,000
Unless I paid cash.

1247
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Not sure.

1248
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Yeah.

1249
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,880
Because I didn't have any money at the time, you know?

1250
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:11,240
I didn't have a job yet, but I still want to, I still want to take a girl out for just

1251
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,920
a good honest Hard Rock Cafe lunch.

1252
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,400
And the Wes Anderson version, of course, like you put the piggy bank down and it's an overhead

1253
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,520
shot of the piggy bank and then you smash it with a hammer and then you collect the

1254
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,520
money.

1255
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:26,800
Perfect little tink and then they're all, they're all old Spanish coins, which for some

1256
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,320
reason the Hard Rock Cafe.

1257
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,320
They take that.

1258
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:36,480
It's, um, well, uh, oh, also there's a, like a stage where there's concerts and shit.

1259
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,800
I, I put it in this sector, but who cares?

1260
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,680
I have nothing to say about the five towers.

1261
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:45,040
You'll see like a little dance recital going on.

1262
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:49,640
You'll see, you know, like it seems like schools get to like put things up there.

1263
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:50,640
Well, I'll tell you this.

1264
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,560
I thought this was very smart.

1265
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,640
In the summer they were playing World Cup games on the big screen above the stage.

1266
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:02,380
drew a crowd like people that was very a very smart move on their soccer very

1267
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:06,220
popular oh maybe the screen is more the thing to talk the stage I don't know if

1268
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:09,420
you guys ever sat and watched anything at the stage no I mean you walk by and

1269
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:12,580
you go it's like a bunch of 12 year olds doing like a cheerleading routine or

1270
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:17,620
something and I okay and I walk away I annex this but can wanted to talk about

1271
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:20,700
it because I assumed if I googled there would be interesting concerts and stuff

1272
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:26,540
that had happened there but like one of the only ones I found was the Hollywood's

1273
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:32,360
most noted gossip columnist Perez Hilton will introduce octone recording artist

1274
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:39,780
Kat Graham to perform her hit single put your graffiti on me so that's the best

1275
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:44,300
thing that ever happened on the stage they don't do concerts it seems like it

1276
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:48,380
would be perfect for some big splashy event sure when Jimmy Buffett was playing

1277
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:52,140
the opening of margaritaville I go for sure he's gonna play the outdoor stage

1278
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:58,500
yeah no no he played the tiny stage inside margaritaville for like you know

1279
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:02,580
a hundred people so I don't they don't they just don't do that I guess I don't

1280
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:08,620
know why and now here's another thing after all this is said and done how how

1281
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:14,260
great would it be if we could do a live podcast the ride from the five towers

1282
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:18,580
stage I think we should do it I think we should and now we can officially

1283
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:23,580
announce the final episode episode 19 will be live from the five towers stage

1284
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:32,860
and you know that's not cool they would never do that how amazing would that be

1285
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:38,300
if we could end it there are days of our lives at the five tower stage which is

1286
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:41,900
pretty cool it's so clogged with soap opera stars how are they gonna fit us

1287
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:46,860
email I will email tomorrow we could you do this last one there really I mean we

1288
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:51,700
should it really be a problem is the problem is the problem is Jason first of

1289
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:55,460
all doesn't like fun and that's the problem but not but hang on that was a

1290
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:59,580
big leap what do you mean I mean Jason doesn't like this for like 10 Jason

1291
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:03,340
doesn't like like if you're like hey let's do something like spur the moment

1292
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:06,660
quick or something this is like a sprung on him and he's like no there's no way

1293
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:11,620
they'll ever let us do something like that you mean if we were to record an

1294
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:15,780
episode of the city walk saga live at city walk like Jason would object to

1295
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:19,140
that I think that if you're referring to a real specific incident when Scott's

1296
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:22,300
suggested we sneak a microphone in the city walking this recording episode

1297
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:26,460
there and Jason flipped out then yes Jason was so upset if that was a

1298
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:30,260
specific situation yeah he would not like that and you also be sent

1299
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:37,060
hypothetically was making a literal big frowny face right now you're making

1300
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:41,540
false promises even I'm gonna email I'm gonna email nothing's gonna come to

1301
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:45,220
that did what did I say these people false hope I'm not it's not when you

1302
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:49,900
say false promises I didn't say you can bet your life that will do it I said hey

1303
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:52,780
you know what I'll email we should do that I'm the one who started announcing

1304
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:59,140
it was a straight lie halfway through the lie I should email and ask now I'm

1305
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:04,940
thinking of course the last episode is this is the parking garage and we're

1306
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:10,840
given given these secrets away people at this point are so fatigued by this whole

1307
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:14,740
thing and they're like what are they gonna do like oh I was a wonder it was

1308
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:19,660
the secret is out I was thinking that we're gonna do you know the garbage cans

1309
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:24,620
in the parking lot for the last episode the sheriff's station yeah like so so

1310
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:32,420
it's not like it's crazy but do we do an unofficial bum rush flash mob episode

1311
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:39,660
from the top of we pull our car up to the top of the Jurassic parking lot and

1312
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:44,860
just start doing it and a crowd shows up it's like it's like a Fast and Furious

1313
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:49,380
Street Race we just start doing it and if the cops show up everybody everybody

1314
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:53,340
skedaddles we get out of there but you know that's how we do it we're running

1315
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:59,260
gun and should do it like what's the is it from Dukes of Hazzard the big car

1316
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:03,860
with a big bullhorn on the top and just broadcast the show like like that yeah

1317
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:06,940
you know what I'm talking about why not well somewhere on that universal

1318
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:11,620
property is that Blues Brothers car oh that has the big with a megaphone on top

1319
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:19,980
so in Blues Brothers an archic spirit we sneak on a lot steal the car hook up our

1320
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:25,460
microphones to it which I assume that it is a functioning audio mechanism it has

1321
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:30,620
to be yeah we hijack that baby using my knowledge of the universal roads from

1322
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:34,980
being a tour guide we find a stealthy path up to the top of the parking

1323
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:38,980
garage and that's episode 19 and I'll tell the listeners right now I promise

1326
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:53,340
