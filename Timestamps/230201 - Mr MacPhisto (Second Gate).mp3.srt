1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,560
Greetings and welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,560
My name is Michael Carlson, also known as Mr. Mike Fisto.

4
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,760
Joining me as always, the little wooden mirror ball boy,

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,880
Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,720
Hello.

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,760
And of course, the man just known as The Hog, Scott Gardner.

8
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,600
Hey, what's going on?

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,480
All right, so what's this then?

10
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,320
I'm going to be in character the whole show,

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,520
all 90 plus minutes.

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,200
Is he sort of an aging podcaster?

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,360
That's one of my personas.

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,240
This is one of my podcast personas, Mr. Mike Fisto.

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,240
We established this, what, years ago?

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,880
Pre-pandemic, is that where the character's from?

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,080
Well, that's a question because I, like,

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,000
at some point you have referenced

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,160
wanting to be Mr. Mike Fisto.

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,720
And then there was a moment where you requested

21
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,560
that you be called that in our New York live show,

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,360
or that you suggested that that could be said.

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,200
Oh, right, yes.

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,680
And I felt like I reigned on your parade by saying,

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,440
I don't think anyone will know what that is.

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,440
There's these things that keep happening

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,840
that I keep doing that I feel like they fall

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,560
in the category of, like, me telling a kid

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,840
that Santa's not real.

30
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,560
That's how I felt when I said Prince wasn't gonna come

31
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,080
to your birthday party.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,280
And I think that's another one that I'm sorry to say

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,840
that I don't think Mr. Mike Fisto landed

34
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,440
like a lightning bolt in the podcast.

35
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,280
You don't think it's catching on?

36
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,120
I think it's catching on more than what we do.

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,640
Well, this is gonna help, this will help.

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,560
And that we're doing an episode all about Mr. Mike Fisto

39
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,520
I think will help kind of underline it

40
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,080
and put it in podcast lore.

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,200
Okay, good, because you'll make,

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,840
this will make my dreams a reality, is really what it will.

43
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,120
Okay, okay, okay.

44
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,320
So from now on, if you're hearing about Mr. Mike Fisto

45
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,720
and you say something like, is that even a thing?

46
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,160
It is a thing after today's episode.

47
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,560
After today's episode, which was a group effort

48
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,200
because as I look back on our group texts,

49
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,200
text from Scout Gander, let's do Mac Fisto exclamation point.

50
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,760
I was, yes, that was me a couple weeks ago.

51
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,160
It has been looming out there.

52
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,880
It seemed like a silly odd tangents to do,

53
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,640
a rabbit hole to go down.

54
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,320
And then the regret that I had

55
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,280
as soon as I walked into the garage

56
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,440
and elevation was blasting on Mike's speaker,

57
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,480
it's shivers of regret that went through my whole body.

58
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,520
I wish I could be that guy back in the text message.

59
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,400
I'll try to be, again, in trying to not say

60
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,960
that Santa's not real.

61
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,120
I'm gonna make some effort here.

62
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,000
We need to get you elevated to a place

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,760
where you're going, woo, woo.

64
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,240
The goal is elevation.

65
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,520
Okay, I see.

66
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,480
Yeah, you're like a mole digging in a hole.

67
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,440
Digging up his soul now, ready?

68
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,280
Okay, before we need to-

69
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,560
Explain what we're talking about?

70
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,800
Yes, we can go no further because I do think

71
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,200
that a lot of people don't know what this is

72
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,320
before we've even gotten into Mr. Mike Fisto,

73
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,280
before we said Mr. Mac Fisto.

74
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,120
So yes.

75
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,940
Cliff Notes.

76
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,880
The Cliff Notes version of this is

77
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,040
Bono is the lead singer of U2,

78
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,680
which is a band that's been around for what?

79
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,120
40 plus years at this point.

80
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,720
That's the thing, the important thing to know

81
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,920
is the longevity, not any other, not the popularity.

82
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,760
They're very-

83
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,000
It's coming up on 42, I believe.

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,840
They're very-

85
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,680
So now you know that.

86
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,840
They're a very popular band.

87
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,360
They, of course, compose the music for Spider-Man,

88
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,440
Turn Off the Dark, which is something we've talked about

89
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,280
on this show many times.

90
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,000
It's the only thing that has made them relevant

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,080
in this Theme Park podcast thus far.

92
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,920
Thus far.

93
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,880
They also did the song Hold Me, Thrill Me,

94
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,320
Kiss Me, Kill Me.

95
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,120
Well, yes, of course, for Batman Forever.

96
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,920
Right, and we'll get there.

97
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah.

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,280
So, yeah, so on the Zootv Tour,

99
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,720
which was a tour in support of Octon Baby and Zuroppa

100
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,440
in the early 90s, Bono invented a few characters

101
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,240
to play on stage.

102
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,760
And these characters included the Fly,

103
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,840
which is basically just Bono with bigger glasses.

104
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,000
So when he has those big, I didn't know that till today,

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,040
if he's wearing those big glasses,

106
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,800
which I associate with being the Bono glasses,

107
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,380
that's actually a character.

108
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,980
He does wear glasses, regardless,

109
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,340
but I think they're pretty iconic, the big glasses.

110
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,180
Yeah.

111
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,020
I'm with Scott here.

112
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,020
I did not know that until today, that that came.

113
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,500
I don't know, because he wore the big glasses later

114
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,620
in the 2000s, but I don't know if he thought of himself

115
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,580
as the Fly then.

116
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,900
I feel like the Fly, as Bono just turned up a little bit,

117
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,620
it's a little more, it's not a crazy departure for him.

118
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,540
So I think I will agree that he's the Fly

119
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,100
when he's wearing the glasses.

120
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,540
I will agree with that,

121
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,340
but I don't know what he would say necessarily.

122
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,900
Yeah, well, he originally talked about,

123
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,700
like, oh, the Fly is like a cliche rock star,

124
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,220
big sunglasses, leather pants.

125
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,620
And then at the age, he just kind of became the Fly.

126
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,820
Yeah, so you two started out, I would say,

127
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,580
like a band, like a post-punk band, I guess you'd call it,

128
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,460
pretty, I don't know, urgent, not punk rock,

129
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,420
but like seemingly falling in the same category

130
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,740
as like a more self-serious Elvis Costello

131
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,980
or something like that.

132
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,140
I don't know, does that make sense?

133
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,980
Yeah, I love, yeah.

134
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,180
Yeah, so the first couple albums, they were,

135
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,140
I would say pretty straightforward and pretty like,

136
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,620
just rock and roll, but have like a little more

137
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,140
like reverb on everything.

138
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,140
And it's not, and a couple years after that,

139
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,260
it would get to like your Where the Streets Have No Name,

140
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,580
which are like secular hymns to fill up an arena

141
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,500
and very pompous and self-serious and you don't,

142
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,580
you think secular hymns.

143
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,220
Everything that you were describing is why I have never

144
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,300
exactly cared for you two.

145
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,580
I guess we can get a little bit into this

146
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,580
because that's the period where I think

147
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,100
that defines them still to this day,

148
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,140
because then for the last 25 years,

149
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,780
they've been chasing that.

150
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

151
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,980
They've gone way back to trying to do that

152
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,740
and now it's like half-life after half-life.

153
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,540
They cannot do a song meant for a little bar.

154
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,580
They can't just do a nice little rock song.

155
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,300
It has to be a world-saving epic.

156
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,140
Uh-huh.

157
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,980
Yes, hymn.

158
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,980
iPod Touch launching song.

159
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,100
Yeah, I guess some of them, not all of them.

160
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,420
Some of them are kind of silly.

161
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,260
I mean, that's a, yeah.

162
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,220
The Couture Se song is not a.

163
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,060
Vertigo, right.

164
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,740
So yeah, but it's still, I would say Vertigo,

165
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,260
not a great song.

166
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,940
Maybe not a great song.

167
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,180
So yeah, so anyway, so.

168
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,220
They didn't do, they were, they started off as a band

169
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,660
that didn't do a bunch of crazy bullshit

170
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,580
and then they became a band.

171
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,420
Yeah.

172
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,660
That's right in this, it seems like Zoo TV

173
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,620
was the era where the crazy bullshit really took flight.

174
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,220
I argue though the crazy, so they were getting called

175
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,300
pompous after doing Where the Streets Have No Name

176
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,500
and With or Without You, all that stuff.

177
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
They were getting called like full of themselves

178
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,100
and stuck up their own ass.

179
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,700
So they decided to break from that

180
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,620
and do different nonsense, I would say.

181
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,980
Cause the 90s, mostly up until, yeah,

182
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,700
most of the 90s they're in like reinvention mode.

183
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,260
And it's not fully reinvented

184
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,620
cause it's like one comes out,

185
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,940
which is pretty standard U2.

186
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,580
But there's a lot more Euro club trash influence

187
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,500
on all the U2 songs.

188
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,180
And Zoo TV is like, is silly.

189
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,380
It's a lot sillier than anything they had done in the 80s.

190
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,500
What is up with this tour?

191
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,380
What is the general, I've only peripherally

192
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,780
ever been aware of what Zoo TV was.

193
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,340
I mainly know it from the interaction

194
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,060
with the VMAs one year when Garth,

195
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,060
Dana Carvey was the host and Garth called in

196
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,220
and drummed from the VMA stage

197
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,940
via satellite to wherever they were playing.

198
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,740
But I know that the tour involved a lot of like,

199
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,620
let's flip through the channels

200
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,860
and it's the world's biggest satellite.

201
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,300
It was a lot of like a big stream of crazy imagery.

202
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,700
But I don't know what, do I kind of have the idea?

203
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,540
Yeah, you do.

204
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,580
I mean, I think Brian Eno had a lot to do with it.

205
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,300
Brian Eno was a long time U2 producer.

206
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,860
He's still around, but he produced a lot of those albums.

207
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,220
He produced Doctone Baby.

208
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,460
And I think it was like, you know how like

209
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,140
when rock stars try to want to say something

210
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,180
and then they try to say something

211
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,180
and then they're not saying anything specific.

212
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,340
They're saying like TV commercialism is bad.

213
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,260
Like it feels like we're talking about the general idea

214
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,220
of television and fame and celebrity.

215
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,540
And you're like, I don't think you're actually saying

216
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,820
anything about any of this.

217
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,540
I think technologically minded,

218
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,660
cause a lot of things I was reading about the subject today

219
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,580
were quotes from like, oh, the tour manager discussed this

220
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,580
and the other characters in an MSN chat in 1997.

221
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:35,060
An MSN chat with the U2 fans.

222
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,820
You're saying that's after the tour happens.

223
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,500
Right, yeah, but I'm saying that.

224
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,220
I'm saying like the satellite stuff, later the iPod stuff.

225
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,860
You're saying it's like technology's emerging

226
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,540
and people that have a vague idea of what it is

227
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,380
try to incorporate it into their persona of the show.

228
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,980
Brian Eno has a pretty varied music career

229
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,420
in terms of both producing

230
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,220
and like I've listened to a lot of his ambient albums.

231
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,860
We're all over the map here, hang on.

232
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,700
I asked a question.

233
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,300
What's the question?

234
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,500
Okay, what is Zootv?

235
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,500
I feel, my thing is that I feel like U2 and Brian Eno

236
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,620
are both very technologically focused.

237
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,580
I think it's a thing where they thought they were making

238
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,620
like points about celebrity and fame

239
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,940
and the hollowness of it and television,

240
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,260
like all this stuff.

241
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,300
But if you watch it and like when it starts,

242
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,100
all the TVs are flashing words

243
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,020
and some of them are like racial slurs

244
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,660
and you're like, what is this saying?

245
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,140
What is any of this saying?

246
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,580
You can appreciate it for it's,

247
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,540
because these are giant stages,

248
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,980
crazy stages with a lot of TVs,

249
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,380
similar to that chain link fence TV aesthetic

250
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,860
you've talked about recently.

251
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,420
The stuff that like is very heavy in popular culture

252
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,420
in the mid to late 90s.

253
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,900
Before that, it was present in like video art installations

254
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,100
galleries and all.

255
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,700
So I feel like it's a catch all for what very out of touch

256
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,500
people see as a problem in society.

257
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,140
It's just technology and change and fame

258
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,180
and our minds and war.

259
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,420
Like when it was just say the words

260
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,860
and then never really turn it into a bigger point.

261
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,180
There would be points in there.

262
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,140
And this is a weird ass tour.

263
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,020
They would go live to Sarajevo during the Bosnian war.

264
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,300
And people would say like, this is really,

265
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,940
why are they doing this?

266
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,300
And then some people were like, this is exploiting the war.

267
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,900
And they thought it would stop dead

268
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,100
in the middle of a rock and roll show.

269
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,340
And they would talk to whoever was in a control room

270
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,300
in the country.

271
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,700
Yeah, people had a lot to say about the 24 hour,

272
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,780
the budding 24 hour news cycle.

273
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,740
So yeah, this is all over the place.

274
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,100
So also by the way, drinking game in the episode,

275
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,860
when Mike says the full phrase rock and roll,

276
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,220
have I said it yet?

277
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,060
Twice.

278
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,900
Okay.

279
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,740
It's a rock and roll show.

280
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,980
Actually show is part, take a,

281
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,740
make it a double shot if show is in there too.

282
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,860
I will not try to force someone to get drunk,

283
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,460
but I'm going to just do it naturally.

284
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:13,460
So yeah, so this is like, this is a multiple year tour.

285
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,700
It went everywhere.

286
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,900
And I would just, the change from YouTube before

287
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,860
is that they're like a little bit self-aware now.

288
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,740
They're a little bit,

289
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,220
they're doing things differently.

290
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,300
They're willing to have,

291
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,100
they don't want to seem like they're sticks in the mud,

292
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,540
even though they probably still are.

293
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,420
But like self-aware in the sense of like,

294
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,700
I was really thinking about this when we were on our

295
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,460
$20,000 a ticket Concorde flight.

296
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,300
Yeah, sure.

297
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,940
Yeah, yeah, no, they're ultra rich already.

298
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,780
Yeah, yeah.

299
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,980
Now like what's going on down there?

300
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,900
What we're passing over,

301
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,380
what's happening down on the ground?

302
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,100
Yes, does Bono, did they move a lot of their money

303
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,620
to a Norwegian bank to stop paying taxes?

304
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,180
Yes, I think they did do that.

305
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,380
So look, there's charity work.

306
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,860
Does it all fall in the line of like

307
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,380
the Clinton Global Initiative?

308
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,620
Sure it does.

309
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,380
Where you're like, I'm not sure.

310
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,580
Obviously there's the Red Foundation, which we will get to,

311
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,060
which is an AIDS foundation.

312
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,100
And I'm sure work has been done.

313
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,420
I'm pretty sure, I hope has been done

314
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,620
to help cure AIDS globally.

315
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,180
We'll get there because believe it or not,

316
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,900
our friend might make an appearance at a Red event.

317
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,860
To either help with or hinder the cause

318
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,420
of helping out with AIDS.

319
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,420
So yeah, so this is a crazy big thing and Bono.

320
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,740
It's a big, they never done a big theatrical tour before

321
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,460
and part of the theatrical presentation is characters.

322
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,300
Yes.

323
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,140
This is an innovation we're going to bring.

324
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,900
And it seems like the characters stepped up

325
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,340
in terms of, is the fly really a fleshed out character?

326
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,180
I don't know.

327
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,460
Is Mr. McFisto?

328
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,980
I feel like McFisto is a hair above the fly

329
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,220
as far as fleshed out.

330
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,940
But yeah, I don't know.

331
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,380
There's a full turn seemingly in the show

332
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,420
where Bono is no more and McFisto is.

333
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,420
Yes, so all the whole Zoo TV tour is pretty well documented.

334
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,140
There's a couple of recorded shows on YouTube.

335
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:22,140
There's a lot of clips and I'll say this about McFisto.

336
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,740
He is well documented online.

337
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,300
When I started looking through this stuff

338
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,740
and I'm like, I like you too.

339
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,620
I like this era of you too.

340
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,940
I like the earlier era of you too.

341
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,800
I don't love the last 20 years.

342
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,420
I didn't know a lot of this.

343
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,780
I didn't know.

344
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,500
I was shocked that anyone gave a shit about him,

345
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,900
but as I was talking to Jason before this,

346
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,080
we were like, oh yeah,

347
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,780
this was like one of the biggest bands in America

348
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,540
and it was a huge world tour.

349
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,220
There has to be somebody who has made

350
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,140
and maintains a weird old looking GeoCities website

351
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,580
about Mr. McFisto.

352
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,200
And that's where I got most of the information today

353
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,700
is a Mr. McFisto fan site

354
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,100
that looks like it was started in 95.

355
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,620
And yet I ended up there too

356
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,620
and it is updated with information from 2018 at least.

357
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,700
Which is kind of weird.

358
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,540
You're like, wow, so this is an old website

359
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,380
that hasn't been touched.

360
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,380
Wait a minute.

361
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,820
These are references to new things

362
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,180
and new celebrities and new technologies.

363
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,220
Somebody is using the same computer that they used in 96.

364
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,580
Anytime they catch wind that Bono is dressed up

365
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,860
with little horns again.

366
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,760
Yeah, it is an old computer.

367
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,940
It is used for the updating the YouTube fan sites

368
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,540
and scheduling Southwest Airlines flights.

369
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,460
Same machine.

370
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,020
Yes, that's a very good point.

371
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,340
So if I have to justify why it's on our Theme Park podcast,

372
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,980
this couldn't be more of a fucking Green Goblin

373
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,380
Theme Park character in one of his songs that he would do.

374
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,140
There's a big, I won't even say it.

375
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,440
Did you watch some of the songs?

376
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,280
I'll ask both of you.

377
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,100
A little bit.

378
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,940
Okay.

379
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,780
I mostly watch prank phone calls.

380
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,740
Cause I don't know what else to call them.

381
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,260
Yeah, no, that's what he,

382
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,660
Mr. McFisto would prank phone call someone

383
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,160
in the middle of the show, basically.

384
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,980
Let me take a step back

385
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,180
cause I'm getting very overwhelmed.

386
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,860
We need to say, what has not been said is

387
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,700
what is Mr. McFisto?

388
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,660
He is a man who is like, it's Bono with face paint on,

389
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,120
devil ears, and he is, there's many things

390
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,940
that have like been referenced for like who he's channeling.

391
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,700
I've seen like, you know, Liberace.

392
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,940
I've seen just the devil himself, you know, whatever.

393
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,500
Is he the devil or is he a devil?

394
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,540
I think he is the devil.

395
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,260
I think that's the idea.

396
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,060
Yeah, the devil is an aging rock star

397
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:46,060
or like a washed up music hall, English music hall musician.

398
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,300
Yes.

399
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,500
And he, he's wearing like a red shirt

400
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,700
and like a gold suit, very shiny.

401
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,060
And he's got kind of platform shoes.

402
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,500
And he, he does have a voice.

403
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,340
That's the voice I was doing is sort of similar

404
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,860
to the voice that he's doing

405
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,800
when he's playing the character.

406
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,780
So he's got a slightly different persona.

407
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,620
I'm not saying this is some

408
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,980
of the greatest character work ever.

409
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,460
I'm just saying he is doing a little bit

410
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,300
of a different voice.

411
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,100
It is more sinister.

412
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:12,940
It's a quiet thing.

413
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,940
And he drags the words out and then they go up.

414
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,220
That's about what he's putting on it.

415
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,660
And I'll say this, you can tell he loves it.

416
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,940
He loves doing this.

417
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,380
He loves playing Mr. McPhisto.

418
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,500
And then I'm looking through this too.

419
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,980
And I find there's a guy, there's a guy that's referenced

420
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,180
in again, one of the many books

421
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,740
that have sections on Mr. McPhisto.

422
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,580
Many books.

423
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,460
And that website, there's all these different sources.

424
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,500
And it's like this, in this great YouTube book

425
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,900
there's a whole chapter on Mr. McPhisto.

426
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,820
And I'm like, I guess of course there is,

427
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,780
but I'm just, again, it was shocking to me.

428
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,260
You feel like YouTube is huge.

429
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,340
Everybody knows YouTube and yet comparatively

430
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,020
the world does not think about Mr. McPhisto.

431
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,500
Like it seems like it's a weird thing.

432
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,620
Like we know the big songs, we know one

433
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,220
but then why do regular people not know

434
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,460
that Bono was a devil guy for like long monologue

435
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,300
for 15 minutes a concert.

436
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,500
Millions saw this.

437
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,540
Millions saw the devil man.

438
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,860
And I guess it's because like Ziggy Stardust

439
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,260
is an album that David Bowie did and a persona.

440
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,100
Yes.

441
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,940
So I guess that's what keeps him.

442
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,460
But I think that, cause like this has its roots for sure.

443
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,220
You know, there's a lot of like rock star alter egos

444
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,060
out there.

445
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,900
Yes.

446
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,940
You know, it all clearly stemming from Sergeant Pepper.

447
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,740
The idea that we're gonna do an album

448
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,260
kind of as other people.

449
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,060
And then Ziggy Stardust as well.

450
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,660
However, like none of them are,

451
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,300
there's not a lot of like Ziggy Stardust media.

452
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,580
They like, there's not like, and now here's a scene

453
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,700
that Ziggy Stardust does and talks to you.

454
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,220
It's like embedded in the music

455
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,180
and especially Sergeant Pepper

456
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,740
because I was thinking about this how, okay, Sergeant Pepper.

457
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,540
Well, yeah, when the Beatles were playing

458
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,620
these other characters, okay.

459
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,740
Now name any other fact about that.

460
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,420
Okay, Billy Shears.

461
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,900
I know one of them is Billy Shears.

462
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,140
Can anyone name who the other guys were?

463
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,340
I can't actually.

464
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,740
Yeah, I had no idea.

465
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,580
But they are named.

466
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,180
Yeah, I don't even know where this comes from.

467
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,020
Their names are Mark Dave and Bob Henderson.

468
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,860
Wow.

469
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,660
So when you look at that cover, it's not John Lennon.

470
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,260
It's Mark Henderson.

471
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,180
Wait, so the three of them, George, Paul, and John

472
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,820
are brothers of some kind and then Billy Shears is Ringo

473
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,020
who sings a little help with my friends

474
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,700
because they introduce him and they say his name in the song.

475
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,980
So Ringo is not related to the three of them?

476
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,820
I guess not.

477
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,660
That's mean.

478
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,900
It's the same format that the movie took on

479
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,620
where the brothers Gib are three of them

480
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,380
and then Peter Frampton is not really,

481
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,580
in real life, the relations.

482
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,420
So that's the rule.

483
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,660
If you're gonna be a Sergeant Pepper,

484
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,540
three of, a Lonely Arts Club band,

485
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,380
three of you have to be related and one of you cannot be.

486
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,220
Right.

487
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,620
I mean, I didn't know all this.

488
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,780
Honestly, until this moment, I didn't know why

489
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,220
that song starts off with someone saying Billy Shears.

490
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,060
Oh yeah.

491
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,900
It's confusing, isn't it?

492
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,740
Yeah.

493
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,580
Billy Shears.

494
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,860
But I mean, when did I first hear

495
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,740
the Sergeant Pepper's album?

496
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,740
2002, 2003.

497
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,740
So by that point, it had been parodied so many times.

498
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,740
I had seen it in books, on posters.

499
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,540
Like I said, a million parodies.

500
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,700
I just know like, oh, it's everyone.

501
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,220
It's all the 20th century stars.

502
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,780
Like Marilyn Monroe is there.

503
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,620
Right, right.

504
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,500
Politicians are there, you know?

505
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,340
Yeah, yeah.

506
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,940
I'm just getting at that like, it's weird.

507
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,180
It's a step beyond for Bono to now do.

508
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,420
It's not just that like,

509
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,740
this character's from a point of view.

510
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,580
Yeah.

511
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,660
This song's from the point of view of a character rather.

512
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,460
That like, this concert is going to stop

513
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,020
and I'm going to talk as a character for 15 minutes.

514
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,100
It's weird.

515
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,940
Yeah.

516
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,780
Which is why I like it.

517
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,780
Like, it's a giant tour with some dumb crap

518
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,260
that most people don't care about.

519
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,140
They're just cheering cause Bono's on stage.

520
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,980
Yes.

521
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,980
And wasn't memorable.

522
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,820
Was not probably that memorable to them.

523
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,860
No.

524
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,900
Can you clarify though?

525
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,300
Cause some of the stuff I saw was that like,

526
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,020
oh, Mr. McPhisto would come out for the encores?

527
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,180
Yes.

528
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,180
I think they changed things up and they changed the setlist.

529
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,260
Now he was not on the American tour.

530
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,100
Correct.

531
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,860
He was, there was a different character on the American tour

532
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,420
that would come out encore time named the Mirror Ball Man

533
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,940
who was a televangelist, like a Southern guy,

534
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,460
but they felt it didn't transfer overseas.

535
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,460
So that's why McPhisto had to be born.

536
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,460
And Bono likes televangelists, approves of them,

537
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,780
thinks they're doing good work?

538
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,620
No.

539
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,460
What?

540
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,580
He thinks they're charlatans.

541
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,740
We couldn't possibly think that they're driven by greed.

542
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,580
I think he does.

543
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,820
Now he never says that in the show,

544
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,380
but I think that's what he means.

545
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,580
I think that's what he thinks.

546
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,420
This all also has, it's like, maybe,

547
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,340
I don't know if they were the first ever to do it,

548
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,380
but I'm obsessed with Sticks and the Kilroy Was Here

549
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,020
album tour, which might've been the first situation where,

550
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,020
all right, we're gonna go see Sticks tonight, huh?

551
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,700
And then 10 minutes and they opened with it.

552
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,260
You had to watch a movie, and then you had to watch a play.

553
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,340
Like, a lot, like even, actually,

554
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,060
it's more laborious than what Bono's doing,

555
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,900
because it's the two of them who cannot act

556
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,860
nearly to the degree that Bono can act,

557
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,100
which is to say not.

558
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,380
But basically, but the Sticks thing also was like,

559
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:47,380
technology is destroying young people and rock,

560
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,060
and also there's a televangelist,

561
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,340
and like, it's all the same shit.

562
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,460
When rock stars start, you know what I'm gonna

563
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,380
get my message out about?

564
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,660
Religion.

565
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,020
And what do you have to say about,

566
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,900
ah, it's just, you know, it's there.

567
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,940
It's not good, it's not good.

568
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,180
Would that Sticks thing, would that be,

569
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,580
that would be post like, The Wall and Tommy?

570
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,420
Yes.

571
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,740
Which would also be very theatrical.

572
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,220
That's why they did it, you're totally right.

573
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,020
Like, we gotta get in on that.

574
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,260
Us, Sticks, who make as good of music as

575
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,140
Pink Floyd.

576
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,980
Who in Pink Floyd?

577
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,260
The Wall, I have always heard, like,

578
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,060
I mean, I've heard the album, but, you know,

579
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,420
he's toured it in recent years, and I've heard like,

580
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,980
look, the original thing, very heavy-handed, big hits,

581
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,500
you gotta see this show, like the show, The Flying Pig,

582
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,300
like the projection of that, like, it is a sight to see.

583
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,060
So The Wall does not, The Wall and Tommy

584
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,340
was like a separate thing you could go see,

585
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,900
but these were not things where you were like,

586
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,620
all right, welcome to the concert, everyone,

587
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,420
here comes a bunch of dialogue.

588
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,020
Yeah, right, right, right.

589
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,540
I don't think, as far as I know,

590
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,940
I don't really know what happens when you see The Wall.

591
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,380
I don't, yeah, I think there's like little pieces maybe,

592
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,460
but it's not, what's his name, Dave Gilmore?

593
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,020
Is he the touring guy on The Wall?

594
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,940
Is it the other one?

595
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,940
What's the other guy's name, that's still alive?

596
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,780
Roger Waters.

597
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,060
Roger Waters, oh, Roger Waters is the one doing The Wall.

598
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,380
Sorry.

599
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,660
Roger Waters, I don't think he puts on

600
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,180
a little devil costume.

601
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,860
No.

602
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:25,860
But he's not, he doesn't have the, you know,

603
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,700
the performer's spark and energy

604
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,460
and the need for attention of Bond.

605
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,620
Yeah, you two, I will say this,

606
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,100
like the Rolling Stones, I feel like,

607
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,860
were like cool dirtbags when they were like younger.

608
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,260
And now of course they're all in a touch,

609
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,180
but like they still have some of the coolness.

610
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,180
You two, bunch of dorks, always been a bunch of dorks,

611
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,460
can't escape it.

612
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,420
Sure, sure, yeah.

613
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,900
Yeah, I would agree with that.

614
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,180
I was just gonna say, oh, now I forgot.

615
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,020
Sorry.

616
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,980
The Rolling Stones, I listened to the audiobook of,

617
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,220
oh God, what's his face?

618
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,060
The second? Keith Richards?

619
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,580
Yeah, Keith Richards' audiobook, Life,

620
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,020
which was notable 10 or 12 years ago,

621
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,420
because it's like, well, Keith reads three quarters of it,

622
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,340
and Johnny Depp reads.

623
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

624
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,980
That's the book where he says Mick Jagger's got

625
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,100
like a little dick.

626
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,820
He like trashes Mick Jagger in the whole book.

627
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,020
He didn't even fill up me old mouth.

628
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:34,100
A big chunk of it is the dirtbag years,

629
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,420
and talking about them like, look,

630
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,940
we were mostly playing covers of American blues songs,

631
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,700
and we had to pull people's teeth to do our original songs.

632
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,740
And which seems crazy to me now,

633
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,540
because I think of their original.

634
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,140
There's a story in that Rolling Stones book

635
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,900
where they talk about just like walking up some stairs,

636
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,060
and one of them or a friend of theirs or something

637
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,900
at the top of the stairs,

638
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,380
and they just start pissing on them as they're going up.

639
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,500
I'm like, this is a different life.

640
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,180
This is a, they grew up in a rough way, it seems like,

641
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,140
at least Keith did.

642
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,900
Well, they passed the baton to us.

643
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,900
This is our hijinks on tour.

644
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,740
Yeah.

645
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,140
Next time, next time around, I'm doing the peeing.

646
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,540
I'm not letting you guys get up the stairs.

647
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,500
Man, Scott's gonna pee on us next time.

648
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,820
I'm racing up those babies.

649
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,820
Tinkle, tinkle.

650
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,780
I hope that's what Keith, if Keith was the peer,

651
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,620
I hope he said that.

652
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,780
Tinkle, tinkle.

653
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,500
This is all happening while Mike knocked over

654
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,300
a cup of tea earlier.

655
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,340
Yeah, a spot of tea.

656
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,860
Opening a card table.

657
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,020
And so it does look like there is a puddle of pee behind it.

658
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:40,860
Of piss, yeah.

659
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,700
Yeah.

660
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,860
Oh, I thought that was, I assumed this was Rockstar

661
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,700
to botchery before I came in.

662
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,940
Pissing all over the garage.

663
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,140
Where were you heading?

664
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,380
So I was heading with the different, I don't know,

665
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,580
we're all over the place.

666
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,300
So there's a lot of rabbit holes you can find yourself in

667
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,300
as you're going through all the extensive archives

668
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,140
of Mr. McPhisto.

669
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,500
One is that somebody claims that the biggest inspiration

670
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,900
is a guy named Quentin Crisp.

671
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,460
Which is- Why do I know that name?

672
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,140
Because he's everywhere, like it's a gentleman,

673
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,660
he was alive in like the, he was born in the 1900s.

674
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:18,380
He was a gay man, an openly gay man in the UK

675
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,340
in like the 20s and 30s.

676
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,060
He was, believe it or not, that wasn't easy to do

677
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,780
from what I understand.

678
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,140
But then he moved to New York, I believe in like the 70s

679
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,380
or 80s and he was on Letterman a ton.

680
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,220
He did a one man show, he wrote books.

681
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,100
He's in Tuang Fu, he's in the movie,

682
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,100
Tilda Swann movie, Orlando.

683
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,260
Huh. Okay.

684
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,420
Qualifies for the podcast with that name.

685
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,820
That's right. We have to talk about it.

686
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,540
He's the bassist for Sting's song

687
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,420
and Englishman in New York.

688
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,260
Oh.

689
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,820
Like I go, this guy, and then the last thing I learned

690
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,900
is Bill Murray claims he's dressed like Quentin Crisp

691
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,780
in Ghostbusters Answer the Call.

692
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,660
What? That's, wait, wait, sorry, Bill Murray says-

693
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,820
Bill Murray's cameo. He's dressed as-

694
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,620
In Ghostbusters Answer the Call,

695
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,500
he's wearing like fancy clothes,

696
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,060
which people thought he was doing

697
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,820
because he was imitating Paul Feig,

698
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,100
the director of the movie.

699
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,820
But he said it was Quentin Crisp was the inspiration for it.

700
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,660
Hmm.

701
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,660
Now, there's another man that people said like,

702
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,260
oh, he was inspired by this performer

703
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,740
who started a big theater in Dublin.

704
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,260
Yes. Well, there's many, look,

705
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,380
when a character is a hit like this,

706
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,900
everyone wants to say- Everyone wants to say-

707
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,740
Everyone wants to claim-

708
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,300
Everyone wants to- Where did this come from?

709
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,060
But this, but the Crisp thing,

710
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,180
I have the Letterman thing.

711
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,620
If you listen to him, you're like,

712
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,380
oh yeah, that's kind of the voice that he's doing here.

713
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,260
As you wasted, dusting all the rails under the chairs,

714
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,420
with people saying, if you go on living like this,

715
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,340
heaven knows what will happen.

716
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,500
Well, it's what he would sound like

717
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,700
if he was any good at voices.

718
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,980
Well, sure.

719
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,820
But I feel like I go,

720
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,700
oh, that is kind of what he's going for, I think.

721
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,140
Yeah.

722
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,300
So anyway, I learned about a new person

723
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,420
and that was interesting.

724
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,380
And it seemed like he's been in so many things.

725
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,220
Anyway.

726
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,740
So Bono is saying that this pioneering gay man

727
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,780
is the devil.

728
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,740
Yeah, basically.

729
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,580
Great.

730
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,900
Again, he may not have thought things through that much.

731
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,740
But yeah.

732
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,540
But he wanted him to be charismatic.

733
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,900
Yeah, so he chose a charismatic guy.

734
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,780
Sure, sure.

735
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,740
And yeah, so I guess, so yeah,

736
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,300
you guys watch a little of the actual performance.

737
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:32,980
Yeah.

738
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,980
Well, and I guess I know that there's monologues,

739
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,460
there's phone calls.

740
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,580
Does he perform songs as McPhisto?

741
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,420
Yes.

742
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,380
The answer is yes.

743
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:49,380
Including like, okay, so here's my problem with McPhisto

744
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,980
is that the songs he's singing aren't McPhisto's songs.

745
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,460
He sings like with or without you, I think,

746
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,100
as Mr. McPhisto.

747
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,260
That is not tonally correct.

748
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,620
Too sincere.

749
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,580
Yeah.

750
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,260
So when he's singing like,

751
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:09,260
like daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car from Zuroppa,

752
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,220
that's closer, I think.

753
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,780
That's more tonally right.

754
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,620
But yeah, so he sings other songs in the encore

755
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,860
and they would switch it up.

756
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,820
But I have this problem also with Kiss,

757
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,580
and somebody's gonna be mad because maybe I'm wrong,

758
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,980
but Kiss, they have personas, the demon, the star child,

759
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,380
but their songs are like rock and roll all night.

760
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,380
And you're like, well, wait a minute,

761
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,420
what does that have to do with the demon?

762
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,660
Where does Beth, how does that song,

763
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,180
it's had this like kind of sleepy ballad attached

764
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,860
to the notion that a devil is singing this.

765
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,300
Detroit Rock City or like, or Black Diamond,

766
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,500
which songs I like by the way,

767
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,100
but I want songs written from the perspective of the demon.

768
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,620
I want a full McPhisto album.

769
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,740
So yes, it's weird when he's singing 80s U2 songs.

770
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,900
You prefer the four solo records

771
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,220
where they took the makeup off.

772
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,420
And they were all released simultaneously

773
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,380
because it's honest.

774
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,980
Right, instead of the fun character,

775
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,780
I want no fun character because I don't want,

776
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,500
it doesn't make sense to me because it upsets me so much.

777
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,460
There must be some boring songs on those.

778
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,780
Like what is it like the drummer's album?

779
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,180
Like what's the eighth song?

780
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,020
You know what I don't think has come up on the show yet

781
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,180
is that I started listening to one of Ace Fraley's

782
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,420
solo albums called Fraley's Comet.

783
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,020
Where he talks about himself in the third person

784
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,620
and talks about him like going through rehab.

785
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,020
Okay, honest.

786
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,660
That's good, we like honesty.

787
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,620
And one of the songs is called Rock Soldiers.

788
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,580
It's really funny.

789
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,380
He's like, Fraley's back and I told you so.

790
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,260
Like there's some really good lines on it.

791
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,380
They are soldiers.

792
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,420
They're knights in Satan's service.

793
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,700
Right.

794
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,380
So yeah, so I guess here, let's get to one,

795
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,660
like the debut of him in the show,

796
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,940
I guess that would be the best place to start.

797
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,900
Okay.

798
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,100
And again, there's so many things open on my computer here.

799
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,460
I'm gonna have to take a second.

800
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,300
All right.

801
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,260
So yeah, generally on an encore,

802
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,060
all of a sudden, and I was playing a little of this

803
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,060
and I don't have to play this again.

804
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,900
There's this kind of like little crude drawing of a boy

805
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,900
in a, I guess, like a old sci-fi bubble helmet.

806
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,500
And he's like, it's like weird.

807
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,860
You hear this.

808
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,420
I don't know what the significance of it is.

809
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,020
In one of those books, probably you can find out.

810
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,700
But then everyone's cheering.

811
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,180
YouTube takes the stage, but it's only the three members.

812
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,700
Where's the lead singer, you might ask.

813
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,780
And he is of course getting ready.

814
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,020
And you see him on a video screen.

815
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,420
And I'll show this to my two co-hosts.

816
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,820
And hopefully you saw this

817
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,620
and you can describe what you're seeing.

818
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,540
Is he putting on lipstick?

819
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,060
In a mirror.

820
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,260
And he's got his own little dressing room

821
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,660
that's been like set up by the side of the stage.

822
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,060
And I should have put this a little bit farther ahead.

823
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,140
So he's got his devil horns on.

824
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,020
And he's got like a big gold mirror that he's looking.

825
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,060
He's mugging a lot.

826
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,900
He's mugging a lot.

827
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,980
A snide smile.

828
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,260
He's in character.

829
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,540
And they're doing most of the song while he's backstage.

830
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,380
Oh, that's interesting.

831
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,220
Getting ready.

832
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,940
And I will say, I love this.

833
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,380
I love this.

834
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,220
Okay.

835
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,060
I do, right?

836
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,460
It's stupid as shit.

837
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,300
And I love it.

838
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,260
I guess that you're, yeah, well, all right.

839
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,140
How are they gonna top themselves in this concert?

840
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,340
Well, the devil is gonna perform the encore.

841
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,180
That's good.

842
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,620
Specifically like a naughty little devil.

843
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,740
Yes, he's a naughty little devil.

844
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,700
It's full camp.

845
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,780
It's full camp.

846
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,140
And then he has like some stage assistants

847
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,060
to dress him with the coat.

848
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,940
And we don't have to hear the whole,

849
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,780
this is daddy's gonna pay for your crash card.

850
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,660
Not my favorite song,

851
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,180
but when there's a little cheeky devil singing it

852
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,740
live on stage. It's very professional wrestling.

853
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,580
Sure, yeah.

854
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,740
You wanna, you're building it up.

855
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,580
And this is what I'm saying.

856
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,140
This is one of those like very Euro dance type songs

857
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,820
where you're sort of like building up, you know?

858
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,380
So then Mr. McPhistle comes out.

859
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,060
He dances like Bono.

860
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,660
This is one of Bono's dance moves,

861
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,180
which I was showing Jason before Scott was here.

862
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:28,300
He puts his leg up in the air and kind of like bounces.

863
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,100
And apparently McPhistle does that same thing.

864
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,620
So they do the rest of the song.

865
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,300
The McPhistle hop.

866
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,420
But here's the part that's very theme park.

867
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,260
There's the edge.

868
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,340
Edge is dressed like some sort of general, but.

869
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,620
Why aren't they stopping the devil?

870
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,260
They're in league with this guy.

871
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,260
They could shut this down.

872
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,860
Just go whack him with the guitar.

873
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,500
Get the devil off the stage.

874
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,780
Very good point.

875
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,300
So yeah, again, this daddy's gonna pay

876
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,620
for your crashed car.

877
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,900
What happens on stage at this point,

878
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:00,100
but the same thing like the Fast and the Furious section

879
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,500
of a universal backlot tour.

880
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,780
Some cars are dancing around?

881
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,780
Two dancing cars appear on the stage.

882
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,620
Wow.

883
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,140
This is exactly Fast and the Furious.

884
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,980
What was that called?

885
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,540
Extreme closeup or something?

886
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,500
Something like that.

887
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,340
Sorry, I could have made that a lot brighter.

888
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,620
So yeah, there's just two dangling full size automobiles

889
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,420
over the band for truly no reason.

890
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,260
Wow.

891
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,100
But that's.

892
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,740
We'd love to lay gasoline over this.

893
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,580
Wow, we can't.

894
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,420
That's my only complaint.

895
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,940
There's some writing on the cars as well.

896
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,860
And let's see, visit to see David.

897
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,380
Something, I should have read this before.

898
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,980
War technology, data overload.

899
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,460
Hitler, Mussolini, Pope.

900
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,620
And large handkerchief.

901
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,900
I should really have looked at this before

902
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,260
because I'm going to run right into reading

903
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,340
a racial slur or something.

904
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,780
David is probably some fascist European politician

905
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,380
who we have never heard of in America.

906
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,740
And then at the end,

907
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,460
much like the Joker in Batman 89,

908
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,380
a bunch of money shoots out of guns.

909
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,260
I don't know if it's, I assume it's not real money.

910
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,420
I should look in to see if they have YouTube play money

911
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,860
made up for this.

912
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,940
One of my favorite things is the wrestler Kazushka of Kata.

913
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,620
He is a rainmaker and he makes it rain with money

914
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,780
when he comes out.

915
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,660
And the money has his face on it

916
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,700
if you get a couple of them.

917
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,540
Oh, that's great.

918
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,140
I have a few of those.

919
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,460
I like what you're showing me.

920
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,780
You know what this is?

921
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:43,340
I guess I have found you two, yes,

922
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,420
to be pompous or overly serious.

923
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,540
And I do like that what you're showing me is so silly.

924
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,060
It does help me get a little more on board.

925
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:57,060
Good, yeah, that's because they're, I miss this, you two.

926
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,180
And they're never going back.

927
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,540
It's never happening again.

928
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,540
Well, post 9-11, after they became 9-11, the band.

929
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,380
Yeah, so that's very true.

930
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,940
They have a duty at this point.

931
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,340
They can't goof around.

932
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,020
Although I guess I should have said this for the end,

933
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,100
but there was an interview with the Edge two years ago

934
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,100
where he was like, could Zootv return?

935
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,860
Oh, huh, huh.

936
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,740
Which is 30 years of Octon Baby.

937
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,740
So yeah, so they would do songs.

938
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,540
That seems like the most fun.

939
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,780
That had the most nonsense in it

940
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,380
as far as extracurricular stage stuff.

941
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,940
But then there was a section where Mr. McPhistle

942
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,260
would just talk to the audience and be naughty.

943
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,020
And then he would, as Jason said earlier,

944
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,380
make a prank phone call, essentially.

945
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,260
He'd do jerky boys bits.

946
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,260
He would call the US Treasury.

947
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:49,260
And it's either staged things.

948
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,180
I'm pretty, like the way I was reading it

949
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,660
was making it seem like these were completely impromptu.

950
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,100
Sometimes he would call the White House or something.

951
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,900
And it does sound like he gets an operator

952
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,500
and then a hangup, which maybe that wasn't staged.

953
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,260
But then there was one where he calls the UN

954
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,260
and it's like, if you need,

955
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,380
there was just some joke in there

956
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,780
that I should have written down.

957
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,620
But it was like, if you need a,

958
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,140
if you're a third world country

959
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,420
and you need help, blah, blah, blah,

960
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,380
call our 800 number or something.

961
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,260
And I'm like, well, that's not the real.

962
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,100
No.

963
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,100
But he would call like, there's a list.

964
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,620
So this website that of course we'll post

965
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,340
lists all the different people he called

966
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,740
on each stop of the tour.

967
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,580
Wow.

968
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,820
So he called the Pope.

969
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,820
He called Pavarotti.

970
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,100
He called Helmut Kohl.

971
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,220
He called, he would just,

972
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,260
sometimes he would just call for a taxi.

973
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,260
He called Dame Edna.

974
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,380
He called Princess Di.

975
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,220
He called-

976
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,100
It's religion, it's politics.

977
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,460
It's just cool people too.

978
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,420
He called, when he was in the Tokyo Dome,

979
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,140
he called sumo wrestler Aki Bono.

980
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,980
That's pretty cool.

981
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,620
Did he pick up?

982
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,260
I believe he picked up and then he challenged him

983
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,580
to an arm wrestling match or whatever.

984
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,420
And then he called,

985
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,500
on the second night of their Tokyo Dome shows,

986
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,060
he called Madonna.

987
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,900
Ah.

988
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,980
Did Madonna pick up?

989
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,820
Well then someone's like-

990
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,660
Wait, I read about this.

991
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,700
I think Madonna was there.

992
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,540
Okay.

993
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,380
But then I don't think came,

994
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,940
I don't know, it's all very confusing.

995
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,260
Can I read one of my favorites?

996
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,100
Yeah, go, yeah, please.

997
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:23,100
This is that the fan website quotes the edge saying that,

998
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,340
one highlight was calling the minister of fisheries

999
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:30,460
in Norway, John Henry Olsen.

1000
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,300
Oh yeah, yes I saw this.

1001
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,540
To congratulate him on whaling,

1002
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,980
which was forbidden by the European Union,

1003
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,540
but legal in Norway.

1004
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,740
He actually took the call and invited Bono

1005
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,700
to come and have a whale steak with him.

1006
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,540
Oh God.

1007
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,380
So that's-

1008
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,420
Yeah, so that one may have gone through.

1009
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,540
So I guess, yeah, so it's very,

1010
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,460
it's much like Fear Factor Live,

1011
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,620
where we were kind of unclear

1012
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,860
if it's completely plants or whatever.

1013
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,700
I feel like some of these calls were planned.

1014
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,540
Maybe that one wasn't planned.

1015
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,900
Cause the Mr. Mephisto would say the opposite

1016
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,260
of what Bono believed.

1017
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,900
He would say good job on the whaling,

1018
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,020
when of course he doesn't like whaling.

1019
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,300
Oh, the website that you referred to

1020
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,460
breaks down Mr. Mephisto's likes and dislikes.

1021
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,580
And one of his dislikes is whales.

1022
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,420
Whales.

1023
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,860
They're unemployed, they don't pay taxes,

1024
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,300
and they take up a lot of room.

1025
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,820
And in general, he has absolutely no time

1026
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,140
for people who do like whales or dolphins.

1027
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,180
Yeah, and his previous character,

1028
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,220
the Mirror Ball Man in America,

1029
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,460
yeah, would often call the White House.

1030
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,740
And like, I would like to speak to George H.W. Bush

1031
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,380
and congratulate him on the war.

1032
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,060
Cause it's the devil, the devil likes war.

1033
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,300
Right, but this is also back,

1034
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,940
this is I feel like back when he might have been

1035
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,780
a little bit more in touch,

1036
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,260
cause there was just an article about,

1037
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,060
and maybe in the New York Times, I forget,

1038
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,500
talking to Bono about all this stuff.

1039
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,580
And they were like, you know,

1040
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,900
some people think it's kind of weird

1041
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,700
that you're like very friendly with George W. Bush.

1042
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,020
And he's like, I don't believe he's a bad man.

1043
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,460
I don't think, you know, he meant to do anything.

1044
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,460
And they're like, some people think you're out of it

1045
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,300
at this point.

1046
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,420
And he was like, what do you mean?

1047
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,060
Very much read like a McFisto, like I'm not bad.

1048
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,900
What do you mean?

1049
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,980
He's got Davos brain in real life.

1050
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:16,740
Yeah, so maybe back then he was actually a little more.

1051
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,860
I think his paintings are charming.

1052
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,020
Yeah.

1053
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,020
He gave Michelle Obama the candy.

1054
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:28,020
Yeah, so we'll see when the Zoo TV Tour comes back,

1055
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,580
who he's calling.

1056
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,700
Maybe it's, he just calls George W. Bush and goes,

1057
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,460
thank you for everything.

1058
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,100
You're a nice man, you.

1059
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,700
I endorse it all.

1060
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,340
Don't fall off your Segway again.

1061
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,860
Was that him, was that George W. Bush?

1062
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,700
Fell off a.

1063
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,460
Did he fall off a Segway?

1064
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,180
I feel like, or every president, I feel like for.

1065
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,900
Decades has fallen off a bike or some sort of.

1066
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,940
Did Trump fall?

1067
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,420
Trump was very careful.

1068
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,660
He was afraid of falling.

1069
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,380
Cause he knows one fall and that's it.

1070
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,500
That's all it'll take.

1071
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,340
Yeah, maybe.

1072
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,860
He's barely hanging together.

1073
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,380
The best one is that one where the,

1074
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,540
he's gripping that railing on a ramp.

1075
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,620
I forget which one that was.

1076
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,780
Which place that was.

1077
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,500
When it was stair mania for a little while,

1078
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,380
that Trump is afraid of stairs and he's denying it.

1079
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,460
And people are like, no, no, no, look, I went back.

1080
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,100
I looked at both of his SNL monologues

1081
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,660
cause he's got four stairs to walk down.

1082
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,740
When you come down to do that

1083
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,660
and he's gripping that railing super hard.

1084
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,740
So you don't see any other hosts do.

1085
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,580
Wow.

1086
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,180
That is a little proof there.

1087
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,500
I feel like there was a rally

1088
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,540
and maybe I've just, false memory.

1089
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,940
I've implanted in my own mind

1090
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,460
where he walked up a ramp or stairs

1091
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,780
and then talked about it.

1092
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,900
He's like, so I walked up the ramp.

1093
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,740
I did it.

1094
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,140
He went on and on.

1095
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,540
He was like, people, he goes, I'm not gonna get fooled.

1096
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,420
You're not gonna fool me.

1097
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,340
I'm not tripping.

1098
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,260
He was like really,

1099
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,120
he didn't like that people made fun of him for that,

1100
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,460
but he was like, I had to do it.

1101
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,380
I didn't want to fall.

1102
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,660
And then the crowd was just like, they loved it.

1103
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,420
They're like, yes.

1104
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,060
Yeah.

1105
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,300
So I have a clip here.

1106
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,220
I'm not, this isn't like a great clip,

1107
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,420
but he's calling and he's got like a sparkly phone.

1108
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,340
Mr. McPhiss, don't add Trump.

1109
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,300
He did not make prank phone calls.

1110
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,940
Although they sounded like pranks.

1111
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,940
He actually did make a prank.

1112
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:22,620
He probably called a lot of the same people on this list

1113
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,180
and it was funnier than this for sure.

1114
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,380
I believe there are stories of Trump

1115
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,900
having a fake publicist name that he would call people.

1116
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,740
Oh yeah, that's true.

1117
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,660
So we kind of did do prank calls.

1118
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:37,380
He would call like AJ gossip columnist, AJ Benza,

1119
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,300
reports as his own PR person.

1120
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,500
He would torture spy.

1121
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,580
He would call spy magazine constantly.

1122
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,740
So here's Bono, Mr. McPhiss, excuse me,

1123
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,140
calling Alessandra Mussolini, Mussolini's granddaughter.

1124
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,980
Oh.

1125
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,900
Six, eight, eight.

1126
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,740
So he's dialing.

1127
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,740
Zero, three,

1128
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,580
oh, one.

1129
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,820
Middle of a concert.

1130
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:01,660
Oh.

1131
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,500
Oh.

1132
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,660
Audience like.

1133
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,460
Hello.

1134
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,300
Hello.

1135
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,340
I don't think he's speaking.

1136
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,620
I don't think he's speaking.

1137
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,460
Hello.

1138
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,860
Well I didn't count on this.

1139
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,620
Italian and Italian.

1140
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:27,980
Hello.

1141
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:30,820
Hello.

1142
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,660
So he's like very satisfied.

1143
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,500
I didn't know that.

1144
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,340
Hello.

1145
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,180
These seem like messages, these phone calls.

1146
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,020
Exactly.

1147
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,100
Never that satisfying.

1148
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,780
You can call and say congrats on the war,

1149
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,620
but then what's gonna happen?

1150
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,100
Hello, I'd like to leave a message

1151
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,980
for Alessandra Mussolini.

1152
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:50,660
I was a close friend of her grandfather's

1153
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:55,420
and I just want to tell her she's doing a wonderful job

1154
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,980
filling the old man's shoes.

1155
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,740
Audience clueless.

1156
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,940
Audience like what is this?

1157
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,180
I believe in Italy tomorrow,

1158
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,500
but I won't be far away.

1159
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:11,500
And I will be with her forever in spirit.

1160
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:14,940
I have a question.

1161
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,460
Before all this happened and before,

1162
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,380
was there ever a moment where he said,

1163
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,740
I'm Mr. McPhisto and I'm a devil?

1164
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:25,300
Like was that, was the game set up?

1165
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,220
So that the audience knew what the fuck this was?

1166
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,420
Oh God.

1167
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,820
Or where they left Flaylon.

1168
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,820
I don't think so.

1169
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:36,580
I think he, I think he did introduce himself.

1170
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,940
When you say like,

1171
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:40,180
did he do it enough to have them know what's going on?

1172
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,020
No.

1173
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,900
But I do think he introduces himself.

1174
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:43,740
Okay.

1175
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,180
He says I'm McPhisto at least.

1176
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,020
Yes.

1177
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,460
Like there's other devil based entertainment

1178
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:53,020
that it starts, please allow me to introduce myself.

1179
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:53,860
Oh yes.

1180
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,700
That's true.

1181
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,100
The bands we mentioned before.

1182
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:56,940
That is true.

1183
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,780
Yeah.

1184
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,020
So it seems like a lot of those, yeah,

1185
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,020
we're like going to,

1186
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,140
so I guess that maybe those are the real ones.

1187
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,500
Cause I was reading the Madonna one was like set up

1188
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,340
cause she was there,

1189
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,020
but there was some confusion.

1190
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:07,860
I don't know.

1191
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,180
So, but it does seem like it grinds the show to a halt.

1192
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,460
It's unsatisfying.

1193
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,300
The audience can't tell.

1194
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,380
Like you can't hear anything in a concert.

1195
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,540
Yeah, probably not.

1196
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,780
And you want to,

1197
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,940
I am amazed by the ballsiness of,

1198
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,740
we're going to talk for a while

1199
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,460
cause like banter seems impossible.

1200
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,020
Like you either have to be in an intimate setting

1201
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,100
or your banter is kind of polished

1202
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,580
or you're so established that people will not mind

1203
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,220
that you just talk for a minute.

1204
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,700
But most, if you're in the middle somewhere,

1205
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,580
I feel like bands don't even try.

1206
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,780
You're not going to do a big run.

1207
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,260
Like here's my standup at the Greek or whatever.

1208
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:46,300
Yeah. These are arenas or stadiums.

1209
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,980
The people in the way back are like, what is he doing?

1210
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,740
And imagine also in that big list of phone calls you made,

1211
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,780
imagine how many of them it just like kept ringing

1212
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,140
or the phone thing wasn't working that night.

1213
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:00,700
Or like, this must've been just a night after night

1214
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,020
of a full minute of dial tones

1215
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,620
or people gesturing off stage.

1216
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,740
It's not working.

1217
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,020
We can't get the phone.

1218
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,860
Vamp, Phil.

1219
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,180
Did he have like lines ready to go like,

1220
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,580
oh, guess I need a new calling card.

1221
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,700
Yeah, he had lines.

1222
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,940
He knew exactly.

1223
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,980
There was probably a writer on staff.

1224
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,700
1-800, when 1-800 collect came along,

1225
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,660
it was all 1-800 collect.

1226
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,500
Sure.

1227
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,060
And I'm charging all of you.

1228
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,980
Expect a bill in the mail.

1229
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,980
70,000 people.

1230
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,780
Set the call if you know what's good for you.

1231
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,980
Accept the charge.

1232
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,460
And the woo that would come after, it would just be woo.

1233
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,820
And there'd be like a question mark at the end

1234
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,660
from the audience.

1235
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,780
Like, what? Woo.

1236
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,140
I think we like this because you're you too

1237
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,420
and we paid to beer so we'd have to like it, right?

1238
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:54,060
It's heartening to learn that Alessandra Mussolini

1239
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,060
reminded every few months.

1240
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,340
So it's like, oh, still skulking around.

1241
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,700
Yeah, still around.

1242
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,420
He called one of the LePens, Marie LePen,

1243
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,500
fascist politician in France now,

1244
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,380
I believe her father before her, also a piece of shit.

1245
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,220
Sure.

1246
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,460
And now he's probably been on the upstate plane

1247
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,300
with the two of them.

1248
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,140
Very well.

1249
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,940
Yeah, very good.

1250
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,300
We're just there for a fun flight.

1251
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,020
It's not about politics.

1252
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,420
If we don't put differences aside,

1253
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:24,460
we can cure AIDS and you want to do that, right?

1254
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,060
So I needed to be on the plane.

1255
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,540
So sad what happened to Ghislaine.

1256
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:30,500
Oh, Ghislaine.

1257
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:33,820
You were naughty.

1258
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:38,300
He's now, already just now he can backpedal like,

1259
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,340
okay, if you find pictures of me talking to Ghislaine,

1260
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,460
that was Mr. McPhisto, right?

1261
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,780
But he doesn't, and he doesn't always have his horns

1262
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,020
or his paint.

1263
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,580
Sometimes he's mischievous in that way.

1264
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,660
He'll confuse you, you see.

1265
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,060
And that'll hold up in court.

1266
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,660
And in fact, if I say anything now in this interview

1267
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,220
that I get canceled for online later, that was McPhisto.

1268
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,540
He's gonna get a chill freak card with this.

1269
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,660
Yeah, and it's gonna, yeah, it'll hold up.

1270
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,620
No jury would convict Mr. McPhisto.

1271
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,900
If you ever been offended by anything I've said on the show,

1272
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,460
it was Mr. Scott Phisto.

1273
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,660
Okay, all right, that makes me feel better.

1274
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,580
Mr. Scott Phisto did most of the Living with the Land

1275
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,660
episode.

1276
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,180
Okay, great.

1277
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,140
There's so many just funny, random, stupid things

1278
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,540
they try to help attribute to Mr. McPhisto.

1279
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,500
They're like, you know, Bono has been quoted as saying,

1280
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,820
mystery and mischief are the two most important ingredients

1281
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,540
in rock and roll.

1282
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,380
Wow.

1283
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,340
And you're like, oh, okay.

1284
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,180
What are they?

1285
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,500
Not like a guitar and drums?

1286
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,940
Yeah, like a four-four time and.

1287
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:41,780
Amplification.

1288
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,460
Yeah, like electric guitar.

1289
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,660
Yeah, one guitar, one bass and drums.

1290
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,300
I would chalk that up.

1291
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,860
It's like a good starting place.

1292
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:49,700
Yeah.

1293
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,820
But something that you can't buy at Guitar Center is mischief.

1294
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:58,820
Can I say some more likes and dislikes?

1295
00:49:58,820 --> 00:49:59,900
Yeah, yeah, please.

1296
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,780
If you have any of these two, feel free.

1297
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,540
But let me say the ones that I liked.

1298
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,780
I really, just this, seeing this breakdown,

1299
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:08,460
cause I like that on like these Disneypedia pages.

1300
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,300
Yeah, yeah.

1301
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,620
Scar likes killing his brother.

1302
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:18,020
Classifying things as likes and dislikes is really fun to me.

1303
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,580
So these must be pulled from various, you know,

1304
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,500
McPhisto rants, but likes.

1305
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,540
People with old fashioned values,

1306
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,660
fascist politicians and the like.

1307
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:31,260
He's nostalgic for the good old days of the Raj,

1308
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,140
the empire, the third Reich.

1309
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:39,140
By in 2018, he said, I'm pleased to see the KKK back in vogue.

1310
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,620
He's staying on it.

1311
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:45,500
He's staying, he's up with our current issues.

1312
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,180
He's as evil as ever.

1313
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,060
Hear his thoughts about Tar.

1314
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,660
But he's like, I'd like an I call Lydia Tar

1315
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,860
and say congratulations.

1316
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,060
Actually, I only watched 45 minutes of the movie,

1317
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,900
so I don't know what, I can't,

1318
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,260
I don't know what Lydia Tar does.

1319
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,700
Does anyone?

1320
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,980
No, I haven't sat down and I haven't taken

1321
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,300
the two hours in 37 minutes yet.

1322
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,140
Yeah, exactly.

1323
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,580
Like parent movie watching,

1324
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,540
every movie takes three nights at least.

1325
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,380
What, likes, what else do I like?

1326
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,380
I like organized religion.

1327
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,740
They're doing my job for me, aren't they?

1328
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,220
Putting the children off God.

1329
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,820
That's kind of correct, actually.

1330
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,140
That's true.

1331
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,380
I guess, but he's saying it

1332
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:27,460
in the most annoying fashion possible.

1333
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:31,700
And if you get cheeky, you want to not agree with it, maybe?

1334
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,220
It's the onion, the worst person you know

1335
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,940
just made a great point.

1336
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:40,700
Likes, people occupying the extremes,

1337
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,300
demonizing their opponents and resorting to personal insults

1338
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,020
instead of seeking out common ground,

1339
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:47,900
considers compromise to be a dirty word.

1340
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:52,580
Do we, do we think this is the editorialization

1341
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:54,340
of the website writer?

1342
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:58,580
Yeah, to some extent, I don't think any of that is quotes,

1343
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,780
but you know, he could extrapolate.

1344
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,700
They are wrong.

1345
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,540
Here's, this one gets more specific though,

1346
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,660
and this again, you can tell when this,

1347
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,500
what year this was set in.

1348
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,260
He likes seeing his protege's achieve success.

1349
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:15,780
Why, I'm so proud of comrade Putin,

1350
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:19,820
and I see great promise in his latest charge,

1351
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,220
dear old Donnie.

1352
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,100
Boo.

1353
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,660
All right, all right.

1354
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,500
Stink.

1355
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:32,460
I don't know that McPhisto will work in modern times,

1356
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,100
necessarily.

1357
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,060
Well, first of all, it's confusing.

1358
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,180
The double speak, the, you know, like,

1359
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,940
my dad didn't understand the Colbert report.

1360
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:42,900
I don't get this.

1361
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,460
Why is this guy saying all this stuff?

1362
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,020
Well, no, it's all the opposite of what,

1363
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,820
ah, I can't deal with that.

1364
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:51,180
This is what anybody, you know, it is a Colbert,

1365
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,580
you know, really Colbert has Mr. McPhisto to thank.

1366
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:54,420
That's a good point.

1367
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,980
A great opposite character.

1368
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,380
Well, McPhisto, yeah, should have,

1369
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,500
McPhisto should have gotten his own show

1370
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,740
or appeared more places.

1371
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,580
Well, the Daily Show has not been solved yet.

1372
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,380
They're just throwing a bunch of guest hosts at it

1373
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,820
and there's no show after it.

1374
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,460
I don't think, wait, I don't even know.

1375
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:14,100
So perhaps time for the McPhisto report, me thinks.

1376
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,420
And a weirdo Mr. McPhisto host.

1377
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,860
They can at least test him.

1378
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,940
Yeah, we're testing, we're trying Wanda Sykes,

1379
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,180
we're trying Leslie Jones,

1380
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:26,660
we're trying Bono in character as Mr. McPhisto.

1381
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,220
Maybe they can try Bono in character

1382
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,580
as his character from Sing, too.

1383
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,900
Let's try all the characters.

1384
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:34,020
A different Bono every night.

1385
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:35,900
Cause he's got the characters.

1386
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,420
What is the character, what is the, he's a lion in Sing.

1387
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,260
Yeah, what is-

1388
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:43,020
He's Guay's reluctant rock star, Clay Calloway.

1389
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:47,900
I've been loosed out of retirement by Buster Moon

1390
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,540
as portrayed by Matthew McConaughey.

1391
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,380
This is a movie that lots of people saw.

1392
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,220
We gotta watch that.

1393
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,060
Two of them.

1394
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:55,900
We gotta watch that.

1395
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,900
Yeah, let's sing, too.

1396
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,100
I gotta watch this Sing's.

1397
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:02,300
Children are gonna love both Sing's.

1398
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,740
Yeah, probably.

1399
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,620
I'll know what all these are soon enough.

1400
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,900
Things that he does not like.

1401
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,060
Wails covered that.

1402
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:13,740
I'm not a fan of that Bono and his endless preaching.

1403
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:18,700
He's a jumped up little Jesus and a pompous little prick.

1404
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,100
So me and McPhisto have this in common, I think.

1405
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,380
I do share some views with Mr. McPhisto.

1406
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:27,100
Common ground, which McPhisto hates.

1407
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,260
I don't like it.

1408
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,780
I like fighting.

1409
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,820
And in fact, I hate the phrase love thy neighbor.

1410
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:35,300
It makes me want to fucking retch.

1411
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,980
Boy, he did a lot of monologues.

1412
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,580
If all this information is out there.

1413
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,660
Yeah, yeah.

1414
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,940
Met lots of chances to get his views out there.

1415
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,820
I, this is where, all right, this is,

1416
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:49,300
what I'm about to say is really theme parky.

1417
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,140
Yeah.

1418
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:55,140
That he says, I loathe sappy songs of unity like one.

1419
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:00,980
Like that's so what a villain in a show would do is like,

1420
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,500
like, no, don't say it.

1421
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,220
Like this isn't one, there was no villain

1422
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,860
in the Barney live show.

1423
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:10,020
But if there was a, oh, I hate that.

1424
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,060
I love you.

1425
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:12,300
You love me.

1426
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,820
It makes me want to retch.

1427
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,100
You don't want to hear it.

1428
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:15,940
Do you?

1429
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,460
No, I don't want to hear it.

1430
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,820
No, stop singing.

1431
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,020
Oh, it's poison to my ears.

1432
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:23,860
No.

1433
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:27,940
McPhisto is a perfect villain for the Bill and Ted show.

1434
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:28,780
Yeah.

1435
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,620
Yeah, sure.

1436
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,460
They missed out.

1437
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,300
Yeah.

1438
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,820
Other than that, that show tends to cover things

1439
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,620
that were relevant.

1440
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,460
That's true.

1441
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:40,380
They could have, there is a window in the nineties

1442
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,900
where they could have had a villain.

1443
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,780
They could have had a very popular villain

1444
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:47,340
that we would have had to spend 10 minutes explaining

1445
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,220
who this villain is.

1446
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,740
I would love a poll of you hardcore YouTube,

1447
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,620
I mean, not hardcore, but YouTube fans

1448
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,180
who could name the character.

1449
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:56,020
Yeah, yeah.

1450
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,420
They're probably just lives at like,

1451
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,860
yeah, they need to do this devil thing.

1452
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,940
What do you think the number is?

1453
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,780
Percentage-wise?

1454
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,260
Of human beings on planet Earth

1455
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,060
who know that this guy's name is Mr. McPhisto.

1456
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,500
Well. I don't have a clue.

1457
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:14,180
It's gonna be at least 3000 due to our Patreon.

1458
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,020
That's true.

1459
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,500
So we're gonna up the numbers.

1460
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:21,500
So that plus 50,000, 53,000.

1461
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,300
I was gonna guess 25,000 people.

1462
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,140
Wow, wow.

1463
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:28,780
And YouTube sold 100 million albums plus, I think.

1464
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,620
Yeah.

1465
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,780
I bet it's 25,000.

1466
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,820
Well, cause look, people keep,

1467
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,940
what most people do is keep living their lives.

1468
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:35,820
They don't get caught up.

1469
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:40,820
We just scour through pop cultural garbage cans.

1470
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:41,660
Oh, let me in there.

1471
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,500
Oh, I found a scrap.

1472
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,460
Hey, look, oh, I gotta tell the other garbage hands.

1473
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,780
I gotta text the guys.

1474
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,260
Yeah, we're Paul T. Goldman's in the trash.

1475
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,860
Yeah, digging through the trash.

1476
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:54,940
Yeah.

1477
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:58,620
So yeah, so this is McPhisto's,

1478
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:01,460
the most prominent appearance of him.

1479
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:06,460
He has shown up in other things since then though,

1480
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:12,660
including like on the next giant YouTube tour, Pop Mart,

1481
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,100
which I think is sort of responsible for them,

1482
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:19,100
like freaking out and going back to the well in a way.

1483
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,780
Pop Mart seemed profoundly annoying when I was like 12.

1484
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:25,500
I would just see it peripherally and like,

1485
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,180
nope, not interesting.

1486
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:29,780
Well, there's no, they don't,

1487
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,980
I don't think there's any McPhisto like character.

1488
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:34,740
He's like his image, like he's kind of like bat symbol

1489
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:37,820
appears on the Pop Mart tour on the like the floor.

1490
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:39,500
McPhisto has a bat symbol.

1491
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,340
Basic one.

1492
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:41,180
We'll get to that too.

1493
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:45,340
It's his like horns, like it's almost like his hair

1494
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,620
in the shape of horns and then his eyebrows.

1495
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,460
Okay.

1496
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,060
The audience knows what this is for sure.

1497
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,380
There was a lot of people going like,

1498
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,020
are the horns too much?

1499
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,460
Bono's really hamming and hauling

1500
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,340
about putting the lipstick on.

1501
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:59,180
There was discussions.

1502
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,020
I don't know, he's thinking about the horns.

1503
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,180
There were discussions about the outfit.

1504
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,020
Yeah.

1505
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,300
And then he put the horns on and he was like perfect.

1506
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,700
And like the rest was history as they say.

1507
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,100
All it took was a stop at party city.

1508
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:11,940
Okay.

1509
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:18,460
McPhisto appears in, I don't know if you guys read this,

1510
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:21,220
the Frank Sinatra and Bono music video,

1511
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:23,620
I've Got You Under My Skin.

1512
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:27,020
I literally watched this music video today

1513
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:29,020
and I don't know what you're talking about.

1514
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,420
He, I didn't see it.

1515
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,620
I didn't notice McPhisto.

1516
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:33,860
Well, Frank Sinatra transforms

1517
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,900
into Mr. McPhisto very briefly.

1518
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,980
This was right in front of my eyes and I didn't see it.

1519
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,500
So it's right here.

1520
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,340
There's Frank.

1521
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:43,220
There's McPhisto and Frank goes back.

1522
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,180
So there's a brief, brief moment.

1523
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:48,140
Sinatra becomes him?

1524
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,180
Frank Sinatra has the ability,

1525
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:53,180
had the ability to become Mr. McPhisto.

1526
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:57,100
Now from what I understand, terrible guy in a lot of ways.

1527
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:57,940
Some people loved him.

1528
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:01,060
He did some nice stuff, but also a bad guy.

1529
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,700
So I don't know, I don't know why that's in there.

1530
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,220
Did Frank approve that?

1531
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,820
Or did Frank just not have eyes on this in any way?

1532
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,660
I think that might be more true.

1533
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,860
I don't know if he had eyes on that entire album.

1534
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,500
I had never heard that.

1535
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,860
This is the Sinatra Bono duet.

1536
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,460
That is a piece of shit.

1537
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,060
That is horrible.

1538
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:22,220
God.

1539
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,020
Is that the, is the Jimmy Buffett?

1540
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,820
Is there's a, there's a Jimmy Buffett Sinatra song,

1541
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:28,820
I believe as well.

1542
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:32,940
Mack the Knife, yes.

1543
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:33,780
They did Mack the Knife together.

1544
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:34,620
They did Mack the Knife.

1545
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:35,460
What?

1546
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:36,300
Yeah, yeah.

1547
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,220
Buffett?

1548
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:38,860
That is not in the genre of Buffett.

1549
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:39,900
You don't think that's good?

1550
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:40,740
Whatsoever.

1551
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,580
Who's this curly haired idiot?

1552
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,140
Why doesn't he have a suit on?

1553
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,340
He's got a, what else?

1554
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:49,060
He comes over, he comes to record in shorts.

1555
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,900
Get this turd out of here.

1556
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,700
Don't like his freestyle ways.

1557
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,980
Laid back turd.

1558
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,740
Here's a little bit of this,

1559
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,860
although it's gonna have a problem loading.

1560
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:04,740
Jimmy Buffett, Mack the Knife duet with Frank Sinatra.

1561
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:05,580
God.

1562
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,340
But yes, he does.

1563
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,820
Why did they do this?

1564
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:12,540
I've got you under my skin with Bono.

1565
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:15,660
There's a song that U2 wrote.

1566
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,940
There's a song on Zuroppa by U2 called The Wanderer,

1567
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,620
which is Johnny Cash singing.

1568
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:21,500
I don't know if you've ever heard this.

1569
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,340
No.

1570
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:23,160
I think it's a great song.

1571
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,000
It's really cool.

1572
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,460
Johnny Cash like singing over like synth,

1573
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,660
like synth music essentially.

1574
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:29,660
Kind of cool song.

1575
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,860
They wrote a song for Frank Sinatra called,

1576
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,300
I think One Shot of Happy, Two Shots of Sad.

1577
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:39,460
And he did not record it.

1578
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:43,220
Why wouldn't I take two shots of happy?

1579
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,460
What's wrong with you?

1580
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,060
So I guess, yeah, I guess Bono.

1581
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,400
I think Brian Wilson had some failed

1582
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,740
Frank Sinatra songs as well.

1583
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:52,660
This might have been the thing a lot of people tried.

1584
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:56,300
I always like those stories when somebody writes a song

1585
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:59,100
for an artist and they go, nah.

1586
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,380
The first, the other one I think of is

1587
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:06,100
the Matchbox 20 song, Disease, was written for Mick Jagger.

1588
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,860
And he was like, I'll write a part of the second verse,

1589
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,080
but you sing it.

1590
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:10,920
Okay.

1591
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,340
So want to be polite.

1592
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,540
I kind of like that song,

1593
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:19,500
but imagine 2000s era Mick Jagger going,

1594
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,660
this song's not for me.

1595
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:25,060
Doesn't meet my standards.

1596
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:26,340
Here's Mack the Knife.

1597
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,080
Mack he's there.

1598
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:34,700
And he keeps it way out of sight.

1599
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,540
When that shark bites.

1600
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,380
Oh, that's why.

1601
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:40,220
Because of shark.

1602
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,580
Oh, I can get around this one.

1603
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:43,420
Hell yeah.

1604
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:45,460
How did you tell me there was a big fish in it?

1605
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,980
They began to spread.

1606
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:52,920
Anyway, I would like Jimmy to do out with Seth MacFarlane.

1607
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:53,980
I think that would be good.

1608
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:54,940
Sure, yeah.

1609
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:57,980
Yeah, they're both island owners.

1610
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,820
They'll run into each other at some point.

1611
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,560
They've been on the up-scene plane.

1612
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,780
I've never really put this together,

1613
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:07,940
but the duets albums come out in 93 and 94.

1614
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:10,140
Sinatra dies in 98.

1615
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,180
So I was just trying to figure out

1616
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:15,060
how old was he at this point?

1617
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,340
Oh, he was old as shit.

1618
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,180
Yeah.

1619
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:19,300
Old enough to not care at all.

1620
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,860
Not to care that they turned him into the devil briefly.

1621
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:27,460
So yeah, so then McPhisto would be referenced here and there

1622
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:32,460
like before Elevation, I think on the tour

1623
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:35,620
after they did the album All That You Can't Leave Behind,

1624
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:38,220
he would be like, I'm looking for a little elevation

1625
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:42,520
or something like little nods to it here and there.

1626
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,860
There's fans dressed as McPhisto.

1627
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:48,100
There's clips you can find recent tours

1628
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,420
where Bono pulls a fan out of the audience

1629
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:52,860
dressed as Mr. McPhisto and the guy jumps on stage

1630
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:56,580
and is dancing with Bono and security swarms this guy.

1631
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:58,340
And Bono must be like, no, no, no, no, no.

1632
01:02:58,340 --> 01:02:59,980
I asked her this.

1633
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,500
They're about to beat the shit out of this guy

1634
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:05,100
and Bono's on the front of the stage trying to stop them

1635
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,340
and then goes back to dancing with the guy.

1636
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:10,260
Has to waltz with him to protect him.

1637
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,060
Was that guy who tried to attack Chappelle

1638
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,820
dressed as Mr. McPhisto?

1639
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:14,660
Yeah.

1640
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:15,500
Okay, okay.

1641
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,220
He's just trying to turn his show off his costume.

1642
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:18,060
Very good eye.

1643
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:21,140
And there's a few other ones.

1644
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:26,140
He brought him back recently as an AR-like character.

1645
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:28,340
Did you see the photo of this?

1646
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:29,500
It's not that interesting.

1647
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,580
You know how like on your phone,

1648
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:34,740
you can send messages where like you're like a hippo.

1649
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,340
Like if you talk, the hippo will talk.

1650
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:37,260
Sure, sure.

1651
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:38,500
Which is pretty fun.

1652
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,820
So there's a version of McPhisto they did like that

1653
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:43,300
where Bono's looking into a camera

1654
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,580
and then on the screen you would see Mr. McPhisto.

1655
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,500
Oh, I've seen this.

1656
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,620
It's horrifying.

1657
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:51,820
Yeah, can you show Scott?

1658
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,220
Yeah.

1659
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:56,940
This image was kind of going around for a little while.

1660
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:58,540
And it's not as fun.

1661
01:03:58,540 --> 01:03:59,380
It sucks.

1662
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:02,180
It's like, what's the point if it's not,

1663
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:04,460
he's not wearing fun outfit to make it look,

1664
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:08,100
cause he looks, it looks more evil too, which is, you know.

1665
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:11,380
But it just looks like a garbage video game from 96.

1666
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,340
Yeah, it looks like a twisted metal character.

1667
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:14,180
Yeah.

1668
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:16,300
But yeah, so like who cares?

1669
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:19,340
But like he would do that on a recent tour,

1670
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:20,860
but yeah, not as fun.

1671
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,060
The most, well, we're gonna go back.

1672
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:24,880
I'm gonna retreat to,

1673
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,940
we're gonna end with my favorite thing, of course.

1674
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:27,780
Sure, sure.

1675
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:32,100
But he did appear on Jimmy Kimmel a few years ago.

1676
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,540
Did you see this?

1677
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:34,380
I did, yeah.

1678
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:35,220
Yeah.

1679
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:37,700
Explain this context though, it's kind of confusing.

1680
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,260
So the AIDS charity read,

1681
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:42,940
a bunch of celebrities are involved with it.

1682
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:46,500
And I didn't, I guess Jimmy Kimmel live

1683
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,580
and a couple of years in a row did something for it

1684
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:51,020
by singing a song that was written called,

1685
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,660
if we don't help people with AIDS, you're going to hell.

1686
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:54,980
I had no idea any of this.

1687
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:56,140
Okay.

1688
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:58,580
And in 2016,

1689
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:02,020
it's a real interesting group of people

1690
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:05,180
sitting around a piano, Jimmy Kimmel live.

1691
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:06,660
Brian Cranston.

1692
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:11,660
Brian Cranston, Brandon Flowers from The Killers,

1693
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:15,540
Julia Roberts, Channing Tatum.

1694
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,500
Hold on, I gotta open the video to remember.

1695
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,740
Gawain Maxwell.

1696
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:19,580
Gawain.

1697
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,820
Oh, Alessandro Mussolini.

1698
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:25,180
Justin Roiland.

1699
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:26,420
Justin Roiland.

1700
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:28,460
That was a joke.

1701
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:29,820
Kristen Bell is there.

1702
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:31,900
So I don't know, it's like, it's a fun little,

1703
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,220
like this is a song.

1704
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,700
It's like Seth MacFarlane type song.

1705
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:39,540
And it's like, it's like,

1706
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:42,180
See, they're doing a Seth MacFarlane standard.

1707
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:43,020
It's Neil Patrick Harris.

1708
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:44,500
Oh, DJ Khaled is there.

1709
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:46,300
Hell yeah.

1710
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,540
And it's like a fun little song, you know,

1711
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:49,380
to raise awareness.

1712
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:51,820
And again, I don't know much about the charity.

1713
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,700
I assume there's some good work being done.

1714
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:56,460
I'm always a little suspicious of a bunch of celebrities

1715
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:57,940
with a big charity.

1716
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,300
But anyway, so they're, whatever, they're raising awareness.

1717
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:01,900
So they do this song and they're performing

1718
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:03,460
and you can find the clip online.

1719
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:06,340
But all of a sudden they're all gathered around the piano

1720
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:11,340
and then an explosion happens from behind them

1721
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:12,820
that takes them off.

1722
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:14,100
They think they're done with the song,

1723
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,900
but no, an explosion happens.

1724
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,180
Oh, the set has turned red.

1725
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:20,540
A concrete rock version of the song starts

1726
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:24,660
and in a bathtub drinking champagne

1727
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:28,620
is Mr. MacFisto on national television.

1728
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:32,540
Had Bono been in the episode at this point?

1729
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:34,060
I actually don't know the answer to that.

1730
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:35,500
Oh, cause if not.

1731
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,980
The bathtub popped open.

1732
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:39,540
The bathtub is like Imagineer and it opens up.

1733
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:40,500
Yeah.

1734
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,300
And he comes out, he's got the...

1735
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:43,460
Did you say health?

1736
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:45,300
Yes.

1737
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:46,980
That's not a word.

1738
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:48,660
There's no health.

1739
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,100
Scamming.

1740
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,540
Oh.

1741
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:52,380
Oh, sorry.

1742
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:54,940
There's some comedy cause he like makes up a word.

1743
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,620
So I gotta say, this might be the best

1744
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:03,060
punk rock music I've ever heard.

1745
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:06,300
It's not as good as American Idiot, but it's close.

1746
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:07,980
It's not perfect, but.

1747
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:16,180
So then Mr. MacFisto goes over and he sits,

1748
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:18,260
I think he sits on Jimmy Kimmel's lap.

1749
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:19,100
Yeah.

1750
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,420
And he's just so naughty.

1751
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:22,660
Like he's just being so naughty on TV.

1752
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:27,220
He does, he does not, does he have horns on?

1753
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:28,140
I can't tell.

1754
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:28,980
Yeah, he does, he does.

1755
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:30,580
His hair is also like spiked up.

1756
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:35,220
So my question is, is the audience cheering

1757
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:38,140
because Bono has just shown up or are they cheering

1758
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:41,860
because it's not that Bono's already been on the show

1759
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:44,420
and then Mr. MacFisto arrived.

1760
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:46,540
This is not a cheer for MacFisto.

1761
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,940
I don't know, no one in the audience knew.

1762
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,140
In the Kimmel audience in Hollywood Boulevard?

1763
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:51,980
I could be wrong.

1764
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:54,020
Maybe it was one person was like, holy shit.

1765
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:54,860
It's Mr. MacFisto.

1766
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:55,700
He's doing MacFisto.

1767
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:56,780
He's doing MacFisto.

1768
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:57,620
Yeah.

1769
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:59,300
This is a question I had in general is like,

1770
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:03,820
can you imagine the, like, okay, you've been obsessed

1771
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:06,300
with MacFisto for a little bit, but you have kind

1772
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:07,140
of an air about it.

1773
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:09,540
You like mentioning it as like, yeah, Mr. MacFisto,

1774
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,180
Bono's character.

1775
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:14,220
Can you, can we imagine the character of somebody

1776
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:16,500
who's just like, oh, Mr. MacFisto.

1777
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,340
The person who wrote the website.

1778
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:19,340
The person who wrote the website.

1779
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,700
I guess so, yeah, yeah.

1780
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:23,820
But like, what are they, like if you left the Zoo TV tour

1781
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:25,860
and what you wanted to talk to your friend about

1782
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:27,660
was MacFisto, what would your tone be?

1783
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:30,540
Like what's an example of a compliment of MacFisto

1784
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,020
that isn't confused?

1785
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:33,140
Oh, very good point.

1786
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:35,220
That was so funny.

1787
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:38,420
When he did that devil guy.

1788
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,900
I mean, now that was some solid satire.

1789
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:41,740
Yeah.

1790
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:45,220
I mean, I knew he could sing, but he made me laugh too.

1791
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:48,060
But he's one of our great satirists of all time.

1792
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,220
Get out of here.

1793
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:52,740
This guy's, he's Frank Sinatra and Oscar Wilde all in one.

1794
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,420
Did anyone say that?

1795
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:58,260
That's what it was.

1796
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:01,060
This is a verbatim conversation on the way home

1797
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:02,420
from an arena in 1993.

1798
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:04,140
Oscar Wilde definitely referenced on that website

1799
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,260
in regards to inspiration as well.

1800
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:07,100
Oh, certainly.

1801
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:11,460
So yeah, it had to have happened, I think.

1802
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:12,820
So yeah, so anyway, he's been around

1803
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:14,300
and they're flirting with the idea

1804
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:16,420
of doing more Zootv.

1805
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:19,140
But in case I've missed anything, let me know.

1806
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:24,060
But the most exciting thing to me is his connection

1807
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:28,180
to Batman forever, which includes the fact

1808
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:32,540
or the idea that he may have been a villain in the movie.

1809
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:33,380
Oh yeah.

1810
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:34,340
So let's unpack.

1811
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:35,740
We've talked about this a tiny bit,

1812
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:39,700
but have you discovered the reality of this at all?

1813
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:43,820
Do we have any from the source, Schumacher pre-death?

1814
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:45,140
Do we know what are the possible,

1815
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:48,620
what was Mr. McPhisto gonna be doing in Batman forever?

1816
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:50,340
I don't think we know that.

1817
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:55,220
I also suspect that was a casual conversation.

1818
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:56,060
Yeah.

1819
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:57,740
I don't think there's a draft of Batman forever

1820
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:59,980
where McPhisto is a villain.

1821
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:00,980
Yeah, yeah.

1822
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:02,540
This is like, there's a thing on the commentary

1823
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:06,980
for Back to the Future 3 where ZZ Top were convinced

1824
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:10,380
that their car from all their music videos

1825
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:14,260
was gonna be the time machine in Back to the Future 3.

1826
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:17,380
Like somebody, like a manager was just like,

1827
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:20,700
did not understand what was being talked about

1828
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,980
and like, yeah, hey, they told me the ZZ Top car

1829
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:26,380
is gonna be the time machine in this one.

1830
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:29,380
Which it is fun to imagine like, yeah, screw it.

1831
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:30,940
I know we've set up a lot of stuff

1832
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,420
and we're committed to the mythology of the DeLorean,

1833
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,460
but yeah, new car, ZZ Top car.

1834
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:36,980
It's a ZZ Top car now.

1835
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:40,660
I feel like when they would go and sort of sweet talk artists,

1836
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:43,020
cause this is the era of the big artist

1837
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:45,420
doing a big song for a big movie.

1838
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:47,060
I feel like there would always be something

1839
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:50,060
like Coolio is in Batman and Robin briefly.

1840
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,540
I'm trying to think.

1841
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:56,940
Batman and Robin also has the Smashing Pumpkin song.

1842
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:59,740
The beginning is the, I forget exactly the long name of it.

1843
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:01,060
It's a good song.

1844
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,820
And Billy Corgan's talked about how they were sort of

1845
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,420
sweet talked into saying like,

1846
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:06,340
it's gonna be the first song in the credits.

1847
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:07,820
And he was like, oh, that's awesome.

1848
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:09,180
I'm gonna be in a Batman movie.

1849
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:10,540
And he went to see it at the premiere

1850
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,700
and he was like, this is a terrible movie.

1851
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,500
And then the song starts playing

1852
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,180
and I think it's like 45 seconds into it,

1853
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:18,340
it cuts out and another song starts.

1854
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:19,900
And he was like, what the hell?

1855
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,780
So I feel like there's some sort of like

1856
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:24,660
negotiating, sweet talking.

1857
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,380
Oh, wouldn't it be fun if this happened?

1858
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:28,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1859
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:32,420
And what can we technically say that is technically true?

1860
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:33,260
And Bono Pro is like,

1861
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:35,980
wouldn't it be good if I was in the movie?

1862
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,140
Oh, it would be wonderful.

1863
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:40,580
That would be so, let's think about that, huh?

1864
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:42,260
Let's, oh, you know what?

1865
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:44,700
There's two villains already.

1866
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:45,820
It's a little crowded.

1867
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:49,580
So the song you're doing we want.

1868
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:53,380
But oh, what about, he could be in the music video.

1869
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:54,660
You know, wouldn't that be good?

1870
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:55,940
Oh, and then we could put Batman in it.

1871
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:58,140
Oh, and that'll be more time for the character.

1872
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:00,780
And you'd be like, okay, that sounds good.

1873
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,380
Really let McPhisto shine.

1874
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:04,540
Yeah, so that is what happened

1875
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:09,540
is that he, Mr. McPhisto has basically an origin story

1876
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:13,540
in this music video for the song that did for Batman Forever.

1877
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:14,500
I watched this today.

1878
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,740
I didn't know what I was looking at.

1879
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:17,700
You're telling me this was an origin story?

1880
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,220
Yes, so the fly, so.

1881
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:21,380
It was not, I guess I wasn't attuned

1882
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:22,580
to the ins and outs of it.

1883
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:27,300
Yeah, so it's like, it's an animated video.

1884
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:30,100
I don't remember this from the time.

1885
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:30,940
I also say that.

1886
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:34,340
I remember the Seal Kiss from a Rose video pretty well.

1887
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:36,700
That was the bigger hit from the movie.

1888
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,220
Oh, for sure.

1889
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:43,220
A video with, that is basically the same shot 70 times.

1890
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:44,580
Right on the rooftop.

1891
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:46,420
Okay, Seal, what if we tried this one

1892
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:48,020
where your arms are wide out

1893
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:50,060
and we swoop down to you and the bat signal?

1894
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:52,180
Okay, now in this next take, your arms are gonna be out

1895
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:54,020
and we're gonna swoop down to you and the bat signal.

1896
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:55,340
I remember it so well, because it was not many shots.

1897
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:57,020
It's like that Mr. Show sketch

1898
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:59,060
where they keep reusing the same.

1899
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:01,340
Oh yeah, the one entrance happens seven times in a row.

1900
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:02,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1901
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:04,220
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1902
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,020
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1903
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:09,500
So, yeah, so I remember that, but I don't remember this.

1904
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,620
So it's like a very, I don't know.

1905
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,260
It's like the animation's okay.

1906
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,300
It's kind of an interesting style, but it's very 90s.

1907
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,460
It's like Spawn.

1908
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:17,940
It does look like this, very good.

1909
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:20,540
It looks like the Spawn cartoon from the 90s.

1910
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:23,580
And then it's just clips from the movie.

1911
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:28,580
So it starts with McFisto and he's playing with you two

1912
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:31,220
and they're on the Zoo TV Tour.

1913
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:33,540
The Zoo TV Tour makes an appearance in this.

1914
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:36,180
Despite it being long over by this point.

1915
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:37,380
Right.

1916
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:42,380
So at this point, it is pretty confusing.

1917
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:44,300
There's a disco ball on a crane.

1918
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:46,940
Which I don't, again, what is it saying?

1919
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:47,780
What is the-

1920
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:51,620
Did we say that Mr. McFisto's phone is disco ball studded?

1921
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:52,980
I don't think we said that detail.

1922
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:53,820
Right, you're right.

1923
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:55,980
So the one he would use on stage is disco ball studded,

1924
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:56,820
which is great.

1925
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:59,380
So that's a big part of the McFisto aesthetic.

1926
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:01,500
So yeah, you're going through and they're playing on like,

1927
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:02,380
even though it's Zoo TV,

1928
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:04,980
they're playing on a rooftop in Gotham City.

1929
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,580
With no audience?

1930
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:08,100
With seemingly no audience.

1931
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,380
So in between clips from the movie,

1932
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:13,140
now we get the origin story.

1933
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:14,420
Bono's character, the Fly,

1934
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:16,860
which now apparently is like a real fly.

1935
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:17,940
Oh, who's that?

1936
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:22,940
He's climbing down a sign in Gotham on his hands and feet,

1937
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:25,740
like Spider-Man, essentially.

1938
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:27,100
So he's doing that.

1939
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:29,220
And then he gets, as we go along,

1940
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:33,020
he gets hit by the Batmobile, I believe.

1941
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,740
And I guess I should have done time code for you

1942
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:37,540
because the music video is a little disorienting.

1943
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,340
But he gets hit by the Batmobile

1944
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:41,300
and it creates Mr. McFisto.

1945
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:44,100
How?

1946
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:44,940
Well-

1947
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:47,900
Well, the Fly dies and goes to hell, I guess.

1948
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,300
And comes back as a little devil.

1949
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:50,140
Yeah, he died.

1950
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,860
Explain the science.

1951
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:54,940
I was trying, I remember watching this.

1952
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:56,620
I think like a couple of years ago,

1953
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:59,220
I sat down and really watched Batman Forever

1954
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:00,940
from beginning to end.

1955
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:03,300
And I looked at the music video for the song.

1956
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,540
The criterion, by the way.

1957
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:05,380
The criterion.

1958
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:06,380
Of both.

1959
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:13,300
The music video of Hold Me, Throw Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me,

1960
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,540
it's part of that director series.

1961
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:18,780
They put out the music video of like Michelle Gondry.

1962
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:22,420
Actually, though, what I was curious who directed it.

1963
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:25,180
The director is a guy, Kevin Godley,

1964
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:28,060
who was in 10CC.

1965
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:30,700
He's one of the members of 10CC, who I love.

1966
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:33,540
And the spin-off group, Godley and Cream,

1967
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:34,860
who I had no idea-

1968
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:35,700
It's him.

1969
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:36,540
Yeah, yes.

1970
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:38,100
He directed this music video.

1971
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:38,940
So it kind of is.

1972
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:40,780
I actually was thinking like it sort of works

1973
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:41,620
as one of these.

1974
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:45,540
And I didn't know Godley and Cream directing duo,

1975
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:49,340
major music videos, Herbie Hancock's Rocket,

1976
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:51,580
Girls on Film, Duran Duran.

1977
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:53,580
Everybody Have Fun Tonight, Wang Chung,

1978
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:55,260
with the strobe effect.

1979
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,860
They actually, I was watching music videos by these guys

1980
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:59,020
for a bunch of the afternoon.

1981
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:01,340
And this is a very good collective.

1982
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:02,180
The real deal.

1983
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:03,020
So you say that, but-

1984
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:03,860
Yeah.

1985
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:04,700
Yeah, yeah.

1986
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:05,820
And this video seems cool.

1987
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:06,660
The video's fun.

1988
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:09,620
I mean, this is like the tail end of music videos

1989
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:11,060
having real budget.

1990
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:14,500
This is a few minutes of actual animation.

1991
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,380
Well, they have budgets now, but they also have to,

1992
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:18,900
you just have to stare at nice headphones

1993
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,380
for 10 full seconds.

1994
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:21,220
Oh, sure.

1995
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:22,060
Or a cell phone.

1996
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:24,940
The only way you can get a giant music video

1997
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:27,860
is a bit like really blatant product placement.

1998
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:28,700
Yeah.

1999
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,340
So what also was interesting about this

2000
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:33,900
is that the scene of you two playing on top of the building

2001
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:37,740
is happening concurrently with the start of the movie,

2002
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:38,580
with the safe.

2003
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,140
So if you remember Batman Forever,

2004
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,620
the start of it is like two faces going into a rob,

2005
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:44,500
a big vault at the top of a building.

2006
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,820
And he locks Batman in a security guard

2007
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:49,220
in this like circular vault thing.

2008
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:51,940
And then he hauls it out essentially of the building

2009
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:53,740
like it's flying through Gotham with it.

2010
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:54,620
It's happening.

2011
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:57,180
They've animated it and it's happening

2012
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:59,180
while you two is playing.

2013
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:04,180
So right here, you can see the vault going up in the air

2014
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:06,860
while this is happening, it's cutting to it.

2015
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:08,500
So when you're watching Batman Forever,

2016
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,540
just know off screen, you two is playing.

2017
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:11,900
You two is playing.

2018
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,740
But not ono.

2019
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:14,820
Roll right.

2020
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:15,900
McPhisto.

2021
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,100
McPhisto's there.

2022
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:17,940
Yes.

2023
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:21,860
But Larry Mullen is mere feet away from the shot.

2024
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:24,300
Larry Mullen Jr. is there.

2025
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:26,580
Star of the train movie with Donald Sutherland

2026
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:27,900
that I have yet to watch.

2027
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:28,740
What?

2028
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:30,820
He stars in a movie with Donald Sutherland about a train

2029
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:33,700
that he completely financed himself.

2030
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:36,580
He financed a movie that he wanted to be the star of too?

2031
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:37,780
That's right.

2032
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:39,380
That's kind of cute.

2033
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:40,980
Also like Paul T. Goldman.

2034
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:41,820
Very, yeah.

2035
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:42,780
I guess he didn't finance it.

2036
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:44,020
So the bat symbol at a certain point

2037
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:46,700
turns into the McPhisto symbol.

2038
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:50,340
And then McPhisto sort of roars to life here.

2039
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,060
This is a good, on YouTube,

2040
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:54,580
there is now a good copy of this music video

2041
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:56,780
because I remember finding it a couple years ago

2042
01:17:56,780 --> 01:18:00,180
and having to watch like a clipped weird aspect ratio

2043
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:03,100
version on daily motion or something

2044
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:07,020
because it wasn't like up in full quality.

2045
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:10,260
So the fly like comes back here

2046
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:12,780
and then he fights McPhisto

2047
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:15,860
and then you two are shooting fire out of their guitars

2048
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:18,660
at this point.

2049
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:22,140
And then there's a McPhisto mobile that happened here

2050
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:25,260
and it is a gross, I would say it's a gross car.

2051
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:27,460
It is a car with fingers.

2052
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:28,300
Oh.

2053
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,140
Did you see this?

2054
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:29,980
Whoa.

2055
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:32,180
It is a gross like car with like kind of a mouth with teeth

2056
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:35,460
and it has like by the headlights has fingers

2057
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:39,540
and then has like sort of ear kind of bat mobile style ears

2058
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:41,100
and it's very, it's yellow.

2059
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:43,980
So McPhisto has his own bat mobile

2060
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:46,140
that is now Canon in the bat universe.

2061
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:48,180
And it fly, by the way, it flies as well.

2062
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:50,100
So the Mac mobile.

2063
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,660
It's a Mac mobile, yes.

2064
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:56,100
And then here's the, this is all by the way

2065
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,060
a little bit out of order

2066
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:59,380
because this is when the fly gets hit.

2067
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:01,580
This is the pivotal moment.

2068
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:02,620
Oh, I guess he actually, excuse me,

2069
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:04,220
he gets hit by a different car.

2070
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:07,180
I watch a different version.

2071
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:08,740
Elvis kills him.

2072
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:10,340
Elvis kills the fly, excuse me.

2073
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:12,300
So that's, so it's sort of out of order

2074
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:16,980
and then McPhisto and his cronies in you two

2075
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:22,140
like end up like kind of fighting Batman

2076
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:26,020
but we just basically see the end of Batman forever.

2077
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:30,380
And then a bunch of Batman playing in a symphony orchestra

2078
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:34,300
while Mr. McPhisto, I assume like dances with Chase Meridian

2079
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:37,140
who's got a gag on like.

2080
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:38,340
This is very good.

2081
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:41,900
And then a full all violin players are Batman.

2082
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:42,740
And this is good.

2083
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:44,340
At the end, McPhisto keeps,

2084
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:45,780
he takes off an outfit and he's Batman.

2085
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:48,460
And then Batman takes off the outfit and he's McPhisto

2086
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:51,580
and it keeps going back and forth for a little bit.

2087
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:54,340
And then bats show up and he ends up as McPhisto

2088
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:55,820
on the top of the building again.

2089
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:57,980
And then there's just sort of a drawing

2090
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:00,140
of like it's a comic book page.

2091
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:01,180
What does this mean?

2092
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:05,820
Is Batman Bono's character, Mr. McPhisto or is he Batman?

2093
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:08,580
That's my theory is that these were like,

2094
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:11,220
these were things to make Bono feel good.

2095
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:12,060
No, you're part of it.

2096
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:12,900
Instead of being the villain.

2097
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:13,740
It's good.

2098
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:14,560
In the movie.

2099
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,400
Yes.

2100
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,920
This is the thing of the franchise.

2101
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,400
Yes, Prince, we'll put your music all over the movie.

2102
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,960
It won't be a very disconnected soundtrack album

2103
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,360
that just has the bat symbol.

2104
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:29,440
No, no, no, you will be a vibrant presence in this film.

2105
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,280
Yeah.

2106
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:31,600
Okay, now just don't tell him.

2107
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,880
And then like, you'll get to be,

2108
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,280
you could dress up in the video.

2109
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,800
You can be in the video.

2110
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,760
We want you to handle the video.

2111
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,480
That's what you know how to do.

2112
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,320
Uh-huh.

2113
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,080
There's nobody better than you, Prince.

2114
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:46,680
So that adds a lot to the mythology of Batman Forever.

2115
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,320
And believe me, it factors into my Batman Forever too.

2116
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:52,440
Oh, is this a little preview?

2117
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:56,160
So you're gonna keep everything in the mythology around.

2118
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,200
Right, cause McPhisto is in the universe.

2119
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,040
Yeah, you're right.

2120
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:02,640
So I've leaked on a little bit of my ideas for it,

2121
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,760
but I will say here and now,

2122
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:08,080
Mr. McPhisto is in Batman Forever, my Batman Forever too.

2123
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:12,080
And he is villainous.

2124
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,560
Now, how do you feel about,

2125
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:16,440
DC has done a run of comics where it's like,

2126
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:20,600
comics series takes place right after Batman 89,

2127
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,840
right after Batman 66.

2128
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:25,600
Like same continuity playing around in that.

2129
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,040
Would you accept that?

2130
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,280
If they allow me to write a comic that is Batman?

2131
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,120
A comic continuation of Batman.

2132
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,760
I will say no deal.

2133
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,120
Oh wow, you're playing hardball.

2134
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:35,960
I will say movie or nothing.

2135
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:36,960
Okay, fair enough.

2136
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,040
$200 million budget or nothing.

2137
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,680
Fair enough. 200 plus.

2138
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,120
It has to be the fourth or fifth highest grossing movie

2139
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,880
to turn a profit.

2140
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,600
That's the only terms I will agree to.

2141
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:51,280
The B way of water.

2142
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,680
I don't wanna get too many spoilers out of you,

2143
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:58,680
but does this film also have a guy named Carl Michelson

2144
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,200
who is Batman's super cool next best friend

2145
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:06,160
who has great taste in rock and roll music

2146
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:09,360
and who maybe ends up in a little bit of a relationship

2147
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,960
with Dr. Chase Meridian?

2148
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:17,320
The name might not be that name, but you're warm.

2149
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,560
It might be in the spirit of,

2150
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,480
let's say Dr. Carl Michelson.

2151
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,320
Dr. Carl Michelson.

2152
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:27,320
That gets Dr. Carl a little bit closer to Chase Meridian,

2153
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,360
might be a coworker.

2154
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,320
He's an associate of Dr. Chase Meridian

2155
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,200
who happens to play a little rock and roll guitar

2156
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,400
on the side.

2157
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,720
And does he play rock and roll guitar with Batman and Robin

2158
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:39,480
and Mr. McPhisto at certain points in the movie?

2159
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:40,320
Yes.

2160
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,640
Yes, he does.

2161
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,720
Oh my God, you're amazing.

2162
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:46,240
Prince would come to your birthday party any day.

2163
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:47,320
I know him.

2164
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,000
I'm his therapist.

2165
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,480
Let me know when your birthday is.

2166
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,240
I'll make sure he's there.

2167
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,080
That might or may not be a scene.

2168
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:55,040
Now can I suck your fucking dick?

2169
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:01,680
There may or may not be a scene where this character

2170
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:04,640
that might be related to me gets his dick sucked

2171
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,760
by Mr. McPhisto.

2172
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:07,600
By the devil?

2173
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,440
By the devil.

2174
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,440
By the devil as Agent Rockstar?

2175
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,680
By the farm cheeky devil.

2176
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:14,480
That may or may not.

2177
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:17,040
Hey, look, look, I don't like the guy.

2178
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,160
I don't approve of his views,

2179
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,560
but given the immense power of the devil,

2180
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,520
can we not agree that he'd probably be able

2181
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,680
to give the best blow job in the world?

2182
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,400
Oh my God, how did he make things happen

2183
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,440
over all these years?

2184
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,360
He seduced, the devil seduces you.

2185
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,000
How did he grease the palms

2186
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,560
of all the most powerful people on earth?

2187
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:36,840
It has to be.

2188
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,400
Sex is evil, we know that.

2189
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,960
That's basically the mission statement in this podcast.

2190
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:42,800
No, it's not.

2191
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:47,720
Why only the devil could dream of something so disgusting?

2192
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,480
When you make that big pitch with either a deck,

2193
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:51,320
a slight shoot deck.

2194
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,160
To James.

2195
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:56,240
Or boards, yeah, are you going to include

2196
01:23:56,240 --> 01:24:00,320
the detail of you getting topped from rock and roll devil?

2197
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:02,400
Not him.

2198
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,160
Dr. Michael Carl, Carl Michael.

2199
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,600
Yeah, he's already.

2200
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,960
Excuse me, excuse me.

2201
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:12,360
Jason, when I'm pitching to the twisted mind of James Gunn,

2202
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,560
I'm leading with that, brother.

2203
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,680
Are you kidding me?

2204
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:17,240
He's kidding, that's music to his ears.

2205
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:18,920
That's rock and roll music to his ears.

2206
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,640
You saw the trailers for Suicide Squad.

2207
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,160
I don't know if you know, James Gunn actually uses

2208
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,120
rock and roll music in his movies.

2209
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,760
Even though they're like hero action movies.

2210
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,200
I've heard some rumblings about that.

2211
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:32,320
He knows Zuroppa, he listen to Zuroppa.

2212
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:38,160
You're gonna bring, you bring like a devil head,

2213
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,600
like a Halloween mask to the pitch

2214
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,840
and you hide your speaker that you're using right now

2215
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,480
in there and it's just like,

2216
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,760
and you just enact that in the pitch for 10 minutes.

2217
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:50,880
Oh sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2218
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,200
And then you stop and say,

2219
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:56,080
now that is one third of the amount of the blow job seen.

2220
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,640
Just in, I just know you have other meetings

2221
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:58,480
to get through.

2222
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,480
And then standing, yeah, applause.

2223
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:02,040
James stands up and he applauds me.

2224
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:03,560
You're the kind of freak that I need.

2225
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:05,680
Stands up reveals that he's rock hard.

2226
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:10,640
I was very entertained and now I'm in, I'm very aroused.

2227
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:12,760
I'll have to excuse myself

2228
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,400
to the DC executives restroom.

2229
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,480
Finally getting some of that nine songs,

2230
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:21,400
some of that short bus energy of like graphic scenes

2231
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,760
into the DC universe.

2232
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,280
Yeah, well that's what it was missing.

2233
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,120
It's where he's gotta take it.

2234
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:26,960
Yeah, he's gotta shake it up.

2235
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:27,800
He's gotta be bold.

2236
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:31,040
Troma, twisted trauma stuff in the DC universe.

2237
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,240
Yeah, well this is where Batman Forever 2

2238
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:36,320
featuring Mr. McPhisto is gonna be perfect.

2239
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,000
Anything we didn't get to in the McPhisto verse.

2240
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,880
There's a lot, but we have to be done.

2241
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,120
Yeah, yes, you do have more.

2242
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,920
Yeah, but no, I mean we get the highlights.

2243
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:45,760
Do you have anything?

2244
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:46,600
No, we get the highlights.

2245
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,280
I actually have a quick hit that he,

2246
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:52,000
the last thing in like McPhisto quotes on that website

2247
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,800
is that he did a little,

2248
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,000
you may recognize the song when I start singing.

2249
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,920
He did a like then current song,

2250
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,960
guess who's back, back again.

2251
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,240
McPhisto's back, tell a friend.

2252
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,720
Another, that's an alter ego situation.

2253
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:10,560
Well, I was gonna say actually,

2254
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,240
you know what the last thing I have is that

2255
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:16,400
Mr. McPhisto did make a like best top 10 alter ego list

2256
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,640
in Time Magazine.

2257
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:18,480
Oh yes.

2258
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:19,300
Did you find that?

2259
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,200
I did, I did.

2260
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,520
Well, and I, well anything you wanna say,

2261
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,520
just don't mention number one

2262
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,680
because I might have a little,

2263
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:29,720
anybody else you wanna shout out though?

2264
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,960
Colbert's on the list,

2265
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:34,800
Andy Kaufman, Tony Clifton are on the list,

2266
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,360
Sergeant Pepper on the list,

2267
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:37,680
all the people we mentioned.

2268
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:38,520
Yeah.

2269
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:39,920
Slim Shady, yes.

2270
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,800
Hannah Montana, Miley Cyrus of course.

2271
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:42,640
Oh sure, oh sure.

2272
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:45,560
Oh yeah, if there's anyone you liked on this list.

2273
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:48,480
Well, there is and I think now that we've opened up

2274
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:51,480
the floodgates that rock star alter egos

2275
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:54,220
count as theme parks and they do.

2276
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:59,080
I would just, I would like the next one in this series

2277
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:03,080
to introduce himself, question mark?

2278
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,280
Please, yeah.

2279
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,760
Ladies and gentlemen, Chris Gaines.

2280
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:11,320
Ooh, what a tease.

2281
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:12,160
Wow.

2282
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,640
Chris Gaines you say,

2283
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,560
the alter ego of Gothbrooks.

2284
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:22,800
Well, so that one may be to cut,

2285
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,560
when you next meet our heroes,

2286
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:28,200
they may be doing battle against a different villain

2287
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:29,200
named Chris Gaines.

2288
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,120
I'm excited about that.

2289
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:33,840
But for now you survived podcast The Ride.

2290
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,360
I don't know, do you feel good, Mike,

2291
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,440
or do you feel stressed?

2292
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,280
Like you didn't get enough out?

2293
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:38,360
I do feel stressed a little bit, yeah.

2294
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:39,200
Uh-huh.

2295
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,040
A lot of information.

2296
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,440
Well, if you ever want to pepper in other episodes,

2297
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:45,280
if you can find times to get out anything else

2298
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,880
fascinating and Mephisto-ish.

2299
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,400
Sure, I mean he'll be back, yeah.

2300
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,640
He'll be back when we least suspect, I bet.

2301
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:53,200
Oh, I'll be back whenever the boys

2302
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,600
are thinking sinful thoughts.

2303
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,440
All right.

2304
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,360
Yeah, look, I don't know,

2305
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:00,400
he was on the Scott Aukerman podcast,

2306
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,560
Bono that is, of course.

2307
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:02,960
So maybe Mephisto, you know,

2308
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:06,080
he would do the pay walled version of podcast The Ride.

2309
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:06,920
I don't know.

2310
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,240
Entirely in character,

2311
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,000
ideally in costume.

2312
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,960
Yeah, of course, yes, he's not gonna do the voice.

2313
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,440
I would throw up. I think it'd be impossible.

2314
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:17,720
Like he needs to feel the wetness of the face paint.

2315
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:18,560
Yeah.

2316
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:22,960
Of the thin, like, smattering of face paint

2317
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:23,880
that he puts on.

2318
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,480
Yeah, yeah, so yes.

2319
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:28,480
Those are the demands we have.

2320
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,160
Okay.

2321
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:32,800
All right, Bono, if you want to appear

2322
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,040
on this theme park podcast Patreon,

2323
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,160
here are our terms.

2324
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:41,720
And you, the listeners, if you wanna keep subscribing,

2325
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:45,120
then do, and if you wanna dig even deeper,

2326
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,480
join us on our new Patreon tier, Club 3,

2327
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,240
where you get one more bonus episode every month

2328
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:51,920
and our regular episodes ad free.

2329
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,920
But do not share the code.

2330
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,320
Or no, he would be like,

2331
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,520
share it with your friends.

2332
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:00,360
Yes.

2333
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,040
Oh, I love when Patreon,

2334
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,640
pay walled podcasts are given away for free.

2335
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:07,440
Yeah, give the left ear to one of your friends

2336
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,800
and you take the right.

2337
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:14,000
Listen at the same time, but only pay once.

2338
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,680
Don't put it on a speaker

2339
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,440
and play it for 10 people at once.

2340
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,400
Even I have my limits.

2341
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,240
Right.
