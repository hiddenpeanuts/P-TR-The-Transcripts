1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,520
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,360
Happy birthday to me.

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,360
Happy birthday.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,360
Michael Carlson.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,120
Did I say you could wish me a happy birthday yet?

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,120
So sorry birthday boy.

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,040
I tell you when you can come in and say happy birthday to me.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,160
Now you may say happy birthday to me.

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,560
Thank you.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,640
No, I'm just joshing.

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,760
I'm just joking around here.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,400
It's podcast, the ride, the second gate.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,960
My name is Mike Carlson.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,000
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,440
Yes.

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,800
Uh, we are Scott free today.

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,160
This is probably Scott will be back very soon.

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,040
Very, very, very soon at this point.

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,200
Um, and today's episode and he hates to miss the idea of this, but he's going

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,520
to miss my birthday shot, which is a tradition now on podcast, the ride,

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,000
where we choose a topic that is a little, I guess, indulgent, not that

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
the show is an indulgent in general, but these are a little extra indulgent.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,760
I feel, yeah, the birthday boy takes a lead and in most cases, the other

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,440
hosts are surprised by what they're.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:20,760
Yes.

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,240
That is a, that is a thing we've been doing lately where it's

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,360
a little bit of a surprise.

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,120
Now last year, I didn't know what I wanted to do until the night before.

29
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:30,920
Okay.

30
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,520
And I'll say this today.

31
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,040
I didn't know what I wanted to do until an hour and a half ago.

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,280
Oh my God.

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,200
I had an idea in my head that I was going to maybe do a Charlie Rose.

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,360
I shouldn't use Charlie Rose because he's canceled a Charlie Rose interview

35
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
of you today for my birthday.

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,560
Oh my God.

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,200
That is the definitive Jason Sheridan interview that is somehow

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,600
indulgent for you, even though that would have been a lot about me.

39
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,720
Exactly.

40
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,560
And it would have been theme park, you know, there would have been

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,240
theme park stuff in there, but I said, ah, it's not, I don't, I have too much.

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,880
I was like, I need more prep.

43
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,760
I need more prep time.

44
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,240
I need to write.

45
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,160
I prepare.

46
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,560
Like, uh, one of the great interviewers would, uh, Joe Rogan, um, Larry King,

47
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,120
you know, the greats, all the greats.

48
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,160
Uh, so I did not have enough time to do it, but one day, maybe when we sit down,

49
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,080
I'll give the, I'll, this will be the definitive Jason Sheridan, be the

50
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,480
frost Nixon interview of Jason Sheridan.

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,520
So I was like, ah, what else am I going to do?

52
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,920
There's all these ideas floating around.

53
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,040
This is what happened last year.

54
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,080
I was like, are we going to do Indiana Jones too, for my birthday?

55
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,560
Uh, we have obviously ended up doing that later in the year.

56
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:38,960
Yeah.

57
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,760
Um, what else, what else there could be?

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,440
I I've been trying to concoct a game show for a long time.

59
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,120
Okay.

60
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,320
Something probably to do live, but I kind of figured something out

61
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,920
that I think is fun, but then I was like, well, I want to do that with like

62
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,080
guests and with maybe a panel of, of deciders of experts.

63
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,560
And you want a whole audience to go like, whoopie.

64
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,480
It's basically the newlywed game.

65
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:06,840
Yeah.

66
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,760
Okay.

67
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,480
No.

68
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,600
Um, yes.

69
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,480
So I was like, I can't do that today.

70
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,000
So I dug, I dug back into the archives of club three of things I like.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,280
And I thought also what would be something that Scott wouldn't want to do.

72
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,840
And I came to one conclusion and one conclusion only Dan Ackroyd unplugged

73
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:37,680
on UFOs, this, uh, somewhat off discussed, uh, very cheaply made documentary

74
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:44,760
where one guy goes in interviews, Dan Ackroyd about UFOs on the set

75
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,440
of Christmas with the cranks.

76
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,400
The Christmas movie that Dan Ackroyd made, I guess almost 15 years ago or

77
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,760
something at this point, and Dan Ackroyd sits behind his desk, chain smokes

78
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,720
while wearing a brightly colored vest.

79
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,720
They love it when you chain smoke in those, uh, production trailers

80
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,320
in those dressing rooms.

81
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:06,840
Yeah.

82
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,240
So today you and I will go through the hour in 20 minutes.

83
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,880
It's like, uh, will we get to all of it?

84
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,320
I don't know.

85
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,360
I don't think so.

86
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,280
Uh, if Scott were here, he'd say, uh, I hope you don't get to any of it.

87
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,400
Um, but he's not, it's my birthday.

88
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,080
So let's talk a little UFO is my history.

89
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,800
I guess I've always liked UFOs in general, but in the last so many years, I am a

90
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,760
little more invested in the idea that something strange is going on.

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,320
Yeah.

92
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,200
I always thought it was fun, but with all the different, there's like been many

93
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,080
different people that work for the government that have now basically on record said

94
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,680
like, yeah, we saw a bunch of weird shit.

95
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,120
Some of them are very casual about it.

96
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,800
Like, Oh, I was in a fighter jet and there's a, I saw something in the

97
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,280
distance that moved in a way that I cannot explain.

98
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,440
We don't have engines that can, you know, shoot a craft up and down that fast.

99
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,000
Can't change direction that fast.

100
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,560
And it also goes, uh, swings all the way to, uh, yeah, we've made contact with

101
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,040
aliens, there have been people killed by aliens.

102
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:19,280
We've recovered alien craft, uh, Boeing and other companies have this somewhere

103
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,400
in a warehouse and they've tried to like reverse engineer it to steal the technology.

104
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:24,800
Right.

105
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,760
So there's a lot of different, interesting stuff.

106
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,600
And I feel like it's becoming more and more mainstream.

107
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,040
It's definitely becoming less of a fringe theory and more of a, like, there's

108
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,280
plenty of people just saying this that seem credible, perhaps they're not,

109
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,200
but they seem credible, whatever.

110
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,280
The speculation is fun.

111
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,160
So I guess what I'm saying is, uh, I bought this DVD a long time ago.

112
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,880
I remember when you got it.

113
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,280
Yeah.

114
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,800
I remembered you, uh, on that TV, we're, we're skipping around on the DVD.

115
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,600
Like you were like, I just got this DVD and you were like showing it to a bunch of us.

116
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,920
And I got it cause it's funny.

117
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,000
Like it is funny.

118
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,880
And it wasn't like, Oh my God, you guys got to see this.

119
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,360
I believe everything in it, but it's funny.

120
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,120
And with Dan Aykroyd, I think Evan Susser and I were talking about this.

121
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,520
And I think he has a good point, uh, about Dan and other people that have made

122
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:28,320
stuff we like is that the, uh, the deep dive interest that Dan has in ghosts

123
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,800
and in aliens is the reason is like the secret sauce to why Ghostbusters is good.

124
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:34,880
Sure.

125
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,680
Dan Aykroyd like knew how the PKE made her work in his head.

126
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,080
I, yeah.

127
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,200
You know what I'm saying?

128
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,000
Like, so what I also like about this Dan Aykroyd thing is you're seeing the mind,

129
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,600
this guy who, look, he, he gave us the blues brothers.

130
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,040
He gave us the cone heads, uh, and he gave us Ghostbusters.

131
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,520
So crystal head vodka, crystal head vodka, which also, if you're not following

132
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,160
him on X or wherever he posts, he has this very interesting way of posting

133
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,080
that also was a promotion for his vodka, where he says that he's going to crack

134
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,680
a head in celebration and that is his phrase.

135
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,720
I assume you're looking it up now.

136
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,760
Well, I was looking up the name of his history channel show because I can

137
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,120
never remember the unbelievable with Dan Aykroyd, right?

138
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,080
So like this is, you know, Gene Hackman recently passed away and this is how

139
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,120
he's eulogized by Dan Aykroyd, uh, pouring two headshots, one in sorrow,

140
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,640
one in celebration for the loss and for the life and career of that great

141
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,440
Gene Hackman.

142
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,680
So he's cracking a head.

143
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,760
Cracking a head.

144
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,040
Or pouring, well, he's pouring two headshots, um, but he was cracking

145
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,400
a head for the, uh, SNL 50th anniversary, which he was not a part of.

146
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,800
He was not there.

147
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,520
No.

148
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,760
Um, and then he wrote, he wrote cracking all heads, original Aurora and Onyx,

149
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,480
which are the different types of crystal head vodka with friends in heightened

150
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,000
anticipation of the Eve of SNL's 50th celebration.

151
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,120
So he cracked all heads.

152
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,760
What's he there?

153
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,960
Did you see him in like, uh, oh, he wasn't.

154
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,440
He wasn't.

155
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,800
And I'll tell you why after when we're off the air.

156
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,040
Cranks too.

157
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,720
Yeah.

158
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,040
Electric Boogaloo.

159
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,400
Yeah.

160
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,480
So, you know, before we get started, I forgot, actually, I told Scott what we

161
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,480
were doing, um, and he sent a message, uh, and I want to read it here.

162
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,120
He wrote, I know this is Mike's birthday shot, but not having to do this UFO

163
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,200
episode is better than any birthday present I've ever received.

164
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,160
Thank you, Michael.

165
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,880
Happy birthday to me, says Scott.

166
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,800
So he is thrilled to not be talking UFOs.

167
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,320
The UFOs is interesting.

168
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,240
I am, it is, I understand why he doesn't want to talk about like Brian

169
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,200
Setzer or Billy Joe Armstrong, but I am confused why he doesn't want to talk

170
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,920
UFOs and I am being sincere.

171
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,160
I think, yeah, it's interesting.

172
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,800
He seems like a particularly like, um, um, that the topic is repellent.

173
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,760
And it's interesting because it's, I don't know.

174
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,640
It's fun to me because it also can provide, it's not only fun on a level of

175
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,040
like, well, what's really going on, but it is also fun because there's so

176
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,960
many fun aliens in pop culture.

177
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,440
Yeah.

178
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,080
You know what I mean?

179
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,360
So like, it feels like it's attached to a lot of different avenues of discussion.

180
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,320
And he's always making those little mashed potato mountains.

181
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,080
So I thought he would love it.

182
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,040
That is true.

183
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,720
I mean, he's real.

184
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,040
He's a real like Dana Scully when it comes to UFOs.

185
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,920
Well, I want to believe though.

186
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,200
Well, we want to believe.

187
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,440
Uh, I just, uh, funny note, the official history channel page for the

188
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,600
unbelievable with Dan Aykroyd show has a very funny image of his literal mind

189
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,120
being like an explosion on top of his forehead and he looks like Ray Liotta

190
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,120
in, uh, the Hannibal movie where he gets his head cut off and you can see his

191
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,040
brains and then his brains get eaten.

192
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,000
Uh, it looks like Dan Aykroyd is like blowing his stack or it's like

193
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,960
he saw like a, like a sexy lady walk into the beach and his head exploded.

194
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,480
Anyway, I don't know why Scott doesn't want to enjoy the UFOs,

195
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,360
the Dan Aykroyd UFO stuff.

196
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:21,800
Um, but here we go and we're going to jump around and so right away we have

197
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:29,760
the most like Apple, like video editing software from 2006 ass graphics you've

198
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,400
ever seen, uh, uh, and the first thing says Gravitron Productions.

199
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,120
I like that.

200
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,280
Oh, it's Gravi- excuse me.

201
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,720
It's Graviton Productions, which I don't know what else they've produced,

202
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,520
but Dan Aykroyd unplugged on UFOs.

203
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,720
Basically this does look like, like the Fox show in the late 90s, early 2000s,

204
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,240
where they would bombard you with different close-up video of just

205
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,440
like blurry lights in the distance.

206
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,400
Um, and with, with scary music, you know, you're like, oh God, yeah,

207
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,960
something's going on out there, but if you really slow it down, are all of

208
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,560
these videos actual UFOs?

209
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,320
I don't know.

210
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,120
You also get David B.

211
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,880
Sarita is the name of the guy and the guy you'll, you'll hear interviewing Mr.

212
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,480
Aykroyd.

213
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,440
Um, I'm just hoping early on when we see Danny, he's lightened up a cigarette,

214
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,760
potentially in silhouette.

215
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,840
Well, it is very, you'll see.

216
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,200
So it says millions of people worldwide claim to have seen UFOs.

217
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,080
Dan Aykroyd is one of them, which is, I'll give them that.

218
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,800
That is a very good intro for this.

219
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,280
Yeah.

220
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,360
That is exciting because you're like, okay, yeah, millions of people have seen

221
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,600
them, but have any of the original not ready for primetime players seen them?

222
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,360
And the answer is yes, that one of them has, and it's Dan Aykroyd.

223
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,320
2001 was a real space Odyssey for me.

224
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,040
Instead of flying on a spaceship to the moon, he doesn't need light

225
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,440
a cigarette for the first time to talk about UFOs.

226
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,720
That's when I knew I had to sit him down in front of a camera and just

227
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,320
when I'm talk about the truth, because if I didn't, no one would believe

228
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,200
we had this amazing conversation.

229
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,880
It's funny.

230
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,200
He brings up 2001 because he does sound like hell the robot from that movie.

231
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,000
Now what's great about Aykroyd is that he always like, seems like he's in character,

232
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,280
but yeah, they get them, they get them lighten up a cigarette with a match too.

233
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,040
Yes.

234
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,160
Which is really good.

235
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,400
He's not doing a lighter.

236
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,680
He's got a match and he's behind a desk.

237
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,960
So it is like he's playing a character, but I do want to reiterate that he is

238
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:50,520
wearing a red vest and a red and green checkered shirt because it's Christmas

239
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,360
time in the movie, Christmas with the cranks.

240
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,600
So they fade out.

241
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,440
One time I had this long conversation with Dan Aykroyd about UFOs and I thought

242
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,080
it was like Einstein was hiding inside of a comic genius, just so that if he told

243
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,520
us the real truth, he wouldn't have to believe it.

244
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,000
If Einstein had told us UFOs were real, would we have believed him?

245
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,760
He never spoke about it.

246
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:23,040
So David Sarita is doing his commentary already and he's saying that Dan Aykroyd

247
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,360
is a genius and you know, we don't maybe take him seriously because he's such a

248
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,800
funny guy and he's been in so many comedies or whatever, but then he also

249
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,600
says that he's like Einstein.

250
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,960
I'm trying to follow the logic here, but would we have believed Einstein if

251
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,560
Einstein told us about UFOs?

252
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,840
Well, he never talked about it.

253
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,680
Never?

254
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,280
I don't know.

255
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,200
Did Einstein ever talk about it?

256
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,240
I guess I should have done some research and figure out if Einstein was ever

257
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,400
weighing in on the topic of UFOs or UAP.

258
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,880
I'm not sure, but David says, David's a guy who's interested in UFOs, I assume,

259
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,960
but one of my favorite things about this video, and I guess I encourage anyone to

260
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,920
put this on and watch at your own pace as well, but David's voiceover and

261
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
commentary, I really, I enjoy that.

262
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,160
I like it too.

263
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,560
Hey, did you know Christmas with the Cranks is a screenplay by Chris Columbus?

264
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,640
I did not know that.

265
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,760
I didn't know that either.

266
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,320
I mean, I guess that makes some sense.

267
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,760
Based on Skipping Christmas by John Grisham.

268
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,800
Really?

269
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,360
Yeah.

270
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,120
But are you a Grisham guy?

271
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,680
I was never a Grisham guy.

272
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,120
No.

273
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,680
It seems like a mistake for you.

274
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,040
Yeah, maybe.

275
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,880
It seems like you were a white Grisham.

276
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,200
All right, let's go.

277
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,640
But Dan Aykroyd speaks about UFOs as if he were a full professor on the subject.

278
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,120
So now we get a video with another title.

279
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,160
You think the movie has started already, but it is not.

280
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,840
Then you go to a title card here that says, Aykroyd's Mind Probe.

281
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,160
And why it's got not what it was.

282
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,960
Well, I don't know.

283
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,320
I think he would have been happy to do this.

284
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't think he wants to hear about me talk about how it could, like

285
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,160
interdimensional beings are visiting us.

286
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,560
Or it could be us from the future or think, like, I don't think he wants

287
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,520
to hear that type of thing.

288
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,640
I do think he would have liked Aykroyd's Mind Probe, which is just, again, we're

289
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,480
only two minutes into this thing, so we may not get through all of it, but I,

290
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,240
so I guess he's just saying, I'm going to ask Dan Aykroyd questions, but he

291
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,720
has set it up very alien-esque.

292
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,680
He's going to probe, which generally when you think of aliens and probing,

293
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,080
it's a rectal probe.

294
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,280
Oh, sure.

295
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,840
Generally speaking, as far as I know with aliens, it's, they put like a alien

296
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,960
piece of technology in your butt.

297
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:50,200
Does Aykroyd at some point, like take a moment and just like hits the harmonica

298
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,280
just to like recollect, like re-center himself.

299
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,800
I'm probably swinging, I'm taking a big swing on that.

300
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,720
Yeah, I don't think he does.

301
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,480
And I don't think he ever like sings the blues or something.

302
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,800
I don't think he goes, like he takes a call from, from Jim Belushi or

303
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,520
something and goes, yeah, we got it.

304
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,720
Like they go over dates for future blues brothers performance.

305
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,400
I don't think that happens, but I don't know.

306
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,880
I, you know, I don't remember all of it.

307
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,080
So perhaps I'm wrong.

308
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,000
Uh, so here we go into Aykroyd's Mind Probe and this graph, yeah, this

309
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,040
graphic is amazing.

310
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,880
We should do, when we interview anybody, we should do like a graphic like this.

311
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,000
If we ever do video again, and we should be like, if Griffin's on the episode,

312
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,600
it should be Griffin's Mind Probe.

313
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,800
And then we start asking him questions.

314
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,800
Griffin, real quick, could you just, it's a, just take this American spirit

315
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,680
and this match and just, you don't have to inhale just, but like light it real

316
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,360
cool, you know, Griffin, would you crack ahead, light this cigarette because

317
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,240
we're going to give you a mind probe.

318
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,760
I want to try to figure out how many times you said crack ahead and add up.

319
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,720
Like that would be 50 bottles of vodka.

320
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,440
Like has he drank 50 or is it just a phrase?

321
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,680
He should have cracked ahead for this episode.

322
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,280
See?

323
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,800
Yeah.

324
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,520
Damn it.

325
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,960
You got to drive home though.

326
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,000
That's a good point.

327
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,120
I'm at my home.

328
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,320
We are in, yes, we are at your home.

329
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,920
So you could have cracked ahead.

330
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,920
No problem.

331
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,480
Yeah.

332
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,760
And all three of the different ones, the other two original.

333
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:20,800
Yeah.

334
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,720
Uh, okay.

335
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,560
Aykroyd's Mind Probe.

336
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,960
You know, how did you get started in UFOs?

337
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,360
What sparked your interest?

338
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,880
What was the first thing that you can remember that happened to you that made

339
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,760
you, uh, you know, ponder the question?

340
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:41,360
Well, I was born in July, 1952 and, uh, I guess about, uh, maybe when I was eight

341
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,560
years old, I found a magazine, a life magazine with a picture of the UFOs from

342
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,520
that sighting on the cover, uh, with a big inquiry, uh, you know, what, what are

343
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,400
these UFOs?

344
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,280
Then I saw the day the earth stood still as a, as a kid.

345
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,280
And, uh, I mean, that was a film that was directly related to maybe some of the

346
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,680
motives for visitations from other planets.

347
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,320
This is a common thing with, with UFOs and UAPs is where, you know, the reason

348
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,920
aliens or the other creatures might be interested in us is because of now we're,

349
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:19,120
you know, pumping so much carbon into the atmosphere and we're threatening each

350
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,240
other with nuclear weapons.

351
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,720
We've detonated nuclear weapons.

352
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,400
So he is, he's definitely on the same page as that.

353
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,360
Um, I, that always felt like kind of a weird explanation to me where it's like,

354
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,680
oh, uh, uh, aliens wouldn't be interested in us unless we were on the brink of

355
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,320
destruction.

356
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,120
Cause like we were making, like, people were doing cool stuff on the earth before

357
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,880
this, they weren't interested in like Shakespeare's plays.

358
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,360
Yeah.

359
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,840
Alien would be interested in a play.

360
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,800
I mean, I guess they don't understand the language, but if they were

361
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,440
sophisticated to be like, you know what?

362
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,960
Some, some people are writing cool books and they're making some cool plays.

363
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,480
Have you seen this painter?

364
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,160
It's like Michelangelo, Michelangelo.

365
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,000
He's painting some cool stuff on earth.

366
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
We should go visit it.

367
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,200
Like, I don't quite believe the idea that they're only aliens or whoever.

368
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,280
Let's interdimensional travels only interested in us because in the last

369
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,200
hundred years, our energy consumption went up.

370
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,560
I just saw a post the other day, I forgot whether it was Twitter and blue sky,

371
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,840
but there is a Wikipedia entry on this.

372
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,640
Do you know about the Zimbabwe, the aerial school UFO incident?

373
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,960
It's called the kids, the kids claim they were, they saw UFOs and some of

374
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,080
them communicated telepathically.

375
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,160
I had never heard of this.

376
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,440
Yes.

377
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,800
This is like, this is one of these events when this is real.

378
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,280
This is not a joke.

379
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,200
This in the not 1994.

380
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,920
This is one of those events where multiple people had the same story after

381
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,680
it happened, because like mostly with this UAP UFO stuff, it's like somebody

382
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:59,720
gets visited or they see one and it's one person's story generally, if they

383
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,080
were abducted or whatever, but this is an incident where a bunch of people had

384
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,680
the same story and they all matched.

385
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,160
Their stories basically match.

386
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,160
Well, and they stuck to it.

387
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,720
Right.

388
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,560
All their lives, you know?

389
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:12,840
Right.

390
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,360
Yes.

391
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,720
I, I, I am wondering, and maybe later in the documentary, they get to this

392
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,240
acroid names, all those big world events.

393
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,120
Yeah.

394
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,440
Well, do they address that?

395
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,480
Like, is it, there's also the theories that, oh, UFOs are a distraction.

396
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,760
This is distracting you from wars, from arms sales, from poverty.

397
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,280
Well, there's, I mean, this, we're not getting through this whole thing.

398
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,600
Uh, uh, what's interesting is there's people then that have the theory that,

399
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,240
yes, the, the talk of UAPs, especially the recently are like Psy Ops to throw

400
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,760
you off what's really going on.

401
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,120
Right.

402
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,000
Tom DeLong from Blink-182 is a big UFO guy.

403
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,920
He has a song called Aliens Exist.

404
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,920
It was on Enema, the state 20 years ago.

405
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,080
And he has had like contact with government officials.

406
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,480
This is how much like actors and musicians like get access to things.

407
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,000
Cause as soon as, you know, he's writing about aliens, he's talking about aliens.

408
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,200
He's contacted by, this is from his own words.

409
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,880
He's contacted by people in the government and like he, he has interactions

410
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,080
with Hillary Clinton's, what campaign manager, John Podesta, where they're

411
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,080
talking UFOs, I think it was in the leaks and the email leaks.

412
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,240
Um, so he now presents himself as an actual expert on this topic.

413
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,800
There's many different podcasts you can listen to some things where he goes, I

414
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,120
can't talk about that because it's classified.

415
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,480
He's like, well, it's a gauge on Podesta.

416
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,840
What are all those pizzas come at?

417
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:46,320
Big Kong, you know, that's satanic performance artists on take off your

418
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,920
pants and jackets and all the great Blink-182 songs.

419
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,360
Um, he is also has to say many times now on podcasts, I can't talk about

420
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,640
that because it's classified, but okay.

421
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,760
So just to be clear, Tom DeLong's history channel show is called Unidentified

422
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,440
inside America's UFO investigation.

423
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:06,720
Yes.

424
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,960
There's so much Tom DeLong alien stuff out there.

425
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,360
And then I've also read though, from other people that go Tom DeLong is

426
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,640
being used by the government, they're feeding him misinformation.

427
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,480
So to throw other people off of what's really going on, which I don't know

428
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,120
what's really going on, what their theory is about what the actual reality is.

429
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,640
But some people then yes, believe that Tom DeLong is a tool now being used

430
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,760
by the government for 20 years to, I don't know, spread fake news

431
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,960
about aliens, I guess.

432
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,320
Right.

433
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,240
Um, so yes, anytime you go down these weird rabbit holes, you get to the

434
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,640
point where everybody has a theory about how one level deeper is actually the

435
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,320
reality.

436
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,840
That's what's always like every, every, you know, QAnon people, whatever

437
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,200
they think Trump or whatever is doing God's work or whatever.

438
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,720
But then there's other people that go, no, no, no, no, Trump is actually a

439
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,400
Psyop.

440
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,960
It's a one, like he doesn't even know he's being played too.

441
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,960
So you really can always go one level, one level deeper with what's actually

442
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,600
going on.

443
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:16,080
The human brain is very bad at remembering things, being able to all agree on

444
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,200
something, which is why some of those alien stories are particularly

445
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,040
interesting if everyone has a very similar accounting of events.

446
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,240
Because generally if you, if something happens in a crowd of people, there's

447
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,040
going to be like 10 different stories.

448
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,400
Right.

449
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,360
The Rashomon.

450
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:31,720
Right.

451
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,840
People really don't, the brain is bad at memory.

452
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,680
Like remember when I remembered that you wanted a warm Walnut.

453
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,040
Uh, yes.

454
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,560
That was not, that didn't happen.

455
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,200
Wet Walnuts or pop ups Walnut barrel.

456
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,040
Pop ups Walnut barrel is what I wanted, but I, I just, I went back to listen to

457
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,440
the episode because I accused you of wanting a warm Walnut and it never

458
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,280
wasn't in the episode.

459
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,360
Like my brain totally shorted out there.

460
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,600
Did not even remember what was going on.

461
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,240
You might've been confused.

462
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,320
Just the phrase chestnuts roasting on an open fire is in your subconscious.

463
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:06,720
Right.

464
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:12,680
But weeks later, after doing that episode, I then put it in my mind that you would

465
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,560
get a Walnut out of a big barrel and then you would want to heat it up.

466
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,080
You would want to put a warm Walnut in your mouth on Christmas Eve.

467
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,800
So, but that was wrong.

468
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,560
That was wrong.

469
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,560
So, so yeah, I would have probably been bad at recalling exactly what happened

470
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,280
if an UFO landed and approached me and my fellow students.

471
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:33,920
Yeah.

472
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,800
I'm guessing.

473
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,280
Um, all right.

474
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,680
We're about minute three here.

475
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,320
I think that in terms of the extra terrestrial machines that are coming

476
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,040
and going, that may be maybe a part of their motivation.

477
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,760
I cannot emphasize enough how the graphics are amazing and shitty.

478
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,560
There's been so many varieties of them.

479
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,080
Yes.

480
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,760
We got some sound public domains, sound effects in there as well.

481
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,480
Yeah, I know.

482
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,520
It's like, and like Dan is trying to talk and he's like, like fighting

483
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,200
for volume, uh, with the sound effects.

484
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,320
Uh, it's like, it's like you are on space mountain or you're like in

485
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,080
tomorrow land and you're hearing those noises.

486
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,440
It also kills the credibility of the documentary.

487
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,320
Like if he's really just like talking to a guy who seems to know a lot

488
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,560
of stuff, which is Dan Aykroyd, like just let him talk.

489
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:31,280
Like we don't need these like beeping boops to remind people of Star Trek.

490
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,040
Sure.

491
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,920
The sighting that took place over Mexico recently where, uh, drug

492
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:42,320
surveillance, uh, twin engine, turboprop plane was at altitude, uh, taking

493
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,040
pictures of possible smuggling routes.

494
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:51,000
And, um, they photograph with their infrared cameras, 11, uh, unidentified

495
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,160
object, so I, this is interesting to me.

496
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,840
And I said this already.

497
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,360
It feels like Dan is in character.

498
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,400
Like ashes, his cigarette with such purpose.

499
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,160
Yeah.

500
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:08,360
Is that like just a long time smoker doing it and a long time actor

501
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,720
knowing he's on camera?

502
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,960
I guess maybe that's what it is.

503
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,240
He's just too dynamic.

504
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,040
A performer is that he cannot help, but ashes cigarette in a way that is cool.

505
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,640
Now you're more of a cigarette guy than I am.

506
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,840
I maybe had two cigarettes in my life, three cigarettes in my life.

507
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,160
I not quite a while.

508
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,480
Right.

509
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,400
But you've asked more cigarettes than I have.

510
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,120
Now, does that mean you've asked 40 cigarettes and I've asked two?

511
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,600
Right.

512
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,760
Perhaps that is what it means.

513
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,960
Have I also asked poorly?

514
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,280
Have I, do I think you can ask as cool as Dan Kroyd?

515
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,760
No, I don't think so.

516
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,600
Did I ask a cigarette at San Diego Comic-Con in the smoking section of the

517
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,880
hotel and I accidentally got some of it on the shorts I was wearing that were

518
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:58,440
very clearly polyester cause they melted a hole and then like, you wait, they

519
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,920
melted a hole in your shorts and then there was like hard plastic and I was

520
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,960
like, well, I'm just going to throw these away.

521
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,720
This was a three pack.

522
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,480
You haven't brought this up on the show before that you

523
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,400
melted your shorts at Comic-Con.

524
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,000
Right.

525
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:20,040
So it was just, it was loose shorts.

526
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,880
It was excess fabric on the inside of the leg.

527
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,760
I spill stuff all the time.

528
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,800
I put on my Ninja Turtle slice, slice baby shirt with Raphael and

529
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
there was a big like stain.

530
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,560
I don't even remember where it came from, but it had just been washed.

531
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,000
So I was like, well, I've ruined a shirt and I don't even know what happened.

532
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,680
So I'm just saying, I'm not trying to put you on a spot, but there is

533
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,640
something extra funny about it burning through in a cartoon style way.

534
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,560
And leaving a hole that wasn't just singed.

535
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,800
It was like, oh, that's hard plastic now.

536
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,520
Cause this is like, this is, this is plastic.

537
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,280
Was it a whole thing?

538
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,400
Did you go, ah, like, was it a like scared thing?

539
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,080
Oh, no, I didn't notice it was night time.

540
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,200
I wasn't paying attention.

541
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,840
So maybe you were like nonchalant in a cool way, like Aykroyd, like no

542
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,400
problem with Dan Aykroyd, like drop some ash on his pants and it burned

543
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,440
through and he didn't even like react to it.

544
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,640
As nonchalant as you can be ashing a cigarette poorly, sitting in a

545
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:23,200
wheelchair, uh, in between canned cocktails at Comic-Con.

546
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,240
Hey, I don't think you could, I think you could look cool if you were sort of

547
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,440
leaning over and you were in a relaxed manner.

548
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,080
Sure.

549
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:34,640
I think you look as cool as, as detective Aykroyd here, but I do, I

550
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,400
give David Sirita, I've already forgotten his name again.

551
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,360
I give him credit when he was putting this together, cause he knew the

552
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,480
smoking was cool.

553
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,680
Yeah.

554
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,200
Yeah.

555
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,720
And I don't advocate anyone's smoke, but unfortunately smoking does look cool.

556
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:54,880
On film, in real life, even if you're a Comic-Con and you, and you burn your pants,

557
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,920
burn a big hole in your pants, it's still cool.

558
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,560
The connection on this cigarette smoking man in the X-Files is in the shadow.

559
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,880
So he's kind of cool.

560
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,200
Right.

561
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,520
This guy must've been an X-Files fan and he probably put two and two together.

562
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:07,960
Yeah.

563
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,640
So anyway, so yeah, they're talking about this incident with 11 different

564
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,400
UFOs in the sky from 2004.

565
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,840
Um, and it is like, I understand skepticism about this because you do

566
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,360
look at this video and you go, it's 11 lights in the sky.

567
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
What am I looking at here?

568
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,840
Like if you don't want to believe, I understand how you would be

569
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,840
disinterested in this topic to some degree.

570
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,560
But also why are there lights in the sky?

571
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,080
Well, of course that's what I say.

572
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,440
Yeah.

573
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,120
That's what you say.

574
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,760
That's what I say.

575
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,280
I say, why are these 11 lights there?

576
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,200
They're moving in a one, but to a, to a Scully, to a Dana Gairdner, we could

577
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,640
call him Dana Scully, of course, Gillian Anderson's character on X-Files.

578
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,840
Um, yes.

579
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,960
He says, well, he's 11 lights.

580
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,520
It could be anything.

581
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,680
What are you talking about?

582
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,160
11 lights.

583
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,160
It's a sub-reflection, 11 reflections.

584
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,760
People are, 11 people sunbathing with that big reflective thing and that's

585
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,520
bouncing off the, the something in the sky and it's hitting the plane.

586
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,000
It's 11 different reflections.

587
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,720
That's what he would say.

588
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,960
You know, these were objects that couldn't be seen by the naked eye, but

589
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,480
were visible on the infrared cameras.

590
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:20,880
Well, the United States Air Force, after the, uh, the news appeared in, in

591
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,440
America and it was covered on CNN and Fox, the footage was shown on Fox.

592
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,320
It was shown on CNN and in the Valley Daily News on the front page had a big

593
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,480
headline UFOs with a question mark and it had pictures from that sighting.

594
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,560
And of course the United States Air Force had to respond and

595
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,480
they said it was a swamp gas.

596
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,640
So Dan is saying that the government's official position was swamp gas.

597
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,960
Got into the sky and obviously he's being a little glib.

598
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,160
He's, he doesn't believe that explanation.

599
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,680
Swamp gas, weather balloons.

600
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,840
Those are often.

601
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,200
Yeah.

602
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,960
Now, swamp gas, what do you know about swamp gas?

603
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,360
Only, only in the instances of like, oh, it was actually swamp gas.

604
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,120
Don't worry about it.

605
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,320
So that's all you, so you were not, because swamp gas

606
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,520
does feel like a thing you would have said.

607
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,480
Well, you know, when I was a kid, we'd always run into some swamp.

608
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,320
Well, you capture the swamp gas in a plastic shopping bag, you know,

609
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,520
and you try to save it like, you know, and then when the swamp gas coming,

610
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,120
you knew the fireflies were far behind.

611
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,560
We would keep, we would keep a jar of swamp gas in the house.

612
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,480
It would ward off evil spirits.

613
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,400
Got a mirror badge and the boy scouts for catching the swamp gas.

614
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,360
We would catch a swamp gas in our mouth sometimes and swallow it.

615
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,440
You know, I think the nineties, I did actually borrow an

616
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,520
audiobook from the library about the rise of conspiracy theories in the

617
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,960
nineties that I haven't, I haven't started yet.

618
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:48,280
Um, I think it's called when the clock broke, but, um, wasn't until much later

619
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:54,520
in life that I learned like, okay, I, I knew like, I was really into the X files.

620
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,760
I was really in this conspiracy theory stuff and alien stuff,

621
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,800
alien autopsy, all that.

622
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:06,960
Uh, wasn't much older that some of that stuff, what the crank version,

623
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,400
like cranks, not Christmas with the cranks, not Chris with the cranks,

624
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:17,040
regular, like Mooney, John Birch society types, kooky people, kooky people

625
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:24,160
were using, they live a type like lizard people and stuff that was actually

626
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,960
coded anti-Semitism.

627
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,960
Oh, sure.

628
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:32,760
So, and, uh, yeah, I didn't know about that until I was much older and I was

629
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:39,200
like, oh, this is taking some of the fun away, but then Hollywood came roaring

630
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,760
back because they just kept the conspiracy, you know, stuff going.

631
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,520
Or so with shows and movies and stuff.

632
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,120
I the Mel Gibson movie conspiracy theory.

633
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,840
Uh, well, yeah, I remember watching that on like the network TV premiere.

634
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,520
And that one, he, his character is right about everything, but also like

635
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:06,400
enemy of the state, the late great Gina Hackman, uh, Will Smith, Jean

636
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:11,360
Hackman kind of unofficially playing his character from the conversation

637
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,760
and that, I believe, I don't know if they can officially call him that.

638
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,720
Was that the idea?

639
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,480
But I didn't know that.

640
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,120
I think that is, that's what I always heard.

641
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,880
Oh, interesting.

642
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,760
I have not seen either of those in a very long time.

643
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,640
It's weird with conspiracy theories because conspiracy theories, like you

644
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,440
can make stuff up about anything.

645
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,120
And I think a lot of conspiracy theories are the human brain trying to organize

646
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,080
things in a neat way, trying to make things make sense because in life, stuff

647
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,880
just doesn't make sense.

648
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,040
Shit happens all the time.

649
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,800
It's really, it's too much, too much information, especially now for our

650
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,600
brains to handle.

651
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,680
So conspiracy theories, oftentimes trying to put things in a neat little box

652
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,120
and it explains a way and it explains that, you know, all the bad stuff that

653
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,320
happens, like the government is so, the secret government is so, um, um, planned

654
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,520
out about things and there's only a couple of people, but they're the ones

655
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,040
that actually control everything and they control it to a T and with the

656
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,200
reality, I think with a lot of things, it's just, uh, people are lazy and kind

657
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,240
of dumb and it's chaos and you know how hard it is for like you to finish your

658
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,720
paper in college, you finish it the night before you're not like so engaged in

659
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,920
it, but you're like, I should, I got to do stuff.

660
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,920
That's how everybody is with almost every job.

661
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,720
Oh yeah.

662
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,960
That's how everything works in the world and a lot of things, it's just chaos.

663
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,200
A lot of stuff doesn't make sense and that's unfortunately the way we have to

664
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,480
live and it's easier to think that everything is connected, that there's a

665
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,320
couple of people really controlling everything in a hardcore way and there's a

666
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,240
trail of bread crumbs that you just have to unlock everything.

667
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,480
It's like a treasure hunt.

668
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,200
It's like going in an escape room.

669
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,760
It's like, oh, oh, if we, uh, if we answer this riddle and we follow it to this

670
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,520
place, we can uncover what's actually going on and then my life will be good.

671
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,880
Then I will be happy.

672
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,280
I won't be chaos.

673
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,440
You know, we, we were talking at, I, I'm not sure the episode's out yet, but we're

674
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,680
talking about cruise ships and a thing I meant to say, but I forgot to on that

675
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,160
episode.

676
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:17,520
Sometimes like scale, the scale of stuff freaks me out.

677
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:22,320
Like if I think about like, okay, there's a grocery store down the street and

678
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,080
that's a chain and there's dozens of that chain and they all have the same stuff.

679
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,720
And where does all that stuff come from?

680
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,760
Comes from factories.

681
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,280
Where is the food grown?

682
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:35,760
Where are the animals, uh, slaughter, you know, and like, uh, similarly like,

683
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,480
okay, cruise ships, how many cruise ships are in the ocean at any given time?

684
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,440
Well, there's like 50,000 boats in the ocean period at any given time.

685
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,400
And it's like, just trying to think about making that scale.

686
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Make sense is like, okay.

687
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,680
I don't, I think I'm done thinking about this sun tapped, you know,

688
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,240
I think maybe, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think on some level you're

689
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:05,160
thinking about how mysterious it is to be alive because you keep going out.

690
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,600
That's what I, because I don't, I just, you know, whatever little world you have

691
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,200
is nice and it's fun to just exist and like, well, are my friends and my

692
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,320
family and the things I do.

693
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,120
And then once in a while you kind of remember that, oh, the world exists.

694
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,560
And it's very overwhelming.

695
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,760
Like it can, it, depending on what information you're receiving, but like

696
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,400
there were fires weeks ago and I'm looking at fire maps and people I know

697
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,360
are, are having to evacuate and I'm leaving and I start to feel very small

698
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,240
in that moment when you quickly, when you see how quickly like a whole town

699
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,200
can get like washed away or fired away, whatever you call it.

700
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,400
You go, oh shit, we are fragile.

701
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,640
This sucks.

702
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,320
I don't want to think about this.

703
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,320
Like, like you start to look and you go, God, it was tiny.

704
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,760
And then you start to, I, me personally, I started to think about my own existence

705
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,320
and it's too much, it's too much to actually have that information, to think

706
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:06,600
about how small you are, where you are, you existing at this very short window

707
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,000
on this planet.

708
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,360
And we don't know what's going on.

709
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,880
I have to reiterate that.

710
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,480
What is going on?

711
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,720
Why are we here?

712
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,240
It doesn't make sense.

713
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,680
No one can explain it.

714
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:26,480
Uh, so the one thing for, for our, uh, tiny little world, I always, I always

715
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,520
laugh when I see people complaining.

716
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,560
The complaints about theme parks, like, well, this track, people

717
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,680
tried to escape the world is a fantasy world.

718
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,960
People trying to escape their everyday lives.

719
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,880
And we're talking about all this, all this shit.

720
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,280
And you're like, yeah, of course people want to escape their daily lives.

721
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,760
Like, this is just too much.

722
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,480
It's a balance because like, sometimes you're like, Oh, this person's too

723
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,080
worried or they're too invested.

724
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,040
Or, you know, there's definitely the song of the South splash mountain people

725
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,360
online that won't let it go.

726
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,160
We're like, let it like, just get, get on with your lives.

727
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,280
Like it's okay that you like that ride and now it's a different ride.

728
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,080
Like that's fine.

729
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,280
But then of course, on the other hand, it's like, uh, obsessing about stuff

730
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,200
you like is part of being a fan of things and is hopefully for you fun.

731
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,320
Fun.

732
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,800
And it's certainly human.

733
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,480
Yes.

734
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,920
You know, and it's certainly a thing that people bond over and

735
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,200
connect people in the best cases.

736
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:26,800
Right.

737
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,040
Cause there's plenty of stuff you'd be like, you are wasting your time

738
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,600
thinking about this or speculating on this or explaining to somebody for the

739
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,480
hundredth time while you don't like this certain movie, but it's fun.

740
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,680
That's what I would say, depending on what it is.

741
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,600
And you know, somebody could correct me if I'm wrong, but like, you know,

742
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,840
caring about dumb stuff is like fun and a distraction.

743
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,080
And as long as it's not ruining you and as long as you're not posting about it

744
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:59,440
24 seven online and people would be like, like, Oh, we better check in on him.

745
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,120
Well, sometimes people get so down a rabbit hole and they just keep posting.

746
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,440
It's like, Hey man, did you finish processing this?

747
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,680
Like, did you try looking at it from another angle or take other

748
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,480
stuff into consideration?

749
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:15,840
Yeah.

750
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,200
Or, yeah, I don't know.

751
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,840
Everyone, everyone's different, but yeah, I don't the best days is when I just

752
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:28,880
like look at like toy news and can watch like a video about the theme park.

753
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:34,160
Like theme park Patton that's been made by a park and you can speculate

754
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,360
what that ride is going to be.

755
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,640
I don't really want to deal with your reality of being alive, but you know,

756
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,640
that's what, uh, that's unfortunately the reality of our world.

757
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,760
You gotta go back and forth and I don't want to, as my daughter says, I don't

758
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,440
want to, which she's imitating a muffin from Bluey.

759
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,120
Have we talked about this for years?

760
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,280
I thought Bluey was the dad.

761
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,360
But Bluey is one of the kids.

762
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,560
That is correct.

763
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,720
And the dad is named a, a, a bandit.

764
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,360
Bandit.

765
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:04,600
Yeah.

766
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,080
Bandit.

767
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,320
Yes.

768
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,320
Which is also a great name for a dog.

769
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,200
It is.

770
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:14,920
And Blue, look, Bluey, uh, my daughter wants to watch Bluey 24 seven.

771
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,560
It just has a hold on kids.

772
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,960
And it is good.

773
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,400
Like it is better than a lot of stuff for that age.

774
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,320
So I give my daughter credit for liking something that is quality.

775
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:33,200
Somebody we know said that their similar age kid is into Paw Patrol and that's

776
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,360
all they want to watch.

777
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,200
And this person said, thank you.

778
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,840
You should be very thankful that your daughter is into Bluey and Paw Patrol.

779
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,600
It's just history, right?

780
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,280
Cause I'm sure you and I just wanted to watch Ninja Turtles.

781
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:48,640
Yeah.

782
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,800
But I would say Bluey is probably a more consistent show than Ninja Turtles.

783
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,360
Yeah, I would, yeah, I would, I would think so.

784
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,800
We did try, I have tried a few times on different screens, trying to get

785
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,320
Garfield to watch Bluey cause there are videos online of dogs loving Bluey.

786
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:09,640
I think because the, the colors, the gradient, I think they pop for them.

787
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,680
Yeah.

788
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:18,960
But our dog, Edwin does not care about television, but my parents' dog loves

789
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,640
television to some degree, but hates when an animal is on the screen.

790
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,000
Their dog, if they, if, if my parents' dog sees a cartoon dog on TV, he

791
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,720
will lose his mind barking.

792
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,040
I've never seen anything like it.

793
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,240
I've never seen anything like it.

794
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:41,360
You cannot watch Lady and the Tramp on Disney Plus, the animated version, or

795
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,680
else my parents' dog will go insane barking.

796
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,600
Just seeing it.

797
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,280
Seeing it.

798
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:45,920
Wow.

799
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,720
Thinks that's a real dog.

800
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,480
And I was like, does this dog have the best vision of any dog in America?

801
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,120
Like that's so wild.

802
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,560
I get it.

803
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,680
Maybe if it's a live action dog on a big HD screen.

804
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,640
Sure.

805
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,480
Maybe he thinks a dog is in like a little box.

806
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:08,800
You know, a nice thing when, before Jane and I lived together, she said that

807
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,600
Garfield would occasionally perk up if she put the podcast on and hear my voice.

808
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,240
Oh, well that's nice.

809
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,400
And that was very sweet.

810
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:15,840
I thought.

811
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,800
Was she being serious though?

812
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,720
She was being serious.

813
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,040
Okay.

814
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,480
Come on.

815
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,120
She didn't make that up.

816
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:21,920
No.

817
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,560
I believe it.

818
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,160
I believe it.

819
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,160
I, you know, I just never have had a dog that likes podcasts.

820
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:27,880
I'll be honest.

821
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,520
A dog's not responding to podcasts.

822
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,080
I think it's purely my, because it was me.

823
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:33,760
Okay.

824
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,000
So it would be, it would be interesting to see.

825
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,040
Can we, I don't want, it's too, too, we're in too deep to test it out, but I

826
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,960
would love to test it.

827
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,720
Oh yeah, that's right.

828
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,400
You're already in the room.

829
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,400
He saw me.

830
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:49,160
I would love to do a test to see if Garfield could tell your voice and what

831
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,680
it means would Garfield like perk up and the tail start going or would it be just

832
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,200
like, what would be the sign that Garfield noticed at your voice?

833
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,960
Would he be panting?

834
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,720
I think he would just sit up or like, yeah, I think maybe some of that.

835
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,360
He pees on the phone to mark the territory.

836
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,440
Oh, don't get started on him being inside.

837
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,400
Like then they got older.

838
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,320
They just have accidents all the time.

839
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,000
Where, when was the last time he peed in here?

840
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,400
Uh, hours ago.

841
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,000
Oh, where I'm sitting.

842
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,000
No, you're not sitting there.

843
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,040
There is a puppy pad over in the kitchen.

844
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,320
Uh, our old dog has liver problem.

845
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,200
This is man, Scott really missed out today.

846
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,640
Uh, our old dog has liver problems, but we're not sure what they are.

847
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,680
And I don't think there's so serious, but,

848
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,840
Oh, you know, I forgot to tell you, uh, I, um, I was, cause you and Scott did a

849
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,760
post office when I was, we did.

850
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,200
Yes.

851
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,520
And I was like, Oh, I said to Jane, would it be funny if I just

852
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,960
respond to all the questions?

853
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,360
And I had forgotten.

854
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,520
She's like, Oh, that episode was a lot about kids.

855
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,760
And I was like, would it be funny if I just subbed in every question?

856
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,520
I just crossed out kid and wrote Jason.

857
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,600
Where do you take your Jason when he's having a fit?

858
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,280
When he's really crying, not for us, it's a hot dog stand or the ice cream

859
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,240
stand, you know, are you revealing that Jane still listens to all the episodes?

860
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,880
She didn't listen to all of them, but she did listen to that.

861
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,000
I think she was checking in, you know, while you were gone.

862
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:24,960
Yeah.

863
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,320
Okay.

864
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,720
So she just wanted to monitor it to make sure we were only saying good things.

865
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,080
Cause we were just trashing you while you were gone.

866
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:38,840
Oh, good bereave and getting roasted while on bereavement leave.

867
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,880
It wouldn't have been too insensitive.

868
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,480
Yeah.

869
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,160
Uh, no, I think we were nice.

870
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:43,600
I don't know.

871
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,920
Mostly nice.

872
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,080
I would think, yeah.

873
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,720
Maybe we talked about that warm Walnut, but other than that,

874
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,280
that's fine.

875
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,680
Look, look what happened in the last hundred years.

876
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,800
We have the Wright brothers in at the turn of the century, taking off and

877
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,560
basically a fabric and wood aircraft.

878
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:05,400
In 1969, we have, uh, lunar expeditions in the year 2004.

879
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:12,040
We have massive airplanes being built out of alloys and, uh, and graphite

880
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,400
and these, this big ship that air Airbus is building the new Boeing plane.

881
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,160
So in a hundred years from fabric and wood, we've come to, you know,

882
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,520
advanced metallurgy, uh, fuel use and propulsion in just a hundred years.

883
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,280
Imagine what a culture could accomplish in a thousand years or 10,000 years.

884
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,240
They just keep making the seats smaller and smaller.

885
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,760
This was a good documentary.

886
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,080
It could have used you in there to add like a little aside once in a while.

887
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:40,800
Yeah.

888
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,840
Just, just chiming in about like, and where do all the coupons go?

889
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,320
Now I got to get apps and you don't get dinner on these flights either.

890
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,280
Are you kidding me?

891
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,440
There's no breakfast.

892
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,320
There needs to be a meal service.

893
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,720
You have to pay extra for it.

894
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,600
Come on, Dan.

895
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,840
I'm not paying for an airplane sandwich.

896
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,640
Are you kidding me?

897
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,360
And then you take a drag off your cigarette and the ash falls and

898
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,640
burns your pants right off.

899
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,120
Well, I was going to say, and they hate that on airplanes.

900
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:06,880
Yeah.

901
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:12,880
Did you, I did learn, I think I started following a pilot on YouTube or TikTok.

902
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:19,680
The reason airplane bathrooms still have, uh, ashtrays is they're like, well,

903
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:25,840
we don't want you to smoke, but if you're going to, if someone's fucking around,

904
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:30,480
we'd least want them to put it out somewhere safely and not start a fire.

905
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,680
Really?

906
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,760
That's what I are.

907
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,160
And now certainly some of these planes are older.

908
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,760
What pilot are you file a following on YouTube?

909
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,360
I'll have to find, let me find it.

910
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,280
What kind of content does this pilot do?

911
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:47,080
There is a pilot who talks about like, Oh, what is, why do you have to be there

912
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,960
this early?

913
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,320
Like why, why is the plane sitting there?

914
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,880
But it still takes an hour to get on.

915
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,640
Well, we have to do this and this.

916
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,120
Is the pilot like kind of an influencer pilot?

917
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,560
Like is on TikTok as well?

918
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,960
Kind of an influencer pilot.

919
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,680
Is he on, he's on Instagram, TikTok.

920
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,840
Probably Twitter or X or whatever.

921
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:10,000
I'm guessing is the pilot on only fans as well.

922
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,560
It's not a naked pilot.

923
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,960
It's not a naked pilot.

924
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,600
It's not a standup.

925
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,080
That's a, have you encountered that?

926
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:18,440
Is that a standup?

927
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:23,000
You only fans has been sponsoring like standup tapings and trying to get people

928
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,480
on there because it essentially acts as Patreon.

929
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,160
So, right.

930
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,840
We may have to switch to only fans at a certain point if Patreon goes away.

931
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,400
If, if they ever, Oh my God.

932
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,360
There's porno anymore.

933
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,480
What's the name of this pilot?

934
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,440
I'm trying to find him.

935
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,720
There's multiple pilot that you follow.

936
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,320
No, just on if you search pilot YouTuber, we got, I forget the person's name, but

937
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:49,640
we, a few months ago, I suggested that no pilot would listen to podcast the ride.

938
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,040
I don't know why I just felt like too professional of a job to listen to our

939
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:58,440
nonsense, but we, a pilot did reach out and say that they listen to podcast the

940
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:58,840
ride.

941
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,960
So we do have a pilot in our audience.

942
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:01,520
Okay.

943
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,960
So I'm going to shout out to that pilot and all the pilots out there that

944
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,240
listened to podcast the ride.

945
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:06,720
Yeah.

946
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,080
Um, and let us know if you have some sort of a social media presence, um, um,

947
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,040
Instagram, only fans, whatever it is.

948
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,320
Uh, and then Jason will follow you.

949
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,480
I will make that pledge right now.

950
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,400
You tell me if that's wrong, that if we have a pilot in our audience and they are

951
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,200
on social media, you Jason Sheridan will follow them.

952
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,960
Uh, pro yeah, I probably will.

953
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:31,440
I mean, my subscriptions on YouTube are just out of control.

954
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:36,240
Like obviously a lot of theme park content, ordinary adventures, expedition,

955
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,800
theme park, right?

956
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,520
So Cal, Hoennson parks.

957
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,400
And then like pilot Pete or something.

958
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,800
I, a lot of, uh, old wrestling stuff.

959
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,000
Jeremy the pilot.

960
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,240
Yeah.

961
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:55,000
But I can't even like scroll any Silvio, the pilot to the pilot.

962
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:55,800
Oh, thank you.

963
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,400
Captain Steve.

964
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,560
That's S-T-E-E-V-E.

965
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,040
S-T-E-E-E-V?

966
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,680
No, S-T-E-E-V-E.

967
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,320
Captain Steve.

968
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,160
Can I take a look at him?

969
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:08,840
Sure.

970
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,200
Well, how old do you think he is?

971
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,280
Oh, he's older.

972
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,320
I would say in his forties or fifties.

973
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,160
No, that's, that's not that old.

974
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,320
I guess I don't know how old everyone.

975
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,800
I still think I'm like 25.

976
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,120
Uh, you know,

977
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,560
you are not, I'm just a little guy.

978
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,640
Oh, captain Steve.

979
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:28,840
Yeah.

980
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,080
Maybe captain Steve is in his fifties.

981
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:31,920
I'm not sure.

982
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,320
Um, okay.

983
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,880
So you, this is great.

984
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,640
I did not know you follow this.

985
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,920
I, this guy is very successful.

986
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:45,040
He's got like 360,000 subscribers and he's got like classic YouTube

987
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:50,200
thumbnail where he's like putting his hand on his chin thinking, and then

988
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,000
it'll say smoke in the cabin with an exclamation point.

989
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,000
And he's kind of making a thinking face.

990
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,040
Wow.

991
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,640
This is good.

992
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,000
I got to follow this guy.

993
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,760
I kudos to you for final following, finding this guy.

994
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,960
This is like an account.

995
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,080
Like I don't even watch a lot of the videos.

996
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,400
He just does so many shorts.

997
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,400
Is there anything where like, it's a little bit like, um, a trashier

998
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,960
thumbnail where it's like doodoo on the plane and captain Steve is

999
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,320
like holding his nose?

1000
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,160
Uh, yeah, potentially.

1001
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,960
PP, like PP on the floor.

1002
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,360
And he's like looking at the floor.

1003
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,680
Like he's kind of got his hands in the air.

1004
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,200
Like I made PP on the floor.

1005
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,800
There's one thumbnail where it says don't open the exit door.

1006
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,800
Three exclamation points that he's holding his head to keep it from

1007
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,560
not exploding like Dan Aykroyd puked on grandma and he's like holding

1008
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,560
his tummy, like he's sick to his stomach.

1009
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,840
I, uh, I want you to do stuff like this.

1010
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:53,240
I'll tell you my, my goofiest plane moment.

1011
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,400
I feel like I was, I was getting on a plane.

1012
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,560
I was flying, I was traveling alone.

1013
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:07,920
Um, someone had like a coffee bean or Starbucks, like frappuccino sort of thing.

1014
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,240
Yeah.

1015
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:17,680
They put it in the pocket of the chair and I like nailed it.

1016
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,360
With my like quad or my, you know, uh,

1017
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,840
Oh, as you were walking down the road.

1018
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,000
Yeah.

1019
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,240
Cause it's so narrow.

1020
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,200
Even back then.

1021
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,120
That is wild.

1022
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,160
I just think I nailed it with a messenger bag and I'm like, why would you?

1023
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,280
And I'm like, I'm really sorry.

1024
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,840
I, if you want to drink or snack, I'll, I'll pay for it.

1025
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,800
That was too nice of you to do that.

1026
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,560
That was a while.

1027
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:43,760
Well, people were loading in a person, put their coffee in the, did they

1028
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,320
forget about it in the little, I think they just, they must've forgot about

1029
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,480
have they ever been on a plane before?

1030
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:49,960
Yeah.

1031
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:57,080
I just, some people recline on a plane before we take off, which is not allowed,

1032
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,080
but I've seen it happen a couple of times.

1033
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:03,720
Well, my favorite is leaning forward, trying to get my bag under the seat in

1034
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:09,520
front of me and someone reclines and just nails me in the head, like you

1035
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,600
gotta and everything, like I said, those plants are so thin and shitty

1036
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,240
plastic nowadays, you can really get nailed.

1037
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,240
Have I said on the show, I'm anti recline?

1038
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,840
I never, yeah.

1039
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,240
Never do it recline.

1040
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,400
I never recline.

1041
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:23,960
Yeah.

1042
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:24,720
I feel it.

1043
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,040
Yeah.

1044
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,240
I feel there's two, there's not enough room to do it.

1045
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,640
I, it doesn't help me in any way.

1046
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:35,000
I have some of those travel pillows, you know, with bean bags or I think we had

1047
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,800
memory foam ones floating around.

1048
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,160
I don't, I don't like them.

1049
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:44,000
I, you know what, a DM us, uh, if you have a good pillow that actually

1050
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,120
can make someone sleep, because I agree with you.

1051
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,840
I've tried all the different pillows to sleep on a plane.

1052
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,640
It doesn't work.

1053
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,400
I just put it behind my bed, but it's the same as like balling up the

1054
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,320
sweatshirt and putting it behind my bed.

1055
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,600
I just pop-

1056
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,160
Behind your head, you're saying?

1057
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:57,520
Yeah.

1058
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,400
I just put it-

1059
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,160
Behind your bed.

1060
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,320
Oh, behind my head.

1061
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,120
You're pulling the seat, your bed, your sky bed.

1062
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:03,640
Yeah.

1063
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:09,840
My, no, I'm saying I just put some sort of fabric behind my head and like,

1064
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,480
leave, you know, put my head back or something like that.

1065
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,440
Um, but then those travel pillows are hard.

1066
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,320
If you have noise canceling over your head, it just gets so much shit on you.

1067
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:27,880
You know, I just popped two Xanax and go to like, uh, sleep.

1068
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,520
Yeah.

1069
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,240
Wow.

1070
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,960
I've only ever done one.

1071
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:31,760
Oh boy.

1072
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,040
Oh boy.

1073
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,400
Usually I'm doing half.

1074
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,240
Those 0.25s are really-

1075
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,280
Usually I'm doing half.

1076
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:37,920
A lot.

1077
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,520
Um, I don't want to blow on a breathalyzer.

1078
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,160
I don't want to get in trouble with the authorities.

1079
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,240
We have gotten through 10 minutes of this dumb special.

1080
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,920
Did you think where we're going to get through?

1081
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,760
No, no, no.

1082
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,320
I'm just, I think it's, I think we've been good.

1083
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:52,880
I mean, Mr.

1084
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,760
Ackroyd is very knowledgeable and I would love to talk to him.

1085
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,960
Uh, let's keep going for a little bit.

1086
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,760
This just, I mean, really all this means is that we've gotten through

1087
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:05,280
like one eighth of the special and we're going to have to go through more of it later.

1088
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,000
As well.

1089
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,440
And the planes of St.

1090
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,320
Augustine and we have reverse engineered that technology today.

1091
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,240
That's the theory.

1092
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,680
Why aren't we using it in our military?

1093
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,800
Why isn't it evident?

1094
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:22,440
Well, I think, uh, I, I, again, I, as far as military applications, uh, maybe

1095
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,160
they're, maybe they are being used already.

1096
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:29,600
I'm not sure that, uh, the U S military would want to play that card right now.

1097
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,480
So Dan is saying here.

1098
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,240
It's a big tangent about the big hopping the air force.

1099
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:35,560
Yeah.

1100
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,280
You've probably heard this and I shortened whatever clip we just watched

1101
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,840
because he goes on and on and on.

1102
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:45,960
Uh, the question that's posed to him is why haven't we seen this technology?

1103
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,800
If it's been, you know, harvested by the U S government or weapons manufacturers,

1104
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,640
we would have seen evidence that our vehicles have, you know, similar

1105
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:59,160
propulsion or something where they can go very fast, very slow or, or wherever

1106
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,840
underwater, that's another thing with a lot of these UAPs and Ackroyd is,

1107
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,720
uh, uh, suggesting that we have it.

1108
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,640
We just haven't needed to show it yet, which I don't know.

1109
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,240
It's interesting.

1110
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,040
Cause I guess I understand what he's saying.

1111
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:17,000
It would be pretty wild if, you know, like all of a sudden the blue

1112
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,680
angels show was a little bit upgraded.

1113
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,760
Uh, yeah, I mean, obviously stealth technology has been upgraded a lot.

1114
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:30,360
Um, it's been 20 years and there are sound weapons that they've used in

1115
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:37,240
battles and turned on protesters, uh, drones obviously, but, um, and the

1116
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,600
machine that keeps mosquitoes out of Disney world.

1117
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,880
Yeah, usually they got to use it for those bees, which we recently

1118
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:50,320
talked about the bees that chased your family out of, out of Disney world.

1119
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,160
Uh, um, but it's an interesting thing.

1120
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,320
Cause I, I don't, basically Dan is saying that he thinks like, we're

1121
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:00,320
not going to show it until we get attacked by aliens well, but then you

1122
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:08,680
see the folly of like, uh, the air force bought a new jet, uh, and it's full.

1123
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:14,360
It costs millions of dollars for one jet and the pilot can see, he has to rely

1124
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:20,160
on the camera feed and it's full of problems that it's so you, you, you see

1125
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,960
plenty of folly, but is that again, it's not a distraction that here's also

1126
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:30,560
though profit, the profit motive is very strong with our country and a lot of

1127
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,760
countries, so I feel like, okay.

1128
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,640
They're like, all right, we're sitting on alien tech.

1129
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,400
This is wild.

1130
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,520
You basically can go like a hundred times the speed of a commercial aircraft.

1131
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,840
This is amazing.

1132
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:51,080
We could sell super fast flights to anywhere in the world.

1133
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:55,240
Now this excites me even to talk about this because I don't like to fly.

1134
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:01,520
If it could go in, like, if we could go in a super alien tech commercial

1135
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:08,360
aircraft from here to Orlando in five minutes, in 10 minutes, I would be

1136
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,680
in Orlando every weekend.

1137
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,480
Yeah, I would be, I would be by co maybe by coastal.

1138
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,440
We can go that fast.

1139
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:20,920
So what I'm saying is I kind of think if they really had the technology, they

1140
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,560
would have tried to apply it to something where they could have made a ton of money.

1141
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,200
They're potentially bringing back the Concorde.

1142
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,680
Oh, is that right?

1143
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,960
London to New York in three and a half hours.

1144
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,440
What does it take in a commercial flight?

1145
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,000
What's that?

1146
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:34,320
What?

1147
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,240
How long does it take a regular commercial flight?

1148
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,680
Doesn't it take eight hours?

1149
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,160
Probably something like that.

1150
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:44,680
Um, but I think this is just the Concorde from LA or Burbank

1151
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,080
specifically to Orlando.

1152
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:50,040
Oh, in probably industry interference.

1153
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,520
Cause you're saying the reason, cause the Concorde is a very fast plane, right?

1154
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,160
Is that correct?

1155
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,000
It was very fast plane.

1156
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:57,360
Yeah.

1157
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:05,240
I think at that, you know, early nineties, it cost tens of thousands of dollars for a

1158
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:05,760
ticket.

1159
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,320
Okay.

1160
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:12,480
So I can imagine now, but it would be like very noisy over if it flew over like land

1161
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,360
by where people live.

1162
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:18,640
I don't really know, but I know it as a reference for a very fast airplane in like

1163
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,080
a movie or TV show, you know?

1164
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:21,520
Okay.

1165
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,760
Maybe that's your like thing.

1166
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,520
You're like the Concorde influence.

1167
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,680
I'm Mr. Concorde.

1168
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,600
Mr. Concorde.

1169
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,840
And you tell facts about the Concorde and you wear clothes like that.

1170
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,080
The flight attendants would wear on the Concorde or the pilots.

1171
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,720
Ooh, maybe.

1172
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,040
Yeah.

1173
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:41,480
Are you allowed to just wear a pilot's outfit on to an airplane?

1174
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,840
Like, oh, I just rolled down the bed.

1175
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,720
It was five AM.

1176
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,080
I wasn't, I wasn't looking at what I put on.

1177
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:48,400
I don't know.

1178
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,920
I just pulled stuff out of the closet.

1179
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,240
I think you have to be allowed to wear a pilot's outfit because other pilots sometimes

1180
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:54,960
fly.

1181
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,280
I've never flown on Halloween.

1182
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,080
Can you be like a ghost?

1183
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,800
Can you be a ghoulie or a zombie or something?

1184
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,320
What would be?

1185
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:05,480
Yeah.

1186
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,440
What would be the problem?

1187
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,400
I don't know.

1188
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,360
A nerving other.

1189
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:14,440
You mean like a Charlie Brown, some psycho, some psycho passenger got, grabbed the

1190
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:20,320
like in plane, like communication thing was singing God bless America.

1191
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:20,920
Yeah.

1192
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,920
But I think that was a plane of mostly people coming back from like CPAC or

1193
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,560
something.

1194
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,880
Do people get thrown off planes if like they're showing too much skin?

1195
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:36,360
Cause like, what if you're a sexy pilot and you're like, I don't know if I can

1196
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:40,280
pull that off, but like if you're a sexy, if you say it's Halloween and you're

1197
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:45,040
dressed up and you're going, you're flying to a Halloween party, you're going to

1198
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:49,880
flying to Miami and you're going right from the airport to the Halloween party

1199
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,480
at some club in Miami and you are a hot pilot.

1200
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,560
That's your costume.

1201
00:59:55,080 --> 01:00:00,280
So you're going to be wearing like a little like crop top pilot shirt and like

1202
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:00,880
a thong.

1203
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,720
Is that a thing where they're like, Hey, could you put that blanket on and maybe

1204
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,560
just change it in the bathroom when we're about the right.

1205
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,000
Would you get through security?

1206
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:09,960
That's a good question.

1207
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:10,760
I bet you wouldn't.

1208
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:11,440
I bet they would.

1209
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:11,640
Yeah.

1210
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,400
They would try to give you some pants or make you put pants on.

1211
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,720
I think that'd be a little suspicious.

1212
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,760
What if, okay.

1213
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,840
Well, how short do the shorts have to be before they would tell you, you got it.

1214
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,880
Get some longer shorts.

1215
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:29,160
Can you go through security cheeks out or does it have to be at minimum

1216
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,560
Lieutenant Dangle shorts?

1217
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,480
From Reno 9-1-1.

1218
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:32,720
Yeah.

1219
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,080
Yeah.

1220
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:33,680
Tom Lennon.

1221
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:39,760
I bet Dangle could go through no problem with the length because he has

1222
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,200
short shorts on, but he's okay.

1223
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,520
His butt isn't hanging out.

1224
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:42,920
Sure.

1225
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,240
But they are very short shorts, but I think that would be okay.

1226
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:46,640
Yeah.

1227
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:52,080
But I think, I think if you're, I think it's probably at the discretion of a

1228
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:57,280
few people at the checkpoints, if they determine there's too much cheek showing

1229
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,080
for you to be on the airline.

1230
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,560
It might read as suspicious.

1231
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:06,920
Um, it would be suspicious or it would be distracting for passengers.

1232
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,320
Distracting and weird.

1233
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:11,680
And so they just chalk it up to like, sir, please come with us.

1234
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,160
You know?

1235
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:18,400
I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet if you wore a pilot's outfit, you could be fine.

1236
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,760
I bet no one would bat an eye even on non holidays.

1237
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,480
You know, it's funny.

1238
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,000
And we've talked about this before is I was with my daughter at city

1239
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,320
walk, as I often do, it's just a couple hour trip, uh, total.

1240
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:35,040
And I always like seeing somebody clocking in at Walter's gate for work

1241
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,440
on transformers because they're wearing full military outfit, but it looks

1242
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,440
like a Halloween costume outfit.

1243
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:40,920
Yeah, yeah.

1244
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,400
But they dress, they dress up before coming into universal.

1245
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,920
Are you hoping to catch Yoshi clocking in for one of those?

1246
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,280
Yeah, that would be good.

1247
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,600
I I'm more just sort of like, I like the idea that they're out in the world

1248
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:59,320
before in full military outfit, but they're not necessarily service members.

1249
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,680
Can you expand that out?

1250
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:05,240
And it's like Marilyn Monroe clocking in Dracula and Frankenstein.

1251
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,960
I would like having a cigarette break.

1252
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,120
I did see Dracula.

1253
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,880
Oh, oh, I've talked, I talked about this on the show before.

1254
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:14,280
I saw Dracula on his break at city walk.

1255
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,440
Oh, really?

1256
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:19,960
Yes, because I clocked a guy I don't remember was a little while ago.

1257
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,640
I, I'm sure I said this on the show.

1258
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:27,000
I clocked an interesting looking guy and I was just like, that's kind of

1259
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,400
interesting, like, is he wearing makeup?

1260
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,880
I didn't put two and two together.

1261
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:34,680
I just like clocked that he looked odd and he was walking and I think he had

1262
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,080
a jacket on or whatever him and he was eating something.

1263
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,640
And then I was in the park 30 minutes later, an hour later,

1264
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,400
and he was in full Dracula outfit.

1265
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,360
And I was like, Oh, I saw Dracula having lunch at Johnny Rockets.

1266
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,120
Did he just have a polo and slacks?

1267
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,560
He had a jacket covering.

1268
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,400
Okay.

1269
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,720
So it wasn't for whatever reason, it didn't read to me like Dracula.

1270
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,400
I just, he looked unusual.

1271
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,520
Jane has tall, I think as well.

1272
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,040
Jane has talked about like when they would get a lunch break or just a

1273
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:09,480
break break in between shows, they would often go from backs.

1274
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:14,680
Their break room was kind of close to Walters gate and a water world.

1275
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:22,440
So like the frog choir from Harry Potter would like partially lose their

1276
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:26,320
outfits and go to the mini monster bubble tea.

1277
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:27,560
Yeah, that makes sense.

1278
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,280
Cause you just want to like, you're not going to, you don't want to be hounded.

1279
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,400
You know, you're not on the clock.

1280
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:31,680
Yeah.

1281
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:35,800
So yes, that's, yes, that's what absolutely happened with Dracula.

1282
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,360
I think I was texting you guys.

1283
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,840
I was texting somebody to go, Oh my God.

1284
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:39,200
Oh my God.

1285
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,480
I saw Dracula eating lunch.

1286
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,560
Holy shit.

1287
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,160
Dracula was eating at Johnny Rockets.

1288
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,440
Johnny Rockets also maybe on the chopping block and Jamba as well.

1289
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:53,800
Supposedly I got some insight Intel that city walk Hollywood that those two are

1290
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:59,920
going to close perhaps next because of the moving the security out from just

1291
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,200
outside the universal entrance to the entrance to city wall.

1292
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,160
I had yet there before.

1293
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,720
I don't want to go to the fuck, go through security before I go to a

1294
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:13,240
fucking mall, you know, I guess I, I like it having up before.

1295
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:19,080
I mean, I'm surprised it's taken this long, but I was like, I've been saying

1296
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,920
we're, we've been saying where we're going to dinner and anahitos for ages.

1297
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:23,680
Dinner and lunch.

1298
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:27,640
And I'm like, I don't, did you say dinner and lunch dinner or lunch?

1299
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:27,760
Okay.

1300
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,920
Uh, but I'm like, I don't want to go through a security corridor to

1301
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,120
go like get a fucking enchilada.

1302
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,240
You know, but when you're at the Disneyland resort all day and you're

1303
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,480
going at back and forth, it is easier.

1304
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:44,280
It is easier unless you go out grand California and you want to go somewhere.

1305
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:44,840
That's true.

1306
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,200
Go back in.

1307
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,680
But if you're just popping in and out California eventually, like you don't

1308
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,240
have to keep going back through security.

1309
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,320
It is nice in that way.

1310
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,000
Yeah.

1311
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:56,960
Um, but I got, I was up there and we're not, we're going to do an episode and I

1312
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,520
still don't know what shape the episode will take, but I was up there on the

1313
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:09,680
last day of billabong and I will tease to the listeners, the good listeners

1314
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,640
of club, not club three, the second gate, but you also, some of you are on

1315
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:19,960
club three, uh, I will tease to the Patreon that I did get something, get

1316
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:24,720
more than one thing because you were tweeting at a, was the universal high

1317
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,560
universal high.

1318
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,800
And I may have DMed with universal high a little bit.

1319
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,160
Cause they got some good stuff.

1320
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,080
They did get good stuff.

1321
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,160
I thought they got good stuff.

1322
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:33,240
Yeah.

1323
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,720
It's nothing compared to what I got.

1324
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,480
Let me ask, did you buy the wave pool?

1325
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,040
Oh, I wish.

1326
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,320
Did you buy the little wave pool?

1327
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,640
I tried to get the vacation mode neon sign and it was already sold.

1328
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:50,000
And we asked, we asked about the sign itself, the billabong sign itself,

1329
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
but they're going to destroy it.

1330
01:05:51,840 --> 01:06:00,960
Oh, but I got something that is so good and exciting.

1331
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,040
And you were, you went up there late.

1332
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:03,960
Well, right.

1333
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,640
And which was kind of my plan, not because I thought that would, this

1334
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:11,320
thing would be there just because I was like, Oh, maybe they'll slash prices

1335
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,040
even more.

1336
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:12,360
Yeah.

1337
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,520
So I do have things.

1338
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:18,080
I got some gifts for everybody from the billabong and I bought a

1339
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,520
piece of city walk history.

1340
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:25,680
You bought the neon sign that says the most beautiful pieces in the world.

1341
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,960
I would have bought that if they was available to me.

1342
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,920
A lot of things were sold, but there was this thing.

1343
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:37,120
And I will say this, a big thing, a big, this tall thing I bought for very

1344
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:41,000
cheap that I'm so excited about.

1345
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,400
I don't know what I'm going to do with it.

1346
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:46,920
I sent a DM to this universal account and they said, what?

1347
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,840
That wasn't there when I was there.

1348
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,880
I hope you got a cardboard Rob Dyrdek like Stanley.

1349
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,120
I think this is better than that.

1350
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,280
And I don't even want to all I'll say.

1351
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:02,600
Well, I'll say one more thing about it is that multiple people, as I was

1352
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:07,880
carrying this out, that didn't know where it was from went, Oh, that's cool.

1353
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,560
Wow.

1354
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,600
So people that did not understand, they did not know the city walk history.

1355
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,360
They did not know who I was.

1356
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,160
They thought this big thing that I got was cool.

1357
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,080
Usually that only happens when you're buying a Michael Ferrari.

1358
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:28,000
Well, that's often what happens when you're buying a $10,000 pointillism

1359
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:36,960
Harley Quinn, but I, I did, I had some fun with this thing too, around city walk.

1360
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:37,840
That's what I'll say.

1361
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:38,680
Oh boy.

1362
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,720
I know nothing dirty, nothing untoward.

1363
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:47,720
Um, but soon ish, I think we will figure out what this sort of city walk update

1364
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:52,640
episode is and I will reveal and you're going to wheel in something covering in

1365
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,600
a black sheet.

1366
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,600
I don't know how did that move?

1367
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,760
I'm going to have to feel like it moved.

1368
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,520
Well, it is a character.

1369
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,880
It could like, it looks, it looks like it could move.

1370
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,640
I'll say that.

1371
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,840
That's I said too much.

1372
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:11,160
I've already said too much, but yes, we will be doing, I know people.

1373
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:12,440
People want it.

1374
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:15,640
People want us to weigh in on what's happening at city walk, but they do.

1375
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:20,560
I, well, look, you mentioned gifts for everyone and this is your birthday shot.

1376
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,800
It wouldn't be a birthday without a birthday gift.

1377
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:23,560
Oh my God.

1378
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:24,000
Really?

1379
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:24,680
Already?

1380
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,120
So, wow.

1381
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,240
We have another two hours before.

1382
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:28,600
Oh my God.

1383
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,120
It's a photo.

1384
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,680
You got me, of course, a Chuck-O photo for Christmas.

1385
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,920
And I believe, is this another photo of Chuck-O?

1386
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,560
It is, it's even better.

1387
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,600
Uh, uh, it is a photo.

1388
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,600
It's a replica.

1389
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,120
Okay.

1390
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:44,920
That's okay.

1391
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:51,080
Uh, a replica photo of Paul Winchell and his two ventriloquist dummies, uh,

1392
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:55,440
Jerry Mahoney that everyone, the name that everyone knows and knucklehead Smith.

1393
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:59,720
Uh, and they are both, or all three of them are looking up toward the sky,

1394
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:04,160
singing, uh, possibly, and it's got a Paul Winchell signature on it.

1395
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:04,600
Wow.

1396
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,600
This is fantastic.

1397
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,520
Thank you very much.

1398
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:10,840
Can I ask where you might purchase, uh, an item like this?

1399
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:11,800
Oh, eBay.

1400
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:12,720
Oh, it's on eBay.

1401
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,040
Okay.

1402
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:13,280
Yeah.

1403
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:16,240
There's a lot of photo stuff on eBay.

1404
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,960
Now I, I did, I do have to still send you.

1405
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,280
I was watching 2 AM last night.

1406
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,120
I was watching some Paul Winchell clips with Jerry Mahoney and

1407
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,000
knucklehead Smith.

1408
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,560
And there was an element, excuse me.

1409
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:28,960
What'd you say?

1410
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:30,800
Knucklehead Smith.

1411
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:31,520
Thank you.

1412
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,640
I thought you said Smith.

1413
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:33,320
I did not.

1414
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,080
I just want to make sure.

1415
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:34,560
Okay.

1416
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:38,000
Uh, and there is an element that I didn't know about.

1417
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:43,680
Uh, it mostly there was like seen like one late night appearance, but they

1418
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:49,120
went to a kid show at some point and there's an element of these dummies.

1419
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:55,120
I don't quite know that I've seen the execution of this element before.

1420
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,880
Well, he was an innovator.

1421
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,720
I'll share, share some of these.

1422
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:02,560
So I was watching just to make sure like they called him the most

1423
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,320
racist ventriloquist alive.

1424
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:08,120
That was not the case because we're very wholesome segments.

1425
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:08,640
Yeah.

1426
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,200
Very goofy segments.

1427
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,760
So, yeah, so far.

1428
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:12,000
Yeah.

1429
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,280
No, I haven't found anything awful about Paul Winchell yet.

1430
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:14,840
Yeah.

1431
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,840
So fingers crossed fingers crossed.

1432
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:18,720
So, okay.

1433
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:22,480
Let's look, let's do a little bit more here and then we'll call it

1434
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,120
on the UFO UAP Dan Aykroyd.

1435
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:26,960
I mean, obviously it's going to be more accurate.

1436
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,080
There's there's certainly a blues brothers episode in our

1437
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,240
future at a certain point.

1438
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,720
Um, so.

1439
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,080
Oh, cause we never did the in park show.

1440
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,880
There's still the in park show to talk about.

1441
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:38,360
Yep.

1442
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:39,960
And it's just a lot.

1443
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:43,480
Um, and there's hopefully more ghostbusters.

1444
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:55,400
When we look at alien abduction, I mean, the idea of a human being being taken

1445
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,560
and having an implant inserted into their body, um, I often think of how

1446
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,280
biologists, um, how we tag whales.

1447
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,640
You know, we put a chip on a whale and we can track them via satellite.

1448
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:11,080
And also how, you know, we go into a frog's pond and we pull out the frog

1449
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,840
and we spread it out on the table.

1450
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,160
Remember biology class?

1451
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:14,840
We used to do this.

1452
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:19,920
And editing is really, they found a frog autopsy video and are now showing

1453
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,960
us, um, and another life form in another world.

1454
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:27,280
I think it's really a sign of violence.

1455
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,200
We can go get a frog.

1456
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,880
There's gotta be a frog place in Burbank.

1457
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,520
I mean, I think it's a sign that civilization is coming to earth and doing

1458
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:38,360
the same to us, putting computer chip implants on us to track us, know what we

1459
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:42,840
are, study our species, do a little bit of biological experimentation.

1460
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:50,320
I mean, I know for us, but from their perspective, do you really think that

1461
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,440
they're being violent?

1462
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:56,120
Well, again, I have to go back to some of them might be here for good purposes,

1463
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,960
interested in perhaps helping mankind.

1464
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:03,800
When he says some of what I like about Akroyd too, is that he, I think he

1465
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:09,120
envisions a world of many different types of beings visiting us because some of

1466
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,680
them are, are, are happy to be here and they're trying to help.

1467
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,200
And some of them are here for evil.

1468
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:20,960
So he's, he, you can see his creative brain imagining this, like very, uh,

1469
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,880
detailed world of all these different types of travelers here, which I, I mean,

1470
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:31,080
I like, again, it's more fun that way versus it's just like the aliens from

1471
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:35,560
independence day that are scouting this place to gut it and destroy us.

1472
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,600
Well, that would be, I wonder if you attract that throughout movies.

1473
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:45,400
Cause obviously I feel like there was more sinister stuff and like the B

1474
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:52,480
movie, sci-fis of the fifties and sixties and then, uh, close encounters are

1475
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:53,440
benevolent.

1476
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:59,080
The ETS good in Mack and me is good of VT.

1477
01:12:59,080 --> 01:12:59,400
Yes.

1478
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,520
Botanical is the nineties.

1479
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:09,080
There was a lot of like bad aliens and that might that they touched on

1480
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:13,560
independence day of like, well, the cold war is over so we can finally come

1481
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,840
together for one common threat.

1482
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,720
You know, the first thing that, uh, that happens is the army is assembled and

1483
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:24,800
you know, guns are shot at the, at these, at these beings and at the ship.

1484
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:36,440
What's really funny about the music in general in this thing is that it's, this

1485
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:40,400
music is either like spooky UFO documentary music or it's like day spa

1486
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,000
music, like basically the same thing.

1487
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,560
Like you'd have a massage, like quote unquote world music.

1488
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,160
Yeah.

1489
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:50,680
But it's, and it's funny that he just plays it the whole time to give it like

1490
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:54,960
an eerie feeling because I also think that's like, you don't need to, it

1491
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,360
doesn't all need to be eerie.

1492
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,880
Some of this is sort of like, it could just be sort of mundane or matter of

1493
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,480
fact, you know what I'm saying?

1494
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:01,960
Yeah.

1495
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:05,200
It's just cause I guess the unknown, but you don't have to, I guess it's just

1496
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,240
two on the nose when you're putting this together.

1497
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,680
Why don't we have some fun music?

1498
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:09,240
Sure.

1499
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,600
Maybe some of these aliens are fun.

1500
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:11,840
Yeah.

1501
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:12,880
They're just coming here.

1502
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,760
They're taking a joy ride.

1503
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:18,400
There's some alien teens joy riding around the globe.

1504
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:23,760
I think I said that the, the graphic at that live show ages ago, take me to your

1505
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,240
dealer.

1506
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,800
Have you made a shirt of that?

1507
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,280
No, that's not, no, that's not a me thing.

1508
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,640
That's a long time.

1509
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,360
Like you should make a poster.

1510
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:34,720
Sure.

1511
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,840
You should just, so many people have made shirts of it.

1512
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:37,680
I bet you could do it.

1513
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,440
You could probably make a killing.

1514
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:39,680
Yeah.

1515
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:43,720
I don't know who has the trademark on take me to your dealer.

1516
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,040
There have been so many celebrities.

1517
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:52,720
And, you know, people like David Bowie and John Denver, many people who have been

1518
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:58,760
interested in UFOs, but also in the idea of going into space, would you train and

1519
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:03,920
go on the space shuttle yourself and conduct investigations into UFOs?

1520
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:10,480
And if you did that, and you took an oath that stated that if you did discover

1521
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,960
something out there, that you would not share it with the American public.

1522
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:18,720
And if you knew you had captured on videotape, actual UFOs from the space shuttle,

1523
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,280
would you break that oath and share the truth with the American public?

1524
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:31,440
That is the opposite of what they teach you to do in journalism school, which is as

1525
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:36,880
short, clear questions, don't ask a question that's longer than the answer would be.

1526
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:43,160
Would you, Dan Aykroyd, train for several months to become an astronaut and go into

1527
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:46,160
space and investigate aliens?

1528
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:50,960
And then if you saw the aliens, would you tell us, would you keep it a little secret

1529
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,840
from us? Would you not tell us?

1530
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,000
Would you not tell your friend David Serreira?

1531
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,920
That was like one of the questions where if you go to a movie screening where a

1532
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:05,680
director and actor is there and they open it up for a Q&A and people ask just

1533
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:09,240
insanely long questions that are mostly statements.

1534
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,360
Well, mostly statements and mostly about themselves.

1535
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,880
Like, that's what happens at the Q&A.

1536
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,760
Well, I, you know, first of all, I'm claustrophobic, so I doubt I'll go up into

1537
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:22,320
space. But if I were to go up into space, I wouldn't have to say, look, you know,

1538
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:27,360
what we see up there and what we find, you know, we're just going to, we're just

1539
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,400
going to have to throw out that law.

1540
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,120
There's a law.

1541
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:35,320
I also like this. I also like this question because this interviewer, David, is

1542
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,400
asking a question.

1543
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,800
He's imagining a world where Dan Aykroyd goes into space and becomes a space

1544
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,560
detective.

1545
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,520
Well, he says investigates.

1546
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:48,200
But he doesn't even know about the future that awaits with Blue Angels space

1547
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:48,520
flight.

1548
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,640
Blue Origin, you're saying?

1549
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:53,680
Uh, is that, oh, Blue Angels fly over the football stadiums.

1550
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:53,920
Yeah.

1551
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:55,720
Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos.

1552
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,800
Uh, Blue Or, oh my gosh.

1553
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,440
You want to take a Blue Angels jet into space.

1554
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,000
I just, you know, I like seeing them at the stock car races.

1555
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:10,360
Um, Blue Origin, SpaceX, you know, space tourism, the emerging field of space

1556
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,080
tourism.

1557
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:11,600
Right.

1558
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:17,200
I mean, there was talk of it back then, but I'm, I'm just liking that this guy

1559
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:22,000
is having a fantasy where Dan goes into space and spends a lot of time up there

1560
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:26,440
investigating aliens, which I just don't see how, what that would look like.

1561
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,640
I don't like the technologies.

1562
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,760
Dan was not going to live long enough to go to like a enterprise D scenario where

1563
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,880
he's like piloting a starship is what I'm saying.

1564
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:37,480
Yeah.

1565
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,720
So I just don't know.

1566
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,680
Will Katy Perry reveal the truth when she goes in that Blue Origin flight?

1567
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,560
Oh, who's going, there's a couple of people going.

1568
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,800
It's a, it's Bezos, his new wife, Lauren Sanchez.

1569
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:50,440
Is that her name?

1570
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:54,080
Laura Sanchez, uh, Katy Perry, and then somebody else.

1571
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,320
And I can't remember who it is.

1572
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,640
It was an interesting group of people though.

1573
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:03,960
Um, are they dishing out the money or are they like comped?

1574
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,360
They're famous enough to get comped.

1575
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:08,400
You've got to comp Katy Perry on Blue Origin is my feeling.

1576
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,880
Shatner, I don't think had to pay when he did Blue Origin.

1577
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,360
Shatner just went to Antarctica too.

1578
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,480
Lauren Wendy Sanchez.

1579
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,160
Lauren.

1580
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,240
Did I say Lauren first?

1581
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,200
I think so.

1582
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:21,560
And, and, um, Lana Del Rey's husband is Jeremy Dufresne.

1583
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,920
I don't know if we even determined what it was on the kids, uh, we are back

1584
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,160
kids from the future episode.

1585
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,800
Um, so.

1586
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,880
Jeremy Dufresne.

1587
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:40,080
Uh, primary credit Lana Del Rey's husband and he's feeding a

1588
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,480
gator in the first picture.

1589
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,040
Let me, um, let me just play this last chunk here.

1590
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,720
And again, there's so much more to get through.

1591
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:51,320
If this is an interesting topic to you, please, I implore you watch

1592
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:53,480
Dan Aykroyd unplugged on UFOs.

1593
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,440
It's all on YouTube.

1594
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,360
We'll post a link.

1595
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:00,720
It's on the neighborhood UFO watch YouTube channel, not often updated.

1596
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:05,120
So how do people respond to Dan Aykroyd when he talks to them on

1597
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,920
a personal level about UFOs?

1598
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:08,480
They come to me and ask me about it.

1599
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,560
And I basically lay out, you know, my thoughts on it.

1600
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:18,400
I'd say half the people that I speak to about this have either seen themselves,

1601
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:23,800
heard about it from a critical credible witness or are willing to, to accept.

1602
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:27,960
The other half totally not Harold Ramis, my good friend and collaborator

1603
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:33,760
does not believe, will not accept until, you know, proof, hard proof is presented.

1604
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,400
It's the Harold Ramis of Podcast the Rock.

1605
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,880
Something tangible.

1606
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:42,960
And so, uh, what I'm able to do is just open people's minds a little bit and,

1607
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,160
and let them think about it.

1608
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,800
And of course, the greatest proof are the kinds of tapes that now exist,

1609
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,360
the kind of videos that exist.

1610
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,400
Jason, you're a podcast.

1611
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,400
I'm the new podcast.

1612
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,560
I'm the new movie boy of some different.

1613
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:02,440
Things that have been exposed to me, there are, you know, tremendous,

1614
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,520
there's tremendous divisiveness in the planet.

1615
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:10,160
And, you know, perhaps this study and this, this understanding of things

1616
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:13,360
that are greater than we have accomplished technologically

1617
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:18,640
will lead us to a spiritual awakening, one that helps us

1618
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,640
respect other beings out there in the universe and other dimensions

1619
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:25,800
and also in our own four dimensions and here in the physical world that we live in.

1620
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:29,360
The sacredness of human life,

1621
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,680
the willingness to get along a little better, to relinquish materialism

1622
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:35,600
and territoriality in favor of a more

1623
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:42,200
comprehensive worldview, which in which we unite

1624
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:46,480
and we all feel the energy within us

1625
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:51,560
as as part of a part of a universal light.

1626
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,560
Honestly, pretty well said.

1627
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,520
Pretty well said.

1628
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,480
But by the way, Mike, to answer your question, the other passenger

1629
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,920
going up in Blue Origin, Gail King.

1630
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:04,520
Oh, OK. Gail King, Oprah's friend Gail.

1631
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:07,320
Katy Perry and Gail King will join Jeff Bezos,

1632
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,720
fiance Lauren Sanchez, a Blue Origin state

1633
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,640
space flight that's from the Associated Press.

1634
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:16,440
I like the idea. Now I realize I looked at you while Dan was talking

1635
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,360
and I'm like, you know, Dan is really making a lot of sense

1636
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,800
because if I'm analyzing about what is interesting to this,

1637
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,680
interesting about this to me, it's like it is like,

1638
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:28,800
oh, I want to like learn more secrets of the universe and why we're here

1639
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,760
and interdimensional stuff and multiverse.

1640
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,280
Like that's all confusing.

1641
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,160
But on some level, it kind of I don't know.

1642
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:40,880
It feels reassuring to me that like, you know, there's a lot more out there

1643
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,320
than this life we're living, which is a nice thing.

1644
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:45,880
I mean, it could be maybe not a comforting thing,

1645
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,640
but at some level, it could end up being a comforting thing

1646
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,600
to know that maybe we exist forever in some way.

1647
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:55,080
And Dan is kind of articulating some of that same sentiment.

1648
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,640
And I look over you and I'm like, what's Jason thinking about right now?

1649
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,480
What's he doing? And then after it was over,

1650
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:03,160
I realized you were just waiting to say Gail King's name.

1651
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:08,800
I think I was trying not to slip of the tongue and say Gail Gordon,

1652
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,040
because you I know you love him so much.

1653
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,600
I was sitting like kind of being moved by what Dan was saying

1654
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,840
and feeling like I was having my own thoughts about it.

1655
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,600
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, I think he's on to something here.

1656
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,080
And I'm like, oh, it seems like Jason may be upset about this.

1657
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,440
But you were just running over in your head.

1658
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,720
Gail King, Gail King, say Gail King.

1659
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:27,080
Don't say Gail Gordon.

1660
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,880
I often when I have to listen to something,

1661
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:35,520
I need to have something visual to sure like so I can focus on the listening.

1662
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,760
Yeah, I hear you. It was just funny.

1663
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,440
I didn't realize. And then I was like, oh, I get it.

1664
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:40,920
Gail King, Gail King.

1665
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,600
Gail King is the third name.

1666
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:46,480
So, yeah, Dan sums it up pretty well there, I think, on some level.

1667
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,200
That I think it plays into stuff.

1668
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:51,440
I like like Star Trek.

1669
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,360
It is fun to think about aliens.

1670
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,720
Different shot, different angle.

1671
01:22:55,720 --> 01:23:01,600
Not he was you could not tell if he was wearing his plaid shirt and vest.

1672
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,840
Well, it's just his head. Yeah, real close to his head.

1673
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,280
So that might have been filmed separately.

1674
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,960
It might. Yes, that's well, I don't know.

1675
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:10,320
Separately, maybe they did have two cameras on him.

1676
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:13,000
And then this guy just filmed himself in front of a green screen.

1677
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,200
The interviewer. I just met like later in the day, maybe.

1678
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,600
Well, yeah, maybe it's all cut together.

1679
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,480
So, yeah, I don't know.

1680
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:22,400
I don't you know, there's a lot of things I'm going to get out of my system,

1681
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:26,200
I guess, this month in regards to puppets.

1682
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:30,840
That's the Club 3 poll in case you're not on the Club 3 tier on the Patreon.

1683
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:35,280
The topic that's been voted on this month, I guess maybe it's come out already.

1684
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,120
I'm not sure how we're going to schedule these releases.

1685
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:41,400
But Mike gets all this puppet stuff out of his system.

1686
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:46,440
But to some degree, I've gotten UFO stuff out of my system talking about it here.

1687
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,680
I forgive me.

1688
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,680
And there's people that are much more knowledgeable about this

1689
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:52,080
and remember names and remember all the events.

1690
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,280
I'm a very novice.

1691
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,440
Yeah. UFO guy.

1692
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:00,400
But I like talking about aliens and puppets.

1693
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,600
Ironically, I feel like share

1694
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:08,040
something similar with you're trying to get to the human condition.

1695
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:10,320
You're trying to get to the human experience.

1696
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,120
Well, that's true.

1697
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:14,200
I mean, we'll talk or you've either heard my thoughts about puppets.

1698
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:19,440
I think puppets, puppets in some way are a mask

1699
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:22,160
that allows me to be more myself.

1700
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,680
I'll say that.

1701
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,120
Comedy, drama.

1702
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:30,640
But also human beings respond better, I think, to puppets than they do to humans.

1703
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,960
I'm getting giving up too much of the puppet philosophy on this episode.

1704
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,480
But my daughter doesn't like to listen to me, but boy, she likes to listen to Alf.

1705
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,080
Let me just say that.

1706
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:45,240
Alf had command so much more respect with her than I do.

1707
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,960
A child going into preschool and speaking,

1708
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:55,400
fawning over her best friend, Alf, in 2025 is just going to be very excited.

1709
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,600
She gets so excited when Alf shows up.

1710
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:02,400
Yeah, she just because we have an elf puppet, a new puppet,

1711
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,440
and she gets so excited with Alf.

1712
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:07,720
But yeah, dad can't tell her what to do, but Alf can.

1713
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:08,440
And you know what?

1714
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,440
If any of those other kids give her lip,

1715
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:11,960
she's kind of tall like her dad.

1716
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:14,360
She is tall, so she can put them in the ground.

1717
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:15,480
That's true.

1718
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:19,560
And you should also draw the parallel or draw the draw

1719
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:23,480
the mixing of UFOs and puppets with Alf, who's an alien.

1720
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,200
That's right. Right.

1721
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:28,360
So anyway, you've survived podcast the ride.

1722
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:32,240
My birthday shot, Dan Aykroyd unplugged on UFOs.

1723
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:38,400
So let us know if you've had any sort of interaction with,

1724
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,760
I guess, I mean, I would like to know with ghosts and like cryptids

1725
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:46,800
and like Bigfoot or something, but mostly UAPs, UFOs, aliens.

1726
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:51,320
I am interested if you have a picture, too, of like,

1727
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,520
I guess, a sighting, that would be cool.

1728
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:57,360
But generally, these videos are hard to see.

1729
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:04,080
Yeah. And hey, I, you know, where my mind went to,

1730
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:07,760
are you familiar with the Nevada long time?

1731
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:11,440
Business, Alien Jerky.

1732
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:13,200
Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1733
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:14,400
I stopped there. Yeah.

1734
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,240
They, the hotel you talking about?

1735
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,200
Yeah, they're still working on the hotel.

1736
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,040
Well, I don't buy it not too long ago.

1737
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,480
It's still under construction.

1738
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:25,240
But this there is obviously there's a lot of alien

1739
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:30,160
based souvenirs and stuff in Nevada due to Area 51.

1740
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:33,280
Right. And Alien Jerky, it's good jerky.

1741
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,280
You've had the jerky. I've had it.

1742
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,280
I didn't actually get the jerky. I've given it for Christmas.

1743
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,760
Really? You can buy it.

1744
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,720
They have an Amazon store front. Oh.

1745
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,120
I sent it back east.

1746
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:44,040
And they're doing an immersive hotel.

1747
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,000
They are building the UFO hotel.

1748
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,240
The UFO hotel is coming to Baker, California.

1749
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:50,680
It's in Baker, California.

1750
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:53,080
And I yes, I was like, that's an episode.

1751
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,200
Gio and I were talking about doing that as an episode

1752
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:59,720
when that is built, this UFO hotel on the way to Vegas. Sure.

1753
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,680
Yeah, there's going to be a lot of Vegas.

1754
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:06,680
They crossed out the UFO hotel attraction as being planned in Baker

1755
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,520
and replaced it with the UFO hotel.

1756
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,160
Attraction is under construction in Baker.

1757
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:15,160
Well, it was not done when I drove by it a couple of weeks ago. Yeah.

1758
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:18,360
So I signed up for email updates.

1759
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,480
So we'll keep everyone posted.

1760
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:23,240
There's that whole the universal thing is opening in August now.

1761
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:26,920
August 15th is the universal like their permanent horror

1762
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:29,320
night's maze out in Vegas.

1763
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:31,920
The Backstreet Boys are playing Sphere.

1764
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,120
Oh, my God. I forgot about that.

1765
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,440
I don't know if the dates stretch all the way out to that 15th in August,

1766
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:41,880
but I wouldn't mind going through those mazes

1767
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,520
and then seeing the Backstreet Boys at Sphere. Sure.

1768
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:47,920
And then the way home, you don't have to drive all four or five hours.

1769
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:52,160
You stay in a UFO, stay in a UFO, pick up some jerky to share with everyone.

1770
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:55,600
Yeah. And maybe then there's a little bit more UFO talk on Podcast the Ride.

1771
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,360
Yeah. We'll see.
