1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Warning, partner.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,740
This here episode may whisk you back to a rough and tumble time when there was nary

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,920
a podcast in sight.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,760
You may encounter Western rides that were never built, a big thunder movie that was never made,

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,640
and a plan involving Main Street that should probably never be attempted.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,560
SNL's Dennis McNicholas joins us for a rootin' and possibly tootin' tribute to Frontierland.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:52,520
And podcast this here ride.

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,640
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a theme park podcast hosted by three men who would gladly pay a

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,680
premium to drink bottled water dredge from the rivers of America.

12
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,360
I'm Scott Gardner joined by Mike Carlson.

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,360
Hello.

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,360
I am here.

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,360
Yes.

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,040
If they could, I wish that sad that Disney store is going away because I do feel like

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,440
that was the spot for niche like products like this for theme park fans, but they had

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,840
done such mass marketed, you know, Marvel stuff, Star Wars stuff.

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,880
They weren't really doing like dirty pirate water, dirty splash mountain water.

20
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,240
I know they wouldn't call it dirty, but you know what I'm saying.

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,240
Yeah.

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,800
That would have been the street terminology.

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,720
But yeah, you can't say that on the shelves.

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,160
Not for the normies.

25
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,160
Of course.

26
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,280
Even just like vials and they could like, like holy water type thing, like where you

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,880
just kind of bless yourself with the water of Pirates of the Caribbean for somebody in

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,040
the Midwest who doesn't get to the parks a lot.

29
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
Yeah.

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,080
It's just, it's a little, it's a little splash maybe to wake you up in the day.

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,880
It's like a cologne and it gives you the confidence that you'd been on one of these rides.

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,120
Cologne as a whole, that's another, I don't want to get us off on a tangent, but that's

33
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
a whole nother market.

34
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,360
They haven't even been smelling like these places.

35
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,480
Jason Sheridan, are you on board with this line of products?

36
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:07,200
I would have loved to have a bottle of Rivers of America water, which comes with a certificate

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,560
of authenticity and also Legionnaires disease.

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,600
Like, you get like three, you got it, you know, you got to get it Sunday.

39
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Of course, discovered in Philadelphia, discovered at a big Legion conference at an old hotel

40
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
in Philadelphia.

41
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,080
Is that what it is?

42
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,720
The Legionnaires equal, it was a Legion, what is a Legion conference?

43
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,320
It was a Legion, it's an American Legion.

44
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Really?

45
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
Like, yeah.

46
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,840
I didn't know that.

47
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,640
And they found it in the air conditioning system.

48
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
Wow.

49
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,040
And then they gifted the world a famous disease.

50
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,040
Yeah.

51
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,480
Man, hometown pride, I guess, for you for that.

52
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,040
Hometown pride for the Legionnaires disease.

53
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,800
Cream cheese, squirtle, and a great disease.

54
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,880
What neck of the woods year wise is that?

55
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,240
Because is Legionnaires disease a product of the era that the land today is tributing?

56
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,040
Um, eight seventies, I think.

57
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,440
So there was certainly like activity going on in the land.

58
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
Mm hmm.

59
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,000
You know, a lot of change, a lot of change going on.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,600
1870s, not 1970s?

61
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
No, 1970s.

62
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,640
Oh, Legionnaires disease isn't an old timey thing?

63
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,920
It hasn't been named that.

64
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,760
Well, now I'm going to I'm going to have to look into this.

65
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,760
I have no idea.

66
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,800
I'll check back in in about an hour.

67
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,760
Yeah, go down this rabbit hole.

68
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,160
Go do some separate research while we pull the wagons up to today's topic, which is frontier

69
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
land.

70
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,560
It's an episode all about frontier land and about frontier lands past, the frontier land

71
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,240
that never was, how it stands today, and the future, a future which is in a way in question.

72
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,400
Like, will there be a frontier land again?

73
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,000
Will new rides be built in the frontier lands we have?

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,880
This is all the stuff we're going to discuss.

75
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,760
Full deep dive and we're doing it with a fantastic guest.

76
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
So happy to have him.

77
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,080
He is an Emmy winning longtime writer for Saturday Night Live.

78
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,760
He is the current producer of Weekend Update and the writer director of the podcast Batman

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,800
the Audio Adventures, which is about to come out very soon on HBO Max.

80
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,560
Dennis McNicholas is here.

81
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
Hello.

82
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,640
Hi, thanks for having me, you guys.

83
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
Of course.

84
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,720
No, I wanted to do this for a while.

85
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,760
Oh, fantastic.

86
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,160
So happy you could.

87
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,680
Because full disclosure, I mean, you know, doing this podcast and kind of having ears

88
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,960
out for who is a theme park fan in the world of comedy.

89
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,280
It's having spoken to you to a big extent for a number of years now.

90
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,520
I can't, I'm not, I feel like you're one of the top theme park nerds in the comedy world,

91
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,520
I have to say.

92
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,040
I can't, it's hard for me to think of somebody with a vaster wealth of knowledge.

93
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,920
Well, you wouldn't probably want to meet that person, I'm suspecting because any more.

94
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,360
Well, actually, it's you guys that I admire because the one time I went to the park with

95
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:11,760
you guys, you know, I have been along with showbiz people before who got VIP treatment.

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,200
But like you guys were like operating on street level, like you were talking to cast members

97
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:24,120
and it was like, it really was like, it was Hucky Baron and Allie type stuff.

98
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,720
You guys were executing and I was all about it.

99
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,640
We went on the very first day of the Rise of the Resistance.

100
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,920
Rise of the Resistance, yeah, yeah, you were in this for that.

101
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Yes, indeed.

102
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,360
And I'm really glad I was because you guys took care of us.

103
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Yeah, I think it took seven or eight of us refreshing apps to get a ride on it.

104
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,840
But we ended up doing it because we had a man on the inside.

105
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,640
Like we would have gotten it, but not till like 9 p.m.

106
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,760
And we got there at 5 a.m. because we didn't know how it was going to work.

107
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,280
So yeah, it did take us to do it within any reasonable amount of time.

108
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,720
We did have our man on the inside.

109
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,480
There was some machinations.

110
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,840
Yeah, there was some standing around waiting, a lot of whispering, I feel like as well.

111
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,040
Like, are we going to get to do it?

112
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,600
Or maybe if we go over here, like there's a lot.

113
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,200
I'm not I didn't have a carton of cigarettes to exchange for it, but it felt like I did.

114
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,280
It felt like that was the deal I was making.

115
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,280
Like I slipped a prisoner a bunch of cigarettes and we got to ride Rise of the Resistance

116
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,760
earlier than we would have normally.

117
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,440
So I guess we're big in the Disneyland underground is what you've taught us.

118
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,280
Yeah, I love that, too, because that makes I sometimes I am worried we're like

119
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,920
because we're talking about the park and we get to go a lot.

120
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,280
We feel like we're elitists.

121
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,960
But that just that says we're not.

122
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,320
I don't think so at all.

123
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,120
I think you guys are operating.

124
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,120
You it was it was populist parks, but I'm kidding.

125
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,360
I think. Well, thank you.

126
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,080
I really that makes me feel good.

127
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,160
That makes me feel authentic, I guess.

128
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,240
Wow. Yeah, credibility.

129
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,240
Much appreciated. But like but as I was saying, Dennis, let's not, you know, undersell

130
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,720
your wealth of Disney knowledge, which I feel like if you have a I mean,

131
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,120
there's a thousand things you could have talked about on the show with us.

132
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,040
But it feels like your major in general is well, like, well, I mean,

133
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,000
there's frontier line and everything.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,200
But it also like you grew up in Florida.

135
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,320
You were in Disney World in the 70s a lot like like early.

136
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,720
The first 10 years of Disney World, I feel like is a passion area for you.

137
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,200
Yeah, I love it.

138
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,920
And I was there as a child, as a young child.

139
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,000
I I probably made it.

140
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,120
My first visit was probably in seventy five.

141
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,320
I was three and I probably probably went once or twice more before 1980.

142
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,480
And so dim memories and they did away with so much of that stuff.

143
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,520
You know, it's sort of it's Scott.

144
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,040
You and I have talked about how they they had real ambitions of being a cosmopolitan

145
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,880
adult retreat, you know, the vacation kingdom of the world.

146
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,680
Oh, yes. Your boats and your water skis.

147
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,760
Well, it's water skiing and yeah, the white dinner jacket,

148
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,240
carved prime rib at your table and all that stuff.

149
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,280
And they, you know, they figured out where what people were coming for.

150
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,840
And then the Eisner thing.

151
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,240
And you guys know more about this than I do, I'm sure.

152
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,520
But all of that lost sort of 70s leisure.

153
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,800
I absolutely love about the Florida property.

154
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,120
You look at those pictures is unbelievable.

155
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,280
It's so the brochures.

156
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,280
It's so many of the pictures from those brochures of that era are not families.

157
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,640
It's young fit couples that look like they've either just made love

158
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,680
or about to go pack up to go back to the room to make love.

159
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,120
No, no question.

160
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,800
You know, I was I was just at the Disneyland Hotel and I love that.

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,400
If you if you sneak back by the convention center and where steakhouse

162
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,760
the steakhouse is, they've got a big photo collage of the history

163
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,440
of the hotel and everything.

164
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,720
And yes, from the 60s, we my girlfriend and I focused on a one shot

165
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,960
that was two women and a man playing cards

166
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,160
and smoking cigarettes in a hotel room at the Disneyland Hotel.

167
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,960
And I mean, it looked nothing so much like an adventurous marriage.

168
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,120
It is like that, like in the old days, we've talked about this,

169
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,960
like, you know, it was date night at Disneyland,

170
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,400
which was like the high end adult crowd.

171
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,720
Like, I feel like they get these like once every so often they get it,

172
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,840
because even I think Pleasure Island, you would say, is the 90s version of that,

173
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,120
of like we need to get adults, we need to make this place cool.

174
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,320
It's obviously 90s cool and not like smoking a cigarette in the 1950s.

175
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,600
Cool, which is the ultimate cool.

176
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,880
But it is interesting.

177
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,040
And they haven't had it.

178
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,480
Disney Springs is the closest they've had for a while, where it's just like,

179
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,320
let's make a uniform shopping center for people.

180
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,640
But that's far less cool than any of the other things we were just talking about.

181
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,560
Well, that's what, you know, adults with disposable income like now,

182
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,560
they like gastropubs and Uniqlo.

183
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,840
That's true.

184
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,120
You're right. Change.

185
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,480
That's a good point.

186
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,080
So I guess they're on point.

187
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,360
They're catering to, yeah, the current.

188
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,600
But like, yeah, the days are gone of the giant

189
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,040
jello molds with grapes in them and with like like with like ranch dressing

190
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,880
for the jello molds.

191
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,080
That's kind of thing that just that way people ate in the 70s,

192
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,840
like high end 70s dining.

193
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,200
And it seemed like Disney World was front and center.

194
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,680
Another thing to bring up, Dennis, was while you're here,

195
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,440
you know, to give you a platform to do so, because we've talked about episodes

196
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,520
that you could do. And I like that you you proposed something that felt like

197
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,840
like on the more obscure and even for even for us.

198
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,800
And I want to give you the platform to say anything you want about it,

199
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,280
which is the Columbia Harbor House, the restaurant.

200
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,520
The Disney World, which is not to preclude a full episode that could come.

201
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,040
I absolutely will talk about the Columbia Harbor House.

202
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,760
And I can kind of bank it into the Frontierland conversation.

203
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,960
Oh, yeah, they're very close. Yeah.

204
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,960
Well, Columbia Harbor House is, for those who don't know, is a very large,

205
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,080
elaborately themed

206
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,840
chicken and seafood restaurant in Liberty Square,

207
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,200
just off of

208
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,720
the Haunted Mansion exit queue and all that stuff, right?

209
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,640
Right on the border of Liberty Square and Fantasyland.

210
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,880
And it's got so much real estate.

211
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,200
It's a counter service restaurant, but it's got like nine dining rooms.

212
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,600
And it is loaded with

213
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,000
nautical antiques of the sort that, you know, that in sometime in the 70s,

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,440
they just pulled a truck up to some place in Maine and just put every anchor

215
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,600
and ship's wheel that they could find in the place.

216
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,880
And it looks old.

217
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,360
Yeah. And they just piled it all in there.

218
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,200
And from what I can tell, it remains popular.

219
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,640
But to me, and this came up kind of recently when

220
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,760
when they opened the Skipper Canteen

221
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,000
for the table service restaurant in Adventureland.

222
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,720
Yes. And I, you know, I thought, oh, well, this is really interesting.

223
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,320
They're branching their rides out into restaurants.

224
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,000
And I immediately thought of Columbia Harbor House

225
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,080
because it's adjacent to the Haunted Mansion and it's ridiculously large

226
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,160
and could be easily outfitted as a table service restaurant

227
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,600
if they wanted to make a Haunted Mansion themed restaurant.

228
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,920
And, you know, they wouldn't have to change it much.

229
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,800
It's all old and 19th century and nautical.

230
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,160
And they've got the space for it and everything.

231
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,200
And this to bank it into the Frontierland discussion.

232
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,760
I was talking with a cast member around that time and saying,

233
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,080
you know, that it was a great idea to sort of expand rides into the restaurant

234
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,200
space and the more, you know, completely immersive

235
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,000
and an interactive type environments.

236
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,920
And they said, yes, there was a rumor

237
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,880
that there was going to be a Haunted Mansion restaurant amongst the cast members.

238
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,360
But it wasn't going to be Columbia Harbor House.

239
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:34,560
It was going to be on the back island behind Tom Sawyer's Island.

240
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,400
And you were going to take a water launch from the keelboats,

241
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,400
the defunct keelboat landing, which used to be able to take

242
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,120
little watercraft called the Mike Fink keelboats.

243
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,200
Oh, we know all about that.

244
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,080
Second day, we learned about Mike.

245
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,200
Very fire prone keelboats.

246
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Exactly. So the keelboat, the keelboat

247
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,960
dock remains completely functional from what it looks like.

248
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,760
And the rumor was you take a little launch from there to the back of

249
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,400
the four wilderness island or the Fort Langhorn Island.

250
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,360
And there would be a restaurant out there

251
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,880
and you'd have an interactive experience and so on and so forth.

252
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,480
I think that's probably never going to happen.

253
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,400
That doesn't sound like the sort of thing that they would, you know.

254
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,800
You know, volunteer for the trouble of. But right.

255
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,040
But the reason that fascinates me is that island is huge

256
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,520
and there's nothing on it except at the very front of it.

257
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,800
They've got the, you know, the replica fort and

258
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,280
I can't even picture the space here, Tiger.

259
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,440
There's a secret island in Disney World. Well, yes.

260
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,120
OK, so Tom Sawyer Island is really two islands.

261
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,800
There's the front island that has all the caves and the,

262
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,120
you know, the the windmills and so on and so forth.

263
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,040
Then you go at the back of it, you take a bridge out to a second island.

264
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,240
And at least in Florida, there's a fort, there's like a log

265
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,360
like for it, like Frontier Fort out there.

266
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,800
And there there used to be a companion, the same thing in in California.

267
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,640
And it's still out there, I think.

268
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,640
But you can't get out there anymore.

269
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,960
And I think the structure is condemned.

270
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,000
But but yeah, if you look at a map, there's this vast second island

271
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,440
behind Tom Sawyer Island in Florida.

272
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,800
And there's nothing on there.

273
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,240
It's just woods, woods, woods.

274
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,160
And, you know, over on on the left side of it, I guess they have some

275
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,880
showpieces for the

276
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,880
for the riverboat and stuff like like the burning cabin and stuff like that.

277
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
Oh, sure, sure.

278
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,000
There's a perpetually burning cabin that they used to point out, but

279
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,640
which which also brings up like all of the fun of

280
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,760
of Frontierland or all these things that are just do not fly anymore.

281
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,160
It's just exploding whiskey stills and, you know,

282
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,920
stagecoaches getting getting attacked by vengeful locals and things.

283
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,520
I mean, it's just it's it's it's hard to entertain around the subject.

284
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,040
It's yeah, it's a more it's like by its nature and subject matter,

285
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,840
a very like rough and tumble world for sure.

286
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,800
I mean, just to start to get into it a little bit,

287
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,120
because I was looking up like what was Frontierland like in 1955?

288
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,320
And I was struck by the like sort of like I mean,

289
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,600
it was the Wild West in a lot of ways.

290
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,440
It feels like it was like kind of undeveloped.

291
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,680
Like a lot of it was just field initially at Disneyland in 55.

292
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,840
Like some greenery a little, but like that wasn't the I feel like a lot of

293
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:03,000
original Disneyland was just here's a vaguely themed field or a non themed

294
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,320
field, and we just gave it a name, which is, I think, literally

295
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,760
what they did with the Matterhorn space before it was the Matterhorn.

296
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,640
And just like Holiday Hill, that's something right. Sure. Close enough.

297
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,920
But it feels to me like Frontierland initially was like was just kind of dirt.

298
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,040
And then it wasn't like a there eventually was the mind train through Nature's

299
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,960
Wonderland, which is a more organized ride.

300
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,800
But initially, what you had is just like mules and horses running around

301
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,320
who like I mean, of course, look, there's there's there's pony rides

302
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,560
a place we know this stuff, but it seems like very strongly notoriously

303
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,600
in early Frontierland.

304
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,160
It was just mules like peeing and shitting like constantly all day.

305
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,720
And they would just like get mad.

306
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,480
They would kind of buck guests off of them.

307
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,760
They would like just stop in the trail.

308
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,240
And their only solution to that was like a guy having to come out and yell.

309
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,640
And like so truly it was like a extremely like just like

310
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,320
all. Yeah, lawless is a great word.

311
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,480
Yeah, just in a land that kind of didn't work.

312
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,080
But if you're after a Wild West experience, then that's what it gave you.

313
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,280
I think in. Yeah.

314
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,320
Well, I think when we first started talking about this, I was like, yeah,

315
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,040
it is interesting to think about that.

316
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:26,600
Like Westerns at the time were like one of the biggest things in popular culture.

317
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,840
Like my dad was born in the early 50s and he's like, he still loves Frontierland

318
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,160
because it's like it's his equivalent of me walking into Marvel Superhero Island

319
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,240
and Islands of Adventure because it's just like, oh, well,

320
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,160
giant Adam Qbert art will just just imprint it on me at like 10 to 12.

321
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,200
And that just hits different, you know.

322
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,920
Right. It's it's just what hit me at the most impressionable age.

323
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:59,200
And, you know, the Davy Crockett stuff and all the cowboy shows and movies and all.

324
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,080
Like they were the Marvel movies of their time.

325
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,160
Extremely and like the most like extremely relevant right then.

326
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,920
Davy Crockett was brand new and a giant phenomenon on television.

327
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:16,480
And the song was a hit song, which kind of strikes me funny that that all in general,

328
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,720
that like Disney had chart topping hits with like Davy Crockett

329
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,160
and Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf.

330
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,840
These were these were big pop songs at the time.

331
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,480
It's hard to imagine something so like novelty being like a song,

332
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,280
like a nonsense song that the minions sing,

333
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,960
like if a minion speak song topped the charts, it would be a little strange.

334
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,240
Yeah, but like for sure, the Sherman Brothers are the equivalent of like Dua Lipa or

335
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,240
or whoever chains, whoever's popular chain smokers.

336
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah, they were probably genuinely chain smokers.

337
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,200
Not just in name like these fake chain smokers.

338
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,480
100 percent they were chain smoking. Yeah, for sure.

339
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,800
But that's a question, Dennis, is like, were you like like,

340
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,760
were you were you fond of of of Westerns or of any of this like Disney material

341
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,280
that kind of fueled the original frontier land?

342
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:18,000
You know, it's interesting because I my father was is a little older than that.

343
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,800
And likewise, huge Westerns fan as a kid.

344
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,480
He actually rode horses and stuff, so he was a little closer to it.

345
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,360
But like when he was before he was before he could ride real horses,

346
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,200
he would sit on a fence rail and pretend he was, you know, riding a horse.

347
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,200
And it was just like all he wanted was boots and six shooters, cap guns

348
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,640
and all that stuff.

349
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,440
And I'm not an expert on it, but from what I gather, like that was,

350
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,280
you know, like Mike TV and Willy Wonka

351
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,800
wearing the wearing the cowboy hat and all that watching his hop along

352
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,400
Cassidy or whatever it was.

353
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,560
I think it was that way until Star Wars,

354
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:09,640
which displaced cowboys and and because, for example, I was I was born in 72

355
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,080
and Star Wars is out in 77.

356
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,120
And so I was five years old and the cowboys never really took root.

357
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,120
I can remember some being very young and having some of that stuff pushed on me.

358
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,880
But basically, from the time Luke Skywalker on, there was just no Western

359
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,600
presence whatsoever.

360
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,400
But you had it hanging on and all that stuff.

361
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:38,160
And everyone I knew knew knew that song, the Davy Crockett theme song, for example.

362
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,440
I'm sure I never saw an episode of Davy Crockett as a kid.

363
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,960
But, you know, that was still around there enough.

364
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,960
And like and you still read

365
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,160
Tom Sawyer in, you know, that that was pushed on you at the school library

366
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,480
and stuff like that.

367
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,640
So like the stuff remained.

368
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,160
It didn't seem odd as a kid that we had this stuff.

369
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:05,560
And at least in Florida, you know, they opened Big Thunder in 79 or 80.

370
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,760
And then you still had

371
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,520
Country Bear, which is still there.

372
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,320
You had all the Tom Sawyer stuff.

373
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,920
And then the shooting gallery.

374
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:20,800
And, you know, it it felt it felt like it had a its thing going on.

375
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,480
You know, it whereas nowadays, like, I don't know.

376
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,960
The reason I wanted to talk about this today is that

377
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,400
it's all about the real estate in these parks for me

378
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,520
and what they can do with the space that they have.

379
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,160
And this is just a big chunk of real estate that they've got all over the world.

380
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,240
And they're just they have no properties that

381
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,720
no no outside properties that they grafted on.

382
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,440
And then the country bears and stuff that they have,

383
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,720
they're not interested seemingly in promoting.

384
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,800
So, you know, they've got an opportunity and, you know, I've got ideas.

385
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,320
Sure, sure.

386
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,520
Are you aware?

387
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,920
We'll cut this if you can't talk about it, but like

388
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,720
you have made attempts at trying to like revive,

389
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,960
like do something in the frontier land.

390
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,760
Yes. So.

391
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,920
A very long time ago now, I think probably 2007, it was around the time

392
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,640
it was before the pirate sequels had come out,

393
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,000
but it was after the Black Pearl had come out.

394
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,160
I went in and I because subsequently

395
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,640
I became a fan of like Spaghetti Westerns,

396
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,520
you know, as an older film watcher.

397
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,800
And, you know, for my money, like Good, the Bad, the Ugly is a comedy.

398
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,640
It's really funny.

399
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,040
And it's got a comedy set pieces just all throughout its length.

400
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,520
And I saw a cowboy

401
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,000
flavored Jack Sparrow adventure

402
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,080
set at Big Thunder Mountain.

403
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,240
And I happened to go into the Disney executive

404
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,840
that was meant to hear this pitch because he had a gigantic Italian

405
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,440
Once Upon a Time in the West, Sergio Leone poster there.

406
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,720
And Once Upon a Time in the West was actually

407
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,920
what I was basing it on to a large extent.

408
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,280
And so it was the perfect meeting to have.

409
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,040
It just worked out perfectly.

410
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,760
And I got to write the movie.

411
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,400
They bought the pitch and I get to write the movie.

412
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,520
And that was the end of the happy story, because subsequently

413
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,040
there was interest and things look good. But

414
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,800
the Lone Ranger and Jerry Bruckheimer came along.

415
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,160
The Lone Ranger, which, like as far as

416
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,080
Disney attempting to do anything Western today, didn't work then.

417
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,080
And now it is like the most canceled movie

418
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,160
on multiple levels continues to be cursed.

419
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520
Who knows what?

420
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,840
While we're recording this, two other things about it now are problematic.

421
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,240
I'm sure in the background have been tweeting unsavory things.

422
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,040
The only more cursed things are that Phantom of the Opera set

423
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,400
where people just kept getting heard at Universal Studios back lot.

424
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,560
And that Crow movie like those are the most

425
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,600
the other the Crow. Yeah.

426
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,320
I couldn't remember if it's the first one or the sequel.

427
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,440
But yeah, the Spider-Man musical. That one. Yeah. Well, yeah.

428
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,120
You know, from a certain angle, we were blessed with that.

429
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,000
But yeah, no, some people would describe it as curse.

430
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,760
Some people might still have hospital bills, might describe it as Spider-Man

431
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,080
themselves. Yeah.

432
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,120
Jason feels the injuries were worth it, actually, is what he's saying.

433
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,160
To get that song, to get that Letterman performance.

434
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,400
It's a reasonable sacrifices.

435
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,920
But so OK, so that came along and killed them.

436
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,840
But this is this is kind of wild that you're glad you're willing to talk about it.

437
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,760
I know that non-disclosure agreement end of it, but that you know,

438
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,320
you wrote some idea of what Big Thunder Mountain the movie is.

439
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,960
I did. I wrote the I did two drafts of a screenplay.

440
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,840
And believe it or not, this was before Iron Man.

441
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,320
And I wrote it for Robert Downey Jr. when he he.

442
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,360
Let me put it this way.

443
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,760
I pitched Robert Downey Jr. to the studio and they said, how about Vince Vaughn?

444
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,680
So that's where that's where everyone's career was at that time.

445
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,480
So but I had in mind, you know,

446
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,040
Robert Downey with a big push broom mustache and sort of being a

447
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,480
sarcastic, cantankerous, you know, rascally,

448
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,000
Jack Sparrow in a cowboy outfit, basically.

449
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,080
And we had some we had some cursed gold in there as well.

450
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,800
It was sort of a different deal.

451
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,600
But the magic gets loose and the dinosaur skeleton comes to life

452
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,160
from the from the ride and everything.

453
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,320
And yeah, yeah.

454
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,200
Oh, that's Skelet. Yeah. Oh, wow.

455
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,360
So that's like embedded in the mountain and then it starts running around.

456
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,760
Peels loose and and like it was like sort of an adobe dinosaur.

457
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,200
It still sort of had the rock and the and the petroglyphs

458
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,920
and all the Native American adornment and stuff.

459
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,840
And I think it could have really been a

460
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,520
it would have looked unlike any other dinosaurs on in the movies.

461
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,120
But but it had all that fun.

462
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,400
My pitch was they still make Westerns,

463
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,600
but they have completely stopped making this sort of Saturday

464
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,680
matinee Westerns, the family adventure.

465
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,520
You know, Indiana Jones, but but with Cowboys.

466
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,560
And I said, let's get back to that.

467
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,680
If they if the kids want to dress up as pirates now,

468
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,920
which was something I think all of us didn't have as a kid, people playing pirate.

469
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,400
That wasn't.

470
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,680
Oh, that's true. Yeah.

471
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,600
If they can manufacture that out of nowhere, then why not sort of,

472
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,240
you know, find something new in the Western mythos to dredge it?

473
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,160
I think it's I think it's possible.

474
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,120
And I think all the thrills are there from any of these kinds of movies.

475
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,680
And anyway, I had my shot and maybe it'll come back around someday.

476
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,640
But, you know, I had all the fun characters in there.

477
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,520
There was a young inventor and, you know,

478
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,200
there was an evil industrialist and all the fun stuff. It was good.

479
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,840
Can I ask if the goat was the goat of the dynamite?

480
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,480
What was 100 percent? We had the goat in there. It was great.

481
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,440
I'll tell you, since it'll probably never see the light of day.

482
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,320
The gag was the hero is tied up in the mines

483
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,560
and he goes his hands are tied behind his back with rope

484
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,400
and he goes over to the goat wanders in and he goes over to the goat

485
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,320
and tries to get the goat to chew his bonds off.

486
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,440
But when he turns around, the goats got the dynamite in his mouth.

487
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,560
And then he's like, no, no, no, no, no.

488
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:26,120
And the goat backs away and knocks over a lantern and lights the fuse.

489
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,480
And so then we've we've got.

490
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,760
Tia, that's fine. Yeah, that's great. Great.

491
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,400
Yes. The mischievous nature, the way that there is an air to that goat,

492
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,120
like it knows what it's doing or like you question is that, yes,

493
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,440
it's somehow aware. So you're kind of playing with it.

494
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,160
That's pretty great. Yeah.

495
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,120
So, you know, and then it just there's there was

496
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,200
in the Florida version, at least a big thunder.

497
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,080
You know, there's the town scene with the flash flood.

498
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:00,640
It's all more articulated, I feel like, in a narrative sense in Florida,

499
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,160
because and again, I'm not an expert on this, but I think they didn't

500
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,000
they grafted on to

501
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,800
mine train and through Nature's Wonderland in California.

502
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,280
Like a lot of the real estate. Yeah. Is is from that ride.

503
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,680
Yeah. The little town.

504
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,680
Yeah. They take it.

505
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,480
And this was part of the old ride. Right.

506
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,080
Is that I think that's yeah, I believe so.

507
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,560
Maybe might have even predated there being a ride that might be like

508
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,920
50s, even pre mine.

509
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:35,120
I see like Griffith Park mini train type thing.

510
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,480
Yeah, yeah.

511
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,800
It just those little flats.

512
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,880
And I think people were fond of it.

513
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,360
It made sense within within Big Thunder.

514
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,520
I guess, you know, one more thing to ask about the movie,

515
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,360
but because now some of this, I guess the creation of this would have been after.

516
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,840
I think at the time there was no Barnabas T.

517
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,920
Bullion, the the character who resembles Tony Baxter,

518
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,520
who is like the supposed owner of the did you in some other way define

519
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,760
who is who is doing the mining operation?

520
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,240
Like was that up to you?

521
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,240
Like you could have maybe defined it

522
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,680
pre off Barnabas. I well, that's interesting.

523
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,560
There was no other than the original Imagineers notes, which made

524
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,960
which made reference to

525
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,360
there being cursed gold in the mountain

526
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,480
and that the mountain thundered when you stole the gold.

527
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,080
That was all I knew, really.

528
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,880
And other than that, I went around the ride and wrote down names

529
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,920
and stuff that are used in the theming and stuff.

530
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,840
It just spun stories out of that.

531
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,800
So I actually don't even know about the I know that there have

532
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:51,240
subsequently been comics and and other things that have elaborated on Big Thunder.

533
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,680
But I got to be honest, I don't know what they are.

534
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,000
So, you know, if this is part of that, S.E.A. stuff or.

535
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,360
That's exactly it is. Yes.

536
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,880
Yeah. I you know, I should know and I don't all that stuff.

537
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,880
But I noticed you guys did a whole show on it,

538
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,440
which I'm looking forward to listening to.

539
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,960
We sure did. We broke it down.

540
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,160
We know too much now.

541
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,000
We know Barnabas and his friend Jason Chandler and

542
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,320
various I think like there's like parrots and monkeys that are members of sea.

543
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,400
It's not entirely human.

544
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,840
We know too much now.

545
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,760
Yeah, it's the most it's one of the most impenetrable podcasts we've done.

546
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,120
That does. Have you guys had the opportunity to go to the skipper canteen in Florida?

547
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:43,280
Because that, you know, that that seems like ground zero for that mythos.

548
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:48,000
I don't know much about it, but it that whole thing looks like it's

549
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,360
was constructed to tell that story. So, you know.

550
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,040
Yeah, it has like one.

551
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,560
It has a room specifically for sea.

552
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,680
And it is not I was really building up in my mind about how awesome I think it's cool.

553
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,280
But I was building it up as some like amazing thing with like secret rooms,

554
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
like a secret room.

555
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,120
And then there's like a glass case with Fez's in them.

556
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,400
And that's kind of the biggest, coolest part of it.

557
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,400
We're like, oh, I know that's Dr.

558
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,800
Albert Falls is fed.

559
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,040
And you're like, very nice.

560
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,480
So it's cool.

561
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,480
But yeah, it's not Magellan's.

562
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,680
I think in Tokyo, Disney Sea is the much more elaborate, cool version of like their hangout.

563
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,960
So I think that's the place where you might the promise might be realized.

564
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,360
Interesting. Yeah, I get.

565
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,600
Yeah. Like so you're starting to see you're aware of sea.

566
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,240
And it is this mythology that's meant to tie together, not just, you know,

567
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,960
like there's frontier land rides in there, but a lot of adventure land, obviously.

568
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,600
And, you know, even I think in the eventual show of it,

569
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,360
it seems like the Matterhorn will be connected to it.

570
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,920
So it's a way to tie together anything that's sort of like older adventure based

571
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,160
or whatever. But were you like in your head, was your attempt at a big thunder movie

572
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,840
like because you've talked about it, like maybe like wanting to light up

573
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,520
all of frontier land in terms of relevance by by starting there.

574
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,440
Was it possible to you that then it like there's like that you're building

575
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,560
some kind of frontier land expanded universe that ties in even the restaurants

576
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,720
or the Golden Horseshoe or somehow the bears are part of it, too,

577
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,720
if the if the bears could possibly be part of the same mythology

578
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,280
as Robert Downey Jr., the cocksure cowboy.

579
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,960
Absolutely. I had, you know, an idea that

580
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,480
for making the big thunder thing into a trilogy

581
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,120
that actually was going to culminate in

582
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,280
a subject that you guys might know about.

583
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,840
It was going to be a play on the Winchester Mansion.

584
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,520
Yes. Yeah. The the the elaborately built,

585
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,320
the insanely built mansion that was made to house the ghosts of

586
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,200
those who were killed by the Winchester rifles.

587
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,240
And it was going to be sort of

588
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,240
I was going to go through the weird west and sort of that was going to be it,

589
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,520
because that's that's sort of my bag.

590
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,120
But it was going to be the folk tales,

591
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:25,560
ghost stories and basically all the the folklore of the west,

592
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,680
the campfire stories, tall tales, which they've already got.

593
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,120
You know, in Florida, they got the tall tale cafe,

594
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,000
pick a spill tall tale cafe,

595
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,960
which I had the opportunity to have a closer look at recently.

596
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,120
And they've got a lot of theming in that they've got, you know, little

597
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,200
the ideas that all of Pecos Bill's

598
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,960
tall tale friends gifted him

599
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,760
mementos to decorate the cafe.

600
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,360
So you've got a giant axe from Paul Banyan that's like

601
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,880
signed to my friend Pecos Bill on the handle and stuff like that.

602
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,520
But but it had like Zorro and then even things like Annie Oakley.

603
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,320
And it really ran the gamut of all the sort of

604
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,160
colorful characters of the West.

605
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,080
And, you know, you definitely could put something together for that.

606
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,960
The problem is just the idea of taming the frontier

607
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,280
is pretty gnarly and in all respects.

608
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,640
Yeah, there's there's just not it's like neither taming the land

609
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,800
nor subjugating the the locals, you know, are things we

610
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,880
we care to celebrate anymore.

611
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,840
So it's problematic.

612
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,920
That's why I thought you go to stories and folklore and

613
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,320
and we all know ghost stories and campfires.

614
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,400
Oh, sure.

615
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,840
So if it's it's more the Wild West of the imagination and this exaggerated

616
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:04,040
like the the tales they told, not the real people who were probably

617
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,440
not probably who were there.

618
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,040
There was bad, bad things, but things you don't want to celebrate work.

619
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,000
Yeah, it wasn't like Deadwood meets Big Thunder Mountain.

620
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,800
Yeah, the pitch, the blood Meridian, the no country for old men.

621
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,280
Disneyland, Disneyland's no country for old men.

622
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,440
The Golden Corral is full of prostitutes.

623
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,440
There's just no way around it.

624
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,480
It has to be the case.

625
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,720
It's funny, you say the Winchester Mystery House, because that's

626
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,560
it seems like you were ahead of that, too, because then isn't it?

627
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,880
Correct me if I'm wrong, everyone.

628
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,000
Mystic Manor is based sort of on the Winchester Mystery House.

629
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,080
Well, they believe that the Disney Dish podcast has been discussing it recently

630
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,120
because like Walt and I think it's Kenny Anderson, one of the early

631
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:52,400
imagineers went to the Winchester Mystery House and just kept taking tours all day

632
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,840
once just as they were coming up with how to do a haunted house.

633
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,880
So like and first off, how do people behave in this environment,

634
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,160
in like a walking tour?

635
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,320
And then also, how do they react to like ghost stories and hauntings

636
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,440
and that sort of thing?

637
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,800
So it's been alive in the company for many, many years.

638
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,160
It's been I guess it's probably influenced every haunted house

639
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,040
they've made, haunted mansion and Mystic Manor and everything like that.

640
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,920
Yeah, I think I think it was very early,

641
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,600
you know, roadside attraction, kind of like

642
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,440
ghost story roadside attraction.

643
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,040
Sure, sure, sure.

644
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,200
Well, it seems like that's where because like some of it in talking about

645
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,400
Frontierland, it like,

646
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:42,040
yeah, where it stands currently is like it's it's all sort of the lead up

647
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,080
to Big Thunder Mountain.

648
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,120
That's in all of them, at least in the first four part

649
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,640
in the American ones in Tokyo and Paris.

650
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,080
And then it's like and we're not like

651
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,440
it's all been light in new attractions for sure since about 1980 or even before.

652
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,880
I mean, Frontierland's always been sort of an attraction light area.

653
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,720
It's more about but vibe.

654
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,520
But like, yeah, they've basically they've kind of like stopped doing them.

655
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,320
Like Shanghai does not have one.

656
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,280
And then Hong Kong Disneyland opened without one.

657
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,240
And now there's kind of kind of an equivalent, which is the whole area

658
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,800
is called Grizzly Gulch, I believe.

659
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,200
OK, which is where this it's and I don't have the name ready to go.

660
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,840
But there what is their grizzly ride that's sort of like Big Thunder?

661
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
Oh, right. Right.

662
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,520
It's called the big grizzly runaway mine cars.

663
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,520
So pretty pretty good at spelling out what it does.

664
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,720
And then Paris has the Frontierland,

665
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,480
which is the Thunder Mesa town that ties together the story of Phantom Manor

666
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,320
and all. And they also have the Legends of the Wild West show

667
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,760
has been going since the mid 90s there.

668
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,800
So it's interesting to see how the Wild West is presented at the Disney parks.

669
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:09,120
Internationally, yeah, it's kind of like catered to like the place

670
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,200
where they're building the park.

671
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,520
And what is the awareness of even any of that?

672
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:17,760
Like in Tokyo, there's the thing that they don't really know the word frontier.

673
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,840
That doesn't mean anything to them.

674
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,640
So it became Western land.

675
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,720
It's completely changed there.

676
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,600
But I guess I guess what I'm getting at is like it's like for there to be anything

677
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,920
else in this area for Disney that they have to go more fantastical.

678
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,640
It's got to be here's a weird like mine car situation

679
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,800
where bears are causing havoc to your right.

680
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,120
Or is is Mystic Manor in their version of Frontierland or is that its own?

681
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,760
I don't think I know what land it's in.

682
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,720
No, it is not. OK, OK.

683
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,640
I don't think it is.

684
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,720
Which is funny, because in Tokyo, you can buy merchandise

685
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,080
that is just like you stepped in the 1950s as far as Frontierland is concerned.

686
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,840
You can buy like what Tomahawks and things.

687
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,160
Yes, honestly, like I think you could buy like maybe a headdress.

688
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,880
Like that could be totally wrong.

689
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,960
But you could buy like little figurines just as if they were from the 1950s.

690
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,800
Like it's totally like they just haven't.

691
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,160
The memo hasn't gotten there yet.

692
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,360
That like you should probably not do this.

693
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:20,200
Well, even into the 90s, I bought like like fake flintlock pistols

694
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,960
or like six shooters like in Frontierland.

695
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,080
And they're like, it's crazy now to think about like carrying those back

696
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,280
in a duffel bag on a plane.

697
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,800
But I think I think even then my parents were like, put that in the checklist.

698
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,440
Don't carry it on the plane.

699
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,360
But while we were talking about that, you know,

700
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,120
I had been thinking about researching for this episode.

701
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,720
I was like, what was my reference for Westerns growing up?

702
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,240
Like because I had a spaghetti Western phase two in college

703
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,200
watching all the Sergio Leone movies.

704
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,360
And I was like, what was it before that?

705
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,080
And besides syndicated television, I'm like, it is Frontierland.

706
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,280
The simulation, I went back and reread.

707
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,840
I talked about a while ago, like the idea of simulation and simulacrum,

708
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,080
which simulation is, you know, a recreation of a real life thing.

709
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:18,480
Simulacrum, I've seen it described as a copy without an original.

710
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,560
And sometimes that's like you're so far removed from the original.

711
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,200
And that's kind of what a lot of the Frontierland stuff is.

712
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,440
But I was like, oh, yeah, I knew the Davy Crockett song in the late 1980s

713
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,240
because of Frontierland and like repeats on the early Disney Channel.

714
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,840
Yeah, that's that makes sense.

715
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,640
That's probably my first like big thing with it, too, where I was not.

716
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,920
I was a Star Wars kid and Star Trek kid superhero kid.

717
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:50,120
So that was probably my oh, this is like I like this because I walked through it.

718
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:55,420
A facsimile of this place that was in movies that other generations liked.

719
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,260
Well, and like theme parks, it feels like a like it's such a like,

720
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:06,120
you know, like a constant theme park presence is I feel like at least in America,

721
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:12,000
almost every theme park probably has some something that is vaguely Western themed.

722
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,560
It's like one of the like one of the primary themes, maybe in a way,

723
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,600
one of the easiest themes to do, because if you don't have a lot of money,

724
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,420
it can just be like, here's a shitty looking house.

725
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,220
Yes. A bunch of playing.

726
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,860
So would you do it right if you do it to the Disney level?

727
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,060
It's not just shitty is what it is.

728
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,900
Everything's on payment.

729
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,440
So, you know, at the very least, you save on paint.

730
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,740
Oh, yes. Yeah, sure.

731
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,140
That's what's. Yeah.

732
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:40,280
For not having you from a great theme park.

733
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:47,120
Oh, yeah. No, no, I hadn't thought about this until you put it this way, Scott.

734
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:51,580
But really, the approach is not different than what they did with

735
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:57,620
Tomorrowland to sort of remake it from a showcase of new technologies

736
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:04,560
to this imaginary spaceport that, you know, I don't know if you guys remember

737
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:08,520
before they changed over to the, you know,

738
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:13,060
but when it was the Wedway people mover and not the Tomorrowland Transit Authority.

739
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,480
But basically, they overlaid an entire theme of Tomorrowland

740
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,620
being a spaceport for visiting aliens.

741
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,460
And none of that was present when I was a kid.

742
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,220
None of that fantasy element.

743
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,900
It was supposed to be, I mean, pre Epcot.

744
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,060
It was supposed to be the world of the future.

745
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:38,760
It was supposed to be this is what we will what what we are headed towards, you know.

746
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:44,080
And so but then they put the overlay of making, oh, it's the future,

747
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,220
but it's it's silly made up future.

748
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,980
This is the same thing.

749
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,260
I mean, it's the past.

750
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,660
But, you know, go into things like all that folklore,

751
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:57,200
like, you know, gremlins and whatever all they have.

752
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:04,540
You could mine the history of Americana for a million kinds of native folklore.

753
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:08,300
I mean, even getting into things like Bigfoot and stuff like that

754
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,480
would be suitable for frontier land.

755
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,080
There's there's a ton of things they could do it.

756
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,360
You know, the wild places are still wild.

757
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,200
So everyone's got their local folklore.

758
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,360
That's just to me seems like the answer.

759
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,800
Sure. Jersey Devil and, you know, Jersey Devil.

760
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,800
Yep. All that.

761
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,300
The best man.

762
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,800
The zoology stuff. Yes. Yes. Absolutely.

763
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,900
It's like it had you have to lean into fun theatrical nonsense.

764
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:40,100
You can't go to the realism of what the future is going to be like

765
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,940
because it's always wrong.

766
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,420
It's it's obsolete within five to 10 years.

767
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,880
And it's the same way with like a land like frontier land, where it's like it's

768
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,560
it's based on what humans used to be like.

769
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,160
Well, they used to be very bad.

770
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,520
You know how they're bad now?

771
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,060
They were very bad back then.

772
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,300
So it's like we can't do that.

773
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,100
It was pretty bad.

774
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,520
Yeah, exactly.

775
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,160
You would even you know, he'd be a G like prison in two seconds today.

776
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,700
The best thing, you know, what was even worse?

777
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,940
Medicine.

778
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,340
So you've got bad people.

779
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,640
You've got no medicine.

780
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,880
Everything smells like shit.

781
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,580
The food tastes like shit.

782
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,080
You know, yes.

783
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,380
The safest thing is whiskey.

784
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,820
Yeah, the whole world stinks.

785
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,520
The whole world smells so bad.

786
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,220
But it's like everyone's probably doing their best to try to make the balance

787
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:28,800
right between being culturally appropriate, making sure everything is represented

788
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,400
correctly and also just like, yeah, and then there's a goat.

789
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,500
There's a fun goat.

790
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,360
Like, you know, it's all there.

791
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,100
I think everyone, from what I understand at Disney and every

792
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:41,060
of these other companies are like doing their best to try to hit that perfect balance.

793
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,640
Well, yeah, you know, there used to be a gold

794
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:50,400
polished brass plaque outside of Pirates of the Caribbean in Florida.

795
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:56,480
And it said it was, you know, it was there to entice you to go in,

796
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,140
as if that was necessary.

797
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:02,120
But it said, see a band of fun, loving pirates

798
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,460
sack and burn a Caribbean seaport.

799
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,380
And that always made me laugh.

800
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:13,800
Those fun loving guys just out to sack and burn a Caribbean seaport.

801
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,720
It's not there anymore.

802
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,540
But it's insane, really, to think about it that way,

803
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,900
because there's no here like now Jack Sparrow is on the ride.

804
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,580
But the ride doesn't have a hero in it.

805
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,000
There's no one like it's a celebration of bad behavior.

806
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,340
Yeah, exactly.

807
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:34,260
Like Rise of the Resistance, like you're the hero and Finn is there and Ray is there.

808
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,160
But like it's good and bad. Yeah.

809
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,840
And then like you get out of the ship. Right.

810
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,740
But the pirates are just like, hey, let's go party with these maniac killers.

811
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,940
Let's just go have an ale with them. Yeah.

812
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,940
Yeah. We're kind of telling you the whole lesson.

813
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,040
You you caught it right.

814
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,640
That the lesson is don't do this because you'll have all those riches

815
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,880
and you'll be alone. I think. Is that the message?

816
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,220
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's have a party with these maniacs.

817
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,420
Yeah. Be careful.

818
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:58,120
You might turn into a skeleton, which sorry.

819
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,260
OK, we're realizing now that is awesome.

820
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,260
Yeah, we messed up.

821
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,460
We were going to turn into a bad ass skeleton.

822
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,940
Yeah, they're a skeleton on top of like a pile of money, which is awesome.

823
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,140
It's like they're not even they didn't even die alone.

824
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:15,900
They died with just a bunch of cool stuff around them with like they're like friends.

825
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,280
I guess maybe they're not necessarily in the cave next to each other,

826
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,320
but it doesn't look that bad.

827
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:24,480
My body is not going to be holding like a cool chalice.

828
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,820
I'm just going to be like dead in a field or something.

829
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,100
Yeah. Yeah.

830
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,640
Yes. To be preserved as the pirates are.

831
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,640
It's so cool.

832
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,980
It's funny they didn't think about that because I think one of the reoccurring

833
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:44,280
themes in these parks is the people behind it over thinking about stuff.

834
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:48,020
Because when they opened Walt Disney World,

835
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,220
the one thing that I kept coming across

836
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:56,760
that plays into the unbuilt Western River Expedition attraction,

837
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,340
the one thing that kept coming up that they'd run into

838
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:04,240
was people would approach gas members and go, where's pirates?

839
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,800
Where's this pirates ride we've heard so very much about?

840
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,020
And they're like, oh, that's that's the other one that's on the other coast.

841
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:15,080
And then and then they real quick turned around and cloned

842
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,820
pirates for Walt Disney World because it's like, yeah, sometimes it is as simple

843
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:24,320
as people want to go on the thing they've heard so much about, you know.

844
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,160
Sure. Sure. And I think I heard even more to that story,

845
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,700
which is even more over thinking, which is they they reckoned that.

846
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:38,560
Eastern audiences would want us that they would find cowboys exotic,

847
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,740
whereas they'd find pirates a part of their local culture.

848
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:48,880
So like the East Coast, you're you're you already know all about pirates.

849
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,780
You've seen a bunch of pirates growing up places like, I don't know, Savannah,

850
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,940
things like that. I mean, they were like there were pirates

851
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,080
as part of that local culture.

852
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,980
But yeah, they thought nobody on the East Coast is going to want to see pirates.

853
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,720
They're going to want to see cowboys.

854
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:08,420
Due to proximity to the Caribbean, I don't you grew up in Florida, Dennis.

855
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,120
I can't imagine there were a lot of pirates in your

856
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:15,960
negative, although a little of that sort of thing.

857
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,360
You'd see like in St. Augustine and stuff.

858
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:22,660
So, I mean, it's not it's not completely insane.

859
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:26,620
The local the chachkis that you could buy

860
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:31,860
as a Florida tourist in that day, there would be probably some pirate coins

861
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:37,600
and that sort of stuff that as much as you would find cowboy hats and,

862
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,400
you know, bowie knives or whatever out west, you know.

863
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,900
But but but it's still a crazy idea

864
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,180
to think that they were serving a need by

865
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,800
regionalizing the entertainment like that.

866
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:57,140
I'm going to care. It's just pirate this pirate that wherever you are in Florida

867
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,380
and Georgia and North Carolina.

868
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:04,580
I that is so funny because I hadn't heard that about that about pirates.

869
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,620
But I've heard other imagineers say stuff like that.

870
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:10,760
And I always think of it. Oh, yes, they are 100 percent correct.

871
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,920
There's no way they could possibly be wrong about it.

872
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,420
And the one that pops to mind was like in France,

873
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,460
people in France like comedy and ghosts,

874
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,940
but they did not understand when ghosts were funny.

875
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,420
They did not understand when it could be like haunted and comedy.

876
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,560
And I went, oh, yes, of course, that must be correct.

877
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:29,260
And I was like, wait a minute, maybe that's not correct.

878
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,560
Maybe there's just a weird overthink imagineer

879
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,560
like brain where it's like we must anticipate.

880
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,200
And it's like if it's good, the audience would like it.

881
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,960
That's really at the end of the day.

882
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,800
But they want to make sure.

883
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,540
The two haunted mansions in America, the the the New Orleans

884
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,900
Square one at Disneyland, you know, is a big southern plantation house

885
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,340
because like this will be wild for California.

886
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,260
They don't have this kind of house here.

887
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:59,040
And then in Florida, it's like, oh, they got all these column houses.

888
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,940
Make it look like this one in Baltimore.

889
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:04,640
You know, they look like the Northeast. Right.

890
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,380
Yeah, it's strange.

891
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:10,080
I know. Well, let's let's talk a little about Western River Expedition,

892
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,820
because we've talked about it a little on the show,

893
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,660
and it's probably a full episode to be done about it.

894
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:17,280
But yeah, if you don't know that mythology, that there was going to be this

895
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,580
there was this whole expansion pad that was meant to be a whole original land

896
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,980
Thunder Mesa that was like an outgrowth of frontier land.

897
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,460
But it was going to be this multi ride campus that resembled Big Thunder Mountain.

898
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:33,260
And it probably would have had a big thunderous ride, but then also

899
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:38,360
an equivalent of Pirates of the Caribbean with Mark Davis at the helm.

900
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,100
Great imagineer known for his like especially being especially good at like

901
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,100
comedy tableaus.

902
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,880
And there was going to be this like just wild,

903
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,580
animatronic, rich attraction that I feel like that's it's got to be in the top five of

904
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:56,880
oh, if it could have been like an unbuilt attractions, it seems like.

905
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,820
And from art that exists and just rumors about what it could have.

906
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:04,400
And if it truly was pirates level, I mean, it could have changed

907
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,900
the the fabric of the park were it to exist.

908
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:11,560
Huge. Yeah, it's like it seems like a bit giant.

909
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,360
It would have been like, I mean, I know I've heard there's like

910
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,800
I'm sure there would have been stuff that has to change about it

911
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,900
as far as like theming and characters and stuff.

912
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,300
But like it definitely feels like it would be in the top five or 10 things.

913
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,400
I feel like that's the vibe from it would have been like that's

914
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,180
that would still be there today.

915
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,540
That's one of the mega things, even like Pirates of Haunted Mansion,

916
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,520
that like it's untouchable, maybe.

917
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:37,760
Yeah, I think because of the nature of that,

918
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,060
that's one of the like half dozen things that sunk the project

919
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:46,800
where it's like it would have been such an expensive undertaking.

920
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,560
It would have had like they were talking about doing a backwards segment,

921
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,600
you know, and all these animatronics.

922
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,080
And, you know, I think tastes were already changing.

923
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,680
The Western was kind of already on its way out.

924
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:05,980
And there was concern, you know, starting about the portrayal of Native Americans

925
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:11,640
and like, oh, are we going to be able to have that in this area?

926
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,640
So like there was a lot of things working against it.

927
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,740
And then when they're like, we got to get something else.

928
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,720
We needed another attraction in here.

929
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,620
And people keep asking for the pirates.

930
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:25,420
So just make a shorter pirates. Right. Right.

931
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:29,720
I so what we ended up with was like a minimal lot like

932
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:33,260
like Tony Baxter took the reins and said,

933
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,680
I think there's a version we could do that is the mine train roller coaster.

934
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,580
And it's only that.

935
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:41,360
And it's pretty wild to look at the concept art where like, well, there's that.

936
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,420
But it's bigger.

937
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:45,560
And there's a boat ride going in and out.

938
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:49,100
And it would have taken up the space that at Disney World is currently

939
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,440
not only Big Thunder, but also Splash Mountain.

940
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,100
Like all of that is one huge campus with this super ambitious ride.

941
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:02,480
Yeah. And the the the kind of comes back around later on

942
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,540
in in terms of big picture, like they want when they wanted to do

943
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:11,140
the Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland, that was going to be a massive thing.

944
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,740
And the Jungle Cruise was going to go through that.

945
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:18,040
So they've definitely like aimed for the stars before.

946
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:22,820
And then inevitably, the grandeur gets scaled back when you're like,

947
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,960
well, we have a time frame and we also have a budget.

948
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,860
So let's start chopping away at this. You know, right. Right.

949
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,940
Dennis, do you have like a favorite in terms of like in your theme park

950
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:38,860
Wanderings, is there like a most intrigued thing that never opened?

951
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:43,860
Is it this or or is it something in the in the Westcott world or like is it?

952
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:46,360
Do you have like an unbuilt that comes to mind?

953
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,440
I have spent probably more time thinking about Western River

954
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,400
expedition than anything else. Fascinated by it.

955
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:58,280
Like you say, it would have they were trying to outdo themselves on pirates.

956
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:03,240
So I think it just would have been outstanding. I mean,

957
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,680
it just such an interesting for starters, just the idea of a river

958
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,140
ride through the Wild West is kind of weird to begin with.

959
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:17,860
And it seems like they were stuck on the pirates model

960
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,100
and didn't completely switch it over.

961
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,900
So just that being the beginning of it.

962
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,900
And from what I gather, the Thunder Mountain portion of it

963
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,960
was on the roof of the show building.

964
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,200
And it just, as you say, it would have been this this vast thing.

965
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:37,000
But, you know, sort of adjacent to this,

966
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,500
I heard and maybe you guys can fill in some details.

967
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:46,540
This fascinated me if I was going to pick something other than

968
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,380
Western River Expedition.

969
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:54,620
I heard rumors that the Disneyland Railroad was going to stop

970
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:58,980
in Frontierland or at the Frontierland station

971
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:04,380
and enact a version of the first act of or the sorry,

972
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:08,220
the cold open of the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,

973
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,620
where River Phoenix is

974
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:16,360
doing the shoot them up on the wherever that is, Monument Valley and stuff.

975
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,960
I had heard that they were going to have a show scene

976
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:25,080
that reenacted that Indiana Jones segment

977
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,020
while you were riding the train.

978
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,120
Do you have you guys ever heard anything about that?

979
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:32,860
I always heard of it as like an amphitheater kind of show.

980
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:36,460
And yes, the train they may have tried to they're like, oh,

981
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:41,400
we can't run the train and we can't use it in the show simultaneously.

982
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,300
Yeah, I have.

983
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,200
We're trying to do the math of like, could there be a version

984
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,180
where the train goes through a like Waterworld type show?

985
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,040
And that's part of it, which is insane to think about.

986
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,140
God knows if they pulled it off.

987
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,180
But like, how do you how do you possibly?

988
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,480
It's a fascinating idea.

989
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,980
And I love the idea of linking these attractions and stuff.

990
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:03,180
You mentioned that the jungle cruise going through

991
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:08,080
the Temple of the Forbidden Eye or whatever, however they used to have it.

992
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,620
It's a fascinating idea.

993
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:12,120
I love that the Paris

994
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,260
Haunted Mansion is is the guy who owns Big Thunder Mine or whatever.

995
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,240
Isn't that the backstory there?

996
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:26,180
Is it the isn't the the house, the supposed to be the home of the mine owner?

997
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:28,220
Yes, I think that's right.

998
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,680
I'm I didn't know any of this.

999
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,860
I just figured all this out in researching for this.

1000
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:37,360
But yeah, it's not there's no Barnabas no Barnabas bullion there.

1001
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:41,300
So this might have been the first to find who owns Big Thunder Mountain.

1002
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:46,540
Henry Ravenswood and then his his daughter

1003
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:52,260
a factory like his daughter is the bride in Phantom Manor,

1004
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:56,300
who's they're engaged to be married after his daughter, Melanie,

1005
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,020
fell in love with a penniless miner.

1006
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:02,300
Mr. Ravenwood's vengeful spirit killed the would be groom.

1007
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,160
Wait, it's the death.

1008
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:08,600
So it's the evil Big Thunder owner is the Phantom or the Phantom.

1009
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,900
Is the Phantom that is the fine? Yeah.

1010
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:15,200
Wow. The sort of Vincent Price voice, depending on when you've been on it.

1011
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,900
Phantom. Wow.

1012
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:21,880
Just because he like didn't like the because she OK, because it was a penniless

1013
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:28,020
miner. So imagine if you're the owner of the mine and then it's some minor bumpkin

1014
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:30,180
who's going to marry my rich daughter.

1015
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,660
He's upset because of the socioeconomic disparity.

1016
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,420
I there's only one solution.

1017
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:37,860
I have to I got to kill this guy.

1018
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:42,500
And then he's like eternally punished for having which is that's not a good

1019
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,740
if you're like if your daughter is getting ready for the wedding, don't

1020
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,480
kill the husband.

1021
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,540
I can't imagine many scenarios where that's a good idea.

1022
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,040
No, no, don't do that.

1023
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:53,940
But that's interesting.

1024
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,380
I don't actually don't know how it fits into sea.

1025
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,080
I really wonder if that's a big problem.

1026
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,880
And they like to retcon that more for sea.

1027
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:03,560
So it fits neatly into the the Barnabas Canon or maybe not.

1028
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,060
Maybe they don't care.

1029
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:05,960
They're going to have to.

1030
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,760
They're going to have to cast Ravenswood.

1031
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,520
They'll deal. But this is all Ronald D.

1032
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,560
Moore's problem, I guess.

1033
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,760
Now, it's probably keeping him up at night.

1034
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,960
How do I come out of a universe where there is Ravenswood and Boolean?

1035
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,160
It can't be done.

1036
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,400
Yes, what writer could ever.

1037
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,440
But isn't that isn't that cool?

1038
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,340
Oh, and wait, here's some other stuff in that version.

1039
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:33,880
They do acknowledge the stealing of the land

1040
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,880
from from Native America.

1041
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,180
So in this world, there is this factors.

1042
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,340
So he's like punished by being a phantom in Phantom Manor.

1043
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:46,540
And then meanwhile, all the shit's hitting the fan at Big Thunder

1044
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:50,720
because they stole that land from the Shoshone people

1045
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:54,520
and therefore angering the Thunderbird.

1046
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:57,900
There is a Big Thunderbird spirit over there,

1047
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,560
and that's why there's earthquakes and things exploding and everything.

1048
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,940
Like so they do.

1049
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:05,940
This is an example of like they're tying all the rides together

1050
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,800
and they're acknowledging you did bad stuff.

1051
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:10,920
You're going to get punished by an angry bird spirit.

1052
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:14,660
I mean, that's I don't know that you maybe pick up on all of that.

1053
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:15,840
If you just go on it once.

1054
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,300
I would say you pick up on zero.

1055
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,600
No, it's only reading a Wikipedia later.

1056
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,940
But right, right. You can't.

1057
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:23,140
That is up to you to do.

1058
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:25,500
Yeah, it's there, which is nice.

1059
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,680
But even like in that frontier land, which is, you know, I've

1060
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:33,180
I've definitely tucked my share of shit about Disneyland, Paris,

1061
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:37,120
and I will say their frontier land, which could be the last new frontier land,

1062
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:37,940
potentially.

1063
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:41,880
And so that was like the kids who grew up on old frontier land get their shot.

1064
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,720
And I think they did it so beautifully and tying everything together.

1065
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,880
It's like it's so ornate and the coolest place in the park to be.

1066
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,160
And also, like the restaurants are part of it, too.

1067
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,920
If you read the full mythology, like, well, the saloon is where they would blow off steam

1068
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,600
and then the fancy steakhouse is owned by this guy's brother.

1069
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,700
Like they managed to connect like the restaurants and the stores.

1070
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:05,640
It all actually makes sense in a proto

1071
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:10,860
galaxy's edge kind of way, which I was like excited to hear all that.

1072
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,960
And Dennis, I know you're like probably your ideal of a theme park experience.

1073
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:18,200
It has all of this math worked out and where there's characters walking around

1074
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:22,040
and there's a backstory and it is you almost in are in like a weird

1075
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:27,180
alternate reality that does make logical and thematic sense.

1076
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,380
So they did kind of do it there.

1077
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,480
That's yes, I love that.

1078
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,820
And, you know, you'd be I was surprised to find out

1079
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,400
that that technique is seemingly applied everywhere.

1080
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:44,240
I some years ago, I was staying at the boardwalk in Florida,

1081
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,280
the Disney boardwalk, and they advertised there was a sign in the lobby

1082
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,740
that said, take a guided tour of the hotel.

1083
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,820
And, you know, 9 a.m. or something like that.

1084
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:58,460
And so I show up down in the lobby at 9 a.m.

1085
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:03,060
And I'm the only guy there at all for the for the tour.

1086
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,500
And I got a very knowledgeable

1087
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,440
cast member who was excited to have someone to tell

1088
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:14,380
everything he knew about.

1089
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:19,420
But but what I was struck by was he pointed out in the construction

1090
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:24,860
of the hotel, it was made to simulate

1091
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:29,260
it having been built over decades.

1092
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:31,860
There being additions

1093
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:35,600
onto the building and so on and so forth, even down to the

1094
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:40,000
where like certain hallways don't align properly

1095
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,480
because they reckon that they would have had,

1096
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:46,980
you know, structural problems adding a new wing onto the building.

1097
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:50,720
So they they sort of engineered fake problems they had to solve.

1098
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:54,020
And so from what I could tell,

1099
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:59,260
just something as as seemingly non narrative

1100
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:04,400
as the boardwalk in seems to have its whole history of the of the structure

1101
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:06,960
planned out and why not?

1102
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,460
I mean, I was saying if I was in charge of

1103
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:17,400
Galaxy's Edge or sort of looking at a way to to show run

1104
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:22,880
Galaxy's Edge, like I would find like blaster marks

1105
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:28,880
on the walls and ceilings and stuff and make stories of like who shot the gun

1106
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:33,020
that, you know, and so that you just and who cares

1107
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:35,760
if any of this gets written down or or passed on?

1108
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,560
But, you know, you point out insignificant details

1109
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,320
and you give stories to them.

1110
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:44,200
And then I think, you know, everyone's having a great time.

1111
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,760
We went and saw last time I was in the Florida Park.

1112
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,960
We went and saw you guys probably heard about the miniature door.

1113
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,860
I'd got outside Gaston's Tavern.

1114
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:58,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1115
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,600
I don't might be stomping us.

1116
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,700
Interesting. Well, OK.

1117
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:03,760
I'll break this story here.

1118
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,140
Oh, my God, I had just heard about it on Snopes or something.

1119
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,100
And I happen to be there.

1120
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:12,380
And it's very much like what you describe with the Figaro sign

1121
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,380
in one of your other episodes.

1122
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:17,340
Pulling the rope.

1123
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:18,480
Oh, yes. Yeah.

1124
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,500
Pulling it's in the wrong spot in Fantasyland and Disneyland.

1125
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,580
But then they put it in the right spot in Disneyland Paris.

1126
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:28,580
And he's given an OK sign like I did it right this time.

1127
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,980
Which is fantastic.

1128
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:33,420
I had never most of the most mundane information in my brain.

1129
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:35,460
I loved it. I loved it.

1130
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:40,420
But likewise, it evidently in in the area

1131
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:44,600
backed by Gaston's Tavern in Fantasyland,

1132
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:52,400
they built a a building too close to a manhole cover.

1133
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,000
So the edge of the building was

1134
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,800
was sitting on top of the manhole lid.

1135
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,380
So it wouldn't have been able to raise the manhole lid.

1136
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,540
So what they did is they cut a little piece of the wall out

1137
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:09,080
so that you'd be able to lift the lid.

1138
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,980
But rather than just make a little hole or something like that,

1139
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,700
they made a tiny door.

1140
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:20,140
And it's seemingly this purposeless,

1141
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:25,720
bizarre little 12, 14 inch high door over there.

1142
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,660
But as you say, they they made a mistake

1143
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:33,180
and they came up with a whimsical, clever way to sort of fix the mistake.

1144
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:36,160
So what's the door for, do we think?

1145
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,700
Well, the door is is just so you can remove a piece of the wall

1146
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,720
so that you can lift the lid of the manhole cover.

1147
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:45,520
OK. Yeah.

1148
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,360
But there's no mythology of like this is where somebody lives.

1149
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,300
That it was not that I know of.

1150
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,260
Well, that's what I was thinking. Is it LeFou's door?

1151
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:53,260
It's like talking.

1152
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,600
It could be LeFou.

1153
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:58,300
It could be that it could be that leprechaun

1154
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,540
we were talking about, the little man of Disneyland.

1155
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:04,140
Oh, yeah. Summer place. Yeah. Yeah.

1156
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:07,080
One that was I didn't know that one for the longest time.

1157
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,680
Yeah, I think Mike and Jason both did.

1158
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,800
And I was stumped on little man of Disneyland.

1159
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:15,100
But together, all of us are finding every certainly every obscure door.

1160
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,940
We're going to know the story of every door there is.

1161
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,580
By the time this is all done.

1162
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:23,180
Dennis, we should also give you credit for alerting us to the tangled

1163
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:27,040
the restroom area, which we did on the second gate.

1164
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,720
You would have this fancy that that dissection.

1165
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,580
Well, exactly. And why not?

1166
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:37,620
You know, they why not build a restroom complex with features?

1167
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:41,700
You know, yeah, it's it's deeds.

1168
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:46,280
I mean, if you if you're like us and go this much like the details,

1169
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,580
it's like the thing that keeps you going back.

1170
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:53,140
I feel like if it weren't for that, if it weren't for a theme toilet, why go back?

1171
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,580
Yeah, I guess that's what I'm saying.

1172
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:00,380
In terms of details and we can

1173
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,760
cut this if I'm thinking of the wrong person.

1174
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,460
Dennis, I Scott told us something once

1175
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:11,620
or did you come up with the idea for something?

1176
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:15,740
A day plan called exile on Main Street?

1177
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,700
Yes. Yes. OK.

1178
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:21,740
So this is because I have been thinking, I think Scott told us this years ago.

1179
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:25,780
And I think about it, it just bubbles into my mind every few months.

1180
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:27,840
Because I think I could do it.

1181
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:30,980
I well, we I would love to do with you guys.

1182
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:35,520
I think we should do it and and and document the experience.

1183
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,960
And I think it would it be

1184
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:42,760
it'd be maybe a little easier out here than it would be in Florida.

1185
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,560
But I think so.

1186
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:50,300
For the those who don't know, my the my idea would be to have a day

1187
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:53,180
at Disneyland called exile on Main Street.

1188
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:56,280
And the rules would be that you would be forbidden from

1189
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:59,040
going beyond the confines of mainstream.

1190
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,340
You have to spend the whole day in the park from park open to park

1191
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,900
close on Main Street.

1192
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:10,180
And you'd have to try to entertain yourself through the duration.

1193
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:15,420
And I think with the cinema running and if they're making

1194
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:19,380
candy apples and stuff, you know, I think you get around

1195
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:24,960
and, you know, dapper dance and some carriage rides.

1196
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,160
Omnibus omnibus.

1197
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,540
I do every type of transportation.

1198
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,400
Yeah, every type of transportation.

1199
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:36,940
And I think according to the rules, I set out, you are allowed one ride on

1200
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,060
a ground 360 ride on the railroad.

1201
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:42,740
But no stopping.

1202
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:46,280
You don't get off and get off and you can't ride the railroad all day

1203
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,880
is what I think I figured.

1204
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,240
But but yeah, we should try that sometimes.

1205
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:56,080
The I know the Florida park, for example, they blow glass in the the the

1206
01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:01,920
they have a working furnace where they're, you know, shaping glass and burning.

1207
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,280
And things like that.

1208
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,840
They've got that in Disneyland.

1209
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,120
Do they have that here too?

1210
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,620
Yeah, yeah. There's a little silhouette.

1211
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:08,880
A little show they have.

1212
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,220
We all get so we all get so it's so eating.

1213
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,220
Eating is easy.

1214
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:17,220
You can go to the

1215
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:19,260
at some point you eat at Carnation Cafe.

1216
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:21,960
At some point you eat at the plaza, right?

1217
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:25,900
And then you got Holly Jolly for I think that counts.

1218
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:28,040
Holly Jolly Bakery is that's the boundary.

1219
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,540
Probably that would be the boundary.

1220
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:31,480
I think I was in check and you could do.

1221
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,240
Yeah, so this is decent food.

1222
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:37,180
And you could have a decent days where the Starbucks, you know, market house.

1223
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:39,380
Sorry, market Starbucks.

1224
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:40,680
And Starbucks and I Starbucks.

1225
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,280
There's two. We've said too many.

1226
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:45,420
Honestly, I don't know if we'll have time for all of it.

1227
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:48,460
It's got to be frankly, it might have to do three days. Yeah.

1228
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:52,200
Exactly. Well, I actually I think I came up with the idea

1229
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:56,960
because I was killing time once while my girlfriend had to

1230
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,460
do a business call or something.

1231
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:03,020
And I didn't want to get too far away or so.

1232
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:07,220
I don't know what my reason was, but I ended up spending about two hours

1233
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:09,260
with nothing to do on Main Street.

1234
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:14,100
And you guys probably know this, but some of at least one in the alley there

1235
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:17,240
on whatever they call that center street or whatever.

1236
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:22,380
One of the buildings has a whole little audio program of

1237
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:26,880
of of of of the occupants of the upstairs rooms and everything.

1238
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:31,480
And that's the stuff that you know, going back to Frontierland,

1239
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:34,140
the this the log cabin fort

1240
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,020
that is still standing out in the Florida version

1241
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,760
has animatronics in it and everything.

1242
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:43,780
There's a there's a guy sleeping in the in the guard

1243
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:48,360
in the guardhouse and guys hammering

1244
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,460
horseshoes and things like that.

1245
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:56,300
But like it's they've got all that those those background

1246
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,820
atmosphere, sound effect loops going and everything.

1247
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,500
That's just great.

1248
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:05,660
Yeah, that would be I mean, that is a day that I've wanted to do

1249
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:08,900
is really just like and this I am truly not joking at all.

1250
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,700
Want to focus on the loops in the park.

1251
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,400
I want to go like listen to the loops for like 20 minutes and pinpoint

1252
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,040
where all of them are.

1253
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,980
This is that no, I'm not joking.

1254
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:19,540
I swear.

1255
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:21,880
Loops. Well, loopy for loops.

1256
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,220
Correct. The the market house.

1257
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,780
I think they kept it when they switched to Starbucks,

1258
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:29,620
but there's a phone in there.

1259
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:32,180
Yeah. Pick up that's a party phone. Yes.

1260
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:35,820
Yeah. I listened to the entire program on this occasion

1261
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:39,320
where I was killing time and it is it's very funny.

1262
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:43,020
And they they sketch out like a whole Springfield of

1263
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,800
of of town residents that have got, you know,

1264
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,400
that are you can't remember what any of the jokes were,

1265
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,640
but they they had running jokes in the thing and it was a well produced.

1266
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:56,600
I don't know who wrote it or, you know,

1267
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:00,640
what whether the thing is they mentioned coffee a lot.

1268
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,360
So I almost think Starbucks maybe

1269
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:05,600
punched it out.

1270
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,940
Paid for a little coffee play.

1271
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,680
Exactly. But that sort of thing.

1272
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,780
Yeah. The squawky old phones was the best.

1273
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:14,920
Wow. Yeah.

1274
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,180
And then you made maybe also do Lincoln like a couple times.

1275
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:21,020
Like, make sure you see you get a full sense of what he looks like

1276
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,360
on all sides from the back.

1277
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,100
Just every vantage point.

1278
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:29,460
Front row Lincoln, back row Lincoln in the pit, in the GAP.

1279
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:34,440
Learn if he plays to the entire crowd or like, does he not really have

1280
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,680
like the sense of the space that a performer should have?

1281
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,740
That's true. Yeah.

1282
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:41,940
Get to Lincoln, get in the pit, you know.

1283
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:44,220
Look up his nostrils.

1284
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:46,580
And then we take, OK, we go and we do we see Lincoln,

1285
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:50,120
but then we take like X to see we take Molly and then we go back

1286
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,760
to see Lincoln again and see what the experience is like that way.

1287
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,080
And so lots of drugs are part of the exile on mainstream.

1288
01:13:57,380 --> 01:14:00,080
That's a different. Yeah.

1289
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,120
Yeah, that that makes. Yeah.

1290
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,060
Go ahead. Go ahead.

1291
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:09,560
No, no, I was just going to say that might make it seem eternally long, too.

1292
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:10,100
You never know.

1293
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:14,000
Yeah. It's either either would help you pass the time or it would make it.

1294
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,740
When do we leave until I'm in 45 minutes?

1295
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,680
And you spend you spend like a couple hours like passed out on a toilet.

1296
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,540
Just like shaking in a fetal position.

1297
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:28,120
Freaking out.

1298
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:29,660
Well, you have described something

1299
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:32,160
it certainly sounds like something we would do.

1300
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:36,360
This is we have punished ourselves with with less with less to do.

1301
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,820
So it's actually I think we totally good.

1302
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:43,460
Well, right, because didn't you guys devote an entire show

1303
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:47,440
to every retail outlet and Universal City Walk?

1304
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:50,300
Didn't we? Well, a lot of episodes.

1305
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:54,040
It was just 19.

1306
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:56,520
That's 19. Just a clean 19.

1307
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:00,860
That's when I that's when I met Scott and I was tremendously impressed with that.

1308
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,520
I yeah.

1309
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:08,400
Well, we were working together and I would do it almost every day of that run

1310
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,440
was like, listen, I got to go.

1311
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:12,760
I got to get up to city walk again.

1312
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,900
We're doing yogurt land or 16.

1313
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:16,740
Yeah.

1314
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,400
Got to go try some menchies.

1315
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,640
That's the job.

1316
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:25,480
But that worked out very well because Dennis, when we were working together,

1317
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:28,340
I feel like there was there were so many days where you would like,

1318
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,480
you know, mid afternoon say like, I want to head to the park.

1319
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,240
What do you think?

1320
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,080
It's a park day.

1321
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,080
That's right. It was like this guy's speed.

1322
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,320
This is great.

1323
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:43,480
And I let's let's let's get a little more frontier land in before we wrap it up.

1324
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,980
I guess like in terms of like

1325
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:49,080
like like what have we missed?

1326
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:52,680
You know, so one of the thesis, I think, of talking about frontier land for a while

1327
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:55,520
is like, is there relevancy to it?

1328
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:00,160
Like, are we have we seen all the frontier lands get built that we're going to see?

1329
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:04,020
And is there ever going to be a new attraction in a frontier land?

1330
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:07,660
Could you not see a world where for dear land as it is now

1331
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:11,560
and has been for a couple of decades does not change per se

1332
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,120
other than like eliminating things?

1333
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,280
That's that's the dark potential future.

1334
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:19,900
Yeah, I've heard I mean, I've heard just from people,

1335
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:23,600
friends who have inquired about things to pitch or whatever.

1336
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:27,900
I do think Disney is still trying to figure out Big Thunder something.

1337
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,700
Like, at least that's what they were told.

1338
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:32,200
So maybe they're like, I don't know, but they're probably trying to figure out Big Thunder

1339
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:36,480
something. I think that they'll probably still make attempts

1340
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,640
to make the places in Disney relevant

1341
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,360
through like Disney plus or a movie or something.

1342
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,760
But barring that, yeah, I could see them just being like,

1343
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:49,900
you know, we could get rid of that whole land.

1344
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:53,380
But I think that, yes, if anything else doesn't happen, I mean,

1345
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:58,620
I don't know. I think everything things aren't as untouchable as people think they are.

1346
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:01,780
That's what that's the sense I get. I could be totally wrong.

1347
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:04,660
But, you know, 10, 10, 20 years from now,

1348
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,820
I wouldn't bet money that it's there.

1349
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,840
Well, a few years ago, they there was a temporary attraction

1350
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,980
called the Heroes of Frontierland, which was like a game, an interactive game

1351
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:19,520
where you would go and interact with characters and go to locations and stuff.

1352
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:26,320
And it is not dissimilar to kind of what the not ghost town.

1353
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,200
There's elements of that in not ghost town.

1354
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:32,900
But I think after the fact, I heard, oh, this was play testing for Star Wars

1355
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:37,660
stuff for like, you know, which they kind of scaled back the interaction

1356
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,980
at Galaxy's Edge, but it could also whatever lessons they learned

1357
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:44,060
from that Frontierland testing, they could be applying at the,

1358
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,580
you know, the hotel.

1359
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:50,660
Yeah. Big, big thunder is the thing, I think, keeping Frontierland alive.

1360
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,900
Yeah, because it's just beloved.

1361
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,000
Insanely popular.

1362
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,760
It's not even like the historical nature of it's just like, oh,

1363
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,600
it's a big roller coaster that everyone likes.

1364
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,580
Like, yeah, that every age can go on any coaster willingness.

1365
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:08,120
Yeah, it really is perfect.

1366
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:11,180
If Galaxy's Edge like extends back, I mean, Galaxy's Edge already

1367
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:14,460
swallowed some of Frontierland, it swallowed a part of Jason's

1368
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:16,460
favorite part of Frontierland, which is goats.

1369
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:20,760
There used to be the goats that you would see in Frontierland.

1370
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:24,060
And Jason, I many, many times over the last decade, he would go,

1371
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:25,680
let's go back and see the goats.

1372
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:29,180
And if there was a wait, I mean, you could always walk in and see the goats.

1373
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:32,860
So you needed somewhere quiet, you know, somewhere to be around nature.

1374
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:37,040
They did keep the bar, the pond, the mossy pond

1375
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:42,440
with the big old tunnel from previous attractions that survived.

1376
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:43,900
The mechanical fish.

1377
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:46,340
There's usually a mechanical fish right there.

1378
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:48,100
Yeah, that's right.

1379
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,340
Little guy. Oh, boy.

1380
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:54,040
There's some these are some deep corners that the I.

1381
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,340
But yeah, I don't know.

1382
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:57,040
Like, yeah, things have already gotten swallowed.

1383
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,760
Like, I think no land has lost more

1384
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:04,760
like territory than Frontierland, if you think about it,

1385
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:07,940
because some of it becomes New Orleans Square, some of it becomes

1386
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,000
bear country, which becomes greater country.

1387
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,400
And then like the big expansion pad.

1388
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:15,200
I feel like it was always a weird thing about like clearly the air.

1389
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,900
The biggest area they had to work with was that big Thunder Ranch zone.

1390
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:22,100
And like that's always like this could be the big

1391
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,640
the biggest expansion Disneyland ever does.

1392
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,140
And of course, that ended up being Galaxy's Edge.

1393
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,560
And I think the reason nothing happened sooner

1394
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:34,240
is that it was kind of something back there would have had to be

1395
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,300
Frontierland and Western themed.

1396
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:39,300
And there's only so many things that that can be.

1397
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:43,400
And they never had a hit movie that that prompted something to go back there.

1398
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,800
There was the we've heard that rumor of like an Oz stunt show

1399
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,840
or something based on the James Franco.

1400
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,800
Ozland, Ozland.

1401
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,440
That was going to be like riots, too.

1402
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:55,100
Yeah, yes.

1403
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:58,100
You say way you can segue from like rural

1404
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:02,400
Frontierland or rural Kansas to the, you know, the Emerald City.

1405
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,340
You had the show in a little.

1406
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:08,700
It sounds, by the way, other than the Franco movie connection, it sounds awesome

1407
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,040
because you go in a little tent.

1408
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,440
There would be a little like medicine show type thing.

1409
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,300
The tent would like spin around while you were in there.

1410
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,740
Then the thing would open and you were in Oz.

1411
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:22,300
And it was full Ozland with like for I think it was a Tony Baxter interview

1412
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:26,080
where he didn't even want to reveal the ride technology that it was

1413
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:28,680
because it might still be used eventually for something

1414
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,200
or maybe it has been at this point.

1415
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,700
But it sounds like there was a crazy ticket

1416
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:36,000
Oz ride with a very, very themed land back there.

1417
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:40,680
Yeah. Since you mentioned Tony, by the way, there is video online

1418
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:44,700
of him giving a presentation from D23 a while ago,

1419
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:49,040
going through the concept art for Western River Expedition and saying like,

1420
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,480
so then this would have happened and this would have happened.

1421
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:56,260
Like this is a sample like song that they use when discussing it and like

1422
01:20:56,580 --> 01:21:00,920
and kind of associating it with Pirates of the Caribbean.

1423
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,060
It's like, well, this is sort of the equivalent of the big,

1424
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:07,420
you know, chase scene that would be this scene instead, you know. Right.

1425
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:11,460
Oh, and you know what? Also, real quick, Tony also talked about

1426
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:14,420
the other thing that might have been in frontier land, which is Geyser Mountain.

1427
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:16,780
Geyser. Do you know about Geyser Mountain, Dennis?

1428
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:21,460
I don't. I've heard rumors about a fire mountain over the years.

1429
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:24,240
But I never heard Geyser Mountain.

1430
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,160
Fire Mountain I've heard to fight.

1431
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,160
I think that's what would have gone somewhere else.

1432
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:33,200
But Geyser Mountain was basically like you were a group of tourists

1433
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:37,000
on a tour going below the surface to take a look at like miners,

1434
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:37,960
what they're doing down there.

1435
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,100
So you'd go down.

1436
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:40,500
I think they were actually going to build it.

1437
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,200
So it was kind of underground partly.

1438
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,200
So basically it's the Tower of Terror,

1439
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:47,660
but it's like half of the tower is more underground and the other half's above.

1440
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:49,440
And it's this big like mining rig.

1441
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,720
So you go down and you'd see animatronics of miners and miners.

1442
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:54,520
And all of a sudden they would like, you know, alarms would go off

1443
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:57,540
and there's a geyser and then water would shoot up all around you

1444
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:00,340
as you shot out of the ground up.

1445
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,480
And then you could see like all of Disneyland.

1446
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,440
And this is before they built Tower at California Adventure.

1447
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:08,620
But that was very much, I think, possible that it would go

1448
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:12,980
like around that area of Galaxy's Edge and the barbecue restaurant and everything.

1449
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:18,940
Yeah, yeah. It it looked like there is like more concept art of that than I knew.

1450
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:20,280
I was finding it recently.

1451
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,880
And we're like that is like Tower of Terror in Florida,

1452
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:26,480
where the car is moving from room to room and then you end up in the launch.

1453
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:29,280
Oh, it was like you're like forward and stuff, too.

1454
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,020
It wasn't just amazing. So cool.

1455
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:36,780
And like the other thing that sounds great about this is that this was like

1456
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:40,180
it was more recent than I realized they wanted to do this in like late

1457
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:44,680
90s, early 2000s, which in like with that,

1458
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,180
you have maybe the people who end up like you're in the same

1459
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:52,820
like late 90s Disney prowess as Disney Sea.

1460
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:55,920
Like so if that kind of had the vibe of Journey to the Center of the Earth

1461
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,060
or one of the many other great attractions at Disney, see if it was done to that degree.

1462
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:02,760
But then 9-Eleven happens.

1463
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,180
DCA is struggling.

1464
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,680
Let's just clone Tower and do less of it.

1465
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:09,760
And when that's what it ends up being and then there's it be redundant

1466
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,760
to have two similar things and one is more expensive.

1467
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:16,120
But this was like this might even top Western River Expedition.

1468
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,160
This sounds so good.

1469
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,440
Yeah, from what I've seen, yeah, that sounds amazing.

1470
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:21,940
It sounds really amazing.

1471
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:27,000
And it's Western River partly felled by the economic downturn, too.

1472
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:31,760
Yes. Coming at like we the seven economic downturn happens in the 70s.

1473
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:34,900
It's like we just spent all this money to build a whole resort.

1474
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:39,700
We cannot build another massive ride after we built all these other rides.

1475
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:41,300
Yeah, it sucks.

1476
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:45,000
I mean, media consolidation is really bad and these companies shouldn't do it.

1477
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,400
But maybe the telecom should just buy Disney so we can do.

1478
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:52,160
Get as many rides every year, regardless of the economy.

1479
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,260
Maybe that's the solution.

1480
01:23:54,260 --> 01:23:55,340
It's us rides.

1481
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:56,840
Well, we'll do.

1482
01:23:57,660 --> 01:24:02,260
But I guess, you know, all this to say like these these were these were our shots.

1483
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:03,700
Now, there's just less frontier land.

1484
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:06,100
There's there's not really,

1485
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:08,440
you know, there's no bigger expansion you could do that one.

1486
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:12,040
That Geyser Mountain also almost went to Paris, but didn't quite happen there

1487
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:15,400
because Paris is always struggling and they got tower ultimately.

1488
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:20,080
But like, I don't know, I like have we seen the last of Frontierland?

1489
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:27,040
And how do you like I is there is there a possibility of a bright future for Frontierland?

1490
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,300
Well, you know, here's my thought.

1491
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:37,980
I have a co-worker with small kids and he said his son and daughter

1492
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:43,080
who are maybe in the five year, four year range, they love their favorite thing

1493
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,960
in Disney World was Tom Sawyer Island.

1494
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,260
And I was thinking about this on the way over.

1495
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:55,760
There is sort of a defunct spur of of imagineering

1496
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,360
that they used to have, which was something a kid knew,

1497
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:06,980
but like a insane gonzo version of it, you know, so like Swiss family treehouse,

1498
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:10,660
like kids know what a treehouse is, but this is the most insane treehouse

1499
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:12,160
you've ever seen in your life.

1500
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:15,900
Or the old river country was supposed to be a swimming hole

1501
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:17,860
like you might have in your community.

1502
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:21,900
But this is the most insane swimming hole that's all tricked out and got all this stuff.

1503
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:25,640
And so I was thinking there were these things like that.

1504
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:31,400
Kids love to run around outside and explore the woods and stuff.

1505
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:38,240
And it seems like they may not need to spend that much money to hit a target,

1506
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:45,080
which is the kids running around unstructured play, just environments that

1507
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:49,180
Disney used to excel at doing that sort of thing.

1508
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:50,780
And they seem to have dropped off.

1509
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:54,440
No doubt because of liability issues and other things like it.

1510
01:25:54,980 --> 01:26:01,180
But I mean, kids, you know, like the youngest kids, they still what

1511
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:05,380
you give them an environment to play in and they're going to be down with it.

1512
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:09,560
So my my two pitches for for them, if they were looking to revitalize

1513
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:19,220
what they had on, you know, on a budget would be to invest in gamifying

1514
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:24,860
those playground areas, whether something along the lines of

1515
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:30,220
the Star Wars datapad game that they have where you interact with the environment

1516
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:33,160
or the way you I think some of that

1517
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:40,660
Harry Potter wizarding world where you're able to the magic wand can make things.

1518
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:43,220
Little effects happen all over the windows and the doors.

1519
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:48,320
Those, you know, endless delight if you're a kid and you use your cell phone

1520
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,660
to make a gopher pop out of a hole or something like that.

1521
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:55,720
But, you know, those those kind of cheap, tiny effects

1522
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:58,260
like they have at the shooting gallery,

1523
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:00,840
you know, that you can affect on your own.

1524
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:06,400
I just feel like, you know, make it an interactive playground, gamify everything.

1525
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:11,400
But then, you know, they have a pirate treasure hunt in Florida

1526
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:15,400
that is self-guided, that operates little animatronic effects

1527
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,860
that you activate with your magic band.

1528
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:20,700
And it doesn't seem like that was a hit.

1529
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:23,160
It doesn't seem like you always see people doing it.

1530
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:27,160
But I guess they determined that was not the future of theme parks. But

1531
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:31,800
it seems like it should be because kids play video games.

1532
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,760
And if you gamify the experience

1533
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:37,940
and give them collective digital collectibles,

1534
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:43,400
you know, send them around Tom Sawyer Island on a scavenger hunt, for example.

1535
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:45,760
Yeah. Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1536
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:49,860
Yeah, there's not there's not like one experience that like encapsulates like

1537
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,900
there's no collect them all kind of thing to do there.

1538
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:56,860
It is interesting that like you say, you know,

1539
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:02,760
everyone has a phone where they can play like high end games on them now, essentially.

1540
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:06,760
But the shooting gallery, like an infrared shooting gallery

1541
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:11,940
where you shoot a tin can that's like on a pole and rattles.

1542
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:15,560
There's still people over there like they haven't gotten rid of it.

1543
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,400
It's still there. It's still popular.

1544
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:21,600
There's still a list on the Disneyland, a Disney World website, as hard as it is

1545
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:25,000
to navigate that website of like,

1546
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,180
here's where all the playgrounds are.

1547
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:32,100
And they keep cannibalizing, you know, taking the the land

1548
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:36,880
for other attractions and all like they did with the Honey I Shrunk the Kids

1549
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,600
movie set play area.

1550
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:45,280
But it's like, yeah, kill kids still need to run around and burn off energy.

1551
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,180
So they take a nap.

1552
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:49,580
You know, like that has not changed.

1553
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:50,880
You know, right.

1554
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,740
Nothing has replaced naps and hopefully never will.

1555
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:56,940
And I saw an aerial photo of

1556
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:02,780
of mine trade through nature's wonderland that had some of Tom Sawyer on it

1557
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:05,280
visible in the photo.

1558
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:09,880
And a lot of it was a gigantic like rock pile

1559
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:14,740
that there were just all these children scampering on a gigantic

1560
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:17,020
like pile of rocks, it looked like.

1561
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:21,120
And it was it had to been two dozen kids on this vast

1562
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:26,820
sort of like sort of boxcar sized pile of rocks that,

1563
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:30,400
you know, and if they, you know, made that sort of thing a little safe,

1564
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,560
kids will have fun with that all day long.

1565
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:38,660
Scott, I feel like I called you once when I

1566
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,720
for the first time, I visited that ranger park ranger out

1567
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:46,860
that what I call the Tom Sawyer Island of DCA.

1568
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:49,360
Oh, yes. Oh, you mean the yeah.

1569
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:51,900
Yeah, the Redwood Trail, the challenge route. Yeah.

1570
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:53,000
Yeah. Mm hmm.

1571
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,160
It's tremendously, thoughtfully constructed.

1572
01:29:57,460 --> 01:30:00,640
It's just got the most boring theme that I could ever imagine.

1573
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,500
I mean, it's just it's it's.

1574
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,000
Some people will take umbra.

1575
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,500
My friends, Tyler Keough will defend the the slice of the tree,

1576
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:10,700
the slice of the Sequoia to to their death.

1577
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:13,100
They that's where that's their favorite thing in the park.

1578
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,140
But yes, some people are.

1579
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:17,300
Yeah, some people might not disagree.

1580
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:22,000
A lot of Park Ranger Brown and things like that, you know.

1581
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:25,840
But but as far as a playground, I mean, the kids were going nuts

1582
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:30,280
and it's multi level and it's very removed from the park.

1583
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:32,400
It it's got an immersive feel.

1584
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:35,240
And I don't know, like, you know, like I said,

1585
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:38,200
there's got to be a million liability issues, but

1586
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:43,540
but not forgetting that Disney used to do stuff like that,

1587
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:49,280
provide sort of superior versions of sort of common childhood

1588
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:51,940
pleasures, you know.

1589
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:53,680
They got better, crazier playgrounds.

1590
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:54,820
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1591
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:57,140
That is the stuff I can't wait when my son's old enough.

1592
01:30:57,140 --> 01:30:58,320
Like I'm already ready.

1593
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:01,540
He's going to go nuts for all those things we're talking about.

1594
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:04,420
Yeah, so that's irrelevant.

1595
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:05,320
Yeah, go ahead, Mike.

1596
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,840
I was just going to say the other thing, and it's kind of stealing

1597
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:11,440
what Nats is doing, but what I do like Nats as a ghost town,

1598
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:13,740
it's, you know, it's frontier land.

1599
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:17,040
But when Nats and what's fun about Nats is that it's just populated

1600
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:21,140
with like Nats original characters now, like the mayor and,

1601
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:24,380
you know, the way that they have a new character, Whittles,

1602
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:25,940
who's the old prospector.

1603
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:29,120
He's not a face like a human character, but he's like a cartoon character.

1604
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:32,580
But it's like they just keep throwing like character and backstory

1605
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:34,220
at their ghost town.

1606
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:37,540
The maze they had a couple of years ago, and they're having it again this year

1607
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:43,020
at the not scary farm is an origin story for the actual town,

1608
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:45,340
like with a witch that looks like the witch from Wizard of Oz.

1609
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:50,340
I feel like you could really make frontier like that.

1610
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:53,720
To me, it's like the fastest way to make it feel really like fun

1611
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:59,180
and vibrant and alive is like adding more characters, adding more people performing.

1612
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:02,580
I don't think they're ever going to do this, but like steal from Nats

1613
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:05,280
and just like have like a blustery mayor

1614
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,620
yelling at people as you walk by in frontier land or something.

1615
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:10,880
Like, it's great. It's real fun.

1616
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,960
They think they used to go. Go ahead, Dennis.

1617
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:17,360
No, I was going to say they still I know on Main Street, they still have

1618
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:23,760
actors and actresses that pretend to be sort of colorful locals.

1619
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:26,660
And I feel like they yes,

1620
01:32:26,660 --> 01:32:29,420
I feel like they might have that on Hollywood Boulevard at.

1621
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,760
Yes, Hollywood Studios as well.

1622
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:36,140
Like, you know, I, you know, period people, 1930s people.

1623
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:41,300
So why they wouldn't have that in in Frontierland is beyond.

1624
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:45,440
Yeah, I feel like they used to have shoot them ups on the roof.

1625
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:47,600
When I was. Yes.

1626
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:51,640
But you said above Country Bear in Florida, like there was there was some kind of stunt show.

1627
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:54,700
They would have just impromptu

1628
01:32:55,200 --> 01:33:00,360
like they're robbing the bank and someone would chase the bad guys across the roof.

1629
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,260
And there'd be some slapstick.

1630
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:05,460
But why that stuff isn't going on constantly?

1631
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:09,400
I mean, there are enough trained improv actors. Sure.

1632
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:11,900
Not to do it. We'll do it. We'll do it.

1633
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:14,240
If that's what you're getting at, we're ready to do that.

1634
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:18,900
Have a shoot. I'm sure I think a lot of the parks in Southern California

1635
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:22,940
are equity actors and they're not exactly cheap,

1636
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,240
but it's cheaper than building an e-ticket ride.

1637
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:26,600
You know, that's right. Yeah.

1638
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:30,040
Look, three years Jason, I run a tarot team for three years.

1639
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,720
So I think we're ready to do this.

1640
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:34,920
Oh, man. Old Westinghouse, are you kidding me?

1641
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:38,680
Oh, entirely no current references, no modern references.

1642
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,480
No, absolutely not.

1643
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,480
No, no reference.

1644
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:44,080
Judge Roy Bean and Judge Roy Bean.

1645
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,080
Diamond Lill.

1646
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:53,120
A lot of, you know, you can reference like, oh, Susanna, you just, you know,

1647
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:55,540
you can talk about songs, you can do song parodies.

1648
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:57,820
It's just got to be of Susanna.

1649
01:33:57,820 --> 01:33:59,060
Steven Foster.

1650
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:02,220
All the old hair pomades.

1651
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:06,500
Yeah, just hair pomade brand names alone will eat up at 10 minutes.

1652
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,800
And if we want to say like, if our brain wants to say like Iron Man or something,

1653
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,360
we'll just replace it with Zorro.

1654
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:15,100
We just say Zorro.

1655
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:18,000
Zorro. Yeah, it was snake oil.

1656
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:19,800
Yeah, buy the snake oil.

1657
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:23,300
Go ahead into the Emporium. Get your commemorative snake oil.

1658
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:26,660
Just find out who the president was back then.

1659
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:29,500
If you're ever tempted to say Biden, just like was it

1660
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:33,360
or we, Andrew Johnson at this point, I'm not sure what year.

1661
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,700
Well, I don't know what 1850 is, but find it out.

1662
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:39,400
And those clowns, those old so and so's in Washington.

1663
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:42,500
And the crowds just losing it. Just going crazy.

1664
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:46,160
Yeah. Well, I think we've made a real good case that we should be these performers.

1665
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:51,400
Yeah. So well, as many things that we saw on the show, the solution is, of course, us.

1666
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,660
Us, yeah. That's always the way.

1667
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:57,160
No one has taken us up on the offer, which about every other episode

1668
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:00,640
we say like, you know, we'll write that ride or we will be the characters

1669
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:02,660
in the park and no one has taken us up on it yet.

1670
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:04,900
Always unbelievable.

1671
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:09,400
Yes. Well, it's that and it's to make Dennis's big thunder.

1672
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:12,300
Do it now. Look, Danny Junior needs another act.

1673
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:13,340
Do a little didn't work.

1674
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:17,900
This is his way to be an old timey, an old timey guy in the right way.

1675
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:21,240
So all of deploy all of us and we'll we'll make it all work.

1676
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:25,880
I think a quick I think a quick rewrite and do little could be on Big Thunder

1677
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:29,020
Mount. It's true.

1678
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:32,740
And then what was his other Mordecai?

1679
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:35,240
What was her? What was the no, that was that.

1680
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:37,640
That was Johnny Depp. That's right.

1681
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:38,580
I forgot about that.

1682
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:41,980
Well, you know, teaming those two up, do little and Mordecai seems like.

1683
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:46,920
Yeah, why not? That was the sleep.

1684
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:50,340
Well, if you think of it all as just prequel, like, of course, they didn't do well.

1685
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:52,580
It was only like it wasn't the sum of the parts.

1686
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:55,540
But once you put them together, that's that's the new dynamic duo.

1687
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,880
Yeah. People have a crossover. Yes.

1688
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:01,520
Yeah. OK. Well, great ideas left and right.

1689
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,320
Dennis, Dennis McNicholas.

1690
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,720
Sorry about the stubble.

1691
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:06,980
Dennis McNicholas, you survived podcasts the ride.

1692
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:09,320
Thanks so much for for doing this.

1693
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:11,620
So so I could have you. It's fantastic.

1694
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:13,780
Oh, for sure. And oh, yes, go ahead.

1695
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:16,580
When in Orlando, visit the Columbia Harbor House.

1696
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:18,420
Yes, we absolutely will.

1697
01:36:18,420 --> 01:36:21,700
And seafood recently reopened.

1698
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:23,860
It is up and running.

1699
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:25,220
So it's closed for a while.

1700
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:29,500
They they were serving the their menu at the Tomorrowland Terrace

1701
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,020
in the interim, but I'm glad to hear.

1702
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:32,960
Yes. Oh, gotcha. OK.

1703
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:37,760
Let's exit through the gift shop because you definitely have have something to plug.

1704
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:41,660
Tell us a little bit about about Batman, the audio adventures,

1705
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:44,200
which I believe is this is coming out.

1706
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:47,120
I think as this episode comes out, this is a thing you could check out tomorrow

1707
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:51,760
on HBO Max September 18th, which I learned via your press release is Batman Day.

1708
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:54,760
I feel that I never properly honored Batman Day before.

1709
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,120
Well, you know, it is a quiet, you know,

1710
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:02,500
contemplative evening with family is is most traditional

1711
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:04,500
spend it with the ones I love.

1712
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,560
But no, that is correct.

1713
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:11,620
On September 18th, all 10 episodes of Batman,

1714
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:14,760
the audio adventures will be available on HBO Max.

1715
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:19,100
And it is something like an old timey radio play,

1716
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:22,440
something like Saturday morning cartoons.

1717
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,960
It's fun. It is not.

1718
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:32,460
It is not a spoof of Batman, but it is not a serious Batman.

1719
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:37,460
It is it is a Batman that acknowledges the absurdity

1720
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:39,760
and the ridiculousness of the entire premise.

1721
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,260
And I've got an amazing cast.

1722
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:45,100
Jeffrey Wright is Batman.

1723
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:47,960
Rosario Dawson is Catwoman.

1724
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:50,300
I've got John Leguizamo is Riddler.

1725
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:52,800
And just about all your favorite SNL

1726
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:55,140
alums are in there.

1727
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:59,500
We've got Jason Sudeikis, Fred Armisen, Seth Meyers,

1728
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:02,400
Bobby Moynihan. The list goes on and on.

1729
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,160
So Paul Scheer, our friend Paul Scheer.

1730
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:07,400
He does a wonderful job place.

1731
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:09,500
The Joker's right hand man.

1732
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:14,000
And oh, and the Joker is played by Brent Spiner from Star Trek.

1733
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:17,460
Oh, I don't know if you do that one, Mike.

1734
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:18,540
I did not know that.

1735
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:23,240
And of course, he played a very Joker like character on the UPN show Deadly Game.

1736
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:28,060
It is, which is the which is the show with Christopher Lloyd

1737
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:30,160
playing the character Sebastian Jackal.

1738
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,240
Terrific. So I'm very amazed.

1739
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,240
He's great on this.

1740
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:39,920
And everyone just really brought it and had a super fun time.

1741
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:43,820
And there are 10 episodes,

1742
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:45,940
total run times about six and a half hours.

1743
01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:48,420
So you get a big fat chunk of Gotham City.

1744
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:52,880
And hopefully we'll be back sometime next year with the second season.

1745
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,740
So jump on board.

1746
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:55,880
She's fantastic. Yeah.

1747
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:59,340
And I know like a thing along the worst for you and a dream come true to get to do

1748
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:03,920
this is an officially sanctioned Batman to do Batman in a way that you're guiding.

1749
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,540
And I'm sure it's awesome.

1750
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:07,780
They'll be excited to check it out.

1751
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:10,080
I would be honored to have you listen.

1752
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:14,680
Geezer. Well, and the other hope is that it paves the way for more Batman

1753
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:18,040
offshoots, because I know I don't want to just call Mike out on it.

1754
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:21,240
But I, you know, I do know that Mike has had a dream for a long time

1755
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:25,440
of his specific Batman spin off, which is Batman Forever

1756
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:29,940
to doing more in the Batman Forever universe specifically,

1757
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:31,580
which I'm fully on board with.

1758
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:35,280
So if there if we're like opening up avenues to like, you know,

1759
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,280
many different little side streets of Batman.

1760
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:40,380
Yes. Hopefully that could be one.

1761
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:43,180
I have it already sketched out a bit.

1762
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:45,280
Yes, it's a long time dream.

1763
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:48,680
I don't know that we get you can't maybe do it as a movie anymore,

1764
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:51,580
but another medium, another piece of media. Yes.

1765
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:55,520
Prestige Maxi series.

1766
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,620
Yes, sure. Yeah, yeah.

1767
01:39:57,620 --> 01:39:59,880
That's the way. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1768
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:02,920
Yeah. Get people for a limited time and

1769
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:05,260
and like way more Chase Meridian, of course.

1770
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:07,360
To nail Nicole Kidman down.

1771
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:08,520
But you'll go.

1772
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:13,260
She's got a very important role in the in the new one in Batman Forever to my Batman Forever to.

1773
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:16,260
Yeah, for sure. We'll look out for that eventually.

1774
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,700
But the course on that will be paved by Batman.

1775
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:19,420
The audio adventures.

1776
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:22,300
Check that out on HBO Max soon and other platforms after that.

1777
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:25,760
As for us, you can find us on all the socials at podcast, the ride

1778
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:27,860

01:40:34,460 --> 01:40:37,460
and evidently probably also exile on Main Street.

1782
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:39,340
Oh, yeah. Let us know what you think.

1783
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:40,540
Let us know what we should do.

1784
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:45,140
Let us know some ways to to spend the day because I guess we'll need them

1785
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:47,900
or we will or we'll like that day will fill up quicker than we think.

1786
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,400
Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, send it if you want.

1787
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,800
But honestly, I don't need it. I don't think I know.

1788
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:58,100
I'll be begging for it after my day run entirely by the Disney Genie.

1789
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:01,180
You see Genie on Main Street where you just choose like,

1790
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:02,180
well, what would you like to do today?

1791
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:04,280
I stay on Main Street.

1792
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:08,000
Hey, did you mean to select another land?

1793
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:10,080
No, no.

1794
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,200
Please proceed to anything else.

1795
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:13,700
Why are you?

1796
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:16,700
Genie, why are you still here?

1797
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:18,200
Turn your phone.

1798
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:19,900
You have to turn your phone off at that point.

1799
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:21,100
It's what we want. We're going to do it.

1800
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:22,740
Genie be damned. All right.

1801
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:23,940
Thanks so much for listening, Dennis.

1802
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:26,780
Thanks for being here so long. Bye bye.

1803
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:27,720
Bye bye.
