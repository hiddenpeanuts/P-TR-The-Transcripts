1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Happy Fourth of July everybody.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's right, we're here.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm Scott Garner with Mike Carlson and Jason Sheridan.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hello.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And it's a big one today.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We're talking Liberty Square.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We're talking lanterns and windows.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We're talking oaks that are replicas of other oaks.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Crooked shutters.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Crooked shutters.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I was going, I'm going to say crooked shutters

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
because I also know this crooked shutters situation.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I don't actually.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's thrilling to be here to talk.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Someone didn't do their research.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh man, this is what I live for.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
These guys find out about crooked shutters and I get to learn?

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, that's part of the fun of this.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's thrilling to be here to talk about the beginning of the American experience

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
at the end of the American experience.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Which is also a joke I may have made last year on Lincoln.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm not sure.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Or during the American experience episode.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Or during the American experience episode.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You mean the American adventure episode?

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh no, I look like a fool now.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh geez.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Some things got to be called the American experience.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's the great transactions you have when you use an American Express card

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
is the American experience.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's true, they're shiny, they're gold, sometimes pink.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
A lot of fun.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So we're doing Liberty Square, which is an area, if you don't know, in Orlando.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's in the Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And it is a salute to Liberty and our forefathers

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and the creation of America.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's a land based on Colonial.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Colonial.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Colonial times.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And there's a Haunted Mansion there too.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes, most importantly the Haunted Mansion is there in Florida.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Where the Declaration of Independence was signed and also there's a spooky house.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So why is this?

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I guess it's that there's two things.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So the Haunted Mansion in Disneyland is in New Orleans Square.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
They're probably thinking, well, here in Florida we are much closer to the actual New Orleans.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is it redundant to do a New Orleans themed area so close to New Orleans?

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This, of course, decades before a gigantic California theme was built inside California.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But they just weren't ready for that yet.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
They weren't ready for the layers of meta to exist, so they had to do something else.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But also it didn't really occur to me that in 1971 we're heading for the long awaited Bicentennial.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
America is horned up for the Bicentennial.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
America is wild for the Bicentennial.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's very interesting to me the history that this opened in because 1971 Disney World opens.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Nixon is president.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Vietnam is still happening.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
When did Vietnam wind down?

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Around then.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But like Vietnam and then soon after that Nixon reelected, but then Watergate.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So people not super jazzed about America at the time, but then the Bicentennial kind of like everyone goes all in for the Bicentennial it feels like.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I guess so.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, that is a crazy fact that when the Hall of Presidents opened, the current president they were depicting was impeached.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Or not impeached, but was headed for impeachment and resigned.

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Like as the Hall of Presidents was open, the current president resigned in shame.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
One of Walt's favorites.

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
One of Walt's favorite guys.

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
They took a famous monorail ride together.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
One of the weird California republics.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
California has created Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Walter Knott.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
This California streak of Republicans.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Schwarzenegger too.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Knott should have run for president.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There should have been a Walter Knott presidency.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Jam for all.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Jam for all.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That would have been ridiculous back then when people had shame, when people experienced shame of like, oh, we can't do this.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That would be shameful behavior.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
To vote for Walter Knott?

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No, for like a industrialist like that.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh, I see what you're saying.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Right, but now it's like a TV man.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, now it's a Huckster.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Now it's a P.T. Barnum kind of guy.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, we've come a long way.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's the thing.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Boy, you know, think of boy, America's divided and people aren't happy about the president.

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Sound familiar.

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's the thing I keep seeing places such as in the Laugh-In reunion special that I wrote to you guys about.

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Boy, when Laugh-In came on, everybody's met each other, including the president.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Sound familiar at much?

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yeah, you did.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This is your fault, Laugh-In generation.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah.

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You did it to us again.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You repeated the abuse of your parents.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
A great endorsement for the powerlessness of comedy.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The Laugh-In reunion special.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That is what they're saying though.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Like we healed the nation, right?

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Isn't that what Laugh-In is implying?

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Well, the special very much was all about that, right?

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah, and we were able to, you know, poke fun at ourselves and it.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And then they just proceeded to show a bunch of clips that were just completely racist and homophobic.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Presented as the goes, freeze speech.

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Freeze speech and then totally throwing away all of their values during the like go-go 80s during the like rise of Wall Street kind of 80s.

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But Goldian made some fun movies.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's true.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's true.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Without the Laugh-In people by leaving the fold as quickly as possible.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And not showing up in the special, right?

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No, no, no, no.

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
She said no.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Intelligently so.

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah, Rowan and Martin did not have to have a producer credit on every comedy movie or TV show made by alumni of Laugh-In.

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Before that system was cracked.

122
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They made a mistake though.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
They were rich.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Every movie Henry Gibson was in, they would have gotten a big cut of it.

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Can you imagine?

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Nashville.

128
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Wedding Crashers.

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The two movies I could think of that Henry Gibson was in.

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's pretty good.

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's two more than I could do.

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He's great, by the way.

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I, you know, while we're talking about the Bicentennial a little bit, right on my way out the door, I learned about I was like, what did Disney World really do for the Bicentennial?

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And they did a parade, Disney World and Disneyland did a parade called America on Parade in 1976.

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And there's a pretty good video of it, like with good, like custom sort of mainstream electrical parade-y music.

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And it's pretty well shot despite being a weird old 8 millimeter.

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Got kind of that red hue to it.

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But it's a fun video and the parade is fun to watch.

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It is mostly filled with scary dolls.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Oh my God, they're so scary.

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They had them out at D23 four years ago.

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Really?

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
A couple of them.

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And I was like, oh my God.

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Like human sized costumes that people would wear?

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah, but like sort of bigger proportions.

147
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I should find the pictures.

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Some were like, some were costumes of big puppet creatures.

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It was like giant small world dolls, but with kind of more soulless eyes.

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah.

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Like the mega pupils.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And it was pretty freaky in general, but there's this one part that I had to pull.

153
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Kind of notable one particular way they paid tribute to America in the bicentennial.

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And Jason especially, I think you'll enjoy what I'm going to play here.

155
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Wow.

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I've not seen that.

157
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's like a Dan Wood sandwich.

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah.

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, that's what I was.

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I was trying to think groups mentioned in that sentence, popcorn, candy, hot dogs, ice cream, big sandwiches, rubbing his hands together as he watched that.

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yes, literally true.

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah.

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I was Dagwood's a good way to put it.

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I was thinking it's like the kind of sandwich of like a junkyard cat would be a governing and I have a better photo of it.

165
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And the sandwich also factored into the Disneyland version.

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Here it is in front of the Matterhorn.

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Look at that thing.

168
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Wow.

169
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Mega sandwich.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If I could describe it for the listeners, it's the 11 layers.

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There's like a full egg in it.

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Entire olives, pimentos, just dripping lettuce and cheese.

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What does this have to do with the bicentennial?

174
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Well, in that justification, it's American food.

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This is somehow the most American food.

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Giant sandwiches are really American?

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I mean, I get hot dogs, ice cream.

178
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That all makes sense.

179
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But do you go to a cookout and get a giant sandwich?

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Now, wait a minute.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The official meal of America is a hamburger, fries and a soda pop.

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Right.

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Like that's the official thing, not represented in this.

184
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But not an 11 layer sandwich.

185
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
A really narrow sandwich.

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Maybe a very long sandwich, a better way to present a big loaded sandwich

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
than one that's impossibly tall to bite and it's going to topple over.

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What's the most amount of layers you've had in a sandwich?

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I think mine is just a club sandwich, bread, some meat and cheese, bread again,

190
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
meat and cheese, lettuce, bread, three breads.

191
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And that's it.

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's the highest I think I've ever gone.

193
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I think I've only done a third bread, yes.

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Jason's got something about this.

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You could not have set me up for this better.

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So Dagwood, beloved comics for character Dagwood,

197
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
is present in Islands of Adventure.

198
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
In the early days of Islands of Adventure, I believe it's still there,

199
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
the Dagwood's restaurant.

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And when they first opened, they served a big Dagwood, like a sandwich of that size.

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Was it 11 piece of bread?

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I think it was like six, maybe six layers or something.

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And I saw it in the window and we were like walking by.

204
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's like, oh, we could go here for lunch because everything was still new at Islands of Adventure.

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah, you played that real cool.

206
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We could just go here.

207
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I was like, look, the big sandwich.

208
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I was so excited to like the big sandwich, like in the cartoons you get to eat it here.

209
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's when we were talking about Blue Milk and stuff.

210
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That makes total sense to me that you would have been reading Dagwood your whole life

211
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
and you were imagining eating a sandwich.

212
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That makes total sense, unlike the Blue Milk, which I still think is strange.

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
To immerse yourself in Dagwood's world.

214
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What does a Dagwood taste like?

215
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But like in Looney Tunes and stuff, they would make a sandwich like that and then they crunch it down and shove it all in their mouth.

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Joghead. They've all eaten a big sandwich.

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So I was like, OK, this is going to be so great.

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This is going to be great.

219
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Edwin was startled by the fireplace, which has turned off.

220
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He's fine, folks.

221
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He's fine.

222
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's not bad, yes.

223
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So I got it and I went to buy it.

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Like because you can't eat that.

225
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Like you think it was truly necessary.

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You think it was truly a tall sandwich.

227
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What's in there? What's primary ingredients like deli meats?

228
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't think there was sardines in it.

229
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I think at one point they did it with the sardine like the fish was sticking out.

230
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And I just remember a couple of bites and I was like, oh, this is bad.

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Like this is maybe the worst thing I have ever eaten at a theme park.

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Oh, no.

233
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It was so bad.

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And I think it was just probably just loaded with onions in the way that like raw onions on the deli sandwich can just overpower everything.

235
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Like it was just a bummer.

236
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And I like I did not finish.

237
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I ate it because it was hot and it was hot.

238
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
We're hungry.

239
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The whole sandwich.

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
No, I didn't finish it.

241
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I like kind of picked it up.

242
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
OK, I see what you're saying.

243
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It was like I got a club sandwich once in the famed Carnegie deli now gone, but it was Jewish deli proportion.

244
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So it was like a club sandwich that was the normal look of club sandwich unwieldy.

245
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah.

246
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Like a heart like a quarter thing of lettuce in there and so much bacon and so much Swiss cheese and turkey.

247
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Like you have to it doesn't function as a sandwich.

248
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's a salad.

249
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You have to pick up a right.

250
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And you don't you can't like choose your own bites and you can't choose.

251
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's incredibly complicated.

252
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's why I like the best thing to order is like, well, just pastrami on bread or brisket on bread.

253
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Much much superior.

254
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So maybe that's where the mega sandwich comes from.

255
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Maybe it's more of like an old time deli thing where it was a taller sandwich.

256
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And that's an exaggerated version of it.

257
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah, possibly.

258
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Or just like like, oh, I'm at home.

259
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's time to make lunch and watch the game.

260
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm going to get really indulgent.

261
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Like moving his fingers around.

262
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:47,000
These kinds of sandwiches we're describing are mainly for sitcom purposes to be like stolen by a mischievous Olsen-esque toddler.

263
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Or dad, dad, dad, if forgets to eat it, it just goes right into his nap.

264
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He doesn't eat the same.

265
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
He makes the sandwich.

266
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yeah.

267
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But then he's such a tuckered out dad.

268
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And then there's like a gerbil or something in the house that he doesn't know is there.

269
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And that steals the same or like if you're say if an alien has recently landed and is starting to live in your house, he might he might steal it.

270
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Or it's for a character that's the best friend of the main character.

271
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And he's trying to eat the sandwich and he goes, come on.

272
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
He pulls him. He takes like a bite.

273
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But then he takes a bite of the air and leaves the sandwich behind.

274
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's good.

275
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah, that could be another situation.

276
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Or just if Jay Wellington Wimpy wants to switch it up one day.

277
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Is his first name Jay or is that just Jay Wellington Wimpy?

278
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
No, Jay, period.

279
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Well, I don't know.

280
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I don't know.

281
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I just saw it written down recently next to his picture.

282
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I was like, I forgot his full name is Jay Wellington.

283
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And Wimpy is his last name.

284
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah.

285
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
His Christian name.

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Oh, his last name is Wimpy?

287
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yeah.

288
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I thought that was just a nickname.

289
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Wow.

290
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Huh.

291
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So he's called Wimpy like if somebody was just calling you Carlson or.

292
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Right.

293
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Wow.

294
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Well, we got to figure out what the Jay is.

295
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Well, that'll be a whole episode.

296
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Figuring out.

297
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Figuring it out.

298
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The multi-part cereal type.

299
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Does this does the mega sandwich in the parade look appealing to you?

300
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It does.

301
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yeah, that one looks pretty appealing.

302
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It does have the fish on the top level.

303
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It does have the fish head.

304
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Let me ask.

305
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Let me before we get back on track to Liberty talking about Liberty.

306
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This is Liberty.

307
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Would you be okay if they turned Magic Kingdom Castle into a big sandwich?

308
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah.

309
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Why do you?

310
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
How do you even have to ask that?

311
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm thinking about I'm just saying like.

312
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
How okay would you be is really the.

313
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Cake.

314
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Cake.

315
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I would be.

316
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Spires are toothpicks with a little colored foils on top.

317
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Okay.

318
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And it'll be a just.

319
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It'll be a bunch of sale.

320
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It'll be different stacks of sandwiches.

321
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Ice cream towers are all fish heads.

322
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Maybe.

323
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Maybe.

324
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Or pickle spears.

325
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh, that's better.

326
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
This is almost easier than the ice cream cake castle or the cake castle.

327
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You're describing more of a platter.

328
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The castle will be more of a sandwich platter.

329
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's yeah.

330
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's a graduation.

331
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's a high school graduation party sandwich platter.

332
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Can we get Chapek on the phone for the 50th to turn the Magic Kingdom into a sandwich

333
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
platter to turn the castle into a sandwich platter?

334
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I mean, they've got art in their archives of like sandwich float.

335
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Right, right.

336
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
They know how to build a big sandwich.

337
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
This has been accomplished by Disney.

338
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah, they never throw out ideas.

339
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
In fact, that's a great transition back to Liberty Square, which was originally going

340
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
to be an offshoot of Main Street and Disneyland called Liberty Street.

341
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yes.

342
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yes.

343
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Which ended up in a Liberty Square at the end of Liberty Street was Liberty Square.

344
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yes.

345
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So it would have been both.

346
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
By the way, I want to go all the way back, but I can't let the big sandwich float pass

347
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
without saying that it was trailed by a little tiny mustard jar that followed it around.

348
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's really great.

349
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That's wonderful.

350
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The little bugs in the Main Street Electrical Parade.

351
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Okay, anyway, back to Liberty Street.

352
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I was just going to say instead of Tinkerbell going to the castle, it's the mustard jar

353
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
going toward the sandwich platter.

354
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's good.

355
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And then dumping out onto it.

356
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
There'll be some effect and it'll dump mustard on the sandwich.

357
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Just yellow glitter.

358
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Sure, fine.

359
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Could you dye the lagoon white so that it is like the big sandwich castle is soaking

360
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
in mayo?

361
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah, yeah, all right.

362
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Sure.

363
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Delicious.

364
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What if it's mayo with the ketchup mayonnaise so it's reddish and white?

365
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Mayo chip?

366
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Mayo chip?

367
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Thousand Island.

368
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Thousand Island's fine too.

369
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Thousand Island.

370
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Spread.

371
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Chipotle mayonnaise?

372
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Chipotle mayonnaise.

373
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's good.

374
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That has the pesto mayonnaise.

375
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah, you got a lot of options.

376
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Maybe dye it something to change the sauce up once a month.

377
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yeah, for sure, for the whole year, for that 50th.

378
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You can think of 12 different sauces suitable of the castle sandwich.

379
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah.

380
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Absolutely.

381
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And we, if they don't feel like thinking of them, we'll do it for them.

382
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah, we'll do it.

383
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Bob Chapek needs to let us know.

384
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Do we have to talk about liberty?

385
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Liberty state?

386
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
After all that, I'm like, now I'm looking at, now I'm staring at my notes that contain

387
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
the phrases one nation under God and Johnny Tremaine.

388
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So let's talk about this real quick.

389
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
As children, what were your feelings about America and all of this stuff?

390
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Because Walt was a big American history buff, very proud American, and I think many people

391
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
of his generation felt like that.

392
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Not that I don't, I'm very lucky to be living in this time and in America or whatever,

393
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
but we don't, I don't think, feel it like that anymore.

394
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And as a kid, I think I was kind of paying attention to American history.

395
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I know the basics, but I wasn't gripped by it.

396
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It wasn't, and it was the sanitized version of it.

397
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It was the exciting one where we were the heroes in most of the stories.

398
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I wasn't being told the nuanced version.

399
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The victors write the textbooks.

400
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Right.

401
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah.

402
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But I think even as a kid, I was just like, yeah, this stuff is okay, but shrank, shrank.

403
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Crank and shredder are more, I combine the two of them, which I think that actually they did

404
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
that once in one of the comics, but they didn't call them that.

405
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I was much more like, these stories are interesting.

406
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
There's turtles walking around, but I was like not engaged in Paul Revere and Johnny Tremaine.

407
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That's probably the story of generationally is we all, like this whole generation rejected

408
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
religion and history in shows, comics and Star Wars.

409
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Yes, it is.

410
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I guess that is part of the downfall, I guess, of America, too.

411
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
These are our heroes.

412
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I grew up outside of Philadelphia, so all of this stuff is background noise to me.

413
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Like you just made you less into it because it was just around all the time.

414
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It was just around.

415
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm sure it would have been much more novel if you did not live in the Keystone State,

416
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
if you did not live in the cradle of liberty.

417
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So because that was the easy class trips into the city is 20 minutes outside the city.

418
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So you kid up the Betsy Ross House, the Ben Franklin House, Independence Hall.

419
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Now the Constitution Center, the Liberty Bell, which you didn't used to be able for a while after 9 11.

420
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
A lot of this was locked down.

421
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And now they've kind of opened it a little more open it back up again.

422
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Yeah, I think they were going to like, yeah, we're going to blow up the you could just like push these places over.

423
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Well, for years and years, you couldn't go into the head of the Statue of Liberty.

424
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Just yeah, for a long time.

425
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And so and then we for like shorter trips, we would go to either like Washington, D.C. or New England,

426
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
colonial plantation, Plymouth, Massachusetts.

427
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I've been to Plymouth, Massachusetts, colonial Williamsburg.

428
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So I got a lot of it.

429
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I got a growing up.

430
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You're like like like sneak a kiss or like hook up with somebody in one of the monuments.

431
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
What do you think?

432
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Was there even like a was there like a high school like a handhold in?

433
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I did. We did do like a four or five day trip when I was a sophomore in high school called Close Up,

434
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:22,000
which I think a lot of schools have some variation of that either the school individually did it or combined.

435
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
A few different schools would go into a Philadelphia trip.

436
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I think people I've talked to grew up in other parts of the country would do like four or five days and hit like New York,

437
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Philadelphia, Amish country, Washington, D.C. would just bang out all of this.

438
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Sure. Yeah.

439
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But I got very little of with the California of like the missions and stuff.

440
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm assuming you got a little. Oh boy.

441
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm assuming you got missions.

442
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I definitely. Yeah.

443
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I don't know. I don't think I think I have somehow avoided missions better than other.

444
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And I never had to build one.

445
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That was a big thing. That was building missions and like the Michaels type stores around here do just off sell mission kits,

446
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
which kind of defeats the purpose of inventively building a mission out of sugar cubes or whatever.

447
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yeah, I would have been super jealous of you.

448
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I loved all this America shit in middle school.

449
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I was reading this kind. I had like a big coffee table book about Jefferson.

450
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Right. Because the presidents. You love the presidents.

451
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I love the presidents. Yeah.

452
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It's made everything so heartbreaking.

453
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The last few years, it's really, you know, the way the way I revered them.

454
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's yeah.

455
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I mean, I liked it to a certain extent.

456
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I just got a lot of it. Yeah.

457
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I just got a lot. Right.

458
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
A lot. It didn't spark anything because it was always there.

459
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It was around. It was always there.

460
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I did not like classic rock. Yeah.

461
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It was always around. It's a Beatles.

462
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
But it wasn't until later that I was like, oh, this is the classic rock I specifically like.

463
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I mean, all of it is very fascinating now.

464
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I find the very like nuanced American history fascinating, I think.

465
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And I was some smart kid who was like, this isn't the right way it went down.

466
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I didn't know. But I mean, it's it is a little homeworky.

467
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah. This section of Disney World is especially Hall of Presidents is homework.

468
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah. Like the American Adventure in Epcot,

469
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I think is a better representative of the American history because it's so weird, because it's so like weird.

470
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
As these little scenes, it's not just like it's not a long list of names and some of them sort of forgettable names.

471
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yeah. I'm just trying to make sure I don't forget anything, because I know I've talked about that.

472
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I cried and cried when the American Adventure was not open because I wanted all this homework stuff.

473
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
With the first time I went to Disney World, I was going to say my mom poisoned me,

474
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
but she poisoned me with education, with like knowing things.

475
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And then I've, you know, pushed all that out of my brain via beer and wine.

476
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
But I was psyched on all this. I was psyched on my Philadelphia trip.

477
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I think I've talked before about when I went to Philadelphia and there was like this movie that played at the museum.

478
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And then my mom looked up what the movie was and got a copy in the gift shop and then sent it to school with me.

479
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Have I told this before? I don't know.

480
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Forgive me if any listeners if I have.

481
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
There was a movie that played in the Philadelphia Independence Hall area.

482
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And there was this very dull 70 millimeter thing where the ghosts of the past returned

483
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:41,000
and John Hancock in a smoky alley is telling you about there was a dispiriting air that day.

484
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And like it was this weird. I've looked it up since it had a lot of the great actors in it.

485
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I don't think the movie was just called Independence or something.

486
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And we really liked it in the museum and my mom bought a copy and sent it to school with me to play in school.

487
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And then it was introduced like and this was brought in by Scott and his mom.

488
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So let's thank them. And I did a little like snooty like you were like, yeah, hell yeah.

489
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I got a shout out from the teacher. Did they go on a Philadelphia trip to the rest of the class?

490
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:24,000
No, no, no. This was a family trip. No, yes, because I had you see this was sent back to school with me in the fall.

491
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Make sure you have this video played. And it was I don't remember who any of the actors were.

492
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But truly it was like like imagine just imagine all the actors in Amistad like Pete Postle Thwait and like the you know these old guys

493
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
in starchy uniforms and speaking poetically about the mists of time.

494
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And this was forcibly played in a classroom and I was proud that I got it.

495
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So you should love Liberty Square. Therefore, I should be jacked up about this episode.

496
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I don't know what happened. I don't know when I turned. I guess I don't know.

497
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I got into things you're supposed to be into.

498
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
One more thing, because I did since you set up Dorky, if I'm the one that liked history,

499
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,000
another childhood memory I have is that there was a movie that came out called Jefferson in Paris that was about Jefferson.

500
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Like, I don't know, he took a trip to Paris and he like hooked up with a bunch of women or something.

501
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yeah, Jefferson and Franklin. That's the stuff they gloss over that they were like whoring around.

502
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Sure. Oh, my God. They also they were wild.

503
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Sally Hemmings was always presented as like and he had child with a one has a worse term.

504
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah, this is not a like coincidentally, a nice relationship.

505
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But what did you like? You're very young. Probably. I would imagine like 13. I don't know.

506
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
That's wrong. Maybe I don't know anything. Jefferson in Paris was a film.

507
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Oh, this involves Sally Hemmings. Oh, yes. It's a really sultry cover.

508
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Nick Nolte plays Jefferson. And I remember I was excited that there was a film in theaters that was Thomas Jefferson.

509
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
But then I found out it was about his love life. And I remember saying at a family party.

510
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah, I mean, it's cool that it's about Jefferson. But like, who cares about his love life? Oh, my God.

511
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And then a bunch of parents laughed at me. How old were you? Like 10? This is 95. Wow.

512
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
This was what I was like at 10. That's so great. I was the biggest wiener in all of America.

513
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I don't know. I was trying to master the Dick Van Dyke falling over an Ottoman.

514
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
That's cool. Honestly, that's closer to what I was doing. Probably, too.

515
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Don't forget, I was also imagining scenarios where I became the CEO of where I became Eisner. Oh, wow.

516
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
We should get it. If a time machine event was invented, interviewing you at 10 for this episode would be so great.

517
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
If there was a way. Oh, can I hear? Can I just say the movie is called Independence?

518
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It was made for this Philadelphia Museum, directed by John Huston, starring Eli Wallach, Pat Hingle.

519
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Whoa. Mayor Gordon. Mayor Gordon, Pat Hingle.

520
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I think what happened is I had all this in the tank for our American Adventure episode and then didn't get to it.

521
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
But here you go. Now you can hear my thoughts about how much me at 11 loved seeing James Tolkien,

522
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
eventual principal Strickland in Back to the Future playing Thomas Paine.

523
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And E.G. Marshall did a great job narrating. We got to do a Patreon on this.

524
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Look up, if you're listening to this and care, look up Independence 1976 and look at what a dreadful, what a deeply dark, depressing film this is.

525
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I want to do that Jefferson movie, too. Yeah, I never saw it. In looking it up really quick, it has a young Gwyneth Paltrow.

526
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Gwyneth Paltrow, one of her first goals. Wow. Lots to look forward to in Jefferson in Paris.

527
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:00,000
As a French lady of the evening? I think possibly, yes. Oh my. Man. Of course it's abound.

528
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
That's good. Wow. Maybe 10 year old Scott wouldn't have liked it.

529
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
It would have turned you off of American history forever if you had seen that scandalous film.

530
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
They were good men. They were chased to their wives as they signed important documents.

531
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Another theme park connection to this American history tangent, a place I've been a lot.

532
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Gettysburg, the Gettysburg battlefield visitor center with a essentially circle vision movie in it.

533
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And I believe was getting upgraded. But that was one in the Boy Scouts. I hiked all 13.

534
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
There's a trail, a 13 mile trail, and they give you like a big patch at the end if you complete the whole thing.

535
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Also up there, Dwight Eisenhower's farmhouse. That way he didn't.

536
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I guess that was his kind of summer home was a farm in rural Pennsylvania.

537
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Yeah, so that was and there is an Amish farm as well with like where they serve you family style and stuff.

538
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It was Illinois so it was a lot of Lincoln for me. And we saw there was a little, I forget which town it was in,

539
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
but there was like a house Lincoln lived in and there was an animatronic Lincoln in the basement.

540
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
What? Really? Yeah. So that's like the one memory I have of being like, oh cool.

541
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Lincoln was pretty cool. Look at this fucking robot. We definitely got to cover all the regional present animatronics.

542
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Yeah, I wonder. It would be interesting to see the history of it. My recollection of it was that it was good.

543
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Like it was in a junkie one. Yeah. But who knows? Maybe it was bad. Not as weird as that recent Garner Holt.

544
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Oh, the one with like the overly expressive cartoon face? Yeah, that they made kind of, you know, make as I'll say, kind of an O face.

545
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Yeah, and I also saw that at D23 four years ago. I've seen that in person was like, have we gone too far?

546
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Now, so in the the unbuilt Liberty Street was going to have technically have the Hall of Presidents.

547
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
They talked about this in the 1950s. Animatronics did not come along for a while.

548
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So if you can imagine one way to make the Hall of Presidents worse, what if they didn't move at all?

549
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
What if they were just haunting wax statues with audio played over them?

550
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I would be like, it was going to be mostly silhouette for sure.

551
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And then there was the second possible attraction. They are one nation under God or no, that was the one that was the show in the Hall of Presidents.

552
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But then there was the other one nation under God, the Hall of Declaration of Independence.

553
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Two of's in a title. No, not the Hall of the Declaration of Independence. Right.

554
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Yeah. So what did we get instead at the end of the 1950s? The Matterhorn, the moderate and the subs.

555
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
We got one stuff. Important decision in theme park history.

556
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I'll say this. That really started the course.

557
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Walt was a little indulgent about America. Not as bad as Walter Nott.

558
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Walter Nott came from the movies and I think that helped him realize that you did need to entertain people first.

559
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You got to put butts in the seats. You got to put butts in the seats.

560
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Yeah. And he got to hang out with Nixon as a result of the Mario opening.

561
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And speaking of Walter Nott, you do get kind of a vibe at Knott's Berry Farm of what that original Hall of Presidents might have been like,

562
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
because you go, there's a replica Independence Hall weirdly across the street at Knott's Berry Farm.

563
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
You go past the TGF right at his and the peanut store.

564
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
If you've hit the water park, you've gone too far.

565
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Yes. The water park is right next to the Independence Hall and it is the area is full of terrifying geese.

566
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And you go into a room where you watch an animatronic free Independence Hall show that's where candles light up in the places where all of the people in the

567
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
where all the signers, I guess, where the signers would have been.

568
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Is that what it is? Like, I think so. Their position in the in the room.

569
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
So if you go, these people shall be three quarters of a person.

570
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I guess that's the Constitution. I guess that's the no, no, no.

571
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Take it down to two fifths. I say I'm getting a call from an unknown number in Anaheim.

572
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Who do you think it could be? Whoa.

573
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Whoa. Chaypeck.

574
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Honda Anaka. Does he have a mission for you? The Lincoln animatronic?

575
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Maybe it could be any of them. I'll see if they leave a message.

576
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Mike, I need your help.

577
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
The you know what I did like historically, I like the twists on American.

578
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I like the musical 1776. I did like I guess the book Johnny Tremaine is not much of a twist, but I did think that was an engaging book and I had to read it for summer reading one year.

579
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
But in Philadelphia, at some point, they're like, we got to get more people out to these fucking things.

580
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
What do they like? Ghosts, the ghosts of the revolution.

581
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So there was nighttime tours, nighttime tours of the houses and stuff and like sightings of ghosts.

582
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So I did a thing like that in Colonial Williamsburg, another play of Cherished Childhood Trip Colonial Williamsburg.

583
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Yeah, there was a yeah, that a ghost tour as well.

584
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I don't remember much that happened, but but you get to watch candles get lit.

585
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Sure. Yeah. Right. A horse with a ghost.

586
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Or Plymouth Plantation. We all got like a cat like a lantern, a metal lantern with a candle inside to walk around the streets holding.

587
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Oh, wow. My mom, that's so much. She bought one of them.

588
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It does feel like if if Walter maybe had combined the Matterhorn with the Hall of Presidents or something like all the presidents are all along the Matterhorn and you get to zoom past all of them.

589
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Like people would like the president like like American history more.

590
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:01,000
If you combine the thrill ride with some actual facts, Paul Revere's ride like a Paul Revere's nighttime ride ride.

591
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
That'd be great. Yeah.

592
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I don't know what would be appropriate housing for the presidents.

593
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Would have to be an American mountain. What's in America?

594
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Good point. Oh, yeah. Like Rocky Mountains or Rocky Mountain.

595
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Rushmore would be oh Rushmore would be great.

596
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
A big, big Rushmore. And then it's like you take a roller coaster through their mouths.

597
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yeah. And you go back in time and see every president along the way.

598
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yeah, that'd be good. Like, yeah, something like that, I think, could have combined Walt's love of presidents with something much more exciting for the youth of today.

599
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Yeah, because right now the Hall of Presidents is I would say in Orlando, the most homework, homeworky ride.

600
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Right. Now, why do you say that as opposed to American Adventure?

601
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
What makes it duller? Is it the fact that it's mainly a list of names?

602
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I think it's a yeah, it's mainly a list of names.

603
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:08,000
A couple of speeches. I mean, American Adventure has an army of robots that are doing stuff different like different scenes.

604
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Yeah. Climbing stairs. I think it's a better structure, Joe.

605
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It's a tableaus form that's pretty exciting.

606
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yeah, tableaus. It's fascinating how it works.

607
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Yeah, yeah. Hall of Presidents is just a it's a movie for a while.

608
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Yeah. Right.

609
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And then you and then curtains lift and then you watch a bunch of mainly men staring, old men blinking, nodding, turning slightly, like fiddling with their fingers.

610
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I get that it doesn't sound very exciting.

611
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I think it was better before the current president got to speak because there is no perspective.

612
00:36:47,000 --> 00:37:00,000
You're lumping in a current experience with history where at least a few decades, not a couple hundred years have passed or a hundred years in the case of like.

613
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But you but also, I mean, is it easier to say that with there being a current president robot that we don't like?

614
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Like, wasn't it? I found it to be a pretty neat novelty that the current president was talking and recorded a thing you can only watch in this room at a theme park.

615
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I mean, I wasn't super jazzed to see George W. Bush speak.

616
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
No, certainly not. During the war.

617
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And now I know everything that was wrong with Clinton.

618
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
But when you're a kid and you just like presidents, obviously, I did you.

619
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Did you guys not think it was neat to hear Bill Clinton talk?

620
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm trying to really remember because I don't I don't remember registering that big of a I probably thought it was kind of cool.

621
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But I don't remember. I don't have I can't access that memory if it exists.

622
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah, sure.

623
00:37:49,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I was just like, oh, yeah, there's a president like as a kid, I don't this Liberty Square area didn't register very hard with me to the point where like I didn't remember the geography of it when I went back for the I had been I hadn't been to Disney World since I was 18 and I went at 28.

624
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And I was like, oh, OK. Oh, the honey man is right there.

625
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Yeah, it is.

626
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Like I don't remember where everything was.

627
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And I go, oh, this is like the colonial era. Got it.

628
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
OK. Like, it really like.

629
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
The diamond horseshoe is technically in Liberty Square.

630
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Not Frontierland.

631
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Yeah, it is interesting.

632
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I was reading about how the edges of Liberty Square, like as you you start to head towards fantasy land like Columbia Harbor House, the restaurant starts to get a little more European in design.

633
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And as you start to head towards Frontierland, it starts to get a little more western.

634
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
There's like transitional points from colonial to the American West.

635
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I was trying to realize we've like oddly covered a lot of this area in a way.

636
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,000
You know, you start getting really the closest thing you hit from Liberty Square heading to fantasy land is the tangled toilets.

637
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You right.

638
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And we've talked about the Mike Fink keel boats.

639
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
The Mike Fink keel boats.

640
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Haunted Mansion, obviously we're covering slow motion.

641
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
We'll hit you with part two in October.

642
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Hall of Presidents, I guess we have and we'll do a full separate Hall of Presidents.

643
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah.

644
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
We'll talk about Trump's arrival in there.

645
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
But mostly stuff being removed.

646
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
The keel boats are gone.

647
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
The Admiral Joe Fowler sailing ship is gone.

648
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Yeah.

649
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Was it a sailing?

650
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Was it like a riverboat?

651
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I think they were both Mark Twain.

652
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Yes.

653
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Right.

654
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
That's what I read.

655
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Yeah.

656
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
There were two Mark Twain's essentially and they were named.

657
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I have it down here.

658
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It was.

659
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
They were named after.

660
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
As opposed to the beloved author.

661
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Right.

662
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
They were named.

663
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
These ones were named.

664
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And then there was a former US Navy rear Admiral who was in charge of construction

665
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
at both Disneyland and Disney World.

666
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
And then who was the other one?

667
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Richard F. Irvine.

668
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Richard F. Irvine.

669
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
A stern wheeler named for a WED executive.

670
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So yeah, not as fun.

671
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
That one was renamed then to the current name, which is the Liberty Bell.

672
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Yes.

673
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Yeah.

674
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And there's two things you can do in Liberty Square.

675
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You can see the Liberty Bell, B-E-L-L, which is a bell.

676
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And you can go on the Liberty Bell spelled like Bell the character.

677
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Right.

678
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And that is a boat.

679
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Right.

680
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Bell and a boat.

681
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
They're both called Bell.

682
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yeah.

683
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Two Bells.

684
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Did you read what happened in the first one?

685
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
The first Mark Twain?

686
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Yes.

687
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Describe it please.

688
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I have it.

689
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
This is just from the Wikipedia.

690
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I'm trying to.

691
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I like that you are just referring to riverboats as Mark Twain's Kleenex tissues.

692
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Yeah, it's a brand name.

693
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It's a more effective term.

694
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Hold on, let me see.

695
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Yeah, okay.

696
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
It was retired after less than 10 years of operation and it got accidentally destroyed

697
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
after falling from a crane onto its dry dock.

698
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So a crane just accidentally dropped this poor ship and broke it.

699
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Fucking owned.

700
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,000
A big like old timey wheel just like crushed like a house of cards.

701
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Jason, are you not more upset about that?

702
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I mean, you know, I think it's...

703
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
One of your beloved steam ships.

704
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
They got one.

705
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:20,000
We actually in Florida, they got to the old Fulton's Crab House that is now called Paddlefish.

706
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
That is technically a riverboat.

707
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Oh wow, that's true.

708
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Yeah.

709
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So.

710
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I ate there last time.

711
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Is that a docked boat?

712
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I think it might be mostly building.

713
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Yeah, I don't know that it ever sailed.

714
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
But very nice.

715
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I had a great meal there last time I was in Florida.

716
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I had a good little...

717
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Yeah, I forget what it was, but I got something good.

718
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Do you have any particular opinions about the Liberty Bell versus the Mark Twain?

719
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I can't...

720
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I'm wondering if it was down for a pair.

721
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I really don't remember.

722
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
It was the last time you were on the Liberty Bell.

723
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I was last in Florida, last in Disney World 2012-2014.

724
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I don't know if I got on that.

725
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I definitely will if I go back.

726
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,000
One of those trips I did at Eat at the Infamous Liberty Tree Tavern that conquered Michael.

727
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
We've covered that also.

728
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
We've covered that quite a bit.

729
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
There's little pieces of Liberty Square.

730
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
We talked about the Bell Bell.

731
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Did everyone come across the anecdotes about the Liberty Bell they have in Liberty Square?

732
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Yeah, there's a lot of move on from the Bell Boat without saying that you got to go on this thing,

733
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
because in 2018 it got a brand new boiler.

734
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So get your ass on the Liberty Bell.

735
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Fuck.

736
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So with that being said, let's talk about the Liberty Bell.

737
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Go ahead.

738
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
But not the...

739
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
There's a lot of misinformation.

740
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
What I found was there's a lot of misinformation about this Liberty Bell.

741
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
We're going to clear it up.

742
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
So there's been a lot of fucking replica Liberty Bells over the years.

743
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
There's so many.

744
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
There's one in Wana Park at Nott's by Soak City.

745
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
There was a massive influx of them in 1950.

746
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Counterfeit Liberty Bells.

747
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:11,000
They made a bunch to promote a campaign to buy savings bonds.

748
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
That's what it was?

749
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Like Liberty Mutual?

750
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Someone.

751
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I'm not sure if it was a government or a bank.

752
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It's confusing if it wasn't Liberty Mutual.

753
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
A bunch were cast in the 50s.

754
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Okay.

755
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Now, the one that I kept seeing on Disney websites, the anecdote I kept seeing was in 1976, for the bicentennial, every state got a replica Liberty Bell.

756
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Pennsylvania famously already had a Liberty Bell.

757
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
The first one.

758
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
The first one.

759
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Duh.

760
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And so the others, that one was gifted to Walt Disney World to use.

761
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Is that what you guys came across?

762
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Yeah.

763
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I read a lot of things with a lot of attitude that was like, everywhere got a bell and then Pennsylvania realized, we already got a bell.

764
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Why didn't you guys take the bell?

765
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
It's a little too perfect.

766
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I don't think that is what happened.

767
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Yeah, it's not.

768
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
It's not, right?

769
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
No.

770
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
That story's too cutesy.

771
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
That story is fake.

772
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
What do you mean?

773
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Why would the whole state not want two bells?

774
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Why not?

775
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Right.

776
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
You would take two bells if you had them.

777
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Yeah.

778
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
What a weird rule.

779
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
The bells are fucking everywhere.

780
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
They're in state houses.

781
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
They're in college campuses.

782
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
They're like.

783
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
They're giving away.

784
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
We could get a bell if we wanted.

785
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I bet we could get a replica Liberty Bell.

786
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
From the mold.

787
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
End of the week.

788
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
By the end of the week?

789
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
That's tomorrow.

790
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
There's a holiday.

791
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Yeah, the holiday.

792
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Fourth of July.

793
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Yeah, that's going to hold us up.

794
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Everybody's ordering Liberty Bells.

795
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And everyone's horny for Liberty Bells.

796
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
That's peak.

797
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
That's like, you know, a lot of Jack O'Lantern needs in October.

798
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
A lot of Liberty, a lot of full cast iron Liberty Bell needs in the Fourth of July.

799
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
We should wait for mid-July.

800
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
All right.

801
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Mid-July we'll try to get our hands on a life-size Liberty Bell.

802
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Everyone's ordering Comic-Con stuff.

803
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Okay.

804
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Where are we storing it?

805
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
That outside your patio.

806
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Here?

807
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
No, I was going to say at the foot of your bed.

808
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I just got a storage out of it that I really like and I really would prefer to keep double

809
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
it up.

810
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
You're the only person whose place doesn't have stairs unless I'm wrong.

811
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
You've got to take a couple stairs up to get to it.

812
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Well, still the least of us.

813
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Probably.

814
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
We'll just got to roll the thing.

815
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It's going to get a lot of cracks by the time we get it to its resting place.

816
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Or everyone can sleep in it.

817
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
We'll put it on its side and then we can use it as a dog bed.

818
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
That sounds nice.

819
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
So do you have a real story?

820
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Do you have a real like how the Liberty Bell got to Liberty Square?

821
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I think it's just like they ordered it.

822
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I think it's like not even.

823
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I think that's right.

824
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I don't think it's a fun story.

825
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:37,000
They ordered, well, in fact, their Liberty Bell was installed on July 4th, 1989.

826
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
This very 4th of July, 30 years ago.

827
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,000
So happy 30th anniversary to the Disney World Liberty Bell.

828
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Enjoy that celebration.

829
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Happy 20th anniversary to Carlos Smooth featuring by Carlos Santana featuring Rob Thomas.

830
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
20 years.

831
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Really?

832
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
20 years this week.

833
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Yeah.

834
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
That's something worth celebrating.

835
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Now that's.

836
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I also have that the bell, if you hit it, it's an E flat.

837
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
The same key as smooth.

838
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Probably don't look it up.

839
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Yeah, don't look it up.

840
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
The oral history of smooth was excellent.

841
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I don't know if you read that.

842
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Oh, where is that?

843
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I forget.

844
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I wish I could credit the place, but look it up.

845
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
The oral history of smooth was fantastic.

846
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It really gives you a lot of context for how a hit song is made.

847
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Rob didn't even want to sing it or he was he was just going to write it.

848
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
It was going to be a big bolster of the songwriting career and he was suggesting George Michael sing it.

849
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
A whole different animal.

850
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
That could have been a real comeback for George Michael, right?

851
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Yeah, he didn't really have any hits.

852
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Kind of lying low after the arrest.

853
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Yeah.

854
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:53,000
He wanted to give that he wanted Mick Jagger to sing that the song disease and Mick said Mick just wrote a verse and said, I don't want to sing it.

855
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Oh, really?

856
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Yeah, he gave it back to him.

857
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Where else would it be?

858
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Rolling Stone, baby.

859
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Rock and roll.

860
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Rock and roll.

861
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
If it happened 20 years ago, Rolling Stone is on the scene.

862
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:11,000
There's another anniversary that I forgot to say on this particular July 4th.

863
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Another nice clean one.

864
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It was July 4th, 2009 to exactly 10 years ago that animatronic Barack Obama made his debut.

865
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Happy 10.

866
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Barack Hussein Obama.

867
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
You always make a point.

868
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I just think I just know you got to.

869
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
The robots middle name is that too.

870
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:45,000
This was back when the current the sitting president recreations were just inaccurate rather than ghastly.

871
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Other than monstrous and Depardieu esque.

872
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I have a question about the Hall of is the Hall of Presidency one attraction.

873
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I feel like we've talked about this in conversation lately off mic, but is that the one attraction they can't get rid of in Florida?

874
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Are they is that just a curse?

875
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
No, I think my feeling was that they could get rid of it, but it would have to be like six months before an election.

876
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
It has to be strategically timed.

877
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Even now, I think it would feel loaded.

878
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Now would feel loaded.

879
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:22,000
But I think I think if you do like six months before an election and as long as it's like, well, we don't know who's going to win, then they can just say, you know, wash our hands of it.

880
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I think it would be great publicity for Disney to get gift for free each animatronic to that president's presidential library.

881
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I think that's an easy fix, right?

882
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,000
That's like that's I mean, then they need like a program or they need somebody to maintain it.

883
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:48,000
But they would get so much shit for like stripping cutting heads off and then putting them as like the luggage checkers on Star Tours.

884
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Yeah, yeah.

885
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Like, hey, did you know, you know, actually, those animatronics, that's Lyndon Johnson's checking our luggage.

886
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Yeah, you know, that war burns voice, but it's in Lyndon Johnson's exoskeleton taft taft.

887
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It becomes Oogie Boogie.

888
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
They finally do Nightmare Before Christmas down there.

889
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
That's actually not bad.

890
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
They should just do that.

891
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Like I should all be stormtroopers on the new rise of the resistance.

892
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Yeah, we can add 45 stormtroopers.

893
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
We're just like oddly shaped stormtroopers.

894
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Different heights.

895
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
But all nail.

896
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
So Carousel of Progress.

897
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Put the president on the Carousel of Progress?

898
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:32,000
No, no, I think all the presidents Carousel of Progress are the ones that like we can't really get rid of these for different reasons.

899
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
But I could see them in a few.

900
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Well, I think this is we didn't talk about this at all really on the show.

901
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
There's been some rumors lately about classic attractions being changed or removed.

902
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I think they like soft test out the idea of removing these things every once in a while.

903
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Oh, and I think I yeah, I think I think they sort of try to gauge a reaction.

904
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I do think Carousel of Progress, they can't get rid of anything with the 50th coming up.

905
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I do think right.

906
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I think you've got to keep Carousel there.

907
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
But I think at a certain point they would love to get rid of all of these things.

908
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,000
They would love to get rid of Tiki Room, Country Bears, Carousel of Progress because they don't people.

909
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
They're not packed.

910
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,000
If you ever go in there, probably hard to maintain, hard to maintain, old time robots.

911
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Yeah.

912
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
And it's like, why do we even do that?

913
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I guess history and they're not as popular as pirates and on a mansion.

914
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Sure. So they see the idea of what if we removed it?

915
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:32,000
They give it to a website which goes on several bizarre rants and threatens and blocks everyone on Twitter.

916
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
The most volatile website.

917
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Yeah.

918
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Yeah, to test the water, see what happens.

919
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:46,000
But you know, that said, that website has assured us that their regular column, like here's some shit that's broken.

920
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Here's some pictures of shit that's not working is coming back.

921
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I'm also poking fun because like, yeah, somebody probably told them that rumor and there was some truth to it and whatever.

922
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Just be like, hey, I post rumors. It's OK.

923
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Yeah.

924
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Yeah.

925
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I post rumors when once in a while the rumors, they change because stuff changes.

926
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
A little too crusade, a little too Woodward Bernstein.

927
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Yeah, it's fine.

928
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
The truth, you know.

929
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:23,000
If you didn't know about the story, this website like posted, they got so defensive because Disney specifically said there's been some unscrupulous websites issuing rumors.

930
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
That's fantastic. I would love it if Disney blasted us.

931
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
No.

932
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Sure.

933
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Wait, all press is good press, right?

934
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,000
You know, how often does a fan site get fucking owned by the company that they cover?

935
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,000
If Disney were to put on their blog that they will not be turning the Magic Kingdom's Castle into a sandwich platter.

936
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
That is a rumor that was started on a Patreon only podcast called Podcasts The Ride.

937
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
That is not true.

938
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I would we would be thrilled.

939
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Yeah. So let's say here now that we were playing around with like, what if we invented that idea?

940
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
We have we have totally 100% confirmed Disney will be turning.

941
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
We'll never be proven wrong.

942
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:09,000
That's fine. One of our inside sources knows Bob Chapek and they were eating a sandwich with him and he goes, hey, here's a little bit of inside info.

943
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
We're going to turn the Magic Kingdom into a sandwich platter.

944
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
We turn the castle into a sandwich platter.

945
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
And people don't like it.

946
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Fuck them. It's a sandwich castle now.

947
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
That's true. Yeah.

948
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I hate my fucking fans, said Bob Chapek.

949
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
The only thing I hate more is these dreadful parks.

950
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
We're going to burn them all to the ground one day.

951
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Build condos and smelting refineries.

952
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Coal mines pollute the air.

953
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
That's well, that's what Bob Chapek says.

954
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I wish he would respond to us.

955
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So a couple of little design features of Liberty Square.

956
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:58,000
One, a friend literally what I said we were doing this told me this an hour and a half ago and I had it made total sense as soon as they said it.

957
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
But I was still surprised.

958
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
There is a replica sewage trough like in the street.

959
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:18,000
There's a brown sort of divot as a nod to history when people would throw their feces out the window into the streets and would drain through down this trough.

960
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
And there's only one bathroom in the land, technically.

961
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
There is one at the Harbor House as well.

962
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
The street?

963
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Yeah, you could have to shit in the street.

964
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
You're allowed. You can just go take a crap in the middle of Liberty Square.

965
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Liberty Square, in case you didn't know, the only land in any Disney park where you're allowed to shit in the street.

966
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Again, totally true.

967
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Totally true.

968
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Disney themselves told us this is fine.

969
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Bring it on, blog. Deny it if it's true, if it's false.

970
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,000
So yeah, the only restroom is in Liberty Tree Tavern because you have to legally have a restroom in there.

971
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Because it's a sit down restaurant.

972
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,000
And the Harbor House is on the outskirts of, even though it's technically part of Liberty Square, it's on the outskirts.

973
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
So they were trying to be accurate and not have a restroom.

974
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Weird. Who cares? They also have coke slushes.

975
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Like none of it's accurate.

976
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Yeah, I had to diet coke with my too much meal that I ate at the Liberty Tree Tavern.

977
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Columbia Harbor House, usually one of the better reviewed restaurants.

978
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I feel like my family liked it. It's a fish house. Fried fish and chowder and stuff.

979
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I haven't had that.

980
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Switch up from the burgers and fries that kind of everywhere in Florida.

981
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I really like Sleepy Hollow. It's a waffle themed stand.

982
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Oh yes, we had a waffle.

983
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Waffle sandwiches. Delicious.

984
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Yeah, and I'm looking at the menu. They have something called a hot dog pretzel pocket.

985
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
They shove a hot dog into sort of a pretzel roll.

986
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
That's American ingenuity at its best.

987
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
But Franklin himself would be proud.

988
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I don't want to just backtrack entirely, but I really, I don't know if we stated enough the fact that it is a big brown stripe that is ebbing and flowing throughout the land.

989
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:09,000
It just looks like a regular ground pattern, but discovering that it is representing...

990
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
It's sewage. It's early sewage.

991
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:27,000
That in colonial America with this charming architecture and with Thomas Payton walking around, that there would have just been shit flowing in the streets and then raining down from windows up above you.

992
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
You'd just be walking around and somebody would dump their shit on you.

993
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Anyone who romanticizes this era is insane.

994
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Ten year old me, somebody should have told me back then, keep in mind there was shit in the street, human shit everywhere.

995
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,000
If you traveled back in time to that, you would just be immediately vomiting because of the smell, because of the awful smell.

996
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Yes, and none of them would be because that's normal to them.

997
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Yeah, so yes, your first move. Would you like to see colonial times come with me?

998
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:15,000
That's what any time some weirdo far right maniac is like, well, we should take a lesson from Percy Thompson of the Massachusetts colony.

999
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
It's like, these motherfuckers, how much soap did these motherfuckers ever touch in their lifetime?

1000
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Like, really? Like, how many lessons should we take from these people who didn't know about medicine?

1001
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Yes, yeah, and the gun debate, certainly.

1002
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Let's remember what those guys said who walked around in their own shit and their friends shit and family shit.

1003
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Yeah, everyone died at 50. Everyone had like a knife on them at all times.

1004
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Except for like the founding fathers. They all lived in their 70s because they were doing well.

1005
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
A lot of them did.

1006
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Because they were like landed gentry. They sat inside reading and just like coughing up blood all day.

1007
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Was it like a taboo though if you were like sitting in like Ben Franklin's house and you're talking to him and he like had a shit bucket full of shit?

1008
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Would you like, would you keep it in another room or would he say, I must excuse myself for a moment to clean or to throw the shit bucket into the street?

1009
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Like how do they deal with it? Was that something that was just, well we know that's around and that's not a big thing or would it be like they...

1010
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I mean he was such a hedonist. I have no, he would probably just do whatever he felt like.

1011
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Well I mean not Ben specifically, but I mean like in common courtesy of others, was the shit bucket held somewhere?

1012
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Was the shit immediately thrown out when it was made?

1013
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I think that there were a couple things going on. I looked into this a little bit.

1014
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Okay, thank you. Good. Because I just was thinking of these questions now.

1015
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
It never occurred to me that there was not sewage and the colonial times were full of shit.

1016
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I can actually tell you specifically about Benjamin Franklin.

1017
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Because if you go to Benjamin Franklin's home in Philadelphia, as you did many times, there is a hole in the ground called his privy spot.

1018
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:04,000
And it's marked and called that. And so that, yeah, he had a shit pit.

1019
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
So he had a shit pit in his house.

1020
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:17,000
It was outside. And then there's another pit marked off right next to like a couple feet, just like six feet away, not even a person's length away.

1021
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And that was the well. That's where he got his drinkable water from. Look at a picture of it. They were so close.

1022
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
He was a notorious drinker too. There has to be a...

1023
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
He definitely got the mixed up.

1024
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
No, no, I'm saying he was a little out of his mind and he took a shit in the well.

1025
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:44,000
That's what I'm saying. Most likely or had no choice in the way if you're really sick, maybe you like, oh no, I threw up in the sink.

1026
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Right. The well was closer and he threw up. He'd vomit in the well and then drink water from the well.

1027
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Did he ever comically stumble and fall into either? Had to. 100%.

1028
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
He had to. 100%.

1029
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Upside down and got stuck like Winnie the Pooh.

1030
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Oh yeah. What was there every time when he fell maybe?

1031
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Thomas Jefferson had to come draw a face on it.

1032
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Thomas Jefferson is like a rabbit in this instance.

1033
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Yes. Oh dear. Oh, you've done it again, Ben.

1034
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Franklin tumbling into the well drunk, gets up, cleaning himself off, trips, falls backwards into the shit pit. Has to have happened.

1035
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Pops out and goes a penny saved, is a penny earned.

1036
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,000
The leaders of my almanac would love to hear about this amusing tale.

1037
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Wait until they hear about this in the almanac offices.

1038
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I will say something about Ben Franklin. I think as a kid I was amused by him in general. I felt like he was a fun character.

1039
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
He was fun.

1040
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Whether he was full of VD or whatever. I didn't know that at the time. The book, Ben and Me, I liked.

1041
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Oh, and the movie. The Disney cartoon.

1042
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Yeah, yeah, with him and the mouse, little mouse friend.

1043
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Yeah, voiced by Sterling Holloway.

1044
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Yes.

1045
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
So he sounded like Winnie the Pooh.

1046
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
How about that?

1047
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Sterling Holloway is one voice that was all of our favorite character. All of my favorite characters.

1048
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Yeah.

1049
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Fitch, Hitcher Cat.

1050
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
So, so yeah, Franklin.

1051
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
We thought of him as like, he was like America's Santa Claus.

1052
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Yes, I think that is probably right. I thought I was like, oh, I like him.

1053
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Bumbling, robust man with a lot of inventive ideas.

1054
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Right.

1055
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Who talked like this for sure.

1056
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Well, I have to give him credit because I'm sure other people back in colonial times had servants or when you crossed the Mason Dixon line, slaves to just clear out their chamber pots. So like took care of that.

1057
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Sure.

1058
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Oh, so you give him credit for not making a slave take his shit somewhere.

1059
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I.

1060
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Lindsay is questioning the Mason Dixon line.

1061
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Yeah, they all had slaves.

1062
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Oh, in his era.

1063
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,000
No, no, no, they still did. I think they abolished. They stopped having slaves.

1064
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
But that was later.

1065
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
It was much later.

1066
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I was not a history major. I was a television major.

1067
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:10,000
So I can tell you that at one point, Dick Van Dyke had a opening credit sequence where he it seems like he's not going to trip over the Hasek.

1068
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
The Ottoman.

1069
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Oh, I see. That's your recovery on this.

1070
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
That's my recovery.

1071
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I see. There's a line in his house that he was hoping to not trip.

1072
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Anyway, he trips over something else.

1073
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I see.

1074
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Yeah. Well, you know, he stubs. There's a couple versions. Actually, I know the answer to this too.

1075
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
There's one where he like side steps and then like trips on the carpeting.

1076
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
And then there's one where he doesn't do that.

1077
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I believe there's one where he survives fine and it kind of plays on your expectation.

1078
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Like seasons went on.

1079
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And then there is one where he sidesteps it and falls right into someone's shit pit.

1080
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
He's covered in shit.

1081
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Yeah.

1082
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Splash.

1083
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
And Rosemary has to pull him out.

1084
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Still in the 60s. Even if you were a successful television writer, you probably had a shit.

1085
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Yeah.

1086
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Right in your living room.

1087
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:59,000
You know, in fact, I was also it also made me think what was going on in the White House and the White House.

1088
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
OK, George Washington did not live in the White House.

1089
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,000
John Adams in John Adams is time he would he had to go to an outhouse.

1090
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,000
The first sitting president had to go outside in the yard to an outhouse to poop.

1091
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Thomas Jefferson was the first to say, how about water closets where we can fill up the pans and then throw those out?

1092
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
And there were two of those.

1093
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Right. And there were not there was likely no running water until Andrew Jackson and no flush toilet until Millard Fillmore.

1094
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Wow. What was film or how many presidents in his hey, you know, 1516 something.

1095
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
No, Lincoln 16.

1096
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Lindsay knows.

1097
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
A divider between slave states and free states as of 1781.

1098
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
1781 was the Mason Dixon line.

1099
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Franklin alive.

1100
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Franklin still alive.

1101
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
It existed.

1102
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
There was a line, but it wasn't have slaves above it.

1103
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Right.

1104
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
OK.

1105
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Well, I will read the thousand page Thomas Pynchon novel Mason Dixon to get caught up on by Mason Dixon.

1106
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I was look, I was in the history as a kid and then not for a long time until yesterday when I learned about President Toilets.

1107
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And President Toilets is who I'm throwing my support behind.

1108
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
2020 the heir to the toilets.

1109
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Fortune.

1110
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Yeah.

1111
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
President Toilets.

1112
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Jason Sheridan is President Toilets.

1113
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
President Toilets has a weird has the swoop.

1114
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
He's got the classic presidential coiffed hair.

1115
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,000
And like the debate is just like somebody's talking for like five minutes and then they go in President Toilets.

1116
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
How would you like to respond?

1117
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
And he just flushes himself.

1118
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
People cheer.

1119
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
People going nuts for President Toilets.

1120
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Better than what Biden was in.

1121
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
This is that is a laugh in sketch.

1122
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
There's a debate with Nixon and Nixon toilet.

1123
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Toilet sense familiar.

1124
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Goldie Hawn flushes it and then they all start dancing.

1125
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Yeah.

1126
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
They were the first to push the envelope.

1127
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
There was never a flushing toilet shown on television until then.

1128
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
So it faded.

1129
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
It faded to black.

1130
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
It panned to the wall as if somebody was going to get shot.

1131
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Oh boy.

1132
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Where were we?

1133
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Hey after all that talk about shit let's keep talking about food because there is a lot of that's really the main thing about Liberty Square.

1134
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
There's a lot of restaurants.

1135
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
There's more restaurants than attractions.

1136
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Yes.

1137
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
The Liberty Tree Tavern.

1138
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Yes.

1139
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Where Mike you had your your incident.

1140
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I forget when we talked about that.

1141
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
That is on.

1142
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
There's a Pirates Dinner Adventure episode right after my birthday last year.

1143
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
And that's when I come back from the Florida trip.

1144
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Yeah.

1145
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
There's basically like an all you can eat American style food thing.

1146
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
And I did it alone which was a big mistake because I had to get on a plane like so many times.

1147
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I had to get on a plane like soon.

1148
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
It was like the last thing I did at Magic Kingdom.

1149
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:06,000
It's the last time I was in Orlando and the last thing I did was eat an all you can eat family style buffet alone.

1150
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
All of those items available as individual platters.

1151
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Yeah.

1152
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,000
But I think I was looking at the menu and I was trying to figure out what to do because people had said that was a good place to eat.

1153
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
And it was like everything I saw was like well this is the thing to get.

1154
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
This is you have to get the all you can eat.

1155
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I forget. I don't know if it's all you can eat if that's what they call it on the menu too.

1156
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
So I wasn't like thinking it was.

1157
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I think it has a I think they dress it up in a sort of like old timey.

1158
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
They say like all you wish to partake in.

1159
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Yeah.

1160
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:44,000
The current branding I believe instead of all you can eat during the like obesity crisis I believe a lot of changes place a lot of places changed the phrasing to all you care to eat.

1161
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Is this one of those things Trump has dismantled and made right?

1162
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
We're going to be saying all you can eat again.

1163
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
We'll be so you folks.

1164
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
You will be saying eat until you're not hungry anymore.

1165
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
It's not that hard.

1166
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Those hungry boys those hungry football boys wanted their Burger King.

1167
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
They were little Burger King boys hungry boys.

1168
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Well if he hasn't done it I know president who will president toilet.

1169
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:17,000
If the more you eat the more toilets get fed across the street.

1170
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Come see me afterwards.

1171
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Wink.

1172
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
The ball of course is opening and closing is the wink.

1173
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:32,000
It doesn't work so well but I would think the jiggling the handle might be enough for a wink.

1174
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Because he has one eye.

1175
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
President Toilets has one eye.

1176
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Yeah so I had that and the first I knew I was in trouble when they brought the cornbread to start and it was clearly for a family of four.

1177
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Yeah.

1178
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:52,000
It wasn't just a little piece for me it was like a skillet of four giant pieces and I was like oh shit.

1179
01:06:52,000 --> 01:07:01,000
They're not changing this for a single man because I think I said on the episode I was waiting for a while and they do a whole little song and dance when it starts.

1180
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:15,000
It's like Smith family party of five right this way Smith family and they keep it's all family all families and then they're like Carlson party.

1181
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Right.

1182
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:23,000
You want right this way and I was like yeah and I'm like the Carlson man Carlson single man in his 30s.

1183
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I was the only person that was alone.

1184
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Everyone else was a family so they were not going to be like oh shit there's like a guy alone.

1185
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
What are we going to do here.

1186
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I don't know.

1187
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Just give him the four pieces of cornbread.

1188
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
We don't know.

1189
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
We don't have a way to deal with this.

1190
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
So they just gave me the amount they would give a family conversation.

1191
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Oh for sure.

1192
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
We're talking about me.

1193
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I think it was he ordered this.

1194
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Let's put that out.

1195
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Fair enough.

1196
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Maybe that's true but I don't think.

1197
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Well is he a large man?

1198
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Is he a big fella?

1199
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
No he's very lean.

1200
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
He's tall and lean.

1201
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I made a mistake.

1202
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Maybe his children are hiding or lost.

1203
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:01,000
But they should have just given me one piece and then the full they shouldn't have given me so much macaroni and cheese.

1204
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
But you ordered it.

1205
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I know but I'm saying since it's since it's family style they should have proportionally given me smaller amounts because they were using the same serving trays.

1206
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
They use for the full family that all digs in and gets it.

1207
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
There's a procedure.

1208
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
You paid for items that then you were given and you're complaining about it.

1209
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I'm just.

1210
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Over a year later.

1211
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I'm not complaining.

1212
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I'm just saying I don't think they have a procedure in place for a single man to order all you can.

1213
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
The procedure is you order one thing.

1214
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
You order a skid.

1215
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
The skid comes.

1216
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,000
But four pieces of cornbread for a single man isn't good.

1217
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
They're losing money quite frankly because I didn't eat all four of those pieces.

1218
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
They aren't losing money because nobody does this.

1219
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Margins dictate that they're the amount of money they're charging for that all you can eat.

1220
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
They're already making.

1221
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:55,000
But if you have a family of four if I had a family of four and we all ordered the same thing and it was all the same amount of money.

1222
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Now they're bringing a skillet of four cornbreads each having one.

1223
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
It's a giant piece.

1224
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
They're not having to pay for that for a single.

1225
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
You know what I'm saying.

1226
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
OK.

1227
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I guess everyone gets charged.

1228
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Everyone gets charged.

1229
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
So they're making the full amount of money with a family.

1230
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:17,000
They should have an option where there's just one little tiny skillet with one piece of cornbread for when I show up.

1231
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
That's what I'm saying.

1232
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
They need to make.

1233
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
They just need to make a hungry single man in a rush because I would have.

1234
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Have it thine way.

1235
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Because I just wasted food and I don't like doing that.

1236
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
It's plagued you ever since.

1237
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Why don't you just the food you made a mistake and then the food goes away.

1238
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I made a mistake for sure and I won't.

1239
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I won't make the mistake twice but I'm just saying if maybe Orlando becomes more of a destination where a man can wander around alone and come into a restaurant Disneyland I think they wouldn't make the mistake because they're much more used to people like me.

1240
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Roaming.

1241
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
We've all done it.

1242
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
The three of us have all been single men of roaming Disneyland.

1243
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
So not single.

1244
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Not single.

1245
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Okay you can go to the how about you go to a place that serves a full pizza and then eight pieces come out and you're like what's this different.

1246
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Well you can expect to leave you can box it up.

1247
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
All you can yeah you can box it up.

1248
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
It's going to be fresher if you order the whole pie if you want extra meals.

1249
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
You could box up the cornbread and they don't know you're on your way to the airport.

1250
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
It's complicated with all you can eat stuff.

1251
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
It's a little complicated with family style stuff.

1252
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
It's tougher because that's.

1253
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Because they don't want you they don't want it to become a thing that people hear about that they can take stuff to leave.

1254
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Right because then you could take a whole like three person.

1255
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Now you're taking three servings of the cornbread home and it becomes a problem for them if they have it happen a lot.

1256
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Maybe they wouldn't.

1257
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
It's not a problem.

1258
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
They have the money the desired.

1259
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Well it's not a problem because they're a very rich corporation and I'm not worried about them.

1260
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I'm just saying.

1261
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I don't think they've been crunching the numbers on this for 13 months.

1262
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:14,000
To say my family ate there last time we were there and we each got individual plot like I had a pork sandwich someone I'd write love someone I'd and we were so full and then we had foolishly scheduled a dinner at Calif like a late dinner at the California Grill on top of the contemporary that night.

1263
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,000
And we were just all sitting down going like I don't I don't want to eat.

1264
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
We're here.

1265
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:26,000
This was a pain to get this reservation during the fire because that's the restaurant where everything stops when the fireworks start.

1266
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Everyone goes out on patio.

1267
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000
They stop dinner service so the food doesn't get cold and then you come back in and sit down.

1268
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
So everyone's like what is light like what has getting the waiters.

1269
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
So what is the lightest thing you would recommend.

1270
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
You poor poor guys you had too much delicious food.

1271
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,000
On your vacation too much food on your fun trip to Florida.

1272
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I've been better.

1273
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Yummy.

1274
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
It's a very sympathetic tales.

1275
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:02,000
The day before I think we had dinner to at least celly a another big portion place and that morning had had the breakfast buffet at the Hard Rock Hotel.

1276
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Oh my god did not.

1277
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
We're trying to ambitious with our eating plans that trip way too ambitious.

1278
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Jason I'm so sorry this happened to you.

1279
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Thank you.

1280
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I mean I understand Mike's quandary.

1281
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I get it.

1282
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I get it.

1283
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I know you would come around.

1284
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I get it.

1285
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
You understood the buffet situation and it's because it's different.

1286
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
It's also this is the last thing I'll say.

1287
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
It is not a traditional buffet like a hometown.

1288
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I am allowed to come and take the portions that I want.

1289
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
They give it a certain.

1290
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I almost sounded like Craig.

1291
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
They give it a certain food.

1292
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,000
They give you a certain plate that is full of the portion they normally do for a full family.

1293
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
There wasn't a sampler.

1294
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:47,000
There wasn't like a best of the best of the in option like the taste of Italy at Olive Garden where you get one and one and one.

1295
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I missed it.

1296
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
OK.

1297
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
What was the name of the item?

1298
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I should look it up because if you're picturing a buffet and then that's not what if it's called a buffet that's one thing.

1299
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Hold a buffet.

1300
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Well then you don't have then that buffet argument is out the window my friend.

1301
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I mean I would have loved to see you eating with a fork out of a styrofoam container on like a Delta flight back to Los Angeles.

1302
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I mean it's the Patriots platter because it's turkey.

1303
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
It's a lot of food.

1304
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Mm hmm.

1305
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
But it doesn't.

1306
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Well this hold on.

1307
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I have to find the actual menu.

1308
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I'm on the official menu the official Disney.

1309
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
All you care to enjoy.

1310
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
So you got the Patriots platter.

1311
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Patriots.

1312
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
But all you care to enjoy.

1313
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I would think they bring you a piece of cornbread.

1314
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
And I say my good man I'd like another piece of cornbread please.

1315
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
And they go of course.

1316
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
It's a theme park.

1317
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
They're not going to.

1318
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
OK.

1319
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
So next interaction.

1320
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Sir how many would you wait.

1321
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
What are you picturing.

1322
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
What bizarre restructure.

1323
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Oh wait a minute.

1324
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
It's like no other restaurant on earth.

1325
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,000
As I'm thinking this if there's eight people doing it they have to bring out.

1326
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
They would have to bring out more cornbread.

1327
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
So there should be a smaller and now as I look at this.

1328
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
There should be more.

1329
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
There should be more.

1330
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Entree items are you can get your pot roast is lunch weight.

1331
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
The pilgrims feast is turkey breast.

1332
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Turkey pot pot.

1333
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
So there is no sampler if you want to try everything.

1334
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Right.

1335
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Take me through.

1336
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
You sit down.

1337
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
What is supposed to happen when you order.

1338
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Hold on.

1339
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Their lobster roll is lobster salad and fried clams on it.

1340
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
That's fucked up.

1341
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
That is very weird.

1342
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
That's another 30 minutes.

1343
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
We still have to finish.

1344
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
OK.

1345
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
So all all Mike.

1346
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:39,000
My only complaint is is that the Patriots platter is all you care to enjoy for a family and they come out.

1347
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:45,000
They bring you a big four piece four pieces of cornbread big pieces in a big skillet.

1348
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Great.

1349
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:52,000
And it's great because most of the people there are families that makes total sense family of four or five or whatever.

1350
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And then you have the ability to say I'd like more cornbread please because it's all you care to eat.

1351
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
So you could order more of anything.

1352
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
That's what they told me.

1353
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
More of anything you'd want.

1354
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Right.

1355
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:06,000
But they don't have smaller portions for one even two people.

1356
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Four pieces is too much.

1357
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Even if they had just brought a platter of two that I would say I would have felt much less guilty not eating.

1358
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:20,000
There's somebody else out there who does want the whole all the cornbread for himself and they don't bring it all to him and he's like what the fuck.

1359
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Well but then he just says oh can I have more cornbread and they bring him more cornbread.

1360
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Yeah.

1361
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
They're the starting amount separately.

1362
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
100 percent.

1363
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
They have to do this.

1364
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
They don't have to do it.

1365
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
They have to invent a system for only the patriot platter.

1366
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
There's no system.

1367
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
They just have to say there's one guy there.

1368
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Let's give him one piece or two pieces.

1369
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:44,000
One to eat while you wait for your meal and then one to have with the meal for scooping and dipping.

1370
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
To palate cleanse.

1371
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
To palate no scooping and dipping.

1372
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
You guys this is the most complicated restaurant math.

1373
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
I think everyone is going to understand exactly what I'm saying.

1374
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I just wanted smaller plates because I was a single man and not with a family.

1375
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I didn't know your family's not in the bathroom.

1376
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Because I made it very clear I was alone.

1377
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:08,000
I've come around because it says all you care to enjoy Bill of Fair and it is like that as like one menu item.

1378
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
It's not saying necessarily.

1379
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Right so it didn't say.

1380
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
It didn't say.

1381
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Okay all you can care to eat Bill of Fair.

1382
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
You start with a declaration salad.

1383
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Mix greens with house made dressing.

1384
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Then you get the patriot platter.

1385
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Roasted turkey breast.

1386
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Pot roast.

1387
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Oven roasted pork.

1388
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Mashed potatoes.

1389
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Seasonal vegetables.

1390
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Herb stuffing.

1391
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Mac and cheese.

1392
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
You're fucking insane already for having ordered this.

1393
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I am.

1394
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
That's a long list.

1395
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
It's a long list.

1396
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I agree.

1397
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
And then hold on.

1398
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Hold on.

1399
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Ooey gooey toffee cake for dessert.

1400
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
And it was like a serving of ooey gooey toffee cake for three or four people.

1401
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
That actually.

1402
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
As it is supposed to be.

1403
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
You are not for a single man.

1404
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Well wait ooey gooey toffee cake is on here as an a la carte item dessert for eight dollars.

1405
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,000
That was probably you got that included in whatever you paid.

1406
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:03,000
You probably did financially rather than ordering all of this stuff a la carte.

1407
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
You probably made the correct financial decision.

1408
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I agree with you.

1409
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I'm not actually upset about my financial decision.

1410
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about here.

1411
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
The value is fine.

1412
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I'm actually concerned about the restaurant.

1413
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
That's what I'm concerned about.

1414
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:22,000
You're concerned about a bulk food restaurant at a theme park that due to this one interaction

1415
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
that they wasted two rolls.

1416
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Now hold on.

1417
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
The game has changed.

1418
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Because now I'm looking at the dinner version.

1419
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:36,000
At a dinner you have the choice of dessert of ooey gooey toffee cake, warm banana cake,

1420
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
or apple fritters.

1421
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Or.

1422
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Could you order all three?

1423
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Now I bet you're paying a premium for dinner.

1424
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I bet you're paying a premium for dinner.

1425
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I mean obviously yes you should be able to.

1426
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:56,000
If the menu said you will be brought out a platter for four people of all of these.

1427
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Every item is for four people and that's what you're getting.

1428
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Once again what menu has specific instructions.

1429
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
You want a fucking book to go with this one.

1430
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
This lead.

1431
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
This lead.

1432
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
This does not say serves a family.

1433
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
This is an all you care.

1434
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Right.

1435
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
It doesn't say serve a family.

1436
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
All you care to enjoy Bill of Fair.

1437
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Right.

1438
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
If it was a regular buffet I would feel much more comfortable going oh I'll have a little

1439
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
scoop of this.

1440
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I'll try all of the items and that's what that indicates.

1441
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
It doesn't say we're going to bring you out.

1442
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
It doesn't say the word buffet.

1443
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
So much.

1444
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
But all you care to enjoy is I'm saying like if it was.

1445
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I gotta say it's also leading on this menu.

1446
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Like it's the top item.

1447
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
So it's what they're leading with.

1448
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
That's what they're leading with.

1449
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
That is the item you should get.

1450
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
So in all you can eat you order an all you can eat thing and then lots of food comes

1451
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
out and you are upset about it to this day.

1452
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I'm not upset but it's not something I'm dwelling on.

1453
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
We're talking about Liberty Square but now I'm reliving it and I'm saying they put all

1454
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
of this food in front of me and I felt an urgency to eat it.

1455
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
So they didn't do anything wrong.

1456
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
And they didn't book the flight that close.

1457
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
No of course they didn't.

1458
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
You did this to yourself.

1459
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
So you've added that stress.

1460
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Yes 100 percent.

1461
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
It's four hours.

1462
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Yes that's true.

1463
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Yeah.

1464
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Wait a second.

1465
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Very important.

1466
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
The Liberty Tree Tavern did not book your flight.

1467
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,000
They did not book my flight but they did put four large pieces of cornbread to start.

1468
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
How dare they.

1469
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I'm in trouble.

1470
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
These monsters.

1471
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Lock them up.

1472
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
But then I wasted food and I felt bad about it.

1473
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
I think we haven't touched on this.

1474
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
This is a popular restaurant.

1475
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Good word of mouth.

1476
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Yes.

1477
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
So for now.

1478
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
But when the word gets out of it.

1479
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
It's a wasted cornbread.

1480
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:37,000
But I think they may have brought out a large portions so they didn't have to keep coming

1481
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
back.

1482
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
So they're like there's no way I will have to I'm going to take care of this.

1483
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Who knows how many.

1484
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
It's always.

1485
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Yes that is probably the situation is that they brought they just they don't want to

1486
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
have to keep coming back more.

1487
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
They would rather go big the first time and not have me go another piece please.

1488
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Like they don't want to do with that.

1489
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
That is the thinking behind it.

1490
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Funny story in my family about this restaurant.

1491
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:03,000
My uncle Joey was down there with his wife and there was a guy one table over and they

1492
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
started up a conversation.

1493
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Both parties had the Disney dining plan where you are allocated like certain meals you're

1494
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:16,000
allocated to me like you get a meal and a drink and dessert and sometimes an appetite

1495
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,000
and like the guy at the other table is like hey do you guys want our dessert.

1496
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I can't.

1497
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
I'm a big guy.

1498
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I can't eat this much.

1499
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,000
They give you so much food on this dining plan and as he's saying this my uncle looks

1500
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
down and realize the guy is wearing a Super Bowl ring.

1501
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
So this is a professional football player who has won the Super Bowl.

1502
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I don't remember who it was.

1503
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
It was for sure a Super Bowl.

1504
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
It was a Super Bowl because then he asked him about it.

1505
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
He's like oh yeah I played for a few years for blah blah blah for the Bills or whatever

1506
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
you know.

1507
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:53,000
And it's so like he was still a tank of a man and even he was like this fucking this

1508
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
restaurant's dining plan.

1509
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
They give you so much food on these things.

1510
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Wow.

1511
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:04,000
It wasn't just a guy wearing a souvenir ring doing stolen stolen Super Bowl valor.

1512
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,000
So now so yeah so heavy Porsche I mean is his failed professional football players award

1513
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
winning professional football players.

1514
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
We'll see.

1515
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
People will rule I think on this issue if I have a point here.

1516
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I know they're going to rule against me but I know how these things go but I'm just saying

1517
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,000
the the the sorted tale where four roles are brought to you.

1518
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
It's not a tragedy.

1519
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
I'm not trying to say I'm some persecuted individual.

1520
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I'm just saying that that for a man trying to try it out go with a smaller plate.

1521
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
All I'm saying is a smaller plate.

1522
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
That's all I'm trying to say.

1523
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I'm not going to commit us anything but should the nation should something arise where all

1524
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
of us are in Orlando could you imagine.

1525
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
I think we got a think we got a save.

1526
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I think we have to do it with an hour before our flight.

1527
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Yeah we have to do a less time than I have to reproduce the conditions.

1528
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Yeah that's true.

1529
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Palpitations.

1530
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Here's what we have to do.

1531
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
What we have to do.

1532
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
We have to make separate reservations.

1533
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
We will not sit at the same table.

1534
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Yeah we will each make single reservations and then each go and deal with the amount

1535
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
of food they give each.

1536
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I don't like to be looked in the eye while I eat like a street dog.

1537
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Yes.

1538
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
All right.

1539
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
So that's that's for sure.

1540
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
If we go to Orlando.

1541
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Wow.

1542
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Each get one of these.

1543
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Can we talk about so this is totally unrelated.

1544
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Mike Mike you I mentioned this very briefly before the show Scott I don't think this you

1545
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,000
would come upon this one the crooked shutters another design element the crooked shutters.

1546
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
We said the beginning I don't know what's up with crooked shutters.

1547
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Yeah.

1548
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Do you know it's basically in the like the shutters are crooked in the area because in

1549
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
the old times they needed to they needed metal.

1550
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Yeah there was not a lot of metal being shipped during the Revolutionary War.

1551
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
There was a shortage of metal.

1552
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Right.

1553
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
So they would take the metal pieces out of whatever were they just those were the things

1554
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
that held the shutters in I think.

1555
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Yeah they were melting it down for bullets and they would do it.

1556
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
They would turn it into the government to turn into bullets and then they would use

1557
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
leather straps to fix the shutters to the house or whatever.

1558
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
OK.

1559
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
And so they did they made them going to be crooked because that wasn't the best way to

1560
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
put shutters on leather.

1561
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Leather softens as it starts to age.

1562
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
So the shutters would shutters are crooked.

1563
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
There is a tribute to this real life thing that happened.

1564
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Yeah.

1565
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
So how about that.

1566
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Just as the Liberty just as the tall oak next to the Liberty tree tavern is a tribute to

1567
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,000
the real Liberty tree that used to be near Boston Common.

1568
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:44,000
There were acts of rebellion until some loyalist scumbag chopped it down in 1775.

1569
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Oh really.

1570
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
It got.

1571
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Oh yes.

1572
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Nathaniel J.

1573
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Coffin chopped it down.

1574
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Bastard.

1575
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Bastard.

1576
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
He's in a coffin now.

1577
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Thank God.

1578
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Your trees are safe every one.

1579
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Liberty tree.

1580
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
I didn't even know there was a Liberty tree I think.

1581
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Here's how much I veered from knowing about history is that when I heard about the Liberty

1582
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
tree I didn't think about the history.

1583
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I don't think I knew much of anything about it.

1584
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:17,000
What I thought of was is something that I do know the full history of which is football

1585
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
player wraps.

1586
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Obviously everybody knows the Super Bowl shuffle but people might not know the many other

1587
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
football wraps that occurred including that.

1588
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
So the Super Bowl shuffle was made in 1870.

1589
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:40,000
So the Super Bowl shuffle was made in 1985 before the Super Bowl that was the Bears

1590
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
versus the Patriots and they hadn't won the Super Bowl.

1591
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
It wasn't a song celebrating that they won.

1592
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:51,000
It was that they're going to win and the Patriots were like fuck this we got to get a song

1593
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:57,000
out too and their song was so much worse and the song is called New England the Patriots

1594
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
and We.

1595
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
It is markedly worse.

1596
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,000
The Patriots lost the Super Bowl and they deserve to purely for their terrible song

1597
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:12,000
and let me tie it all together and tell you to show you why I think of that with this

1598
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
topic.

1599
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Here's a little taste of New England Patriots and We.

1600
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
That's that's that.

1601
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I don't know who that player is but that very flat will hang a bell from the Liberty tree.

1602
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
That is not as fun as the Super Bowl shuffle.

1603
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
It is much worse.

1604
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,000
It's even less qualified rappers.

1605
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I think another one is here's a V for Victor Rhee.

1606
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Crap song.

1607
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:51,000
I will I'll just say if you I don't know how far we can stretch the confines of this podcast

1608
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:57,000
but if there is any interest in a full history of football raps this is a if that somehow

1609
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:02,000
counts this is a topic I can speak to at length.

1610
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
There is either on it there are like 20 of those.

1611
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,000
I was going to say how many do you know off the top of your head?

1612
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Super Bowl shuffle Patriots and We, Ram It, Buddy's Watching You, Philadelphia Eagles

1613
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
won.

1614
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
There's got to be some baseball ones in there.

1615
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I can only name four.

1616
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
There's definitely more.

1617
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Okay.

1618
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Well, then I mean we'll do it.

1619
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Yes.

1620
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Great.

1621
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Football raps coming at you.

1622
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
What did we miss?

1623
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Very few additions over the years.

1624
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Memento Mori the Haunted Mansion shop added in the last few years.

1625
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
For years there was not a Haunted Mansion shop just a little cart.

1626
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
The Liberty Square pillory.

1627
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
The stocks.

1628
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Yeah, that's fun.

1629
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
That's real fun.

1630
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Yeah.

1631
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:57,000
At some point you kids would be deemed sons and daughters of Liberty and hand it declarations

1632
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
of independence and a ceremony.

1633
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Is that true?

1634
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Yeah, I saw it.

1635
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
There's footage of like a 1970s.

1636
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
They don't do that anymore, do they?

1637
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I don't know.

1638
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
We got to get you that certificate.

1639
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
There's still a town crier.

1640
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I mean you met the restaurant crier but there is a town crier who shows up.

1641
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
JJ who shows up in the Muppets.

1642
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Oh yeah.

1643
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Present great moments in Muppet history.

1644
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
We didn't even touch on that.

1645
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
That's probably worth its own episode.

1646
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:23,000
That is worth its own episode but we've talked a little bit about it and I, you have not,

1647
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
oh yeah, I've not really seen it.

1648
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
I saw a little video clips.

1649
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
It's the greatest.

1650
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
It's very fun.

1651
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
It's really great.

1652
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Money.

1653
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Real puppets, real puppeteers.

1654
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Real puppets.

1655
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
There's a couple different shows.

1656
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
I think so many yelled at me for saying there were too many like four maybe.

1657
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
There's at least two.

1658
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
There's two.

1659
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Paul of Vier and Declaration of Independence.

1660
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,000
And then like they're in the different spots in different buildings like Sam Eagle's over

1661
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
in the Hall of Presidents one time.

1662
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Oh so you don't know where they're going to appear.

1663
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Yeah and they're real puppets and it's, and it's also, it's probably the only thing that's

1664
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:57,000
like self-referential about American history because in the main song it's like we're singing

1665
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,000
about American history or singing about great moments in history but only the American parts.

1666
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
And there's like a nice, there's you know like Muppets joking about Sam Eagle.

1667
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Just that little bit of subversiveness.

1668
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Yeah.

1669
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
That's great.

1670
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
There was, I'm trying to think there was something like they apologized to the British people

1671
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,000
in the audience for like the take on something like whatever they were like because they're

1672
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:21,000
basically they're just reenacting famous moments in history and they fuck it up because they're

1673
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
the Muppets.

1674
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Yeah.

1675
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
And it's great.

1676
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
And the real voices in it.

1677
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Yeah.

1678
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
I believe so.

1679
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
That's cool.

1680
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Yeah.

1681
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Yeah it seemed like Steve Whitmire pre, they're not seeing Steve Whitmire.

1682
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Right.

1683
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Before the incidents.

1684
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Or incident whatever we, yeah.

1685
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Yeah.

1686
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
So yeah that's really great and is so fun.

1687
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Yeah.

1688
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Well that's, it seems like they finally figured out a way to if we're filling this area is

1689
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
too homeworky.

1690
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Yeah.

1691
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Give us some of our friends.

1692
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Give us some of our beloved characters.

1693
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I want a little, I want it a little coarser.

1694
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I want the all of Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States.

1695
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Oh yeah.

1696
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Yeah.

1697
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:03,000
The book they hand you with your dorm keys at every liberal arts college in America.

1698
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Uh huh.

1699
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
And who's in there?

1700
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Oliver Stone and Michael Moore and.

1701
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Sure it's a little more dry.

1702
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
It's a little more dry.

1703
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,000
The history of the indigenous people and working people and stuff.

1704
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Yeah.

1705
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
It's more just like a lot of this.

1706
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
It's not just like a quick sound bite.

1707
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,000
It's like 15 minutes of somebody saying how they were subjugated.

1708
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Yes.

1709
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Yes.

1710
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Or add Noam Chomsky into the Hall of Presidents and have him like after every dialogue like

1711
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
here's why that's bullshit.

1712
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Well they should close it out.

1713
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Like the last show of the night should run like an hour and a half and should have addendums.

1714
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Oh yeah.

1715
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Like their THO Martin.

1716
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Hall of Presidents after dark.

1717
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
And now for the Hall of Presidents rebuttal.

1718
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
It's like a little.

1719
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
It's body.

1720
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
It's body.

1721
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
It's body.

1722
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Yeah.

1723
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Yeah.

1724
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
More fun.

1725
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Well then it's the big, it's the Hall of Mistresses.

1726
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Oh yeah.

1727
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
There's not enough room in that building for all the mistresses.

1728
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Yeah.

1729
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I really wonder if you added every extramarital affair with the 45 presidents.

1730
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:15,000
If you are in the performing arts community in Orlando and you have not done the Hall

1731
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,000
of Mistresses at the Orlando Fringe yet, what are you doing?

1732
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Get on that.

1733
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
What are you waiting for?

1734
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
What?

1735
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Yeah.

1736
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
They, that would be, they would have to shut.

1737
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,000
What if they shut Carousel Progress and Country Bears down and just put the mistresses in

1738
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
there?

1739
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
They would need both campuses.

1740
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Yeah, do both of them.

1741
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Now for part two.

1742
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Yeah.

1743
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
It's 1901 so head over to the.

1744
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Yeah.

1745
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
The post-industrial mistresses.

1746
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
I think that's fine.

1747
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Sure.

1748
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Hey, just grab back what we missed.

1749
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
The parasol cart.

1750
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Oh yeah.

1751
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:56,000
The pretty squares where you get yourself a pretty parasol.

1752
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Which is probably something we should do when we, let's see if they'll customize.

1753
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Let's see if they'll, because they got purple parasols.

1754
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
They do.

1755
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Let's get a parasol.

1756
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
It says podcast the ride.

1757
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Yeah.

1758
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Ye olde Christmas shop.

1759
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Mm-hmm.

1760
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Or it's Christmas all year round.

1761
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Yeah.

1762
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Yes.

1763
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
That's, we have a Christmas shop here too now.

1764
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Kind of, there's a little section.

1765
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Right.

1766
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
But it's, yeah, that is, I was shocked.

1767
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I was like, oh wow.

1768
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
What's this doing here?

1769
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
When I was there in Florida.

1770
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Yeah.

1771
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:31,000
I mean, America is very instrumental in the history of the way Christmas is celebrated.

1772
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Like it was very celebrated very differently over the years and stuff.

1773
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:43,000
And the version we have of Christmas now did not come about until like 20, early 20th century.

1774
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Those Coke ads.

1775
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Coke ads were a big part of it.

1776
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
And Coke is readily available.

1777
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Late 19th century.

1778
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I mean, British, Charles Dickens and Christmas Carol was a big part of it.

1779
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
You know?

1780
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Interesting.

1781
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Yeah.

1782
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,000
But I make sense they have Christmas thing there because sometimes you go once a year

1783
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
and you want a couple of Christmas things.

1784
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Oh yeah.

1785
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
They're not like crazy like we are.

1786
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
We go all the time.

1787
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Hey, hanging on the tree.

1788
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
You remember your nice trip?

1789
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
You went on one.

1790
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Yeah.

1791
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
It's not so crazy.

1792
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
It's fine.

1793
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
That's why we think Christmas presents are okay.

1794
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Yeah.

1795
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
So Liberty Square, we did it.

1796
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
We missed the Columbia Harbor house.

1797
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Oh yeah.

1798
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
We talked a little bit.

1799
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Yeah.

1800
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Oh, the fish house.

1801
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Oh, okay.

1802
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Okay.

1803
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Yeah.

1804
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Well, there's also a weird thing about it where the it's supposed to tie into the Columbia.

1805
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,320
Like it was like where that was like, oh yeah, supplies are kept or like, you know, if you're

1806
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:35,760
working the Columbia, that's where you sleep.

1807
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,360
That's the cottage that goes along with the Columbia.

1808
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:39,360
Right.

1809
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,080
But then they didn't build a Columbia.

1810
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:42,080
So it's weird.

1811
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:45,280
I didn't realize that was supposed to be a tie into a ship that never got built because

1812
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,880
they did two Mark Twain's instead.

1813
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:50,280
Two Mark Twain's.

1814
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:52,760
I had to rush that fact in.

1815
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:53,760
Yeah.

1816
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:54,760
Well, that was the episode.

1817
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:58,600
People were like, oh my God, I'm canceling this Patreon unless they get to the Columbia

1818
01:32:58,600 --> 01:32:59,600
effect.

1819
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,440
Well, the other thing we haven't talked about is the haunted mansion.

1820
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,160
But I guess that I think it's assumed.

1821
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:04,640
That gets this whole thing.

1822
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,640
Yeah.

1823
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:07,800
It's a nice looking haunted mansion.

1824
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,960
Yeah, it's a great haunted mansion.

1825
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,800
My mom still claims that's the better looking outside one.

1826
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:13,800
I'm still not so sure.

1827
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:14,800
I go back and forth.

1828
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:15,800
I go back and forth.

1829
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:16,800
Because it is creepier.

1830
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:17,800
It's a creepier thing.

1831
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,300
And we'll talk about it on.

1832
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:22,340
It reminded me as growing up of where Corella DeVille lived.

1833
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:25,500
Because it is set back, which is nice.

1834
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:28,940
It's got a cool like setback thing and like that makes it feel creepier.

1835
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:32,060
And they reproduced it in Tokyo.

1836
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:34,900
They chose that as the Tokyo haunted mansion as well.

1837
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:37,900
So that speaks to its quality.

1838
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:38,900
I'm not sure.

1839
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:41,980
I think they're both good in their own ways.

1840
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:49,260
Yeah, that I think there was I read some stuff, but it was a little too complicated to try.

1841
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:55,860
The architecture of the land, if you add 17 or 18 in front of the address of some of the

1842
01:33:55,860 --> 01:34:01,620
buildings, it gives you an idea of what year you're kind of looking at.

1843
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:04,580
And the haunted mansion is older.

1844
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:05,580
There's two numbers on the door.

1845
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:08,780
And if you put 18 in front of them, it says what year.

1846
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:09,780
You would have seen that style.

1847
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:10,780
Something like that.

1848
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:11,780
Yeah.

1849
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:13,740
I think the haunted mansion is actually earlier.

1850
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:14,740
Hmm.

1851
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:19,460
It is what is interesting about Haunted Mansion being there is like because it's Liberty Square.

1852
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:23,540
You're like almost celebrating an idea in an era more than with New Orleans Square,

1853
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:26,740
which makes more sense where it's like, OK, it's an area and there's like the fun part

1854
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:27,740
of it.

1855
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:30,020
But then there's like kind of the setback creepy mansion.

1856
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:34,860
The reason it feels like it's because Liberty Square, it's so tied to like American history.

1857
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:37,940
And like that's what's kind of weird about it being there.

1858
01:34:37,940 --> 01:34:38,940
Yeah.

1859
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:41,300
And there's nothing else patriotic about nothing.

1860
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:42,300
The Hall of Presidents.

1861
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:43,300
Because it makes sense.

1862
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:44,780
I'm sorry about the Haunted Mansion.

1863
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:48,540
It's not there's not like ghosts of presidents or congressmen.

1864
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:49,540
Right.

1865
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:51,780
Which would be maybe cool if they had done that.

1866
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:53,340
They should have just made them all.

1867
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:54,340
Yeah.

1868
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:55,340
Every character is.

1869
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:57,420
Well, maybe that's the way you just put all the presidents into it.

1870
01:34:57,420 --> 01:34:59,300
Because most of the presidents are dead.

1871
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:00,300
So right.

1872
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:01,620
They would be in the Haunted Mansion.

1873
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:02,620
Yeah, sure.

1874
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:03,620
Sure.

1875
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:08,860
Or Hall of I mean, more criminals in the Hall of Presidents and Pirates of the Caribbean.

1876
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:10,860
It's a scurvier bunch of scoundrels.

1877
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:11,860
For sure is.

1878
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:12,860
Yeah.

1879
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:16,420
I know we're heading to the end, but if I say this bizarre facts, then we can save it

1880
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:18,820
in Haunted Mansion Part III down the road.

1881
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:19,820
Sure.

1882
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:23,100
And since we're talking about architecturally, this Haunted Mansion, if you've never been

1883
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:26,340
there, it doesn't look like it's not the pillars.

1884
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:31,940
It's not the new like southern style plantation kind of house like it is in California.

1885
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:35,100
It is a style that you describe as colonial Dutch Gothic.

1886
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:40,140
And it's supposed to look like a place called the Harry Packer Mansion, which is in Pennsylvania.

1887
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:42,140
Basically, it's in the town of Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania.

1888
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:45,460
Do you know about Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania?

1889
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:48,500
I think I've been camping in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania.

1890
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:50,260
I think there's a state park or something.

1891
01:35:50,260 --> 01:35:51,740
It's a place you can camp.

1892
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:52,740
Yeah.

1893
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:54,620
I just got on my way out the door.

1894
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:56,180
I got curious about that.

1895
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:57,460
Quick tangent.

1896
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:03,020
Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, named after the famous Olympian and football player and assuredly

1897
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:07,380
the town named after him because that was his beloved hometown and where he resided.

1898
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:08,380
Right?

1899
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:09,380
Yes.

1900
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:14,300
He's from Oklahoma and he never stepped foot in this town.

1901
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:19,180
This guy died in the 50s and people were talking about, well, do we build a park in Oklahoma?

1902
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:20,180
What do we do?

1903
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:28,580
Meanwhile, his third wife sold his remains to this town, which was called Motch Chunk.

1904
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:33,620
Motch Chunk, Pennsylvania, bought Jim Thorpe's body.

1905
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:34,620
You can do that?

1906
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:39,100
Like a widow can sell a body and it's still where his remains are.

1907
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:42,060
That's what Casey Kasem's wife did.

1908
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:43,060
Really?

1909
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:45,780
Well, remember, she was dragging his corpse all over the place so it wouldn't be in the

1910
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:50,300
ground to keep it from the kids, to keep the kids from getting his money.

1911
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:51,300
It was a whole thing.

1912
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:52,740
I'm not sure I knew he died.

1913
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:53,740
Casey Kasem?

1914
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:54,740
Yeah.

1915
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:55,740
It was like five years ago, I think.

1916
01:36:55,740 --> 01:36:56,740
Oh yeah, it was a big scandal.

1917
01:36:56,740 --> 01:36:57,740
Soikes!

1918
01:36:57,740 --> 01:36:58,740
There it goes!

1919
01:36:58,740 --> 01:37:02,060
She was taking his corpse around the world to keep it from being buried.

1920
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:03,060
Anyway, that's a whole other...

1921
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:04,500
That's a Patreon episode.

1922
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:05,500
We'll get into that.

1923
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:06,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1924
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,460
Casey Kasem's body.

1925
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:14,300
Anyway, yeah, this town needed a tourism element so we'll name ourselves Jim Thorpe and put

1926
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:16,540
this guy's body in the town.

1927
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:21,380
And then in 2010, one of Jim Thorpe's sons sued the town to get his father's remains

1928
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:28,420
back and then he died a year later and then four years later the case was overturned by

1929
01:37:28,420 --> 01:37:30,940
the Supreme Court and they didn't get the remains back.

1930
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:36,380
So this guy was trying to get his dad to be buried where he wanted to be buried, died

1931
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:38,140
and the Supreme Court said no.

1932
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:40,740
So hooray.

1933
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:43,180
And also it has a house that looks like the haunted mansion.

1934
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:44,180
God, what a ghoulish.

1935
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:45,180
That was my initial point.

1936
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:46,180
It's a ghoulish tale.

1937
01:37:46,180 --> 01:37:47,180
What a ghoulish tale.

1938
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:50,780
Surrounding the ghoulish home where the ghosts reside.

1939
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:53,980
That is an American tale if I have ever heard one.

1940
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:54,980
That's what I was...

1941
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:55,980
Yeah, as I said that.

1942
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:59,020
The third wife sold the corpse, the son tried to get it back but then he died.

1943
01:37:59,020 --> 01:38:01,780
Honestly, this is not dissimilar to the Gene Kasem situation.

1944
01:38:01,780 --> 01:38:02,780
Really?

1945
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:03,780
Yeah.

1946
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:05,980
The kids were just like put him, bury him.

1947
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:07,140
We need to bury him.

1948
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:09,300
The kids wanted it stopped and the wife...

1949
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:11,700
She kept the kids from seeing him toward the end.

1950
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:12,700
It's a whole situation.

1951
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:15,220
I mean, I might have some details wrong but that's the gist of it.

1952
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:16,380
And then like he wasn't in the...

1953
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:20,660
Like months after, it took months for him to get buried finally because it was such a

1954
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:22,700
dispute over his money and everything.

1955
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:23,700
Geez, wow.

1956
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:26,700
And his wife was an evil carnival owner.

1957
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:27,980
I don't think he was...

1958
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:33,460
She didn't sell his corpse to a town, Casey Kasem, Pennsylvania.

1959
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:34,460
So I guess that's where it's different.

1960
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:35,460
Right next door.

1961
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:38,460
Which by the way sounds fun.

1962
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:39,460
Yeah.

1963
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:40,460
Loving Casey Kasem, Pennsylvania.

1964
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:41,460
Sure?

1965
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:42,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1966
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:43,460
It has a ring to it.

1967
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:47,020
Yeah, but no, what an odd little encapsulation of...

1968
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:51,940
Yeah, that's the way an Olympic athlete is treated, a Native American Olympic athlete.

1969
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:52,940
Right.

1970
01:38:52,940 --> 01:38:53,940
Wow.

1971
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:54,940
Yeah.

1972
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:55,940
Got to know anything about that.

1973
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:56,940
Attuate.

1974
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:57,940
Yeah, great stuff.

1975
01:38:57,940 --> 01:38:58,940
Lordy Square.

1976
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:04,860
Well, yeah, how fitting I suppose for...

1977
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:11,820
Yeah, Olympic corpses being trotted around against their will, shit in the streets.

1978
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:13,820
Sandwoods, platter castles.

1979
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:14,820
Food arguments.

1980
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:17,820
A literal food fight.

1981
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:20,020
I mean, that was...

1982
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:26,140
Yeah, I enjoyed that and I hope any listeners who have been determined that the Liberty

1983
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:30,060
Tree Tavern situation was left as a cliffhanger.

1984
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:31,060
Well, yeah.

1985
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:32,060
I'm glad we got back into it.

1986
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:35,860
Well, you can see the coming glory, all the coming, all the glory.

1987
01:39:35,860 --> 01:39:43,300
I mean, if we go to Orlando, if we go, I think that we'll do a full Liberty Tree episode,

1988
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:45,260
main feed, two hours.

1989
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:47,980
Is there something that you would like to...

1990
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:51,780
What would be the lesson that I would need to learn?

1991
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:56,100
I think if you just said much like the episode where you said that three days you needed

1992
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:57,140
at least three days to talk to...

1993
01:39:57,140 --> 01:40:01,380
If you said the plates aren't too big for one man, I think that would be...

1994
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:02,380
I'll say that right now.

1995
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:03,380
No, no, I don't want it like this.

1996
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:04,380
I don't want it like this.

1997
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:05,380
I don't want it like this.

1998
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:06,380
Not like this.

1999
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:16,340
We'll hash it out in the two, maybe two and a half hour main feed episode about Liberty

2000
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:19,500
Tree Tavern if we go to Orlando.

2001
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:22,100
All right then.

2002
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:24,020
You survived podcasts, right?

2003
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:27,300
There'll be many more things to survive in the future.

2004
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:29,180
Yeah, good luck.

2005
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:30,180
Happy Fourth of July.

2006
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:31,180
Happy Fourth of July.

2007
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:36,780
Oh, and here, well, here's a little quote from Walt Disney about America and his feelings

2008
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:38,860
about America to send us out.

2009
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:44,540
If you could see close in my eyes, the American flag is waving in both of them and up my spine

2010
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:48,020
is growing this red, white and blue stripe.

2011
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:51,020
And that's what killed him.

2012
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:54,020
All right, goodbye.

2013
01:40:54,020 --> 01:40:55,020
Goodbye.
