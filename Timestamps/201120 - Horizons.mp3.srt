1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,720
Warning, the following podcast contains gushing, fawning, breathless praise, and at least one

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,320
brief joke about a robot or something.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,960
It's Horizons on today's podcast, The Ride.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,520
Welcome to podcast The Ride, the show where we like to say, I'll take the city.

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,360
Yes, it's always exciting.

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,880
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes, I'm here.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,760
I always say that I'll take the city.

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,280
You know, it's one of my merch items I sell on my personal Etsy shop.

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,200
Oh yeah, the front says, I'll take the city and the back says, yes, it's always exciting.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,240
And then I also have, yeah, like athletic pants that say that on the butt as well.

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,800
On the seat, excuse me.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:15,200
Yeah, and then you have small shorts that say, I'm serious on one cheek and the other cheek

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,440
says, well, I am too.

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,720
Like unusually confrontational.

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,200
Look, it's a big ride today, folks.

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,940
I'm going narrow.

20
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,500
I'm sure there's lots of lines about the future I could have started with.

21
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,980
Scott Garner also here as usual.

22
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:44,100
Yeah, I wear a hoodie that says, stretching frontiers into reality, which is what Leonard

23
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:51,540
Vickers, the General Electric VP of Corporate Marketing said what this attraction was about.

24
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,460
Um, I yeah, and then my and then on the and then I wear pants that on the butt say I ride

25
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,940
for Leonard Vickers.

26
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,420
Have we we have never talked about Leonard Vickers on the show before, I don't think.

27
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,860
No, this is the first time in five minutes getting straight into Leonard Vickers.

28
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,580
We have to get you know, we have to get stuff out of the way because there's so much stuff.

29
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,420
But can Leonard Vickers get it?

30
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:23,060
Um, I don't have a photo that one of the only Google results for him is an obituary and

31
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,020
the photo used is a candle.

32
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,460
So I cannot off of that determine whether he can get it.

33
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,340
OK, well, we'll come back.

34
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,020
We'll find like young hunk pictures and then we'll determine that later.

35
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,380
Oh, wait, no, wait. I do have a photo.

36
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,500
Wait. All right. From Progress City, USA.

37
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,260
And just to explain, General Electric was the sponsor of this Epcot attraction we're

38
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,380
talking about today.

39
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:54,740
And all right, I will share my screen and please announce if you think that he can get it.

40
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,620
I will say he's not as good as he card Walker.

41
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,860
Yeah, that's what I'll say. I don't want to put him down.

42
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,460
I don't want to say can't get it. I need to see more photos, but I will say he's no

43
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,340
E. Card Walker. That's all I'll say.

44
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,820
He's he's in a suit in front of like a wall of equations, like on a whiteboard.

45
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,340
That's what we're looking at. He's approximately

46
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:27,740
62 years old or 34, depending on like the time period and how people aged.

47
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,820
Yeah, I look, I don't know.

48
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,500
Getting it is I think he may have once been able to get it.

49
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,420
Let me be nice to Leonard Vickers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

50
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,820
Look, we got we got a lot of stuff.

51
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,220
We got a lot of stuff.

52
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,820
But shout out to Progress City USA, a great website and Twitter account I've read for years.

53
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,500
Folks, we're talking about horizons.

54
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,500
The most I will say, and I've seen lots of other people saying it, the most beloved closed

55
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,740
attraction when it comes to all this.

56
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,540
It's got to be. Yeah, it's got to be. Right.

57
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,260
Maybe Maelstrom is closed, but you know, the bones of it are still there.

58
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,740
And even then, that's Maelstrom is not nearly the horizons.

59
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,020
Original journey.

60
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,060
Original journey is up there.

61
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,660
It's for sure there.

62
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,300
But is it just because we can see at least see Figment even in this bastardized version?

63
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,700
Maybe a great movie ride.

64
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,580
Yeah. Yeah. But I I don't know.

65
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,020
Not to me.

66
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,420
Yeah. Yeah, it could be this.

67
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,500
Definitely could be this.

68
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,540
Yeah. Hey, and we're hitting early Epcot.

69
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,260
Barely not original Epcot.

70
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,020
This was a year delayed.

71
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,100
But it's pretty early Epcot.

72
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,980
And it is shameful how little of this we've done.

73
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:55,180
We did Universe of Energy and then haven't touched one in a little bit.

74
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,980
And so we'll start getting through them.

75
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,860
And this one is huge.

76
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,980
Is this is it maybe a result of us

77
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,060
enjoying things where we can like talk shit and make fun of it?

78
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,540
Like the American Dream Mall or some of these, you know, bizarre things

79
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,620
that we cover as opposed to this where I mean, I'm so excited to talk about it,

80
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,420
but I think it's going to be an episode full of like and then the bad thing.

81
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,060
That was so good.

82
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,620
And then the music that was so good.

83
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,540
The sea base. Look, it's two stories and there's animatronics on both.

84
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,420
And there's it's like a die cut.

85
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,980
Yeah, Jason, what you're trying to say is it's so good.

86
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,180
It's so good. Yes.

87
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,380
I mean, it's a lot.

88
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,620
It's very earnest love for this thing, I think, with all of us.

89
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,740
I was trying to figure out what the comedic angle on it was,

90
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,420
because I also thought, oh, no, this is going to be just a gushing episode,

91
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,660
which I'm sure people like.

92
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,900
I think they like that.

93
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,820
But they do come here to podcast for the laughs.

94
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,300
I was trying to like, I'm like, oh, I think, you know,

95
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,740
we could joke around about this interesting tidbit.

96
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,460
So I have a couple joke notes to try to make sure

97
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,020
that there's some levity in this episode.

98
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,260
I mean, that was, you know, but maybe I'll forget them.

99
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,940
My funny discovery, I've watched this ride through now like four times,

100
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,780
which is not unusual when prepping an episode.

101
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,300
But this ride is like 20 minutes long if you watch all the endings.

102
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,140
So I feel because I just there's just so much.

103
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,020
I was having trouble remembering and wrapping my head around.

104
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,060
And about an hour ago, as I was watching the last one,

105
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,980
the thing that struck me as funny is the dynamic between the grandparent characters.

106
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,660
And they're like clearly like each other,

107
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,060
but they they do snap at each other every now and then.

108
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,820
Were you referencing that earlier?

109
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,420
Is that what that little back and forth was about?

110
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,940
Yeah, I the I'll take the city.

111
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,500
Yes, it's always exciting is like begrudgingly like, yeah,

112
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,660
they're making a good point.

113
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:04,100
But the best I think is the lines when they're talking about the floating city.

114
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,220
And the one says, I'm serious.

115
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,340
And the other says, well, so am I.

116
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,980
I don't remember this little this little bickering.

117
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,580
Well, well, so elderly couples still fight in the future,

118
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,140
no matter how hopeful it is. Yes. Right.

119
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,740
Did let me ask this right up top.

120
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,740
Did this make you sad for the state of the world?

121
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,260
Oh, yeah. Watching this video, because it certainly made me sad.

122
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,180
I anticipated this.

123
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,020
I was I and I was thinking I feel like we have to put a moratorium on discussion

124
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,980
of how the future is bleak and not as good as horizon there,

125
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,780
because the more of that that's run through this episode, this will be a miserable slog.

126
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,660
Hey, I hear I hear that.

127
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,540
That's why I want to get out of the way right now.

128
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,820
Is that I was watching it and I was just like, oh, yeah, that would be.

129
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,620
Oh, yeah. Wouldn't have been great if we were like here by now. Right.

130
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,940
I am optimistic.

131
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,740
I do agree with one of the mission statements of the ride that this future is possible.

132
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,180
All you have to do is get rid of fossil fuels.

133
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:17,180
The current iteration of wage labor, policing, the military industrial complex,

134
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,180
the current concept of nation states and nuclear weapons, which, yes,

135
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,460
that sounds great.

136
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,740
Let's go for it. Let's have horizons.

137
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,140
Surely the DNC and Nancy Pelosi can stay, wouldn't you say, Jason?

138
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,500
I mean, look, as long as they're ripping up paper and clapping,

139
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,180
that's all that's all I care about.

140
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,140
Hell, yeah.

141
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,700
Commemorative scarves, man, these ballers, they're going to bring

142
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,300
they're going to get us to horizons future.

143
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,780
There there should be a new version of horizons where an empty political gesture

144
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,100
is one of the scenes, and then the next scene we see what happened.

145
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,460
So it's like Pelosi clapping.

146
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,940
And then all of a sudden, we're on the moon and a moon base.

147
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,740
We've colonized the moon because of that gesture.

148
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,780
Oh, it inspired people so much to be the best version of themselves.

149
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,460
Yeah, it created harmony on Earth and enabled an international cooperation

150
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,420
to build a brava centauri.

151
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,460
That's right.

152
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,500
So that could really draw the parallel, I think, in a future version of this.

153
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,340
But again, that's maybe that's future brainstorming.

154
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,180
I don't even want to get there.

155
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:23,780
I do think there there's a funny, realistic version of this where it's like,

156
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,580
wow, we have a colony on the moon thanks to SpaceX.

157
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,300
Oh, the founder of SpaceX is tweeting about a local worker

158
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,780
that's trying to rescue a child.

159
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,500
He's calling him a pedophile again.

160
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,220
And this is really in the moon colony is on fire.

161
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,740
The first instance of fire in space.

162
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,380
Elon Musk is spending most of his days trying to debunk covid testing.

163
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:53,300
He really should be more focused on his futurism, his future colony.

164
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,100
Why is this colony just thick with blunt smoke?

165
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,740
Has been for years, apparently.

166
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,740
This is a weird I don't want to, like, over explain this thing,

167
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,900
because I think many of the listeners just absolutely know what horizons is

168
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,780
and have it memorized and have been wondering when we're going to get to it.

169
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,740
But I feel like it is a product of it being gone since 1999,

170
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,100
that there are a lot of people who don't really know it, didn't get to go on it.

171
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,620
And in doing so, I mean, the basics of it are

172
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,580
early Epcot attraction, open to year late.

173
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,260
It is where mission space is now.

174
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,180
And it is like a hard ride to synopsize.

175
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:43,860
It is a yes, it's it's a it's a dark ride that is about the future.

176
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,060
It is visions of futuristic life,

177
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,100
sometimes from the past, the ideas from the past of what the future would be.

178
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:57,340
And then you get to see a bunch of ideas from 1983 of what the future could be,

179
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,860
which I'm on record many times as saying is the best future, the most optimal future.

180
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,340
Some of these futures make my heart stop.

181
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,180
They are so beautiful.

182
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,700
It's it's it is a weird, wonderful ride.

183
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,540
Yeah, it's it's I I thought this while I was watching the video.

184
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,260
And then I saw that I think internally and some other people thought of it

185
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,700
kind of as a sequel to the Carousel of Progress.

186
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,420
Yes. Which, of course, if you don't know one of that is that's like sort of the

187
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,820
history of technology in America and whatever.

188
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,180
And with a little now, of course, it has a few quote unquote future scene,

189
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,180
which is 20 years ago, future scene, which is less fun.

190
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,940
Although although my favorite thing in the ride, certainly is fun.

191
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,380
And also due to the cyclical nature of trends, VR came back around

192
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,460
like rugby shirts came back around.

193
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,020
So it stuck around long enough to be kind of relevant.

194
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,580
Oh, voice activation is real and very inconvenient now.

195
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,180
It's here and it's a pain in the ass.

196
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,460
And every version, not perfect, every version of iOS.

197
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
The dictation just gets worse.

198
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,140
At least if you have a Philadelphia regional accent,

199
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,980
it just doesn't understand what the fuck you are saying at all.

200
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,940
Yes. So, yeah, it's like it's like in the same vein.

201
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,620
They use the Carousel of Progress song in there, which is nice,

202
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,780
which I was really like kind of impressed by that thinking of like,

203
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,740
oh, a ride sequel is really a cool idea.

204
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,540
Yeah, which we don't see a lot of.

205
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,820
I guess I guess I've talked about before the Monsters After Dark

206
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:40,300
Guardians Halloween Overlay, which is kind of a sequel in the same ride.

207
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,700
But I was like, oh, yeah, this is like this is exactly

208
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,940
like this is completely then a continuation of that idea.

209
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,100
And on a bigger scale, more, you know, longer ride, different kind of ride.

210
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,060
A sequel in a different place. Yeah, is pretty rare.

211
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,620
Let me ask you this, because I did not know.

212
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,580
I guess I knew it was in the spirit.

213
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,780
I knew it was sort of related

214
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,660
to the Carousel of Progress and the song was in there.

215
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:11,420
The GE sponsorship sort of unites the both of them, at least initially.

216
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,700
But did you guys know that it was the same family?

217
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,060
Because I had never put that together.

218
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,460
When I did not. Yeah.

219
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,300
When I started the research, it started to come up like

220
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,340
the same family in theory.

221
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,540
I mean, this is like a heightening and expansion of Carousel of Progress.

222
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,220
Yeah, yeah, we take them into the future.

223
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,540
The way distant. Yeah, I did.

224
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,300
I did not know that it was they meant it to be in the same

225
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,140
canon mythology.

226
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,900
I mean, this is predating like see, of course, the society of explorers

227
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,620
and adventurers that was going to connect rides

228
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,820
via this like group of horrible rich people.

229
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,420
The international tyrants. Yes.

230
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,660
Yeah, which we love.

231
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,180
We will still do an episode of that soon.

232
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,900
But yeah, this is predating that by years.

233
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,340
And I really I will admit that as a kid, I went on Horizons,

234
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,900
but it didn't loom large in my head until I was older and reading about it and stuff.

235
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,300
It wasn't something that I was crazy about, like figment or something.

236
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,780
Right. But well, let me let me say this about my childhood

237
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,980
feelings about it. And this is me.

238
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,460
This is in general, I think a lot of Epcot put together

239
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,820
because I went when I for the first time, I think when I was seven.

240
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,420
And in my head,

241
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:38,300
I have like such strong, evocative memories of Epcot in general,

242
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,940
maybe not specific things, but I remember the feeling of going on

243
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:48,340
lots of very long, claustrophobic, creaky, shadowy rides.

244
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,260
There's so many of them.

245
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,060
And so to me, for a long, long time,

246
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:59,620
Horizons, Spaceship Earth and World of Motion were all just tangled up in my brain.

247
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,740
And I did not know probably until we started doing the podcast.

248
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,020
I had not completely untethered like, OK, which is the one with like

249
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,020
the horse and the buggy and the horses jumping,

250
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,540
which is the one where there's like a guy in a tunic with a scroll.

251
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,700
That's a beard guy.

252
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,180
But then there's also a beard guy in a capsule with a chicken like

253
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,580
like they're all similar styles of animatronic

254
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,620
and all similar styles of very small vehicle

255
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,860
that you're in for a long time that moves upward and clanks along.

256
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,740
I just I remember like the base feeling of all of it,

257
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,340
but I could never pick them apart for the longest time.

258
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,740
Yes, I completely agree with that.

259
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,860
I agree with that, too.

260
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,100
This the thing that sticks out in my mind,

261
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:50,580
like the flashes of childhood for World of Motion is the overturned

262
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:55,460
like horse cart, you know, street scene in this.

263
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,740
Probably the robot, but robot Butler never really was.

264
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,060
There was always an image of him somewhere, even in shops or something.

265
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,940
But choosing your own ending was like what stuck with me for this ride.

266
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,980
Like going back and watching it, I was like, oh, well, the first

267
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,780
like third of this ride is so like bonkers and abstract.

268
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,500
And like I feel like it wouldn't get away with that anymore.

269
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,020
It feels it feels like a lot of this.

270
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,580
A lot of the stuff adding to the legend of this ride, it's like

271
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,260
imagineering firing on all cylinders had to make some minor cuts,

272
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,420
but they still spend a lot of money on this ride.

273
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,380
It's loaded with animatronics.

274
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,260
It's got like an A-list team of people working on it.

275
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:45,620
The corporate sponsorship like actually seemed to be contributing ideas

276
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,140
and not demanding like light bulbs shoved in there.

277
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,500
And like we're we're into the, you know, message of it.

278
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,020
And we're into like having their name on something positive and uplifting,

279
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:05,220
as opposed to like make goofy, hold a Pepsi, you know,

280
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,700
that would never happen.

281
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,060
Disney is a coke corporation.

282
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:13,180
But, you know, it's just a lot of elements are just working correctly.

283
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,060
Yes, for sure.

284
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,020
It's also a period.

285
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:23,460
I mean, I think because Epcot obviously has a rocky history of it

286
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:28,260
being a real city when Walt was envisioning it, and then it's switching over to theme park.

287
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,420
But they were trying to stay sort of true.

288
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,300
Like they were really trying to stay true to like Walt's ideas.

289
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:40,540
So I feel like Future World is like like they got to do an art album.

290
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,340
They got to do an art concept album, whereas Scott's saying they all blend together.

291
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,980
And I completely agree with that in the same way that whatever the suite at the end of

292
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,780
Abbey Road blends together, it's like all kind of of a piece.

293
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,980
It all kind of can.

294
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,260
You could probably sub in different scenes for each ride,

295
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:06,820
and it wouldn't be completely out of out of like or wouldn't be completely jarring.

296
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,060
And the other thing is that Horizons was the keystone.

297
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:18,460
It brought together all of the communication and transportation and innovation.

298
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,180
And all of these ideas are kind of present in here.

299
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:27,820
Even the sea, the literal seas, energy like it all shows all the other pavilions

300
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,740
kind of feed in to this GD Captain Planet ass ride.

301
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,740
Where like it just makes makes a larger piece.

302
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,660
Yes, it would have almost made more sense now with the new version of Future World

303
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,620
if they had just taken out pieces of all these rides and just thrown them into Spaceship Earth

304
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,340
and made Spaceship Earth like a greatest hits of original Future World.

305
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,580
Oh, that's an idea.

306
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,620
That's a good idea.

307
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,020
That would have been I mean, I guess it's still possible.

308
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:04,580
But like then you can at least like get a lot of the iconic stuff from this this these rides,

309
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,780
because it sucks that like Horizons is gone because it feels like Horizons

310
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,860
should have been pirates.

311
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,860
Like it feels like you shouldn't have been able to touch this ride.

312
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,500
At least you could update it and make it new and cool.

313
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:24,220
But it feels it feels bad to me that Horizons isn't there, obviously

314
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,340
in the same way Figment isn't the same.

315
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,140
And I don't know, I'm not I'm not mad about like Spaceship Earth changing.

316
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,460
But this being gone 100 percent.

317
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,220
Yeah, it's very strange for something that and it wasn't there that long

318
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,300
when you add it all up.

319
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,340
And right in the last few years, it was pretty spotty, whether it be open or not.

320
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,900
So it got kind of like a not graceful exit.

321
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,780
I think I only went on it on my first trip.

322
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,100
I don't I don't think I don't think I got to say goodbye.

323
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,100
Yeah, I don't I don't have a memory of going on it.

324
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,420
When did I close in 99? Is that right?

325
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,860
Yes, it closed like January 99.

326
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,940
That was a big thing I saw mentioned.

327
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,260
There is a website called like Horizon Timeline,

328
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,260
or if that's what the page on the website is.

329
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,220
And they made sure to point out that despite Epcot being at capacity

330
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:16,700
on the night of December 31st, 1999, they did not reopen Horizons.

331
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,780
Horizons, like in fact, they closed

332
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:25,660
Horizons a year before the future was supposed to start, which is darkly funny,

333
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,860
but like a little grim. Yeah, no, a very grim.

334
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:35,100
Yeah, I did not go on this because I went in 2002.

335
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,420
So I probably had.

336
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,300
Yeah, I probably went on it when I when I was like 12 or 13 for the last time.

337
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,260
Or maybe like, yeah, something like that.

338
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,780
You know, it's another thing with them.

339
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,460
Sorry, the other thing with them just like

340
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:51,820
mushing up all together and being this sort of unique little concept album is

341
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,620
that you don't see any of your friends in them.

342
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:00,300
Like it's all either anonymous animatronics or they are portraying,

343
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:06,500
you know, Jules Verne or like a real like man from the from the Roman era.

344
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,340
And like you get you get no Mickey.

345
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,420
You don't even get a fox on the hound.

346
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,100
You get nobody that you know,

347
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,140
which that's not a complaint for me.

348
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:21,420
It's just like it was like so much to take in as a seven year old and so like,

349
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:28,420
like just like odd and melancholy and not what I expected.

350
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,580
A theme park would be at all.

351
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,620
Actually, you add Maelstrom and Mexico Boat Ride to that, too,

352
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,460
which are also sort of claustrophobic, sort of darkly lit.

353
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,420
That just that a whole half of the park is so and the and the scary dinosaurs.

354
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,100
Like Epcot was a like moody theme park.

355
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:52,060
Yes, it's a moody concept album of a theme park that doesn't give you the hits

356
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,780
from the Magic Kingdom, it doesn't give you what you want.

357
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,580
It's a challenging it's challenging, which is why so much of it is gone.

358
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,620
It's why fans like it.

359
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,660
It's like no, no, no, no.

360
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,500
Sit down and listen to it, because if you actually like really listen to it,

361
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,380
you're going to get it.

362
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,660
But people who only have a passing fancy just want to hear the hits.

363
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:17,180
They just yes, they just want those first early albums of pop pop songs, which are

364
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,780
great. This is the marketing, though, right?

365
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,180
And this was the mission statement for Epcot is was for the adults,

366
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,620
for the adults who are coming, staying at the contemporary water skiing

367
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,980
when they weren't at the park, you know, and and a permanent world fair,

368
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,500
a showcase for ideas.

369
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,260
I mean, just the concept art alone, this beautiful like

370
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:48,460
book cover painterly art of the Herman Herb Ryman paintings, not Herman,

371
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,980
are just so great for Horizons.

372
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,100
I don't think I know that exactly, but

373
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,740
I think I know what you're talking about.

374
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,700
Yeah, I have it here.

375
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,100
I mean, he did that famous painting of the castle.

376
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,540
But then this was an early one for Horizons.

377
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,180
And then look at this.

378
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,380
Look at this big. Oh, yeah.

379
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,900
Oh, it's sort of like it feels a little more like 60s of an art style.

380
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:16,500
And, oh, boy, just like, you know, raise a sunlight flesh and through and so much

381
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,740
color hitting everything is this family with two little girls in hats.

382
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,700
They can't wait to go meet their friends at Brava Centauri.

383
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,340
Oh, there's some swingers over here.

384
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,500
If you can see them, Warren Beatty, I think that is his pocket.

385
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,180
And with someone's wife, it is.

386
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,540
Ali McGraw, it is Ali McGraw still.

387
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,940
Wow.

388
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,980
Yeah. So it's.

389
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:48,860
I guess I understand why all this stuff has closed, but it does.

390
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,500
It I guess it's for us as adults, not

391
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,700
necessarily for even the general population of adults.

392
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,740
If you took Spaceship Earth, just throw figment on Spaceship Earth and he's

393
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,100
your guide through the best of all the Epcot rides.

394
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,620
How about that? Oh, yeah.

395
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,220
You got a fun, fun person for the kids, fun character for the kids.

396
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,340
That's pretty interesting.

397
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:12,220
Yeah. And just do something else with the bit like is the back half just more of

398
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,900
like that's like you end up doing your

399
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:21,060
like, well, why don't the screens just show you these videos where you choose

400
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:27,820
your future path instead of bad like 2006 era Jim Chab.

401
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,140
Yes.

402
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,540
Or it's your mom would send you.

403
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,220
Yeah.

404
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,660
So anyway, I mean, we're doing some of the end of the podcast.

405
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,820
Now we're doing sort of our concept album

406
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,220
podcast because we're sort of starting with the end.

407
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,900
Yeah. Well, and that's sort of that sort

408
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,780
of outside the box thinking is what you get with Horizons.

409
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:53,820
You know, when you get a business genius like Jack Welch involved, the oft mentioned

410
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,340
on 30 Rock, GE executive Jack Welch. Yes.

411
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,140
Who eventually appeared on 30 Rock.

412
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,820
I don't know if he counts as a

413
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:07,820
what I was calling for CEO performers like Eisner and Brandon Tartikoff.

414
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,860
He's a little bit in there if just from that one appearance.

415
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,260
Sure. Yeah. He helped think of this.

416
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,180
He did a real thing.

417
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:21,700
I he was I think the original CEO, Reginald Jones, and then Jack Welch was

418
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,180
like his lieutenant, who would then

419
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:30,740
take over the company and would be revered by the fictional Jack Dongy.

420
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,020
But they don't. Yeah, they don't talk about Horizons on 30 Rock.

421
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,700
No, they don't.

422
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,980
References, no.

423
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:45,140
But it is funny that GE would go on to own the other theme park company down the line.

424
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,260
No, that's right. Oh, yeah.

425
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,780
But then with this, it's like incredibly

426
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:55,740
ambitious and very adults, which is sort of what their theme park property

427
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,020
is a little more.

428
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,740
It's like it's almost universal esque.

429
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,180
And it's it's adultness and darkness and ambition.

430
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,060
Yeah, yeah, it's it's it's funny to think that

431
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:14,340
it's funny because the company hasn't thought like this since this.

432
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,460
Like MGM Studios, definitely like for

433
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,660
Disney, MGM Studios, definitely for the parents as well.

434
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,460
But that's much more all the stuff they've put in there is much more kid

435
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:28,580
friendly than any of this up. You're meeting your friends left and right.

436
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:34,460
You're meeting C3PO and Indiana Jones and Rod Serling

437
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,380
and Busby Berkeley.

438
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,020
Yeah, what

439
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,740
Jimmy Durante or wait, no, who's in the which gangsters do you meet?

440
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,820
James Cagney. There you go.

441
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,420
I'm all the kids favorites.

442
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,620
Ray Bolger.

443
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,260
All of them.

444
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,420
Yep.

445
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,540
So, yeah, this is so this is the only

446
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,220
time in the Disney company history where they were fine with no friends,

447
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,260
which I like as a kid.

448
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,700
I did. I appreciated it on a certain level because you get bombarded with friends

449
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,940
at the Magic Kingdom, you get bombarded with friends at MGM Studios.

450
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:18,660
So I like the different vibe of Epcot, you know, sometimes it's nice to be away

451
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,860
from your friends. That's what we're saying.

452
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,980
You need a little, you know, you need a little break.

453
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,780
You need a break from your friends.

454
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:32,340
You just need like nine months to a year and a half away from all of your friends.

455
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:36,780
We all need a quick nine to 18 months.

456
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,220
Yeah.

457
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,300
So, yeah, it's interesting.

458
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,980
So that's.

459
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:49,180
Yeah, I, I, I get why it's not there, but I was just so feeling so nostalgic for it

460
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,060
while watching this or something I didn't feel nostalgic for as a child.

461
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,940
Yeah, I didn't have so much fun as a child.

462
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:01,260
It's funny, Mike and I talked to a student group at UCLA the other day.

463
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,820
And as we were talking, that's right, you can be impressed.

464
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:09,540
I, but as we were talking to them, I realized because they had a horizon zone

465
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,340
in the back of my mind, I realized like, oh, my God, were you all born

466
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,140
after this ride closed? I think that timing works out.

467
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,980
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

468
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,220
A lot of people, we only went on it once.

469
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:27,300
Yeah, it's I feel like it lives on through through videos and articles almost

470
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,900
primarily, one of which I will quote real fast just to say the scope of it,

471
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,980
because he broke it down real, real well.

472
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,460
Our friend Doug Jones, who wrote a great article in Dangerous Minds about it,

473
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,060
just he spelled it out really nicely with these stats that I copy pasted.

474
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:43,620
Thank you, Doug.

475
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,100
Fifty four audio animatronic figures,

476
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,900
seven hundred and seventy props, twelve projectors and a pair of massive

477
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:56,420
Omni-Mac screens, groundbreaking technology at the time spread across 24 sets

478
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,780
set in the year 2086. Incredible.

479
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,860
So madly and the show building is so massive when you're looking at it.

480
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,540
And it's not just it's not a fake facade.

481
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,460
It's not just for show.

482
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,900
Like it's so tall because they had to fit those giant screens in the middle.

483
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:17,140
Omni-Max is the type of domed screen that they use on Soren.

484
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,460
And I guess that's not the exact type on Soren, but back to the future,

485
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,300
the ride definitely.

486
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,940
And they had to be huge.

487
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,180
This is the first ride to to use them.

488
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,620
And you also just technologically and I'm jumping around a little bit here,

489
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,340
but with this interactive ending that it

490
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:41,500
builds to where you choose the future that you go to, which interactivity already

491
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,420
is a huge thing this ride is doing for the first time.

492
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:50,060
But also, I think until watching the Martins vids, I didn't realize how they did it,

493
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,660
which like you're like on your way out of the ride.

494
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:58,740
You were watching a little like flight simulator path to a future destination.

495
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,140
And it's this crazy thing.

496
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,500
I think you're like going along a screen,

497
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,100
but the projector is traveling with you.

498
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:10,700
So you're like the projector is mounted and like four cars all collectively pick

499
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:15,140
which future that you go to and then you're like moving along with the screen,

500
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,100
which feels very Harry Potter ride.

501
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:23,140
Like it's all these like early analog versions of things that are a little more.

502
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,660
I don't even want to say commonplace.

503
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,700
I feel like Horizons did things that are mega blockbuster moments in rides

504
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,780
of the 2000s and 2010s.

505
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,740
Yeah, I mean, we were talking about the

506
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,580
Haunted Mansion episode where you'll see a really cool thing in a new ride

507
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,580
and you'll be like, hey, what cool new technology is that?

508
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,940
And they're like, oh, it's Pepper's Ghost.

509
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,620
You know, like, oh, yeah, it's a really good illusion that still works.

510
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,900
And it does feel like maybe, yeah, like this one, it's like they probably still

511
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,180
use this type of thing. I think so.

512
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,700
All of the technology. Orange scent.

513
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,100
We get an orange scent in it.

514
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,260
Which is like the thing that people are

515
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:03,220
nostalgic for in Soren over California as opposed to the later one.

516
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,380
It's I think we've agreed the superior

517
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,460
smell, even with all the many smells in the new version.

518
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,700
But they did orange.

519
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,220
They did an orange smell first.

520
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,580
I think that was probably very rare at the time.

521
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,940
I don't think. Yeah, we were talking about it.

522
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:21,300
I don't think there's any other orange smell anywhere.

523
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,820
I mean, before 1983, I don't know.

524
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,060
Somebody will correct that, I'm sure.

525
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,980
I don't know if it's a correct analog.

526
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,540
You can think of what the actual one is.

527
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,340
But what we're saying is like incredibly

528
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,940
influential, Ride did all these things that were done, you know, later to more

529
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,540
success, but they did it first in this concept album thing.

530
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,180
It's what is it Velvet Underground?

531
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,780
What is it? What are we?

532
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,900
What is this? The Velvet Underground of Rides?

533
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,820
That's a good question.

534
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,620
Is it television?

535
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,660
That's a good one. Like big sprawling long songs.

536
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,620
Yeah, it's not pop singles.

537
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:01,460
But if you want a little challenging 10 minute experience, absolutely.

538
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,900
I think that's pretty close.

539
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,660
Maybe the television of rides.

540
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,220
Television is a band, by the way, for the younger listeners.

541
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:09,860
Yeah, Mark.

542
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,300
It's not a ride about television.

543
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,900
It's you know, watch televisions on it.

544
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,820
They were comparing it to the band.

545
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,380
Yes. Right.

546
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,260
Scott, you mentioned the Morton's Vids.

547
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,700
It's the thing that struck me in that not

548
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:28,700
just like the seven projector array for the ending, but the schematic for the

549
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:34,100
Omni-Max sequence where like it spirals around like it.

550
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:39,060
It just seems like when you look at it as a blueprint, it's one of those ones that

551
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:44,540
looks like an impossible architecture and one of the few where the like it's not

552
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,820
just a square show building behind it, it's like, no, it.

553
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,700
Yeah.

554
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,940
That shape of the building extends behind it.

555
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,540
It's such a unique looking building and something that is, I think, missing from

556
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,140
Epcot, you know, now. Right.

557
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,980
Right. Yeah. The blueprints are so confusing to look.

558
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,380
I still haven't wrapped my head around all of how it works.

559
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,020
Are you saying do you just say that it's

560
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,620
like it's not one projector on top of your vehicles?

561
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,580
It's seven. Oh, I think it's like seven.

562
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,060
That's how they did like a half moon almost of projection.

563
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,140
Wow. Wow.

564
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,540
That kind of fans out in front of you until you get back to.

565
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,900
Wow. Wow.

566
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,380
The other folks, if you haven't if you don't, if you haven't seen this ride it

567
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:32,540
through in a while or you don't remember riding it, search on YouTube Horizons

568
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,980
Revisit, which is like a cleaned up, deinterlaced,

569
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:44,500
restored ride through that is like it's so rare you get like a quality video

570
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,460
of these long gone rides.

571
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,180
And it is like it's a 20 year old ride.

572
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,500
And a lot of times those look like shit on YouTube.

573
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,140
Yeah. And they cleaned it up.

574
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:59,380
Retro WDW and the Lake Wainovista Historical Society cleaned it up and put

575
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,540
this video out and it is wild to watch this.

576
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,380
There's so much stuff like even watching it through a couple of times.

577
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,820
It was like, I forgot about that.

578
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,180
Like there's so much, especially because of the first, like I said,

579
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,300
chunk of the ride is so abstract.

580
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,660
I definitely I hate to keep coming back to the concept album idea,

581
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,900
but you're saying there's just so much.

582
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,380
I'm like I'm just scrolling again.

583
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,580
I've scrolled through this now 20 times, but there's so much stuff.

584
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,700
And then I remember hearing that when they were talking about building Westcott,

585
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:31,820
Tony Baxter was talking about there was going to be a 45 minute boat ride

586
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:36,500
that would that would like be just go along the circumference or not.

587
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,180
Yeah. The edge of the park, essentially.

588
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,460
And there would be four stops.

589
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,460
You could get off whenever you want.

590
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,860
It would be like the train, the Disneyland train, except it would be

591
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:50,300
full scale dark ride for 45 minutes with like pirates drops, like drops, like at

592
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,860
the start. And I feel like, all right, like they're just getting going

593
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:59,180
with ambition here and they're like, let's throw everything at it.

594
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:04,020
We don't have to do anything like we're we're we're feeling so emboldened

595
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,780
by the success we've had thus far that they were like, we're going to throw

596
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,740
everything at this thing and we're not going to not going to apply any of the

597
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,460
rules we would you would assume they would have for a ride like this.

598
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:23,300
And then like World War Two breaking out, a conflict in Europe happened and everyone

599
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,140
tripped on their own decks.

600
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,860
So

601
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:33,300
that being you're saying the Euro Disney, the Euro Disney, which kills like more

602
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,140
ambitious, bizarre, like non IP rides like this, which probably would have been

603
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,340
strewn throughout the 90s if they had that not happened.

604
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,820
Yeah, I mean, it's really the thing that

605
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:48,420
like made Eisner blink, like it like made him like threw him off.

606
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:54,220
I think you start to see like the decline and there's a list

607
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,740
a theme park tourist, I believe, made a list of like here's everything that got

608
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,780
closed or delayed because of Euro Disney fallout.

609
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,740
And it's it's Tomorrowland 2055 Westcott,

610
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:12,300
the closures, 20,000 leagues under the sea in Florida, the horizons.

611
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,900
You know, it was a miracle that Animal Kingdom was so good when it was.

612
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,900
Right, right, right.

613
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,820
Rough year.

614
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:25,740
Maybe the maybe the roughest until this year, I would think.

615
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,620
Don't we think to get Disney back on track, they need to build Westcott and have

616
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,620
a 45 minute boat ride with no IP on it?

617
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,380
Absolutely.

618
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,820
Bring the ambition back.

619
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,380
Get crazy, guys.

620
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,540
What do you have to do?

621
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,900
Deficit spending, folks, you know, don't be afraid of it.

622
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,020
You got to spend your way out of a recession.

623
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,100
Your way out.

624
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,340
Also, what I'm doing with toys.

625
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,780
For sure.

626
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,220
You know, nobody's going to want the like we should.

627
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,060
This is the point beyond which we're not going to want all the presidents.

628
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,820
Right. Like if we do it here,

629
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,580
if we do it not with Trump, then like we can't say nobody will say it was Trump's

630
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,900
fall. Let's just like do it with Biden.

631
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,140
We're done with all presidents and repurpose all of the robots and make them

632
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,420
like animatronic, like do something like this again.

633
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,980
Put them in a space city or add them all to pirates.

634
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,820
If nothing else, just like throw all of

635
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:26,380
disperse the presidents into different pirates of the Caribbean's across the globe.

636
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,340
Oh, and not and not change anything about them.

637
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,660
Right. They're just the presidents.

638
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,660
A lot of them already look like weird old, you know, Martin Van Buren can be drunk

639
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:39,900
on the bridge. James Garfield is harpooning somebody.

640
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,820
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's yes.

641
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,140
That's a great idea, honestly.

642
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,380
Like obviously have throw a bunch of presidents in the ballroom in the Haunted

643
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,340
Mansion. Yeah.

644
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,900
Or pirates just build 46 more wells to dunk them in.

645
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,180
They have it coming.

646
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,980
They're going to build Biden to do that.

647
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:02,260
They're going to build Biden still, but put him into pirates.

648
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:07,940
Hey, man, back in my day, dunking into well, that's party.

649
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,020
Look, Jack, he's saying that as he comes up for a second.

650
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,940
Dunk me harder.

651
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,100
Hey, look, fat.

652
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,900
Malarkey.

653
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,260
That's more fun.

654
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,140
Look, fat. You're lying with the pigs.

655
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:30,180
You're not going to get the map, you know.

656
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,300
A real play, a replacing depth, even just with Biden

657
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:41,500
releasing, replacing Jack Sparrow in general, popping out of the barrel.

658
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,100
Yeah.

659
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,540
And on the chair at the end of the ride.

660
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,740
Yeah. Yeah.

661
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,260
He's completely spinning the yarn toward to you.

662
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,220
Is he is he surrounded by treasure?

663
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,100
What's Biden's dream room at the end?

664
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,700
Ice cream.

665
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,300
A bunch of ice cream.

666
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,500
Yeah. A bounty of ice cream.

667
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,180
Pine Scalore.

668
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,740
You know, if Donald Trump Jr.

669
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,900
heard this podcast, he'd be so mad at us.

670
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,500
Like they go into my they insult my dad every single episode.

671
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,260
And then when it comes to Biden, what's the joke?

672
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,420
He loves ice cream.

673
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,100
Podcast The Ride is soft.

674
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,780
They're biased.

675
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:27,740
And they were and they will be banned from podcasting in term two.

676
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,780
Yes.

677
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,020
Sloppy podcast.

678
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,940
The ride is no longer hot.

679
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,740
Not like NASA.

680
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,540
Yeah, wait, we're all being not optimistic.

681
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,140
Trump is the Trump made space hot again.

682
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,060
That's like horizon dreamed of doing.

683
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,100
That's true. He did make it hot again.

684
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,580
Right.

685
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:54,220
I let me let me shift gears into

686
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,620
what you started talking about, just the building and the architecture.

687
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,140
This is one of the best things about it.

688
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,260
I could stare at that building all day.

689
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,180
Oh, my God.

690
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,860
It's hard to say because I like so many of those old pavilions.

691
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,100
But is probably the best.

692
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:16,380
This big, crazy diamond UFO spaceship thing, this big angular, weird steel with

693
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,860
the sign up front, that that amazing logo,

694
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,340
just aesthetically before you even get in the door.

695
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,420
And it was a bummer when it closed, but at least like before they just crushed it

696
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:32,180
down the side to start building mission space, even like seeing this thing over a

697
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,980
fence still was kind of nice. I just like I just wish the building was there.

698
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,380
Yeah, it had the full hat trick.

699
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,500
Great sign up front, great building.

700
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:47,780
And then the logo icon, the minimalist Epcot Pavilion icons is great.

701
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,380
My favorite one, I think I will declare I like a lot of them.

702
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,540
I like all of them.

703
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:59,540
But the the little like angled path to the horizon and the lines get thinner

704
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,020
and thinner as you get up to the horizon line.

705
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,780
Yeah, that little icon logo is wonderful.

706
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:10,580
They pack so much information in there and yet it's still really minimal.

707
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,460
I love it.

708
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:16,100
Here's my here's my like, oh, I feel dumb because I didn't process this.

709
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,380
I feel like I had heard over the years that this was kind of the, you know,

710
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,380
touchstone, it combines a lot of the elements of all the different pavilions.

711
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,580
But like if you stare at the building,

712
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,900
the vertical lines on the front go to a point, they go to a horizon at the top of

713
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,060
the building. Oh, interesting.

714
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,980
Did not catch that. Yeah, no, I didn't catch that either.

715
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:48,220
I I will also this this building has just given me this permanent attraction to

716
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:53,500
big austere buildings from the 80s built in office parks.

717
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,980
I can drive around because of this.

718
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:02,420
I'll be driving around, you know, Irvine or West Lake Village, California,

719
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,100
or the area around Fashion Island and Newport Beach.

720
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:11,260
Sometimes I will see a building and a corporate logo out in a big in a big lawn.

721
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,540
That's an important thing. Also, it's got to be a big austere,

722
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,020
sort of unfriendly, but imposing, but fascinating building.

723
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,100
And then a big lawn and then and then a like round sign up front.

724
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,060
I've got to put the land in this, too.

725
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,900
The land is also a very cool building.

726
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,820
But I,

727
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:32,300
I don't know if anyone can think of buildings where they've been to or work or

728
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:36,340
something that are like the Horizons building.

729
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,140
I can't get enough.

730
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:42,620
Like if I get a Horizons vibe from a building, I just it's it's like

731
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:46,340
the Ratatouille bite that the critic takes.

732
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:50,180
It just like flashes me back to it just takes me back to childhood.

733
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,820
And I feel good.

734
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,260
Well, I think there's going to be a lot of building

735
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:58,980
hunters now looking out for you. I hope so.

736
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,900
They know exactly. Is there a hashtag you could throw on this?

737
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,500
What you were talking about here?

738
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,620
Hashtag Horizons esque.

739
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,300
OK, yeah, that's good.

740
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,180
Think about it.

741
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:15,140
The two horizons for me, the building, I always think of, I don't know if you've

742
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,340
guys have seen Star Trek, the next generation, when they would do like we're

743
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:23,100
beaming down to a planet, an alien planet, and they will do like a

744
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:28,420
kind of a painted looking like far away shot of the planet with some buildings.

745
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,300
And then they'll just cut in.

746
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,460
It's obviously a shitty soundstage on the Paramount lot.

747
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,100
Like it's really like beautiful looking

748
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:40,060
picture of a planet with like cool looking buildings that are similar to the horizons

749
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,820
in the early Epcot buildings.

750
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:42,780
And then it cuts in.

751
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:48,460
It's just like it's either like Griffith Park or it's like some studio, some sound

752
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,140
stage on Paramount.

753
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:56,180
But that but the buildings to me get that give me that very like Star Trek vibe.

754
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,260
And yeah, it's a Logan's run thing, too.

755
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:04,620
Just like this should be just one model on a giant table that you only see for 10

756
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,420
seconds at the beginning of a movie.

757
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:12,020
But in this case, you get to go be inside it for a really long time.

758
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,260
Yeah, yeah, it is.

759
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,340
It would have been nice if they could have preserved.

760
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,100
I don't like keeping negative and talking about it, but like it would have been nice

761
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:23,420
if they could have preserved some of this a little more with Epcot.

762
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,100
Well, you also have the problem that

763
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,580
and this seems alternatively debunked or not debunked.

764
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,980
I can't tell, but there's at least the theory out there that there is a sinkhole

765
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:39,140
under this building and that might be some of the reason why Horizons went away.

766
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,620
Right. Yes.

767
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,580
And I think other parts of the building deteriorating, too.

768
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:48,100
I rewatched the documentary about Hoot and Chief, the guys who would constantly

769
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,980
sneak into Horizons and walk around it because there was no security system.

770
00:44:53,140 --> 00:45:00,580
And one time one of their feet went through rotten plywood

771
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:06,300
and that that has led to a injury, a pain, reoccurring pain in their foot.

772
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,460
They still have.

773
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:13,660
So they don't always keep everything up, up and going, maybe more now.

774
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:17,220
I feel like OSHA is a little more aggressive now, a little more.

775
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,260
But like what Scott was talking about on Haunted Mansion, it was like there's a moat

776
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,380
in the Madame Leota room in Haunted Mansion.

777
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,100
Oh, yeah. You can't walk up to her.

778
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,020
You would just fall.

779
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:27,780
Yeah.

780
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:33,180
So obviously these are already not designed for people to hang out in them casually.

781
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:33,820
Yes.

782
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,060
Oh, the other thing from that documentary,

783
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:42,060
this OmniMover vehicle has no restraints so you could just vault over it.

784
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,180
Oh, that's right.

785
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,540
That's why they were able to.

786
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,260
Yeah.

787
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,940
This is by Matt Serrano, who did the Halyx

788
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,060
documentary that we got to be a part of.

789
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,020
And yeah, it's so fascinating.

790
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,420
These guys shot all this footage of themselves running around, getting off

791
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:01,100
the ride and going and like we can go be in the scene for two full minutes before

792
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,620
anybody catches us. And it's all about like the.

793
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:08,860
All right. So there's a gap, this amount of gap between cars.

794
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,940
And we know if there's one that where there's six empty spaces,

795
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,380
that means that we won't get caught.

796
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,180
Like they figured out all the rhythms of it.

797
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,340
It feels oddly akin to like when you hear about the guy who learned how to game

798
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:23,900
Press Your Luck, the Lanny game show and like, all right, I figured out the code.

799
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,820
I cracked the code by watching it for hours and hours and hours.

800
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,300
But yes, so strange.

801
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:33,700
They just yeah, as opposed to safety bar lowers for you, they just jump out the top

802
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:40,820
and can go hang out with the family and feed the fake seal in the ocean world.

803
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,180
Yeah, I feel like they spent the collective,

804
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:47,020
like many hours just hanging out in the horizons.

805
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,500
Yeah, I mean, I am delighted by that story, but don't do that, folks.

806
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,300
Please don't stress me out.

807
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,940
Stress me out.

808
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,300
But a wonderful with some perspective,

809
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,020
with a couple of decades perspective to look back on it.

810
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:02,940
It's like, well, that's kind of cool.

811
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,420
Pretty impressive.

812
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,740
No way. I want people to go hang out there right now.

813
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:08,900
The parks aren't open.

814
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,700
Now is your time to sneak in.

815
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,420
What's the book about museum?

816
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,900
Is it the head?

817
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,220
The name in my head is like Basil E.

818
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,220
Frank Weiler.

819
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,700
Like, what's the book about staying over in a museum?

820
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,460
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

821
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,860
I might weigh the hell off on that name.

822
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:28,700
You know, there's a book about spending the night in the museum or a movie called

823
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,500
Night at the Museum, I was going to say, the movies.

824
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,460
Anyway, everyone.

825
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,540
Yeah, go do that.

826
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,660
Go find a vent to crawl into.

827
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:42,700
No one will find you if you go live in Rise of the Resistance for two months.

828
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,780
Have your royal tenenbaums evening

829
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:49,340
living in Anaheim, Rise of the Resistance.

830
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,340
That's right. Yes.

831
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,620
Am I way I weight?

832
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:52,980
Basil E.

833
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,860
Frank Weiler is it is that the museum?

834
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,260
Yeah, kids, yes.

835
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:00,340
Siblings run away to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

836
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,860
Got it right. OK, few self corrected.

837
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,260
No apology necessary.

838
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:05,340
Let's continue.

839
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,460
That's a funny.

840
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,940
That would be a funny episode.

841
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:12,780
Is we each bring in the weirdest kids book we were obsessed with or like kids think

842
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:19,300
we were obsessed with because I got some of my grandfather's books from the 1910s.

843
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,660
And some of those good books are weird.

844
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,420
Thanks. I don't believe that.

845
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,420
Yeah.

846
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,700
Can you throw can you can you just get a wetter appetite?

847
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,820
What's the name of one of these books?

848
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,020
The one that sticks out.

849
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,100
Well, there's two that stick out.

850
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,460
One was just called Boy Scouts on the Moon

851
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,540
and then another one,

852
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,700
which my family just laughed at because of the old aphorisms.

853
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:45,820
I believe it was called Poppy and the Pickled Peacock.

854
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,900
And that was like a blockbuster movie,

855
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,580
that kind of like rep alliteration back then that just drove people wild.

856
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,980
It was like the train driving right at you,

857
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:59,580
people losing their mind, which is surprisingly not in this ride.

858
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:04,300
They've got the moon, the moon with the ship in its eye,

859
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,340
like anything that references the early days of cinema.

860
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,060
It's got the moon with the ship in the eye.

861
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,700
Right. Earth. Yeah.

862
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,340
I am just real quick with that.

863
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:16,300
You reminded me with that kind of thing, like weird turn of the century stuff.

864
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,940
My my grandfather, who was a writer, I think

865
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:25,060
the least contributed some material to something called Captain Billy's Whiz Bang.

866
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,500
Which do you know about Captain Billy's Whiz Bang?

867
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,180
I think that's yeah, that's a ref.

868
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,180
That's also a reference to something.

869
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:34,940
I can't remember.

870
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,500
I think it's in the Music Man.

871
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,740
Oh, right. Yes, I think you're right.

872
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,420
It's the Music Man. That's what I'm thinking of.

873
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,260
I yes, it is. It is.

874
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,540
Yes, you're right. Wow.

875
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:44,700
No, wait a minute. It's in.

876
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,140
It's in You Got Trouble, isn't it?

877
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,660
Yes. Yeah, I believe so.

878
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,860
Is it a thing that's warping young minds?

879
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:51,980
This was kind of.

880
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:56,820
Yeah. It was like the Mad Magazine of its day, like a sort of like cheeky,

881
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:00,340
racy body magazine.

882
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,860
And just in Google imaging it, it looks

883
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:08,060
like I just found a cover that seems to reference the fatty Arbuckle incident.

884
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:12,540
Like they're parodying that in a Mad Magazine style.

885
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,740
So

886
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,900
surprising no one.

887
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,860
I have a copy of Captain Billy's Whiz Bang around here somewhere.

888
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,500
Whoa, whoa.

889
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:27,380
They put out a facsimile like 10 years ago, some like book publisher, comic

890
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:32,580
publisher, I have no idea who put it out, but I found it at a store and I bought it.

891
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:33,780
Wow. Wow.

892
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:37,740
I find it and see if there's a Gartner original in there.

893
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,620
Carl Schrader would be there.

894
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,740
Schrader. Check out Carl Schrader if he's in there.

895
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,620
Given Fatty Arbuckle the what for?

896
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,300
Yeah.

897
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,500
Anyways,

898
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:55,300
away from the 1920s into the the 2080s.

899
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,940
This is clearly.

900
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,180
What's that? Was that the year it was supposed to be?

901
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,660
100 years forward?

902
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,060
Yeah, apparently.

903
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,540
Again, thanks to Doug Jones for highlighting that fact.

904
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:08,460
I don't think I realize that, which is that you then you wonder, well, how could

905
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:12,740
it be the family from Carousel of Progress?

906
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,300
But of course, they jump 20 years in time in every scene.

907
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,100
The Carousel of Progress is a magical family in general.

908
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,140
They're like a bicentennial man situation.

909
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:25,380
Like how could the same family go from

910
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,020
the turn of the century to the 60s to the 90s or whatever?

911
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,140
And I guess it keeps going.

912
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:32,700
This eternal family makes it all the way to 2086.

913
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:39,220
They're like another kid's book, Tuck Everlasting, the family cursed to never die.

914
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,700
But it wouldn't be a problem if you got

915
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,900
to live in this world, go into this future.

916
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:49,020
But I guess we're we're going a little out of order because the well, OK, before

917
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:54,660
we this is going very haunted mansion, we talked about the outside

918
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,620
the the inside, then you just walk in that first room

919
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,820
and then you see a big display of like the flight itinerary.

920
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,180
Like this is your airport.

921
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,940
Here's where you could go, depending on which gate you go to.

922
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,300
And it says Futureport, just that.

923
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,540
Oh, my God. This like octagonal.

924
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:17,620
I don't know how many sides it is, but like just the font of Futureport,

925
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,940
the crazy places you get to go striped with pink neon.

926
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:25,420
Every room in this thing is such a aesthetic dream for me.

927
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,980
That feels like

928
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:32,300
like in your dream house, one of the rooms looks like that.

929
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,140
Yeah, absolutely.

930
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:39,860
And also with Dreamhouse, you I was thinking how much I would like to have.

931
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,420
This is a thing that's in a couple Disney rides, but it's in this too.

932
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:47,260
Once you board the attraction right before you take off into the ride proper,

933
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:51,540
you are facing a wall of like pink slats.

934
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,060
I guess the slats aren't pink.

935
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,780
It's like glowing pink,

936
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,380
just like a big wall of light.

937
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:02,620
And then those like oval shaped like futurey.

938
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:07,300
I don't know how to describe it exactly, but it's in Space Mountain.

939
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,500
When you get off of Space Mountain, those kinds of things, those it's future slats

940
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,860
and the Star Tours in the line as well.

941
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:18,580
I would love for like just a wall to be like that in my house.

942
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,820
And I don't know how to do it.

943
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:23,300
How would you how you would have to get somebody to make like you'd have to go

944
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:28,820
to like Nick Offerman's place to get him to make you future slats, maybe?

945
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:29,620
I think so.

946
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:32,060
But I feel like I'd be going on and on about, you know, it's like this I've got

947
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:34,740
a right horizons, which is kind of this cool image of the future.

948
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,620
Provincetari.

949
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,180
And, you know, it's all because I lived

950
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,660
in the 80s and he would just glare at me the entire time unmovingly.

951
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:42,660
It's possible.

952
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,580
I get so insecure.

953
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:48,380
But maybe you just say, well, do it and you'd be fine.

954
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:49,900
You've given him money and he does it.

955
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,620
And look, I'm paying you, Nick.

956
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:56,780
Yeah, shop up the shop up some future slats for me.

957
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:00,060
Future slats, I've never seen at any of these Disney auctions,

958
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,860
future slats on the menu.

959
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:06,060
I wonder if it was built into the like the support beam.

960
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,580
It was built into the drywall or something.

961
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,220
Maybe. But I think don't isn't it?

962
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,980
It's probably comprised of a bunch of smaller pieces.

963
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:17,540
Another anyone let me know if you know how.

964
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,220
What do you know about future slats?

965
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:23,340
Listener Hashtag Horizons, as cash tag future slats.

966
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,540
I like, yeah, I was just gonna say, like,

967
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:31,820
I would want a hallway to lead into the room, too, that has sort of that plastic key

968
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:36,260
kind of vibe, which is also very like Starship Enterprise.

969
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,660
Well, big time.

970
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:38,860
Yes.

971
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,460
Yeah, monorail ish.

972
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:42,460
All of that.

973
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,660
Yeah, feels like part of a modern.

974
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:46,380
Yeah. Yeah.

975
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,140
Monorail has that kind of thing, too.

976
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,060
Yeah, absolutely.

977
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:49,860
I got to crack it.

978
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,180
I got to figure it out.

979
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:56,980
I think even before that boarding, like you were saying, the departure board

980
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,340
all around you, there's a lot of glowing colored lights.

981
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:04,620
You go around some corners and then you get on the ride.

982
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,700
And when there is a hundred and it was

983
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:09,580
something like one hundred and seventy four ride vehicles on this Omni

984
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:15,020
Mover system, I never remember waiting a long time for Horizons.

985
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,660
Well, I think that's right.

986
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:20,180
I mean, that's the problem, probably, other than the sinkhole.

987
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,420
Well, yeah, that that, too.

988
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:26,740
But but it was nice that it was a ride.

989
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:30,340
I feel like the outdoor

990
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,940
the outdoor section of like the spaceship Earth Q backs up a lot.

991
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,300
And that can look a lot worse than it is.

992
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,700
I really don't have much memory of the queue for World of Motion,

993
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,420
but I think it's Horizons.

994
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:46,180
You get the leaderboard and you're pretty quickly at the loading area.

995
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,620
And and not.

996
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:51,020
And then the first thing you see, you see this crazy ride.

997
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:58,620
It's like an Omni Mover, but it's got walls on the sides and it the track is above you.

998
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:00,380
It's not below you.

999
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:02,860
Feels like it feels like Harry Potter in a way.

1000
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:08,020
These like a little these little pods that are that face flat.

1001
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:11,340
They're you know, we were also we're talking about Ghostbusters.

1002
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:16,940
And we looked at the vehicles for a proposed 80s Ghostbusters shooting ride

1003
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:21,580
that never happened, and it felt like the vibe of these ride vehicles a little bit.

1004
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,060
I love the color scheme.

1005
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,860
I feel like Ghostbusters would have been similar to it's like that

1006
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:31,460
that like reddish orange that's the backing and then just like black silver on

1007
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,340
the front. They look so cool.

1008
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:36,660
I'd also love like a die cast one of these.

1009
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:37,940
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1010
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:41,780
That's I mean, just in general, like the nostalgia merchandise seems lacking from

1011
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:47,180
Horizons, like give us the building, give us a little building, give us a little toy

1012
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,740
of the building. Oh, my God.

1013
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:51,140
One of the kits you put together that's

1014
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:54,740
mostly like just really cut up your fingers if you try to do it.

1015
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,660
I let's give it to you. I'll do it.

1016
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,740
I will destroy my hands.

1017
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,020
I bring that up.

1018
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:06,860
I could not find a lot of real vintage merchandise on eBay for Horizons.

1019
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:12,220
I found a lot of T public accounts selling like the logo.

1020
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:16,820
So if you want the logo, you can certainly get variations of it.

1021
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:21,180
But I really didn't find a lot of like vintage stuff out there for sale.

1022
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:24,300
I just think this was not appreciated at the time.

1023
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,940
Like, yeah, in hindsight, I think the

1024
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,900
groundswell of support has happened, but it just at the time, I just don't think

1025
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:34,380
it was moving enough people and we can see that now.

1026
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:38,780
And they're not like exploiting it for nostalgia money.

1027
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,180
They don't they don't see it.

1028
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:43,500
I think I think it's there now more than they know.

1029
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,060
That's what I'm saying.

1030
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:46,660
I guess the fact that those guys were

1031
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:50,780
able to sneak around the ride for so long and that they could count on giant

1032
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:54,660
stretches of ride vehicles that were empty going through constantly.

1033
00:57:54,900 --> 00:58:00,660
That sort of tells you it's a bummer, too, because like in like Sinbad ride in Japan

1034
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,700
and we were only there for a few days, but we went on in a couple of days and it was

1035
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:07,500
like that was empty, too, and I was like, I hope this doesn't mean this is going away.

1036
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:12,500
But it does feel like sometimes great rides aren't people aren't going on them.

1037
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,620
But some of that is they're efficient.

1038
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:16,620
Oh, yeah, for sure.

1039
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:21,140
And then both Sinbad and this one obviously was an omnivore that was very big.

1040
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,020
Yes, that's definitely part of it.

1041
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:28,300
But I feel like maybe that maybe works like Haunted Mansion is can get through a

1042
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,260
lot of people, but is, you know, usually as a decent line.

1043
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,620
It's pretty backed up. Yeah.

1044
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:38,300
So I wonder if it's like those evil money people at the parks look at it and go,

1045
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:42,900
well, this this line is isn't longer than five minutes.

1046
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,540
Means it's not that popular.

1047
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:47,100
Well, maybe they had dreams of a ride

1048
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,780
that would give people seizures and make them sick.

1049
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:53,820
They just had to get in

1050
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,900
a ride that could

1051
00:58:56,100 --> 00:59:02,060
affect you negatively for the rest of your life from the people at Compaq.

1052
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,820
All right. Oh, my God.

1053
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,980
We had to do Mission Space.

1054
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:06,940
Mission Space.

1055
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:14,420
I'm also getting the sense now that there's a dedicated Mission Space fan base

1056
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,980
that I did not think existed.

1057
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,460
Maybe we'll run into them.

1058
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:20,700
About. Yeah, we've been negative about

1059
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:21,900
Mission Space, or at least I have.

1060
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:22,940
And I think Scott is Jason.

1061
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:26,260
Are you well, I less negative.

1062
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,820
I think the first time or two I wrote it,

1063
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:32,940
I was very impressed at what it was able to simulate.

1064
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:39,380
And then the last time my family all went down, we all walked off and everyone needed

1065
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:46,940
to sit on a bench like everyone's like, I need 15 minutes to collect myself.

1066
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:52,460
Everyone was like, oh, like between headaches and queasiness.

1067
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,860
Oh, yeah. No, that's my experience.

1068
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:59,740
I think visually, I think the Spaceship Earth building is

1069
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,100
cool to look at.

1070
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,100
Mission Space or Mission Space.

1071
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,420
What did I say? Yeah.

1072
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,020
Spaceship. Yeah.

1073
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,780
No, Spaceship Earth rules.

1074
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:09,820
No, Mission Space.

1075
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,620
I think the building's all right.

1076
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:16,660
But compare going deep dive on Horizon for like a week now.

1077
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:20,740
It's just like, oh, man, it really makes Mission Space look like shit.

1078
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:25,140
It's also a ride that is 15 minutes of sitting on a bench.

1079
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,060
Yeah, that's true.

1080
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,460
Best way. Seeing the best stuff,

1081
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:35,100
seeing the looking at a screen the size of like a Nintendo DS.

1082
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,420
And that's you're watching.

1083
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:39,900
That's another thing that's unique about it.

1084
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:45,260
It's like three times as long as other OmniMover rides, but it's

1085
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:49,580
a third as long as the moving theater kind of rides.

1086
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,860
And I don't really know what else falls into that category.

1087
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,700
You know, it's just strange.

1088
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:58,980
It almost reminds me of Rise of the Resistance in its like weird multi act

1089
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:04,660
nature and that you explore all the parts of this little campus in many different

1090
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:08,980
ways that combine here's the animatronic zone and here's the screen zone.

1091
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:11,620
And here's a different kind of screen zone.

1092
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:13,940
It's just it's all over the place.

1093
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:17,420
Yeah. And I think that maybe part of its

1094
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:20,780
Genesis, like it had so many different names.

1095
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:22,980
They were going to call it Century Three,

1096
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:26,220
but they were concerned international guests wouldn't understand that.

1097
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:28,820
At some point it was just called Horizon.

1098
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:34,740
And then we got Horizons briefly was considered the name briefly considered

1099
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,220
was Future Probe.

1100
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:42,420
And everyone's like, oh, that's the medical implications on that.

1101
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:46,980
We're all we're all aware that we have probes in our future and yeah, but it's

1102
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:50,540
good, it'll help us take care of potential health issues.

1103
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,220
But I don't want to think about them when I'm on a ride.

1104
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:57,660
Did they did they want to call Body Wars Future Probes?

1105
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:59,300
More accurate, that's what it is.

1106
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:03,300
Yeah, yeah, that would make sense.

1107
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,140
Just the ideas jot it down.

1108
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:07,700
That's early idea was for innovation and

1109
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:13,340
enterprise, which became science and in a venture in a venture.

1110
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:16,260
Then, oh, what's this one?

1111
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:19,860
GE really wanted it to be about Thomas Edison.

1112
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,180
That seemed like it got scrapped pretty quickly.

1113
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:26,260
A another name I came across, the Incredible Time Machine,

1114
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:30,420
Colin, a journey into the worlds of science and invention.

1115
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:34,420
That doesn't really roll off the tongue like Horizons.

1116
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:38,660
No, I mean, Horizons is a great name.

1117
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:44,500
Yeah, it also sounds like it could be maybe like a rehab facility

1118
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:47,620
or the name or the name of your yearbook.

1119
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:49,460
Yes.

1120
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:50,580
Yes, for sure.

1121
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:53,500
I look back at 2003.

1122
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:54,380
Right.

1123
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:57,700
It is a great name, though, but it is not so specific.

1124
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:02,460
No, I got to say, though, this Century 3 piece of concept art is awesome.

1125
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:06,540
Well, yeah, like I wish they sold a decent print of that.

1126
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:09,620
That's all vehicles going in a big starburst.

1127
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:10,500
That looks real cool.

1128
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:11,580
Century 3.

1129
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:12,780
Century 3 is a cool name.

1130
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:13,940
I do like Century 3.

1131
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:14,740
Yeah.

1132
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:19,580
I think there's a vehicle in the ride labeled Century 3 somewhere.

1133
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:20,380
I think that's right.

1134
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:21,940
Yeah.

1135
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:25,620
Well, let's get into some stuff.

1136
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:33,660
I mean, I don't know that we have to room by room it, but I guess in a way,

1137
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:38,580
I sort of until watching ride throughs, I sort of forgot all of the past of the

1138
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:40,700
future or the future. Wait.

1139
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,540
Yeah.

1140
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:44,420
The future that never was.

1141
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,260
The past. Yeah.

1142
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:47,380
Which that's another thing.

1143
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:48,780
There's a lot of Spaceship Earth.

1144
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:54,340
Also, you end up watching old footage with kooky music, like da da da da da da,

1145
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,380
which also I think happens on Dream Flight.

1146
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:01,020
I think I mushed that up in my head, too.

1147
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:04,060
But it's neat.

1148
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:08,020
You see Jules Verne in a pod with a dog.

1149
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:09,740
I guess I'm confused by that.

1150
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:13,060
That's how he thought he would get to the moon is

1151
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:17,860
in a little pod where he'd be standing and have a little trunk.

1152
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:19,060
Yeah, a chicken.

1153
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,860
I think the chicken would provide eggs, maybe.

1154
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:24,940
Well, they were also like his idea was like, well,

1155
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:30,380
what if you built a gun big enough to shoot a man to the moon?

1156
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:31,580
Cool.

1157
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:34,300
Yeah, you'd write like, you were in the bullet.

1158
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,820
Yes.

1159
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:43,540
And then you bring one chicken with you who you hopefully is pretty regular with

1160
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:48,380
egg production, which then do you have to bring a hot plate so that you can

1161
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:49,860
cook them up in there?

1162
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,500
Could a rocky style.

1163
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:52,820
Oh, sure. Yeah.

1164
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:54,060
Eat them. Eat them raw.

1165
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:58,220
Pure proteins straight out of the shell.

1166
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:00,380
Yeah, that's all you need.

1167
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:02,580
I mean, that's everyone else is overthinking it right now.

1168
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:06,780
We just get in a giant bullet and go to the moon with a chicken.

1169
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:10,980
Now, should I strap myself in inside the bullet?

1170
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:15,740
And the same question goes for my dog and my chicken.

1171
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:19,580
Or do I just stand without a seat belt?

1172
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:21,340
Hmm.

1173
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:23,460
I think you probably should.

1174
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:25,980
Well, if the bullet is completely the

1175
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:30,860
correct human size and there won't be any room to bump around in.

1176
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:31,820
Oh, no, no, no.

1177
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:34,260
Jules's vision was that there'd be a lot

1178
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:39,140
of room and that the chicken and the dog are untethered to anything.

1179
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:44,620
And that he's just in a full, thick suit, like a big, starchy 1800 suit.

1180
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:48,260
I don't think it's occurred to me how insane this scene is until right now.

1181
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:49,380
Yeah, no, you're right.

1182
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:50,220
It's a good point.

1183
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:53,140
Standing through my trip to space.

1184
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:59,100
It feels like correct because of all the other like, oh, DaVinci and Michelangelo

1185
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:02,180
paint, but that's like normal stuff compared to this.

1186
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:04,420
And when you also meet Jules Verne, this

1187
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:09,260
ride came later, but you meet Jules Verne in the old dreamatorium or whatever that

1188
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:12,420
ride, the Visionarium. Oh, yeah.

1189
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:13,660
There's multiple else.

1190
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:17,700
Magic Kingdom then also had a Jules Verne thing.

1191
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:20,340
And then Doc Brown's obsessed with Jules Verne.

1192
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:23,500
And then a lot of there's all these things that are like this is the future.

1193
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:27,020
Jules Verne and so much Jules Verne in the parks.

1194
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:31,260
And Jules and Verne were Doc's kids in the cartoon.

1195
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:33,580
And in the movie, technically, I guess.

1196
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:36,180
Yes. And somebody pointed out when I

1197
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:41,420
posted a picture of me with my finger in an inappropriate place on the monorail

1198
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:46,380
after a few too many adult libations, and somebody said that it looked like Verne

1199
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:51,340
at the end of Back to the Future 3, who's weirdly pointing to himself.

1200
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,100
Oh, right, right, right.

1201
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,700
Whatever the hell is happening there.

1202
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,380
So I'm sorry.

1203
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:57,060
Yeah, that's a pretty bad own.

1204
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:58,780
I'm sorry I looked like Verne.

1205
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:01,500
That's something to aim for, is to not look like Verne.

1206
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:02,700
Look like Verne.

1207
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,420
It's funny, name your kids Jules.

1208
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,540
Jules and Verne is such a, oh, what a tribute.

1209
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:09,620
Your father must have your mother must have loved his work.

1210
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:14,980
But then, like, if it was like, hey, Verne, it totally loses any.

1211
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:16,820
Like if you're completely out of contact,

1212
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:19,700
just like then you just think of Ernest's friend Verne.

1213
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:20,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1214
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:23,060
You are introduced after your brother.

1215
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:24,540
Yeah, right.

1216
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,060
Jules, at least you go Jules.

1217
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:28,020
That's a sophisticated name.

1218
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:29,980
You go, hey, Verne, what's a Verne?

1219
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:30,940
Yeah, yeah.

1220
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:32,780
And Ernest ruined it forever.

1221
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:34,660
Ernest. It's Ernest's fault.

1222
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,340
There's also like things for a lot of people.

1223
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:40,420
I'm sorry. There's like little lanterns in this Jules Verne car, too.

1224
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:42,020
I kind of can't get off of it now.

1225
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:46,260
Like you had to do would you have to like light a candle inside these?

1226
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:47,620
Yeah.

1227
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:52,220
And then there's drawers, but the drawers aren't baby locked.

1228
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:55,260
Like these drawers would be flying around.

1229
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:56,380
He's the first.

1230
01:07:56,380 --> 01:08:00,620
OK, the first things I'll say is that he looks like he's in Jeannie's bottle for my

1231
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:03,220
dream of Jeannie. Oh, yeah.

1232
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:06,780
And then second, second, he

1233
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:10,740
it's like Ed Wynn in Mary Poppins a little bit.

1234
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:11,820
Oh, yeah.

1235
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:13,620
So it's like he's laughing and he's

1236
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:17,060
floating and like you don't get the sense that like he's in space here.

1237
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,340
No, not really.

1238
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:23,820
The the there's like kind of a tube at the bottom, which maybe answers a question

1239
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:30,500
that I had, which is how are Jules and the dog and the chicken doing their business?

1240
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:31,660
Bottom tube.

1241
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:32,860
Yeah, bottom tube.

1242
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:35,820
You shitting the bottom tube.

1243
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,820
I shouldn't underestimate him.

1244
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:41,540
He thought about unless it's unless it's just one of these like lanterns isn't a

1245
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:46,020
light, but like it's not lit and they just like keep putting their droppings into

1246
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:47,460
the top of that.

1247
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:49,860
Could that be sort of like the exhaust?

1248
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,580
Could that be helping fuel the propulsion?

1249
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:53,820
Oh, maybe so. Yeah.

1250
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:57,620
In case it loses any energy from having been shot out of a giant gun.

1251
01:08:57,820 --> 01:08:59,900
Right. Exactly.

1252
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:04,740
And then, of course, we know that the bullet ultimately ends up in the moon's eye

1253
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:11,060
and that the eye winces and it seems mad that a bullet he's not the moon's not dead.

1254
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:12,260
But here he is right now.

1255
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:13,460
There's that moon.

1256
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:16,260
I love that trip to the moon moon.

1257
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:21,940
Yeah. And that was what comedy was in France for like 80, 90 years until they got Jerry Lewis.

1258
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:27,980
They were still just laughing at the moon with a with a bullet spaceship in its eye.

1259
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:30,100
They gave it awards every year.

1260
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:31,220
Yes, every year.

1261
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:35,740
Once again, the best actor, the bullet moon.

1262
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:38,140
He did other movies, romcoms.

1263
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,300
He fell in love with the sun.

1264
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,780
The French loved the smashing pumpkins tonight.

1265
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:44,780
Tonight video.

1266
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,980
Finally, a return to form.

1267
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:50,300
We haven't liked the movies since the professor.

1268
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:54,500
Billy Corrigan is our prime minister now.

1269
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,420
What else is in that old time?

1270
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:01,820
Are there other animatronics in that in that initial run?

1271
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:06,580
Well, there's yeah, there's all the like kind of illustrated version of the Da Vinci

1272
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:12,620
stuff, and then it kind of very quickly jumps to like a 1930s pulp

1273
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:17,380
future with with the infamous robot Butler and a lot of just art.

1274
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:21,540
Everything is art deco, the windows, the chairs, the avid.

1275
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:23,820
I think they reference the Avenue of the Planets.

1276
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:28,980
Does that get referenced in Tomorrowland 94 as well?

1277
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:30,060
All right.

1278
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:35,140
I future that never was, I think, is a reliable theme park

1279
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:36,420
stand by.

1280
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:37,420
It's always good.

1281
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:40,740
I like any version of them, essentially.

1282
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:43,820
Yeah, that I love that weird future.

1283
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:45,380
I like a little robot Butler.

1284
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:46,420
I like this.

1285
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:49,820
There's a big there's a hair cutting machine that tans you.

1286
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:53,060
And if you watch the videos, you see a close up with like the different settings.

1287
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:58,260
You can go to Hawaiian tan or Palm Springs tan.

1288
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:04,860
I think that's where Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow is playing in an old timey fashion.

1289
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:07,620
There's a woman in a bathtub at some point.

1290
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:10,060
That's a Hoppin future.

1291
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:10,820
It's a Hoppin.

1292
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:16,300
That's the same version of it's a big great big beautiful tomorrow that plays

1293
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:21,900
when they are demonstrating the radio they have in the progress.

1294
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,100
Yes.

1295
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:24,260
Like the very

1296
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:26,580
don't don't don't don't don't don't don't.

1297
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:28,620
It's like a real like

1298
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:29,580
John T.

1299
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,660
Describe that I guess John T. is the word.

1300
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,220
Yeah.

1301
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:36,700
How many people like this is

1302
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:39,660
what is the percentage of people that went through it and went, oh my God, this

1303
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:42,940
is a sequel to the carousel of progress.

1304
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:46,260
How many people knew the carousel of progress to begin with?

1305
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:47,300
Right.

1306
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:51,180
They're like, oh, yeah, they had probably just been on it that morning

1307
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:54,060
and already lots of yes.

1308
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:59,380
I don't underestimate the progress lamp, the version from the World's Fair,

1309
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:03,660
because if you were from the the tri-state New York, New Jersey,

1310
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:07,700
Pennsylvania, like area when the World's Fair is, that was a big thing.

1311
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,940
My dad always talks about going to the World's Fair.

1312
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:13,300
So then everyone who was a kid go into the World's Fair.

1313
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:17,340
Then they can hop on a plane when they're adults two hours away, go to Disney,

1314
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:19,820
see the carousel of progress again.

1315
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:24,420
So kind of primed for like a big horizon sort of thing.

1316
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:25,340
Sure.

1317
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:28,740
But I'm still I think I feel like what Mike is saying is like,

1318
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:36,140
if you're like a sunburnt like Budweiser drinking half shirt guy from Florida

1319
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:41,140
in 1983, maybe your World's Fair knowledge is low.

1320
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:42,580
Yeah.

1321
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:48,980
But, you know, every you could be always surprised by the type of World's Fair fan.

1322
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:52,740
You know, you never know who loves the World's Fair.

1323
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:57,140
Shouldn't judge a World's Fair fan by its cover.

1324
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:59,980
Who cares? The secret flame.

1325
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:02,100
There's a lot of talk about, you know,

1326
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:06,020
automation right now because of the pandemic and some companies are now going

1327
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:11,740
to probably use this opportunity to accelerate to automation and to

1328
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:16,780
replace human workers, I will say from this scene,

1329
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:21,980
if they do it with cute robots, I think we'll all be a little bit more happy

1330
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:25,700
with it, even though it'll put a lot of people out of work and cause some strife

1331
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:26,260
for a while.

1332
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:27,940
All good. Yeah. As long as they're cute.

1333
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:28,660
Yeah.

1334
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:29,180
Fine.

1335
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:29,820
Don't deal.

1336
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:33,820
It's like this dish this dishwashing robot, I think, deserves more merch.

1337
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,660
Robot Butler sort of I think has become the most famous.

1338
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:37,140
Yeah.

1339
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:38,980
He's got the merchandise.

1340
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:40,260
I've got Scott.

1341
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:41,700
Do you have him in a Park Star?

1342
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:43,660
I don't have him, no.

1343
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:45,260
But they made him.

1344
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:49,740
But I feel like Dishwashing Robot definitely deserves some love.

1345
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:51,340
A little more attention. Sure.

1346
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:53,060
Yeah.

1347
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:55,140
Where do we go from here?

1348
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:58,500
Yeah, we were in that Screenland,

1349
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,140
lots of future visions and Buck Rogersy stuff.

1350
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:03,860
Yeah, there's the version of the future.

1351
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:06,620
The next two scenes are both kind of neon

1352
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:11,900
wire work scenes, which are really art movie concept albumy.

1353
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,500
And apparently we're put in as a cost

1354
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:18,140
cutting measure, but I think are so cool to look at.

1355
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:20,260
There's the movies,

1356
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:23,140
popular culture kind of movie versions of the future.

1357
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:28,980
And then there's the neon, like modern 1950s view of the future.

1358
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:30,060
Yeah.

1359
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:33,980
I mean, you could definitely like, obviously, these are videos.

1360
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:36,220
My memory isn't so clear of the ride.

1361
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:41,140
But yes, as you're saying, like you can tell it's like not as expensive as robots.

1362
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:42,900
But you're watching it like this looks awesome.

1363
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,060
This looks like a cool like real life Jetsons.

1364
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:47,260
Right. Yeah.

1365
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:50,620
When do we end up on?

1366
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,660
When do we end up in OmniMax?

1367
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:54,380
So the OmniMax is next.

1368
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:59,660
And this is right before it is the second of three of like kind of transitional,

1369
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:05,660
like colored, like cloud sequences, which I I think work pretty well as a transition

1370
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:09,340
rather than just like black, like totally black room.

1371
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:14,060
I think that's kind of like the lights are synced up to the talking.

1372
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,180
Oh, that's right. Yeah.

1373
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:18,060
Oh, the 1950s.

1374
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:21,780
There is a great dialogue exchange about like, wow,

1375
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:26,060
we thought the 1950s, that version of the future is pretty out there.

1376
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:33,580
And then the grandmother again says, like, well, we all wanted to have some fun.

1377
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:37,140
You know, everyone keeps bringing up fun

1378
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:42,060
in this ride, which is very funny to me.

1379
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:44,540
The

1380
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:49,180
these these lines, again, have not lasted like the Carousel of Progress.

1381
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:52,260
I assume just because it's not as round as long.

1382
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:55,780
But I they haven't they didn't stick with me even as much as they did with you.

1383
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:59,780
Did you were you listening for the old people talking and writing down?

1384
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:01,500
Or was that just something that struck you?

1385
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:07,260
It just struck me after a few viewings of like, this is very funny.

1386
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:11,860
The naturalism they tried to make this the way they tried to do this dialogue.

1387
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:15,340
It is it is funny because

1388
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:17,500
there I guess I guess, yeah, what you're

1389
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:21,820
illustrating is they're still sort of playing on the old trope of like

1390
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:25,020
the husband and wife hate each other.

1391
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:27,220
They're going to be passive aggressive.

1392
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:31,780
They're not applying sort of the like like Start to the Next Generation's concept.

1393
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:35,820
Gene Roddenberry's concept of the future was that by and large, humans had

1394
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:39,820
resolved their interpersonal conflicts. Right.

1395
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:44,060
He was like he was talking about like, you know, they're really just trying to like

1396
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:48,300
go about the universe and try to deal with problems that come into contact.

1397
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,700
They come in contact with.

1398
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:54,820
But the Disney futurism was still it was still like, well, the husband and wife are

1399
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:57,740
passive aggressive and they cut each other down.

1400
01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:00,300
And that's just how it always will be.

1401
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,140
So they were still going with an old school

1402
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:05,820
like sitcom way of approaching their future characters.

1403
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:07,020
It's optimistic.

1404
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:11,980
But you got to get a little lock horns in there for mom and dad to laugh.

1405
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:14,940
Are the lock horns represented in Toon Lagoon?

1406
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:17,660
That is a great question.

1407
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:20,500
I could be wrong. Are they King Feature Syndicate?

1408
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:25,460
Well, I'll have to look that up, otherwise I won't get to sleep tonight.

1409
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:32,820
So, yeah, so from the cloud sequence, then you hit the OmniMax screen sequence.

1410
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:37,580
We see some DNA chains, which is like a pretty new thing.

1411
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:40,940
I think we were to DNA aware at that point.

1412
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:42,060
That all looks cool.

1413
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:45,180
Had to be computer rendered.

1414
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:50,180
If I could nerd out slightly on a thing here,

1415
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:54,500
there is some cool synth stuff going on in the sequence kind of throughout the ride,

1416
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:58,420
but especially in here, there's a real synth landscape happening.

1417
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:01,460
And I was like, I wonder if I could figure out who did it.

1418
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:02,660
I wonder if I could look it up.

1419
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:05,220
I looked it up. It's a guy named Michael Bautiker.

1420
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,300
Michael Bautiker is one of my favorite

1421
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:10,340
names that you see in albums,

1422
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:11,980
liner notes all the time.

1423
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:14,380
I was so excited to see his name.

1424
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:16,860
He's a Thriller guy. He's all over Thriller.

1425
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:20,660
He's on all my favorite stuff, which is like Michael McDonald and George Benson

1426
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:22,940
and Al Jarreau. We Are the World.

1427
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:25,780
I think the beginning, the big synthy part of We Are the World is him.

1428
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:29,060
He did the score for Buckaroo Banzai.

1429
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:30,980
So that's a cool one.

1430
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:33,620
Pleasant greatest love of all by Whitney Houston.

1431
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:38,260
Mainly was very excited to see Michael Bautiker's name because

1432
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:43,180
we on the Main Street Electrical Parade, we talked about my thing, Lords of Synth.

1433
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:47,820
Lords of Synth is about like people like analogs of

1434
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:50,620
Agergio Moroder and Vangelis and Wendy Carlos.

1435
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:53,860
And to do Wendy Carlos, I was like, I remember tossing out like,

1436
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:55,700
now that's got to be one of those old keyboards.

1437
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:59,260
It's like an old Moog and it's got like all the patches, all the wires.

1438
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:00,140
So go find that.

1439
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,260
And then some production designer is like,

1440
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:05,740
those are extremely expensive and very hard to find.

1441
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:10,140
And so he just went searching for people who had just actually had working

1442
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:13,740
equipment from that era, like what Wendy Carlos would have used.

1443
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:15,580
And where did he end up finding one?

1444
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:18,500
From this gentleman, Michael Bautiker.

1445
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:21,020
We used a real old keyboard.

1446
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:23,900
I looked up what it is. It's the Moog System 55.

1447
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:27,180
We used a real like vintage piece of equipment.

1448
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:31,140
And I remember being told, if you break this thing, this costs like two times

1449
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:37,100
the budget of this entire piece, so do not be extremely careful with it.

1450
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:37,860
We were.

1451
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:41,820
I didn't know until after we shot it that it was this is from the collection

1452
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:43,660
of this guy who played on Thriller.

1453
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:47,380
I'm 80 percent sure he played the creepy,

1454
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:53,380
awesome, evocative synths that play while you're waiting for Captain Eho, like outside.

1455
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:55,700
Like there's all this ambient stuff at the beginning.

1456
01:19:55,940 --> 01:20:01,100
And maybe, maybe some of this Horizon stuff was played on that thing that we got

1457
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:07,060
to use as Carlo Windows's synth in one of my favorite things I've ever been a part of.

1458
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:12,420
Was it plugged in on doing it or was it just for the look?

1459
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:14,100
Just for the look? No, no, no, we didn't.

1460
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:19,260
I think you'd need like a real technician to figure out how the hell to operate it.

1461
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:23,980
And I remember the actress being very tentative, like, OK, I heard the scary

1462
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:28,140
warning and we're like, just bash the thing, keep plugging stuff in and out.

1463
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:30,340
And she's like, should I though?

1464
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:31,100
Yeah.

1465
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:33,300
And you are still paying for the repairs.

1466
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:38,180
But it was very funny to see Josh Fadum take a pratfall through it.

1467
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:39,780
Didn't end up using it in the cut.

1468
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:40,660
It just didn't work.

1469
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:42,460
But it was fun. I'm glad he tried it.

1470
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:47,820
And yes, I will owe money to Michael Bodeker for the rest of my life.

1471
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:51,260
That would honestly, they'll give you a good excuse maybe to see him once in a while.

1472
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:52,500
Oh, my God. Yeah.

1473
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:55,180
I've been wondering if there's a way to contact him.

1474
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:58,380
Here's a check. Here's your check for the month.

1475
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:02,300
What I heard is that because when I asked, like, why did this guy lend it out?

1476
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,260
And he said, well, I explained the concept

1477
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:07,380
and that it was referencing, you know, Wendy Carlos and stuff.

1478
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:08,780
And he was like, that sounds cool.

1479
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:12,020
Look, I should charge you way more, but I just want this thing to be a part of it.

1480
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:15,140
I think he's just like a nice guy.

1481
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:19,460
So, yeah, listen to his cool stuff, especially in this Omni-Max room.

1482
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:21,500
This guy rules.

1483
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:22,380
That's very cool.

1484
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:27,220
And accompanied by like just really, again, abstract, but pretty beautiful.

1485
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:33,580
Like, it feels like an art film when they cut from a city to a microprocessor.

1486
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:36,300
Very still kind of new in the popular

1487
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:42,100
consciousness at the time, and then crystals and the ocean and DNA strands.

1488
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:45,740
And at the end, just the sun.

1489
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:51,020
Yeah, this is in that zone of like scary Epcot films.

1490
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:53,220
The films announcing Epcot were scary.

1491
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:56,860
The films in the Universe of Energy, the movie at the end of Maelstrom,

1492
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:01,180
just these like strange narrator free.

1493
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:06,140
You're just left to free associate what imagery is all about.

1494
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:11,180
There's so many films in Epcot and all of them extremely stark, all of them very adults.

1495
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:15,620
There's nothing where somebody's like doing a cute voice and talking to you.

1496
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:20,340
It's all like just like criterion type

1497
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:23,940
scary 70s documentaries.

1498
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:26,900
It would be these are the you would be like if you were

1499
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:30,220
if it would be like the equivalent of like taking a film class in college and

1500
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:34,580
they're like, now we have to watch like 2001 and now we have to watch.

1501
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:36,740
These are the challenging films.

1502
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:38,740
These are. Yeah.

1503
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:43,460
You're not going to do your Wizard of Oz is in your Indiana Jones.

1504
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:49,340
You're getting like Stan Brakhage ink blots, paint, paint drops and stuff.

1505
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:52,380
But I love I love scary star Epcot.

1506
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:57,220
But of course, things get a little friendlier when we go to the future.

1507
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:00,700
And this is the meat of the thing that you are.

1508
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:07,860
You visit three very different visions of the future, which are essentially land,

1509
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:10,420
sea and space, I guess, land.

1510
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:13,580
You could be more specific and say desert.

1511
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:16,180
Well, you see the irrigated desert.

1512
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:17,980
The grandparents live the city.

1513
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:20,940
See, that's where the city is separate from.

1514
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:23,940
Is that that's a considerate part of land in general?

1515
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:25,940
Yeah, land is kind of split in two.

1516
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:30,780
That's another cool like a film cut almost where it's like you see the apartment.

1517
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:31,860
They're like, I'll take the city.

1518
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:33,220
Yes, it's always exciting.

1519
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:40,460
And then they kind of transition into the the deserts, the reclaimed desert,

1520
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:45,100
where the daughter is in irrigation, agricultural engineering.

1521
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:47,700
So does the city not count as one of the futures?

1522
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:49,740
Because I was going to say we should like pick a I mean,

1523
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:53,100
I think we still could in general, but like at the end we should discuss

1524
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:57,140
what's our ideal future. I don't know if the city counts,

1525
01:23:57,340 --> 01:24:00,860
but that's where I want to be. I love that city very much.

1526
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:02,260
Well, it's always exciting.

1527
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:03,780
It's always exciting.

1528
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:09,220
It's always if I pull up this and for good listener, forgive me.

1529
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:11,220
But we'll describe it.

1530
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:16,860
Triangular buildings with weird like

1531
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:20,260
Orby things coming out of them,

1532
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:27,340
like the fountains out front, perpetual dusk, like this beautiful pink dusk.

1533
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:30,660
I want to be here so very much.

1534
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:36,860
It's like there's buildings that look like the Studio 54 logo, essentially.

1535
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:42,540
I mean, I think this picture I literally did send to somebody involved in Moonbeam

1536
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:47,580
City, I think we're chasing this vibe or it's always pink dusk

1537
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:49,500
or this this orange one, too.

1538
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:52,900
Like I have nothing

1539
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:54,260
productive to say.

1540
01:24:54,460 --> 01:25:00,500
I just love these places so much and I want to be in that apartment.

1541
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:06,940
I want to I want to be where that Carousel of Progress guy is wearing his jumpsuit.

1542
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,540
I want to be playing his orb keyboard,

1543
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:13,420
his weird light up nonsensical instrument.

1544
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:16,300
I love this world so much.

1545
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:19,340
Yeah, I feel like it's an aesthetic that

1546
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:22,340
I kind of never goes out of style.

1547
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:27,740
And one thing I saw mentioned in the genesis of Horizons is that people's

1548
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:33,100
visions of the future had kind of matured a little in popular culture.

1549
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:38,420
You know, you had Blade Runner, you had Alien, you know, and very grim and grimy.

1550
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:44,140
And this kind of marries the two of like a mature version of the future.

1551
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:46,580
But it is hopeful. It is optimistic.

1552
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:47,780
You know, yeah.

1553
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:50,140
And realistic and realistic.

1554
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:52,460
Yeah, it still seems realistic.

1555
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:53,820
Mm hmm.

1556
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:57,060
Yeah, it's not so well, it's all like based in current technology.

1557
01:25:57,260 --> 01:26:02,300
It's all like several steps beyond technology that we have, like the

1558
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:06,620
irrigation machines, I guess that's a lot of steps beyond.

1559
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:10,820
But I guess this is that's kind of one of the most striking parts of the ride is

1560
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:17,500
fields that's being plowed by these giant machines that

1561
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:24,900
feel like they like if reprogrammed in a wrong Skynetty way could do a lot of damage.

1562
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:27,940
These feel like War of the Worlds a little bit, but they're friendly.

1563
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:30,300
They harvest oranges for us.

1564
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:31,180
Yeah, fine.

1565
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:36,100
I mean, they're not as cute as the dishwashing robot, but yeah, they're friendly, I think.

1566
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:37,660
I was just reading an article.

1567
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:40,660
There was one there was a climate scientist that was very alarmist saying

1568
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:44,780
that we're already past the point of of no return as far as climate change.

1569
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:47,340
Although I've seen now other people say that's not completely true.

1570
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:48,260
We can always turn it on.

1571
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:52,940
But he was saying that there needs to be like massive

1572
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:56,020
machines built to pull carbon out of the air.

1573
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:57,580
Right. Yeah.

1574
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:59,500
We'll figure it out, right?

1575
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:00,860
We're going to get them.

1576
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:05,860
Which I mean, humanity in general is like, you know,

1577
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:10,700
how I was in college, like I put everything off to the last minute.

1578
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:12,100
Like a lot of people are.

1579
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:15,540
As we saw with the virus and we saw how well that went.

1580
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:17,380
Yeah.

1581
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:20,580
So maybe we'll build these giant machines

1582
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:25,340
to pull carbon out of the atmosphere, like a couple of weeks before the planet dies.

1583
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:28,580
And just like college Mike Carlson,

1584
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:32,500
we knew about the problems for a very long time because, like,

1585
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:38,940
reclaiming the desert for like lush green space, crops, desalinate,

1586
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:45,980
desalinization of saltwater to make it consumable or usable in crops.

1587
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:51,100
People have been thinking about that for hundreds, if not thousands of years at this point.

1588
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:52,100
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1589
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:55,700
And we got a week at a.

1590
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:57,860
Yeah, you know,

1591
01:27:58,060 --> 01:27:59,020
there's this guy.

1592
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:02,060
So Mark Zuckerberg broke the world.

1593
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:08,300
And then, you know, we'll get to the desalinization, you know.

1594
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:10,660
But yeah, I mean, there's no.

1595
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:14,660
Yeah, all the futurism is rooted in like reality of the time.

1596
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:18,700
And so we're saying now is still stuff that needs to be done or still

1597
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:23,940
possible things that could help turn some problems around.

1598
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:26,940
I'm trying to think, is there anything in here

1599
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:30,500
like they didn't forecast everything, they didn't forecast like celebrities

1600
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:35,220
going to Swedish clinics to get teenage blood to stay alive longer?

1601
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:37,940
Like, I assume Quincy Jones is doing.

1602
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:43,140
They forecast it like Pluots, like the lemon orange, like

1603
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:45,860
creations in this ride, you know.

1604
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:46,820
Wait, yeah.

1605
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:47,860
No, hang on.

1606
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:50,100
This is something I never caught.

1607
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:53,220
And I copy pasted this big stretch.

1608
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:56,580
By the way, this world that we're talking about is Mesa Verde.

1609
01:28:56,780 --> 01:29:00,020
That's the that's the land world

1610
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:06,020
which, of course, oddly is a is a recurring location in Better Call Saul.

1611
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:08,700
So Horizons used it first.

1612
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:11,660
Disney gets you in.

1613
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:13,980
But yeah, Mesa Verde world.

1614
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:17,580
And it's yeah, we're dealing with with irrigation.

1615
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:21,100
One of the characters in it we follow is like a farming person.

1616
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:24,740
And there's a shelf that you see that's a bunch of fruits.

1617
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:29,900
And I never put it together that they are weird, hybrid fruits of fruits that we have

1618
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:31,180
in them. Let me see.

1619
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:34,620
There's this ivy that you look at, but it's not a regular ivy.

1620
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:37,460
It's called Circuit Egg Ivy.

1621
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:39,500
I don't understand that one.

1622
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:41,660
Pepcumbers.

1623
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:43,700
I guess that one's pretty clear.

1624
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:47,300
And I like saying the word flavor grapes.

1625
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,780
Well, now that's just

1626
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:53,220
so you're going to show me regular grapes, but tell me that this one tastes

1627
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:55,300
like a lemon and this one's a kumquat.

1628
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,300
I mean, that's a that's lazy naming.

1629
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,020
I think the idea is sound.

1630
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:00,300
Yeah, yes.

1631
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:03,700
But the texture and experience of eating a grape is good.

1632
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,420
And I would be interested to try different flavors.

1633
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:11,140
If a great surprise to you with its flavor, yes, that would be cool.

1634
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:12,740
This one's black licorice.

1635
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:14,620
You

1636
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:16,300
so jelly bellies.

1637
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:17,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1638
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:20,180
You popcorn.

1639
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:24,020
Popcorn grape poop.

1640
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:26,180
And then pin.

1641
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:28,020
OK, how do you say this?

1642
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:30,220
Pine, I guess it'd be pine anas.

1643
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:31,540
Pine anas. Yeah, yeah.

1644
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:33,700
Or pineapple. That's got to be delicious.

1645
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:35,100
That kicks ass. Yeah, I would.

1646
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:36,380
I mean, that'd be a drink.

1647
01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:38,900
For sure. Yeah, yeah.

1648
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,020
And loranjes, limes and orange.

1649
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:44,860
Also Michael's his own oranges.

1650
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:47,820
I want I need the assistant, the loranjeets

1651
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:54,580
need to give me a basket of loranjes or I can't start the meeting.

1652
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:58,700
If you go into Lauren's office, do not eat the orange.

1653
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:02,500
It is just the bowls of loranjes are just a test.

1654
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:05,380
You're not going to get update if you eat the orange.

1655
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:06,980
Yeah.

1656
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:11,780
Guys, I'm realizing because I know a Mesa is like a geographical, you know,

1657
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:17,420
like a plateau, but it only occurred to me just now that the name Mesa Verde is a

1658
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:24,500
wordplay because Mesa, I believe the translator is telling me it is also

1659
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:26,300
the Spanish word for table.

1660
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:29,980
So technically Mesa Verde means green table.

1661
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:33,460
Huh? Oh, greenery harvest.

1662
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:36,220
Yeah. Right. How about that?

1663
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:39,980
So that so that they named it is a national park.

1664
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:41,340
So they named that.

1665
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:43,700
That's what's a cute name.

1666
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:46,660
Yeah, that's a cute name.

1667
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:48,900
Or it could just be named after the national park.

1668
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:51,380
And I'm going too far.

1669
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:53,620
Maybe. I don't know.

1670
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:56,260
I didn't realize until

1671
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:59,740
Blankchek and Griffin Newman did great

1672
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:01,220
episodes there.

1673
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:03,460
There's a Mecha's run and they're back to the future.

1674
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:04,380
Episodes have been great.

1675
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:05,780
And I didn't realize till he pointed out

1676
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:10,220
that Hill Valley is like a conundrum impossible in all these years.

1677
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:11,380
I never put that together.

1678
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:14,100
Hill Valley makes no sense.

1679
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:15,220
Yeah, that's funny.

1680
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:18,540
I had a joke that's been there the whole time.

1681
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:21,540
And it's just a it's a little Easter egg.

1682
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:22,420
You get it later.

1683
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:25,340
And then we all just went like, hmm,

1684
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,780
that's the degree of

1685
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:30,860
I like it when I like Christopher Lloyd yells.

1686
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:34,060
That's more what I was focusing on.

1687
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:38,420
OK, so I mean, this one's cool.

1688
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:40,100
Bravas and Tari.

1689
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:41,380
No, you end with that.

1690
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:45,660
I guess the next one is what's the sea called?

1691
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:49,380
Sea Castle, Sea Castle.

1692
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:49,940
Yes.

1693
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:55,660
So a great transition here where the granddaughter teenage granddaughter is

1694
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:59,620
talking to a video conference call

1695
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:05,660
of her boyfriend, who they call a beach bum.

1696
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:10,740
She's like, he works, he works on a floating city.

1697
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:13,580
And then it cuts to the other angle

1698
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:16,780
where there's an animatronic boyfriend and the video girlfriend.

1699
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:21,620
I believe the boyfriend in the video is a young Tom Fitzgerald,

1700
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:24,380
one of the lead imagineers on this ride.

1701
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:27,380
Yeah, I guess so.

1702
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:29,660
I you know,

1703
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:34,660
yeah, I threw it out to a friend of the show Bugman Buzz Buzz,

1704
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:39,460
because I know he shares the my fondness for like Epcot attractions being weird

1705
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:44,620
and scary and just like being up at night and exploring these claustrophobic

1706
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:48,300
spaces. And I'm like, I'm just like, what is his main thing with Horizons?

1707
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,220
Because I know he's going to have one.

1708
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:50,940
And he said

1709
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:56,460
the that there would be that you see characters as on a video screen as real

1710
01:33:56,660 --> 01:34:02,420
human beings and then as robots is so clever and so like also like off putting

1711
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:07,220
and upsetting a little bit and like when you take each individual side of it,

1712
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:11,260
that you're watching a robot whose boyfriend is a real man.

1713
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:14,500
And then you switch it and it's the other way.

1714
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:17,620
And he was like, yeah, who are these actors?

1715
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:19,580
Like, does anyone track them down?

1716
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:23,660
So interesting finding out that one of them wrote the ride.

1717
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:28,180
And the other one, apparently, I had her IMDb.

1718
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:33,140
Her name is Corinne Cook, and she has some fun credits,

1719
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:37,620
including that she is in a movie called Malibu Hot Summer,

1720
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:41,860
which has also been released as Sizzle Beach USA.

1721
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:47,620
And this is one of the first, maybe the first film credit of Kevin Costner.

1722
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:49,460
Oh, yeah. Wow.

1723
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:53,020
So check out Malibu Hot Summer.

1724
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:55,660
Let me see if I can get a tagline on it real fast.

1725
01:34:55,860 --> 01:35:01,340
Three girlfriends who find careers and the hottest offer of their lives in.

1726
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:03,540
Wait, what? In Malibu Hot Summer.

1727
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:04,580
What's weird?

1728
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:07,140
I got confused by the grammar in that part way through.

1729
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:09,980
Fuck you, Malibu Hot Summer.

1730
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:13,140
I want to add to the unsettling.

1731
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:18,300
I'm sorry, the dialogue they actually call that what they call him is a beach boy.

1732
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:20,260
Not. Yeah, it's Beach Boy.

1733
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:21,900
Yeah, Beach Boy.

1734
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:28,340
And the dialogue is because she's defending the Beach Boy to her parents instead

1735
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:31,540
of flirting or is it them the parents bickering instead of flirting with that

1736
01:35:31,740 --> 01:35:35,100
Beach Boy, he is not a Beach Boy.

1737
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:38,500
As if that's so bad, as we've determined

1738
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:42,540
that these are now plans that I have to join the Beach Boys.

1739
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:47,660
And I would think that any parent in law would be very proud of me.

1740
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:50,020
Yeah, like this is another where they're

1741
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:54,540
like sort of just going in the going with the past because, you know, in 2080,

1742
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:58,580
obviously, the Beach Boys will still be touring in 2080.

1743
01:35:58,780 --> 01:36:02,780
And I'm going to be the most like tangible original member.

1744
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:08,380
Like, I'm propped up by robotics like he actually did meet

1745
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:10,860
Mike Love right before he died, so he counts.

1746
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:13,140
He's the one with the most legitimacy.

1747
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:18,740
You look like, of course, the emperor on Exegol being

1748
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:22,980
arm, a kooka arm behind you

1749
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:28,420
puppeted to sort of tap a keyboard and play

1750
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:34,460
Kokomo 2070, the update that we did.

1751
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:40,140
The concerts are now only vibrate are real vibrations.

1752
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:41,180
You can't hear it.

1753
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:44,180
It's just you're hearing them like on these low tones.

1754
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:46,900
Yeah, yeah. You have to you have to be a precog.

1755
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:50,500
You have to be in the precog tubes to experience the tubes.

1756
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:52,420
And you will be on the floating city,

1757
01:36:52,620 --> 01:36:55,500
but it is not the beautiful utopia of this floating city.

1758
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:57,860
It is called an atoll.

1759
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:03,620
Oh, yes, the plane by smokers, floating atolls.

1760
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:09,980
The Deacon and his posse of Beach Boys.

1761
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:16,220
Yeah, he's a marine biologist and they call him a beach boy.

1762
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:17,260
Beach boy.

1763
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:20,300
Odd disrespect to that profession.

1764
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:21,820
I do. I mean, that's obvious.

1765
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:25,140
I feel like that's a thing in the 50s and 60s where parents would be like,

1766
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:28,620
you're you're good for nothing surfer boyfriend, huh?

1767
01:37:28,820 --> 01:37:30,780
What a real loser he is.

1768
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:34,220
If he was respectable, he'd be dying in a factory right now.

1769
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:36,300
Yeah, he'd be in up in St.

1770
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:41,100
Clairs, the jungle, putting the meat pieces in the casing machine.

1771
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:45,380
But all these I mean, all these old parrot heads, they would love a beach boy.

1772
01:37:45,580 --> 01:37:46,820
Yeah, they'd be like, oh, great.

1773
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:49,060
You're one of us.

1774
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:50,140
I'd say so.

1775
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:52,500
Yeah. Well, and these guys have so much fun up there.

1776
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:59,100
They get to show kids some seals and float around in the ocean with some

1777
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:01,100
projected scenes. Right.

1778
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,820
Yeah. Yeah. They're having a lot of fun in this.

1779
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:04,060
So this one's like a competitor.

1780
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:09,260
It's tough to the three are all competing for best future.

1781
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:10,740
It's hard to determine.

1782
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:13,180
I don't know which button I'm going to press at the end.

1783
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:19,260
Yeah, I mean, I didn't watch a lot of Sequest DSV as a kid, but I certainly did

1784
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:23,700
put it on Peacock last two nights ago.

1785
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:24,580
How'd it go?

1786
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:26,820
I have like

1787
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:31,340
I have like affection for it exists for remembering that it existed when I was

1788
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:32,260
young. Yes.

1789
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:33,500
The vague idea of it.

1790
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:34,740
Yes. Yeah.

1791
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:36,260
So I don't know.

1792
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:40,580
I like the idea of all of this, but I don't know yet.

1793
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:43,820
I'm still well, do we do we bring the third one in?

1794
01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:48,700
Do we bring Bravo Centauri in as the option number three?

1795
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:54,380
A quick shout out for the number of animatronics in that two story sea castle

1796
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:55,580
scene. Yeah.

1797
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:59,420
And then you see the people enjoying their dinners

1798
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:03,300
in the little like porthole viewing stations.

1799
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:07,780
This is also where you get the grandmother saying a very Kurt.

1800
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:10,140
Well, so am I.

1801
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:13,100
Is just very dig it.

1802
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:15,020
Take a look at that dialogue exchange.

1803
01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:16,020
It's funny to me.

1804
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:17,220
Why are they so upset?

1805
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:20,500
They live in that awesome loft apartment in Triangle City.

1806
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:22,860
They look at dusk every day.

1807
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:25,660
I think it's dusk from morning to night.

1808
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:27,180
It's always dusk there.

1809
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:31,500
They said it's only a few minutes to go and see their kids, but they also had the

1810
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:34,260
option to video everyone's video chatting.

1811
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:39,980
That's a funny thing that where this ends up is like it's a birthday and people

1812
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:45,540
can't be there in person, so they all just project videos of themselves.

1813
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:49,300
And that's a future that we have realized.

1814
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,260
Why we had spent a whole year of virtual birthdays.

1815
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:55,100
Isn't it as fun as Horizons?

1816
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:56,540
Yeah.

1817
01:39:56,660 --> 01:39:58,660
Yeah, it is fun.

1818
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:01,540
Wow. Grandma got on the machine.

1819
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:07,100
Well, that's and she's synced up in her singing with mom who's off in Seattle.

1820
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:09,900
This rules just as good.

1821
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:11,780
Well, no problem.

1822
01:40:11,980 --> 01:40:15,820
My son-in-law and his family would choose to live nowhere else.

1823
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:18,300
Whatever they said.

1824
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:21,700
Boy, Horizons could have predicted Zoom

1825
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:24,860
backgrounds and all the fun that we've had with those.

1826
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:30,060
Definitely enough ideas for how to play with Zoom backgrounds to sustain

1827
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:33,860
two years worth of Zooming.

1828
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:38,620
I'm realizing now I should have.

1829
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:41,140
Yeah, I know here now I'm doing it.

1830
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:43,540
Let's get back to the let's get back to the fun.

1831
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:44,820
You know what I want to say about the future.

1832
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:46,300
It looks like the Cloud City.

1833
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:48,780
Yeah. And Star Wars.

1834
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:49,620
That's neat.

1835
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:50,980
Which is the place to be.

1836
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:54,220
Which is what and any of these hotels

1837
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:57,580
I think would be more fun than the Star Wars Hotel they're building.

1838
01:40:57,780 --> 01:40:59,700
Oh, yeah. Being a Cloud City Hotel.

1839
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:01,260
Yes, would be very cool.

1840
01:41:01,460 --> 01:41:06,780
Yeah. And that tiny little cell prison cell on the Star Wars Hotel.

1841
01:41:06,980 --> 01:41:08,620
We'll see. We'll go.

1842
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:10,420
We'll have to go try. I'm going to go.

1843
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:14,180
I'm going to pay $900 a night to go to this hotel.

1844
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:18,580
Pay a rent a month just under a month's rent payment.

1845
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:22,140
Yeah. Anyway. For who?

1846
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:24,660
Nine hundred dollars.

1847
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:26,900
Ooh, OK.

1848
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:28,700
Living in a closet.

1849
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:30,140
All right. Move again.

1850
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:36,300
So the word space from Bravo Centauri.

1851
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:38,300
Bravo Centauri.

1852
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:43,020
Now, just in general to talk about, like, you know, we're deciding here.

1853
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:48,260
Living in space, there was no fantasy I had more like that loomed in my mind than

1854
01:41:48,460 --> 01:41:50,900
living on the Enterprise as a kid.

1855
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:56,540
So while we're this is a little bit more like clinical.

1856
01:41:56,740 --> 01:41:57,780
Yeah, yeah.

1857
01:41:57,980 --> 01:42:01,180
It's not as fun as a space as Star Trek.

1858
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:06,340
But, man, watching this, I'm like, yeah, that's as a kid.

1859
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:08,500
That always felt like the coolest thing.

1860
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:11,380
I think I would definitely have picked space as a kid.

1861
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:13,140
Yeah.

1862
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:15,460
Well, you get to be upside down in this one.

1863
01:42:15,660 --> 01:42:17,900
You get upside down animatronics in this one.

1864
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:18,900
Yeah.

1865
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:25,820
The the the hanging OmniMover setup really adds to the like floating through

1866
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:29,620
underwater, floating through space,

1867
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:33,140
I think really heightens that in a nice way.

1868
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:39,140
Also, the going from ocean to like there's a little bit of blackness in under the

1869
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:42,060
ocean and then little stars show up and then you're in space.

1870
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:44,620
A lot of cool theatrical tricks.

1871
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:46,500
Yeah. Transitions.

1872
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:51,380
Yeah, it's it's like I'm trying to think and maybe this is unfair to like Little

1873
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:56,060
Mermaid, but it just like it feels like it's doing so much of a better job

1874
01:42:56,260 --> 01:43:00,620
simulating you going and changing like terrain.

1875
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:03,340
Yeah, like Little Mermaid, you go under water.

1876
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:05,300
And like obviously we've talked about that.

1877
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:07,980
Like the original idea was like it would feel more like you're floating.

1878
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:12,140
But Little Mermaid always to me feels like you're just on the Haunted Mansion

1879
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:14,540
like OmniMover track for the most part.

1880
01:43:14,780 --> 01:43:16,580
But this together, this they went all out,

1881
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:21,020
really trying to immerse you and make you feel like you were switching

1882
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:25,620
scenery and switching terrain, switching gravity.

1883
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:27,420
I have a question.

1884
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:31,540
Maybe you guys can confirm for me about one of the tricks in the birthday party

1885
01:43:31,740 --> 01:43:38,100
scene in space, the video screens, are they animatronics kind of like poking out

1886
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:39,820
of the video screens? Is that right?

1887
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:43,420
Was I imagining that or is that a pepper's ghost?

1888
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:44,700
Is that a pepper's ghost?

1889
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:46,300
Yeah, that's a good question.

1890
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:48,620
Because they are coming out of it, essentially.

1891
01:43:48,820 --> 01:43:50,820
It's hard to tell from a video.

1892
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:51,980
Yeah, yeah.

1893
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:56,340
It's just kind of a funny choice of like, oh, did this get built first?

1894
01:43:56,540 --> 01:44:04,020
And then they had to resort to filmed footage for the other ones for like saving money.

1895
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:05,660
I don't know. I do like it.

1896
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:09,180
It looks like it looks like it looks like pepper's ghost to me.

1897
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:12,940
Yeah, that's my guess, because like on the video

1898
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:16,740
and I'm just scrolling here to try to on this video, I'm looking at it does look

1899
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:20,900
like pepper's ghost, but I don't know that to be a fact.

1900
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:23,020
Hmm, not sure.

1901
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:24,900
I don't have a lot about the space stuff.

1902
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:26,260
It's cool up there.

1903
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:27,820
I like seeing people upside down.

1904
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:32,420
I like seeing, you know, little jumps suited kids.

1905
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:35,420
I guess I wanted to be a jumps suited kid.

1906
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:38,820
I want to be like a bill mummy.

1907
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:39,540
I don't know.

1908
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:41,980
Kids in space always have a good time.

1909
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:43,420
Yeah, kids in space.

1910
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:48,060
I definitely knew aliens very bad time.

1911
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:49,420
Ender's game.

1912
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:50,340
Mm hmm.

1913
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:51,500
Yeah.

1914
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:52,060
All right.

1915
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:55,100
Kids don't always have a good often kids have a horrible time in space.

1916
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:57,460
But are you talking from Alien three?

1917
01:44:57,660 --> 01:45:01,060
Newt, what happens with what's up with Newt by then?

1918
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:01,740
No, too.

1919
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:02,500
He gets.

1920
01:45:02,700 --> 01:45:06,660
Well, no, it knew it is an alien aliens, which is alien, the second aliens.

1921
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:11,580
And then in between aliens two and three, he just gets killed off screen.

1922
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:12,860
Oh, oh, no.

1923
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:15,780
Oh, aliens, aliens, the third aliens.

1924
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:16,940
It's just like he's dead.

1925
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:18,700
But Newt's a girl.

1926
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:21,820
Oh, yeah, you're right. Sorry.

1927
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:23,780
Newt dies, Newt dies in between.

1928
01:45:23,980 --> 01:45:25,380
I'm forgetting.

1929
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:27,700
OK, movies.

1930
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:28,740
That happens for sure.

1931
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:29,860
Newt dies. OK, OK.

1932
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:32,300
No, I for some reason, I'm in Alien three.

1933
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:33,780
So I don't know.

1934
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:36,300
Depressing. Well,

1935
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:40,180
now I guess we're all right if we're picking if we're picking a button,

1936
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:44,260
if we're picking a return path or if you had to live in one of these futures,

1937
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:45,940
I guess I guess that's really the question.

1938
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:48,260
Do you like because now we get these three

1939
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:53,940
awesome model sequences that are like Star Tours before Star Tours,

1940
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:59,860
like the biggest model sets ever built, the shoots that took two years.

1941
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:02,380
These things are so awesome.

1942
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:05,860
These little like minute long simulator sequences.

1943
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:08,820
But what do we choose if you had to take

1944
01:46:08,860 --> 01:46:12,620
one of those paths and then live the rest of your life and Mesa Verde or

1945
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:17,260
Brava Centauri or Sea Castle, what do we pick?

1946
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:21,060
I think I always picked Brava Centauri or Sea Castle.

1947
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:26,060
Brava Centauri used in all of the marketing material,

1948
01:46:26,260 --> 01:46:31,820
the the in-room, I watched an in-room loop from 1992,

1949
01:46:32,020 --> 01:46:36,860
that little short snippet of space flight, I feel like was they just got marketing

1950
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:38,900
material for years out of that footage?

1951
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:42,700
Oh, yeah, like disconnecting from the docket and kind of and start to fly through.

1952
01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:45,780
Yeah, yeah. And I was like, I have that footage lodged in my brain and I could

1953
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:49,820
never remember what it was from. And I sometimes I forget it was it was

1954
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:53,900
Horizons. Yeah, this.

1955
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:57,660
OK, so wait in the if I'm choosing, is it I'm going to live here for the rest

1956
01:46:57,860 --> 01:46:59,860
of my life? Hmm.

1957
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:01,500
Is that what the exercise is?

1958
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:02,980
Well, I don't know.

1959
01:47:03,180 --> 01:47:05,740
Maybe we're just maybe we're just picking a button on the ride.

1960
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:07,100
If that makes it easier.

1961
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:09,660
Oh, OK. Yes, that makes it a lot easier.

1962
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:11,260
What do you want to kill you?

1963
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:15,380
The pressures of underwater, the pressures of the vacuum of space or the

1964
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:19,900
unrelenting heat of the desert, the pressures of big city life?

1965
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:21,820
Oh,

1966
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:24,580
I think I'm going space

1967
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:28,820
because, yes, all that Brava Centauri stuff.

1968
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:32,340
And even though it's not quite the enterprise, still you get to float around.

1969
01:47:32,540 --> 01:47:34,260
You got the jumpsuit on

1970
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:39,300
and there's still like just that that fantasy as a child, I think, is still too

1971
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:42,420
strong. You know, yeah, I think I got it.

1972
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:46,780
I got to go as cool as the city is right on.

1973
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:48,820
I think I'm going Mesa Verde.

1974
01:47:48,820 --> 01:47:52,060
It's not that Mesa Verde is that cool in and of itself.

1975
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:54,140
And I don't know if I want to work in irrigation.

1976
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:57,900
I don't know if I want to program those giant machines, but I would like to smell

1977
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:03,660
oranges. And I think that model sequence, that flight path is extremely cool.

1978
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:05,340
I like that you land on a little like

1979
01:48:05,540 --> 01:48:10,980
helipad outside of like a future New Mexico build it like this.

1980
01:48:11,180 --> 01:48:16,260
The vibe of like future Southwest, I think, is so awesome.

1981
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:18,620
So maybe I'm going with that one.

1982
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:21,460
Maybe maybe C is too claustrophobic for me.

1983
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:23,180
Like that path is cool.

1984
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:29,500
And they the little model footage that they shot, they made it look underwater by

1985
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:31,220
using like fog effects.

1986
01:48:31,220 --> 01:48:33,100
They didn't actually shoot in a tank or anything.

1987
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:35,860
They simulated it with fog and smoke.

1988
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:39,180
So that sequence is cool, but it's also it's also murky.

1989
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:43,540
Like if anything leaks, I think down in Sea Castle, you're in a lot of trouble.

1990
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:46,940
So if I go to Mesa Verde, then I can go

1991
01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:50,060
hang out in pink Triangle City whenever I want.

1992
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:52,220
And I think I'm set.

1993
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:57,380
Well, Mesa Verde, that's the that's the that's a long term choice.

1994
01:48:57,580 --> 01:48:59,020
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

1995
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:00,020
And I get that.

1996
01:49:00,220 --> 01:49:01,620
It gives you more flexibility.

1997
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:03,420
You know, being close to your parents,

1998
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:06,860
I'm still pretty close to my parents where I am now.

1999
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:09,500
I didn't make the leap to Los Angeles,

2000
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:14,620
which is equivalent to you guys making the leap to the sea or space as you did by

2001
01:49:14,820 --> 01:49:19,140
moving here. Yeah, I think I would choose out complete the triangle.

2002
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:22,140
I will choose Sea Castle because different things.

2003
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:23,820
Well, we all make different things.

2004
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:27,820
I don't know. I just feel I like being by bodies of water.

2005
01:49:27,820 --> 01:49:30,340
I like staring at a lake or staring at the ocean.

2006
01:49:30,580 --> 01:49:37,660
If I can't sleep, I automatically put on like running water, mountain stream waves.

2007
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:41,380
I think it's just one way I reset my brain.

2008
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:43,140
Certainly it's one of the ways I have

2009
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:46,940
managed to sleep during our current future.

2010
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:49,300
Well, you are a beach boy.

2011
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:51,860
I am a beach boy. Yeah, I love the beach.

2012
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:53,540
You don't. Yeah, you don't deny it.

2013
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:57,660
You don't think you don't find that to be an insult, as the grandparents intended.

2014
01:49:57,820 --> 01:50:00,780
I can barely hang a framed photograph.

2015
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:04,220
I am not an engineer of any

2016
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:09,420
irrigation or marine biology or or space.

2017
01:50:09,620 --> 01:50:11,220
I am solely a beach boy.

2018
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:12,820
Have you ever hung a picture?

2019
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:14,100
I've hung a picture.

2020
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:17,380
I just when you start to get into you got to find a stud.

2021
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:18,700
Oh, is the drywall strong?

2022
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:21,700
And I just hate all that shit.

2023
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:24,140
Depends what you're hanging. Yeah.

2024
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:26,140
Well, yeah.

2025
01:50:26,180 --> 01:50:30,100
No, we'd all be screwed in terms of working in any of these places.

2026
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:30,900
Yeah, I don't know.

2027
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:33,660
I don't know if they accounted for podcasting

2028
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:37,620
as your employment in these worlds, but it may be interesting.

2029
01:50:37,820 --> 01:50:41,740
Now via Zoom, we know that we can do this distantly.

2030
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:44,380
So maybe there is a future in which we're

2031
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:50,340
recording this podcast separately from space, the desert and under the sea.

2032
01:50:50,540 --> 01:50:51,260
Yes.

2033
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:55,420
But popping out of our frames in a hologram fashion

2034
01:50:55,580 --> 01:50:57,940
and wishing each other happy birthday.

2035
01:50:58,140 --> 01:50:59,340
Yes.

2036
01:50:59,540 --> 01:51:03,660
The ride does not the experience does not end there.

2037
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:09,300
So as you get out of the ride, there were a couple different versions of the exit.

2038
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:10,940
One

2039
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:15,460
was a beautiful hand painted mural called

2040
01:51:15,660 --> 01:51:19,260
the prologue and the promise by Robert McCall.

2041
01:51:19,460 --> 01:51:20,420
And I'll bring it up.

2042
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:25,100
I have it right here with Robert McCall in the photo.

2043
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:26,660
You can see him right there.

2044
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:28,580
Real. That's the scale of it.

2045
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:30,780
He's as big as the people in the.

2046
01:51:30,980 --> 01:51:31,780
Oh, my God.

2047
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:34,180
That really shows you how huge this thing is.

2048
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:35,020
Yes.

2049
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:38,980
And so this only lasted a few years before

2050
01:51:39,180 --> 01:51:42,380
they subbed it in for like a glowing GE logo.

2051
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:49,340
And I asked around in preparation for this episode because I saw one blog that said

2052
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:52,980
they preserved this canvas, they preserved the mural.

2053
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:57,380
And I asked some of our peers, do you know where it is?

2054
01:51:57,580 --> 01:52:00,620
And the answer was, I think it's been lost.

2055
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:05,420
I don't think I don't think at least anyone at the moment knows.

2056
01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:10,980
So if you know where the prologue and the promise and the rock, the McCall estate,

2057
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:15,700
you know, recall was a big like space age painter

2058
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:20,580
and they have it on their website and I'm sure you can get a nice print of it.

2059
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:26,820
And it's a very beautiful painting, but only lasted a little while.

2060
01:52:27,020 --> 01:52:30,980
It's a mural about the promise of the future and they lost it.

2061
01:52:31,180 --> 01:52:33,820
It's gone. It's destroyed.

2062
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:40,940
Well, I think it's just things happen in like 30, 40 years.

2063
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:44,660
Like you take it somewhere, you put it in a warehouse and God knows where it ends

2064
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:47,420
up and then the building it was in is destroyed.

2065
01:52:47,620 --> 01:52:51,500
But I did not realize I only stuck around for a little while.

2066
01:52:51,700 --> 01:52:52,940
Hmm.

2067
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:59,780
Well, they scattered Horizons things all across different parks internationally.

2068
01:52:59,980 --> 01:53:05,140
Those are little ways you could experience Horizons elsewhere in the Disney park

2069
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:12,460
verse, one of them being these the three amazing model sequences of flying

2070
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:19,060
to your future destination are all used at or were used at the end of star tours

2071
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:20,780
in Tokyo Disneyland.

2072
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:24,140
I think I mentioned this a little in our episode about the Pangalactic Pizza port,

2073
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:27,220
but basically it was like a post flight thing.

2074
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:28,140
You would end star tours.

2075
01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:32,940
Then you go up to this bank of monitors and see all of the offerings of these

2076
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:37,100
different settings and a big screen called TourScan.

2077
01:53:37,260 --> 01:53:40,820
And there's a little robot telling you about all of them, about desert and space

2078
01:53:40,860 --> 01:53:45,300
and sea. And that robot was the robot named Dan Android,

2079
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:49,540
which delights me as much now as it did a year ago when we talked about that.

2080
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:53,140
So check out the Pangalactic Pizza port on the second gate.

2081
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:57,860
A bunch of other things like robot parts and various Horizons odds and ends were

2082
01:53:58,060 --> 01:54:04,180
all dumped on the France back lot tour where they pretended these were props for

2083
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:08,500
movies or something instead of a ride that almost fell into a sinkhole.

2084
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:13,140
The France back lot tour, we clearly have to hit it because Disney just put out

2085
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:15,500
this video saying here's what's coming up in the future.

2086
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:17,100
And one of them,

2087
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:22,540
I forget, I don't know which of you tweeted this, but that that the concept art of

2088
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:28,300
here's Catastrophe Canyon and here's a big cars truck smiling at a fire.

2089
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:31,100
It is the creepiest imagery.

2090
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:35,180
Somebody on Twitter said it reminded them of the everything is fine dog.

2091
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:36,620
Yeah.

2092
01:54:37,540 --> 01:54:39,580
Finally, the cars can feel pain.

2093
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:42,220
The cars can scream.

2094
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:44,740
I was Jason Tweedy.

2095
01:54:44,940 --> 01:54:46,820
I figure it's human and Jason's voice.

2096
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:49,780
I like that. But yeah, that Fred's back to her.

2097
01:54:49,980 --> 01:54:52,060
What a bizarre mess.

2098
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:53,820
I so I don't know.

2099
01:54:54,020 --> 01:54:58,300
They like strewed a bunch of horizon shit all over there.

2100
01:54:58,500 --> 01:54:59,900
I forget what.

2101
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:03,020
But I don't know. I think they did this ride dirty.

2102
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:08,020
I think it was replaced by a thing that is that a lot of people don't like.

2103
01:55:08,220 --> 01:55:10,820
I remember I think I might have been in

2104
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:14,180
Disney World at a point where they were mid destroying it.

2105
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:15,260
I'm not totally sure.

2106
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:17,140
Just seeing it with a fence around it was bad.

2107
01:55:17,140 --> 01:55:18,620
Or maybe I'm just conflating that with that.

2108
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:22,460
I've seen photos of that a wrecking ball went through half of this beautiful

2109
01:55:22,660 --> 01:55:24,140
building. It's such a bummer.

2110
01:55:24,340 --> 01:55:28,980
I don't know. Such as just a not graceful end to a really cool, ambitious attraction.

2111
01:55:29,180 --> 01:55:31,180
Yeah, it is brutal.

2112
01:55:31,180 --> 01:55:38,060
The operating schedule of like fall 93, the GE sponsorship ends late 94.

2113
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:39,980
Horizons closes.

2114
01:55:40,180 --> 01:55:43,980
It reopens December 95 because

2115
01:55:44,180 --> 01:55:49,180
Universal Energy was being re redone and World of Motion was being redone.

2116
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:54,700
And July 9, January 9, 1999 was the last day of operation.

2117
01:55:54,900 --> 01:56:00,140
There were some tests that supposedly in fall 99, there were some press groups who

2118
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:04,980
got to go through it, but it just never reopened again.

2119
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:09,460
And that's very sad because the the people who worked on this, just a murderers

2120
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:14,420
row of the imagineers were Marty Sklar, George McGinnis, Claude Coates,

2121
01:56:14,620 --> 01:56:18,460
John Hench, Rolly Crump early on, like Tom Fitzgerald.

2122
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:24,980
We said, like, so many people that just come up in the history of the Disney parks

2123
01:56:25,180 --> 01:56:30,100
and theme park design in general were like had a hand in this music by the guy.

2124
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:36,940
Who co-wrote the music for Sunny Eclipse with Cal David, the voice of Sunny Eclipse.

2125
01:56:37,140 --> 01:56:39,540
What do we think of the theme song?

2126
01:56:39,740 --> 01:56:42,260
Oh, yeah, I think it's a nice one.

2127
01:56:42,260 --> 01:56:46,740
I think I mean, I'd love just they need to put out a vinyl or wait, there's an Epcot

2128
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:48,940
vinyl, isn't there? Maybe there is and I don't have it.

2129
01:56:49,140 --> 01:56:54,900
If there's I should get if it exists, whatever has all these songs, because as

2130
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:58,580
we discussed, I do like living with the land, the song.

2131
01:56:58,740 --> 01:57:00,740
Let's not have confusion about that.

2132
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:03,140
That I listen to the land is the song.

2133
01:57:03,340 --> 01:57:04,340
Oh, OK.

2134
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:06,900
It's a jeez.

2135
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:08,140
Minor differences.

2136
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:09,740
Listen to the land.

2137
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:11,940
Yeah, there's an official Epcot album.

2138
01:57:12,140 --> 01:57:15,620
I don't know if it was put out before or after Horizons.

2139
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:17,340
But yeah, when you say the official song,

2140
01:57:17,540 --> 01:57:21,900
do you mean the like easy listening kind of like track?

2141
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:25,260
Yeah, I mean, I can play a snippet real quick.

2142
01:57:25,300 --> 01:57:30,940
I also have if we're going to I also have the unreleased demos.

2143
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:32,660
What? Really?

2144
01:57:32,860 --> 01:57:34,940
Yes. Why?

2145
01:57:35,140 --> 01:57:36,140
Because they're on YouTube.

2146
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:38,380
Weird. Wow.

2147
01:57:38,580 --> 01:57:40,700
Uh, let's just get a little taste here.

2148
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:42,460
So this is the main one.

2149
01:57:55,260 --> 01:58:02,860
I think I'd like it if it had no children on it.

2150
01:58:04,220 --> 01:58:10,100
Children's choirs I'm not a big fan of, but the instrumentally, I think it's wonderful.

2151
01:58:10,300 --> 01:58:11,940
It's like the Carpenters or something.

2152
01:58:12,140 --> 01:58:13,740
It's lovely.

2153
01:58:13,940 --> 01:58:18,180
And there are five different demos I found on YouTube here, and I'll just play one of them.

2154
01:58:18,180 --> 01:58:20,460
I'm not going to you can go and find it yourself.

2155
01:58:20,660 --> 01:58:22,620
But they were doing some different styles.

2156
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:24,900
Tomorrow,

2157
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:31,100
like the heartwarming side of the friend,

2158
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:37,580
where we work, where we play dreams come true every day.

2159
01:58:37,780 --> 01:58:44,060
As we reach for new horizons,

2160
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:49,340
we have learned to get more out of living.

2161
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:50,060
I like this.

2162
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:53,660
This sounds like the song they would play when the world ends, like when the last

2163
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:57,500
night is snuffed out, is an epilogue for humanity.

2164
01:58:57,700 --> 01:59:00,060
This is this song plays during the end of something.

2165
01:59:00,260 --> 01:59:08,220
This time there is space as we reach for new horizons.

2166
01:59:08,420 --> 01:59:11,900
This is what music will all sound like in the future.

2167
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:14,300
In the year 2080.

2168
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:16,260
This, though, you know, back to albums,

2169
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:19,140
you know, Prince has been releasing, the Prince of State has been releasing these

2170
01:59:19,140 --> 01:59:22,300
albums full of like five discs of demos.

2171
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:24,260
How about we start doing that with these

2172
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:27,700
rides because you know, multiple versions of songs exist.

2173
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:30,900
Obviously, they had to work on things and they tried things.

2174
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:32,740
Absolutely. Yes.

2175
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:34,740
Let's get this for all the rides.

2176
01:59:34,940 --> 01:59:37,740
Let's get an official releases remastered.

2177
01:59:37,940 --> 01:59:42,820
Yeah, every instrumental track, every false attempt.

2178
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:46,380
And let's make that weird orb keyboard exist because I'd buy that.

2179
01:59:46,540 --> 01:59:47,340
That's what I would.

2180
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:52,420
I'd spend $20,000 to buy that if it worked.

2181
01:59:52,620 --> 01:59:54,260
Yeah, I agree.

2182
01:59:54,460 --> 02:00:00,100
The theme song brought up a big thing we have missed talking about.

2183
02:00:00,300 --> 02:00:03,060
If we can dream it, we can do it.

2184
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:07,460
The much misattributed quote,

2185
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:14,780
which D23 had an article, the D23 website or no, was it IO9?

2186
02:00:14,980 --> 02:00:15,900
I forget now.

2187
02:00:16,100 --> 02:00:21,620
This has been confirmed over the years as all these guys start to age and like no

2188
02:00:21,820 --> 02:00:26,380
one is telling the like really good dirt stories yet, but everyone is calling their

2189
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:30,540
shots of like that was me and Tom Fitzgerald says, I'm familiar with that

2190
02:00:30,740 --> 02:00:33,180
phrase, I wrote it.

2191
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:36,700
Now, why is this an object of fuck you?

2192
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:43,060
I thought of dream and do it because it is often credited to Walt Disney.

2193
02:00:43,260 --> 02:00:44,500
Right.

2194
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:48,780
And for years, I thought Marty Sklar wrote it.

2195
02:00:48,980 --> 02:00:51,500
But, yeah, I think Fitzgerald,

2196
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:58,420
one of the former Gawker Gizmodo sites had a here are fake Walt Disney quotes.

2197
02:00:58,620 --> 02:01:01,340
And here is the actual context for these quotes.

2198
02:01:01,540 --> 02:01:03,500
And that was one of them.

2199
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:08,060
You when you say fake, you mean ones that people think are him, not the game I

2200
02:01:08,260 --> 02:01:12,180
played a couple of years ago with everyone, and I made up generic quotes.

2201
02:01:12,380 --> 02:01:13,900
Yes, ones.

2202
02:01:14,060 --> 02:01:18,460
But they are similar of like with the power of imagination.

2203
02:01:18,660 --> 02:01:20,340
Even a poor man can be rich.

2204
02:01:20,540 --> 02:01:23,020
You know, like it's like Walt did not say this.

2205
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:23,900
Fuck you.

2206
02:01:24,100 --> 02:01:30,780
I thought of the world has room for all of the magic we could ever imagine.

2207
02:01:30,980 --> 02:01:33,900
Give me some fucking respect.

2208
02:01:34,580 --> 02:01:35,580
Very important phrase.

2209
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:36,300
Yeah.

2210
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:38,420
So that is that is a thing.

2211
02:01:38,420 --> 02:01:47,380
Also, I did not see the video for this, but it appears like much of early Epcot.

2212
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:50,020
There was a grand

2213
02:01:50,220 --> 02:01:53,900
opening ceremony with a lot of people in white jumpsuits.

2214
02:01:54,100 --> 02:01:55,620
And you love to see it.

2215
02:01:55,820 --> 02:01:56,900
Yeah. Yeah.

2216
02:01:57,100 --> 02:02:04,900
Holding big future tennis rackets with an Epcot logo as the net.

2217
02:02:05,100 --> 02:02:08,220
This looks like a hell of a party.

2218
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:09,340
Wonderful.

2219
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:13,420
I think I thought of a good way to go out with these with these quotes and just

2220
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:19,660
thinking about like the futurism of Walt Disney or Tom Fitzgerald and the hope

2221
02:02:19,860 --> 02:02:26,340
and these visionaries who created and inspired this very hopeful ride.

2222
02:02:26,540 --> 02:02:32,940
And to to combine that with the visionaries that we actually ended up with,

2223
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:37,060
I'm right now going to share my screen.

2224
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:43,220
I'm going to go to Elon Musk's Twitter and let's just I think let's go round.

2225
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:47,700
Robin and all three of us say one of the last thing, if it's just a retweet,

2226
02:02:47,700 --> 02:02:48,460
it's not going to work.

2227
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:52,460
But let's just find the last coherent things that he's tweeted and say them

2228
02:02:52,660 --> 02:02:54,980
in the most Walt Disney fashion that we can.

2229
02:02:55,180 --> 02:03:00,100
And this will be a beacon to the future of now or the future of 2020, not to the

2230
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:02,180
horizon's future.

2231
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:02,980
Let's see.

2232
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:04,620
And I haven't screened these.

2233
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:06,220
So this this might not work.

2234
02:03:06,220 --> 02:03:08,180
I don't know.

2235
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:10,140
Oh, I think it's going to work great.

2236
02:03:10,340 --> 02:03:11,500
All right.

2237
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:16,540
You know, there's a saying that I often think I stop and think to myself.

2238
02:03:16,740 --> 02:03:23,940
And it's this Tesla holiday software release is fire to fire emojis.

2239
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:27,540
I guess I'll go next.

2240
02:03:28,380 --> 02:03:32,060
Well, there's something I always would say.

2241
02:03:32,260 --> 02:03:35,420
Cobra Kai is a deep cut.

2242
02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:38,340
And this next one's confusing.

2243
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:40,340
I wonder if there's a more clean.

2244
02:03:40,540 --> 02:03:42,020
Yeah, I want for you.

2245
02:03:42,220 --> 02:03:44,780
It's hard to vocalize the galaxy brain.

2246
02:03:44,980 --> 02:03:45,860
No, no, no. Yeah.

2247
02:03:45,860 --> 02:03:47,700
And now he's just been tweeting about the launch.

2248
02:03:47,700 --> 02:03:51,620
Oh, no. Here, I should just keep trying to find one because he was got a positive

2249
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:54,980
covid test. Oh, that's right.

2250
02:03:55,300 --> 02:03:57,940
Or two positive covid test, two negative.

2251
02:03:58,140 --> 02:04:01,940
Wait, wait, what did he tweet about the that's that's what we close on.

2252
02:04:02,140 --> 02:04:03,940
Yeah, he's been tweeting.

2253
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:05,900
He's been trying to like debunk Kovac.

2254
02:04:06,100 --> 02:04:08,060
He's he's on a mission for months to debunk.

2255
02:04:08,060 --> 02:04:09,860
OK, OK. Here's what I'm going to do here.

2256
02:04:10,060 --> 02:04:12,180
What, Jason, you should close it out.

2257
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:16,380
Will you just look up whatever he tweeted about having covid?

2258
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:19,300
And in the meantime, I will say our final

2259
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:23,180
things, you survived podcast, the Ride Horizons edition.

2266
02:04:49,580 --> 02:04:50,700
Did you find any that?

2267
02:04:50,900 --> 02:04:53,820
I don't know if you have a phone or computer handy.

2268
02:04:54,020 --> 02:04:56,980
I didn't mean to just command you there, Jason.

2269
02:04:57,180 --> 02:04:59,340
No, I got it. OK, great.

2270
02:04:59,540 --> 02:05:04,380
So so in the words of our great futurists of today,

2271
02:05:04,580 --> 02:05:08,140
let me set this up a little like they they would in the style of the ride.

2272
02:05:08,340 --> 02:05:10,740
Yeah, these futures might seem far out,

2273
02:05:10,940 --> 02:05:15,620
but they are possible with the power of imagination.

2274
02:05:15,820 --> 02:05:21,660
And progress and something extremely bogus is going on was tested for covid

2275
02:05:21,860 --> 02:05:25,940
four times today, two tests came back negative, two came back positive,

2276
02:05:26,100 --> 02:05:32,300
same machine, same test, same nurse rapid antigen test from BD.

2277
02:05:32,820 --> 02:05:36,980
If you can dream it, yes, you can do it.

2278
02:05:39,220 --> 02:05:41,380
