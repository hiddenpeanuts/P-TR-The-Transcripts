1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Warning.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,640
The following podcast kicks off a theme month full of vice, depravity, and robots that got

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,360
thrown in the trash by the mid-90s.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,600
You may encounter stooge siblings, Vietnam flashbacks for the whole family, and high stakes

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,860
bets about roller coaster air circulation.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:30,740
We go all in on the MGM Grand's defunct theme park MGM Grand Adventures on Podcast the Ride

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,860
Sin City Nights.

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:55,660
Welcome to Podcast the Ride Sin City Nights.

11
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,580
When the sun goes down, the good boys are nowhere to be found.

12
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:07,100
The sinful boys come around doing sins in sinful town.

13
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,740
I'm Scott, there's Mike, there's Jason.

14
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,740
Hi.

15
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,740
Ready to sin.

16
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,580
I just wanted to, you know, get to the day, if any sins you want to confess.

18
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,580
We will confess.

19
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,420
We're going to do the sins, but we are going to confess them as well.

20
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,420
Okay.

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,820
I thought maybe it's just more like a confessional today versus us sinning.

22
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,340
Well, that's what, look.

23
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:34,100
The sinning is in our future, I suppose, because we're on our way to Las Vegas, literally,

24
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,380
but now we have landed there topic wise.

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,800
And I just want to, you know, like this sleazy veneer, I think we can get some stuff out

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
of our system.

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:51,140
This is a late night USA early 90s style version of Podcast the Ride.

28
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,700
We've done a location change, presumably for tax breaks and are doing it all in Las Vegas.

29
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,700
Yeah, that's smart.

30
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,700
Yeah.

31
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,220
So, so I can, I'm trying to think like, what, what, what could I confess right away here?

32
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,780
I want to just like start off in the spirit of this, you know, Las Vegas, like, did I

33
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,020
have like a blue drink for breakfast or something?

34
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:19,140
Or did I read reread 1995 danger girl comic that I've talked about before on the show

35
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,460
where some bosomy ladies solve it, solve some crimes and go on adventures?

36
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,780
I, I'm not sure.

37
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,340
I didn't read that today, but I'm trying to think of something like that.

38
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,340
Well, you know what?

39
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,980
I can recall a time and I don't remember which trip it's been, but I've gotten a little

40
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,420
crazy in Las Vegas.

41
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,100
You know, one time the, you know, the buskers, like the guys like flipping the cards around

42
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,100
and they'll hand you this and as they'll just force those cards into your hands and then

43
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,900
you'll look at it and there'll be a pretty lady on it.

44
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,860
Who knows where that card on the card.

45
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,860
Yeah, exactly.

46
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,900
And like, do I know what the phone number leads to?

47
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,740
No, but my sin is this.

48
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,300
I didn't throw the card away.

49
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,700
I didn't rip it up right then and there and throw that filth in the garbage.

50
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,660
I kept it in my pocket and then maybe glanced at it one more time and then put it in a hotel

51
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,660
trash can.

52
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,660
That's right.

53
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,180
We're getting a little crazy here on Sin City Nights.

54
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,220
Jason, you want to confess anything naughty right now?

55
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:19,540
I've seen those buskers too, but it was 2006 and I think they're pretty much gone from

56
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,540
the strip now.

57
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,540
Is that right?

58
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,540
Really?

59
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,540
Was there not that?

60
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,340
I remember more of it back then.

61
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,340
Yeah.

62
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,340
That was the first time I went as a pseudo adult.

63
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,820
Yeah, you'd walk by and they were hitting the cards, like sort of, and they had a big

64
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,860
stack of them and they just sort of hold them out and there were like 50 people in like

65
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,780
a row, almost like you were on a receiving line of some kind and they would try to all

66
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,140
throw the little card at you.

67
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,140
But you're right.

68
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,740
I guess last time I was there, I didn't notice as much of that.

69
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:52,700
My memory, well, because a lot of that middle strip, like the Cosmo and Aria and crystal

70
00:03:52,700 --> 00:04:00,420
shops, a lot of that was just empty space in the early 2000s and then eventually these

71
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,580
massive projects got built up.

72
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,020
So everything's built up.

73
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,420
There's a lot more sky bridges.

74
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,380
There's a lot more walkways above the road.

75
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:14,500
I feel like there's a lot more crossing, you know, traffic lights on the street level.

76
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:21,380
So you want to confess that you miss these buskers that would give you the numbers of

77
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,380
prostitutes?

78
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,780
I miss the active construction sites that were going on.

79
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,780
Okay, good.

80
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,780
Yeah.

81
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,780
Nice.

82
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,140
I mean, look, there's always going to be those because as today's topic shows us, things

83
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:40,540
are always done, committed to, lots of money spent on them and then they're fully imploded.

84
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,540
We never mind.

85
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,100
No, never meant to do that.

86
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,100
Never going to do it again.

87
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,100
Yeah.

88
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,820
Almost immediately after they were built.

89
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,820
Yes.

90
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,420
The brutality of Vegas in that way, I think is going to be a theme and it makes it a perfect

91
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,420
area for it.

92
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,140
I'm so excited, by the way, to be landing in Vegas for a little while because it does,

93
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,340
boy, does it tie into themes that we like.

94
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,860
I mean, A, it's a place with big dumb stuff that looks like other stuff.

95
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,860
Yes.

96
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:14,100
And B, it is full of construction catastrophes and barely, like badly thought out plans and

97
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,940
guys and so many of the things we've discovered or what we really love over the years of doing

98
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,940
the show.

99
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,740
It's like a big themed weed.

100
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,060
It's just a big out of control weed or a big rat.

101
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,900
If rats, okay, if rats could join a rat king with different animals, I don't know, what

102
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,900
would you call it?

103
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,900
Just an animal king?

104
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,900
An animal kingdom?

105
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,900
Sorry, we're describing it.

106
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,900
It's a rat king.

107
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,900
But other animals are part of it too.

108
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,780
A bunch of rats all get their tails tied together in a big clump.

109
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,260
It's called a rat king because they can't get free from each other.

110
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,100
It's a massive thing.

111
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,340
But it's just a monstrosity with different gnarling heads and different size rats and

112
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,980
it's really unnerving and scary.

113
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,700
I'm thinking Vegas is such a weird, again, like a weed, a rat king.

114
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,420
It's just out of control.

115
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,980
Things don't fit with each other.

116
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,380
So there's like a shark in an anaconda as part of the rat king.

117
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,380
I didn't know that.

118
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,860
I didn't know they got along with rats.

119
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,860
I didn't know rats could fuse with sharks.

120
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,860
It's just like it's an animal.

121
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,780
Let's call it an animal king.

122
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,420
That's my new phrase.

123
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,220
And it's just, yeah, it's scary.

124
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,220
It's beautiful.

125
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,220
It's everything at once.

126
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,460
Yeah, anything you would want.

127
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:30,300
Vegas is very much it's the epitome of like themed entertainment where the theme is all

128
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,140
themes at once, like all architecture at once.

129
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,500
The theme is too many themes.

130
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:43,820
I mean, today is probably the biggest example of the family friendly theme park 90s Vegas

131
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:51,860
that I think the running theme through this and the other MGM resorts, now MGM resorts,

132
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:58,100
but Excalibur and Luxor is like they pumped a lot of money and time and construction into

133
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:05,980
themed entertainment, be that rides or shows or outside of casino attractions.

134
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:12,340
And within a few years, the contempt they had for these things, which have either shutting

135
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,460
down, scaling back or bulldozing.

136
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,780
Like how many nightclubs will convince you that this place is not for children?

137
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,860
If we build a seventh one, will you not think of this place as just a giant miniature golf

138
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,860
station?

139
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,860
Yeah.

140
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,860
How many places can Steve Aoki be in one night?

141
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,860
Okay.

142
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,100
There might be multiple Steve.

143
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,340
That's the big secret of Vegas.

144
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,020
We'll reveal Vegas secrets.

145
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,020
Secrets.

146
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,380
Steve, there's multiple Steve Aoki's.

147
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,380
Multiple Steve Aoki's.

148
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:49,020
From a distance with a wig and sunglasses on.

149
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,180
I believe one of I believe is current endeavor from the last few years.

150
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,860
Pizza Aoki is in one of the food halls.

151
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
Oh really?

152
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,860
Is maybe an area.

153
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,860
Is a real pizza Aoki location?

154
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,020
Yes, that's right.

155
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:06,140
And I Food Hall is one of the current Vegas trends.

156
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,940
It just means a food court, but a little bougie.

157
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,740
Not so shit.

158
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,740
Yeah.

159
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,860
Not a chain that you started realizing was bad around 1998.

160
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,860
Yeah.

161
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,460
Not a Nathan's that is slowly decomposing.

162
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,740
If you look at it too hard, like.

163
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,740
Yeah.

164
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,140
Are all this stuff, anything in the Vegas Food Hall, is it owned and operated by a DJ

165
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,140
or could it be any?

166
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,140
It helps.

167
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,540
It helps you get your foot in the door.

168
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,700
Yeah, I think it probably helps.

169
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,460
DJ Snake's subs or something like.

170
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:44,300
I think a chunk of the Vegas strip, if I've been, you know, I watch a lot of Vegas YouTubers

171
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:50,700
or news updates and stuff, and it seems like a good chunk of the food that isn't Guy Fieri

172
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,700
licensed or owned restaurants is Buddy Velestro, the Cake Boss restaurant.

173
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,700
Really?

174
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Cake Boss is a lot going on?

175
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
Yeah, Cake Boss.

176
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:05,540
There's Cake Boss, Cake Slice, Vending Machines, and I saw like a YouTube short where they're

177
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,860
like, hey, just a heads up.

178
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,140
These are not freshly made.

179
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,180
They are shipped in cardboard boxes from a warehouse in New Jersey, and they all have

180
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:20,660
a very fine film or like a thing of corn syrup on it to make it look fresh.

181
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,060
So like, do not.

182
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,260
Maybe they have a thick coating of corn syrup on the outside.

183
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,260
Shiny.

184
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,140
Yeah, like they're not necessarily the freshest cake slice.

185
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,860
Just need a little corn shine.

186
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,580
Yeah, it's just a little corn shine.

187
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,980
In the way that the Sprinkles Cupcake ATMs, there's a kind of fun.

188
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,540
They're at a lot of places, but I think those are like, you know, they make them.

189
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,540
Well, they're right there.

190
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,260
They're usually by the place that makes them.

191
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,940
It's next to a Sprinkles and they load it up from the kitchen.

192
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,180
Man, we got to get you the cake.

193
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,700
We got to have you try this cake with the corn syrups.

194
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,180
Let's see if you can tell.

195
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,060
Yeah, see if you can like pull that film off, that corn film.

196
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,740
It's not a distinguished business like the Hello Kitty Cafe.

197
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,340
Where's the Hello Kitty Cafe?

198
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,860
That's in the park in between Park MGM and New York, New York.

199
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,860
Really?

200
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,380
And there is always a line.

201
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,380
Okay.

202
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,380
It's pretty good.

203
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,260
We got a slice cake there last year for Jane's birthday.

204
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,260
We like the Hello Kitty Cafe.

205
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,180
But was it covered in corn syrup?

206
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,100
No, it tasted fruity.

207
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,540
I had like fresh fruit preserves in it.

208
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,540
Okay.

209
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,460
Is the corn syrup also a preservative to keep it fresh when the New Jersey travel?

210
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,460
It could be, yeah, probably.

211
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,460
I think so.

212
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,460
That's probably the idea.

213
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,460
Right.

214
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,460
Well, this is good.

215
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,700
We'll get your treat tips.

216
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,660
As with any new location, we need that for, that's actually genuinely helpful for the

217
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:45,060
Especially because at this point in time, just before we get into the topic, one exciting

218
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,740
thing is we land in Las Vegas.

219
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:53,660
It is possible there are people listening to this very episode on the way to Las Vegas

220
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,580
to attend the podcast, The Ride Big Vegas Groove Blender.

221
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,580
That excites me.

222
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,540
If you're listening to this in your car on the drive, honk really loud.

223
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,340
Just to like, I don't know.

224
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,900
The other cars aren't going to know why, but I think it's going to keep spirits up on

225
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,900
the road.

226
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,900
Yeah.

227
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,260
And if you're in a plane, then just yell really loud.

228
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,700
Do a couple loopty loops as well.

229
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,500
I was thinking they were flying the plane.

230
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,140
You were matching people in a private plane or in just like a two person plane.

231
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,860
No, I was thinking of them in a World War II, like Ernie and Bert in Follow That Bird.

232
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,860
This is what I pictured.

233
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,860
Yeah, yeah.

234
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,860
With aviator goggles.

235
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,700
Or if you're in a commercial plane, if you could just knock on the door and be like,

236
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,780
excuse me, would you mind looping in a loopty loop?

237
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,220
I think it'll just help morale.

238
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,780
And I'm excited because I'm going to this live podcast thing.

239
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,780
They're doing a groove blender.

240
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,780
Oh, groove blender.

241
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,780
Say no more.

242
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,780
Yeah, podcasts are right.

243
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,140
Of course, I'm going as well, says the pilot.

244
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,540
That's why I took this shift.

245
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,580
I usually fly to Kuala Lumpur.

246
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,900
I'm doing Vegas today.

247
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,300
Fellow Cliffords, we're landing.

248
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,300
I did one.

249
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,460
I was not sure if you meant the door to the cockpit, which I love when people like check

250
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,060
in, tap on that thing.

251
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,900
Or if you meant the pressurized like emergency exit doors.

252
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,900
Like you're doing a bit.

253
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,020
Start opening all the doors.

254
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,020
Yeah.

255
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,020
Yeah.

256
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,020
Just keep get spirits up.

257
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,500
Start celebrating because that's what's coming for you.

258
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,060
Do we have any pilots in the audience?

259
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,380
Do you think there's one person who's in a commercial pilot or even, I guess, a private

260
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,380
pilot?

261
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,380
Probably.

262
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,940
You would think statistically, maybe as a hobby.

263
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,940
Yeah.

264
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,940
Really a hobbyist.

265
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,380
Mostly commercial pilots.

266
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,940
I don't know why, but for some reason I can't imagine a commercial pilot listening to this

267
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,020
podcast and I don't know if that's wrong.

268
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,020
Why not?

269
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,020
I can't.

270
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,700
I don't know why not, but for some reason they just seem so professional.

271
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,420
So they're serious people and why would they ever listen to frivolity like this?

272
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,020
So I blow off steam.

273
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,020
They're dignified.

274
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,020
Good vision.

275
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,700
Got to have good vision to be a pilot.

276
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,580
I'd love it if we had like half of the audience be pilots.

277
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,780
I'm just saying I just can't imagine it, but I hope I know.

278
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,340
If a listener shook our hands when we were boarding like a Southwest flight to Vegas and

279
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,020
gave us the little wings, gave us little sticky.

280
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,020
That'd be so good.

281
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,020
We got the little sticky.

282
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,020
Yeah.

283
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,940
And then we then we could go up in the cockpit if they were a listener.

284
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,860
Maybe.

285
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,860
Yeah, maybe.

286
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,900
Like I'm a Club 3 subscriber.

287
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,900
You're a lot up in the cockpit.

288
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,900
I hope.

289
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,780
I mean, these people, this, this depends on this is a scenario where we're all on a plane

290
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,780
together.

291
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,780
That's true.

292
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,780
Yeah.

293
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,900
We're on our way to England or something to play Glastonbury.

294
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,900
Play the West End.

295
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,340
Well, that's what the Groove Blender is going to lead to.

296
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,500
It's all kind of, you know, it's a, it's a big celebratory show.

297
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Yeah.

298
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,740
You know, proven that we can do a bit, you know, we can carry Glastonbury, of course.

299
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,820
Yeah. The podcast stage.

300
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,860
Yeah.

301
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,220
No, we'll make it up to me.

302
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,220
We'll get to me.

303
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,660
We will lead the audience in a sing along of don't look back in anger like that one

304
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,020
clip of Oasis playing Glastonbury.

305
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,180
Yeah. And it's just miles of people joining in on the chorus.

306
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,180
Yeah.

307
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,180
But that's you. That's we'll teach everyone the specific words to like you talking about

308
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,180
trades.

309
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,180
Sally can wait.

310
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:59,700
Oh, you thought it was going to be repeating like the corn syrup sheen preserves the cakes

311
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,620
while you say, yeah, yeah, no, by that point that will be the new don't look back.

312
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,620
Okay. Right.

313
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,900
But for folks who are coming to that, so excited to have you really excited for this

314
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:16,020
thing. If you can't be there in person, then this episode is coming out July 21st, the

315
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,140
following day, July 22nd, Saturday, July 22nd at 8 p.m.

316
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,420
There will be a live stream.

317
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,700
Tickets are available for that at the space LV dot com.

318
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,820
There'll be a link in the episode notes of this.

319
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,860
Join us for that if you can.

320
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:37,060
I think we can promise some visual components that I think will make it worth the live

321
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,780
stream. I mean, it's all visual.

322
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:45,220
Yeah. You know, like it's the cameras are being used and lights and color will be.

323
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,300
But, you know, beyond that, beyond the basics of visual information.

324
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,660
Yeah. And we should specifically say this is a true live stream.

325
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,180
This is a live live stream.

326
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,260
It is not necessarily an on demand one.

327
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,540
We're going to get that is not an on demand.

328
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,220
It is. It is not an on demand one, but we will try to, you know, try our best to get

329
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,820
some footage and put it up somewhere down the line.

330
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,100
Yes. But yeah, sure.

331
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,180
Doesn't go on because it's ready.

332
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,740
Sure goes on because it's eight p.m.

333
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,900
That's a big clock.

334
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,380
July 22nd. We have the massive clock.

335
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,500
Danny, like studio, the mad LV clock.

336
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,140
And also, before we go much further, another part of this since the nights, which I'm

337
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,780
excited about since the nights logo courtesy of the wonderful Aaron Gardner and the since

338
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:30,100
city nights theme, I assume I haven't heard it yet, courtesy of my Carlson.

339
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,380
Cut it if we don't if you don't have time.

340
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,060
No, it'll be. Yeah, it'll be. There's a theme.

341
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,580
I've just I've loved it.

342
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,820
I abandoned one.

343
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,740
I abandoned a version of it and I redid it today.

344
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,820
Oh, boy. And I think it's pretty good.

345
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,580
Oh, all right. So you're here in a second draft.

346
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,940
Yeah. Air that's been put into it by my band in the C.V.

347
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,620
Oakey homage one more with a C.D.

348
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,060
Martin angle.

349
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,700
You know, I abandoned the Elvis homage.

350
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,180
Oh, OK. There's like a bad.

351
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,700
I just didn't wasn't coming together.

352
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,500
But then I saw the logo, which you could all the right.

353
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,420
It did. The branding was the branding was, you know, sinful.

354
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,980
And it was so I just it got a little got a little sexier, if I'm being honest.

355
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,660
You've heard it by now. So you know how sexy it is.

356
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,140
But oh, now I'm reticent to have complimented it.

357
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,100
Maybe if it's too sexy.

358
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,340
Yeah, I know it's maybe on my other computer.

359
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,980
We'll tone it down for next week.

360
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,900
OK, just like, you know, that word for that week.

361
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,260
But we got to look. I know it's since the nights and all, but too sexy.

362
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,700
Bring the just lower the decibels of 25 percent less sex next week.

363
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,700
As far as the music gets into logic, one of the settings on logic.

364
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,380
Yeah, please. Yeah, yeah. Run it.

365
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,780
Run it through the anti sexer.

366
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,780
OK, now that I'm in.

367
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,180
Now, of course, you did say that there is the sexy veneer.

368
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,740
But of course, today's topic and many of the things we're going to talk about

369
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,220
are from the family entertainment boom of the early 90s.

370
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,220
That was the logo. The logo was sturdy.

371
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,460
So the logo was sort of about the nights.

372
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,820
And we'll try to. Yeah, yeah.

373
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,780
Look, we'll we'll try to be medically.

374
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,700
We'll try to push it.

375
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,980
We'll try to do some things that stretch us out of the out of the comfort zone.

376
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,140
But but here we go straight into the molten core of the comfort zone.

377
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:16,740
When they really did when Vegas really did a for the family theme park,

378
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,180
there's themed entertainment stuff always there.

379
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,140
Every year there are new iterations of that.

380
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,380
There's this area 15 thing, but there's a distinctly adult flavor to it.

381
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,460
Yeah. More catering to that.

382
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,980
And this is just this odd alternate universe era where Vegas decided

383
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,220
we're going to try to be for families.

384
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:42,260
And it was seemed as like, oh, it was done as quickly as it started.

385
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,820
And boy, it was so much money spent on it.

386
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,860
And in an era where nobody thought to film it.

387
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,980
So there's such rare like it's so hard to find really good

388
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,580
footage of a lot of the stuff from this era.

389
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,500
This park included MGM Grand Adventures, the theme park

390
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,300
that used to be at the MGM Grand.

391
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,700
I thought you you said something a couple of weeks ago about how there wasn't a ton.

392
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,020
And I was like, yeah, but there's got to be a good amount.

393
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,820
You know, you're right. There's nothing.

394
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,380
Barely anything. There's one ride through video.

395
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,060
OK. Yeah. Yeah.

396
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:22,980
Of the Backlot River tour of the river tour, which I looking at it,

397
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:28,340
I was like, well, this seems like it's the like main ride.

398
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,420
And it did not make it to five years.

399
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,820
Like, you know, not stick around.

400
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,220
That's the strangest thing about the history of it.

401
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,580
This park was it was it roughly a decade.

402
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,140
It was around all told.

403
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,900
But then I didn't know the history of it where there was just the severe

404
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,700
cut down. Yeah. Early on.

405
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,140
So this there was it was a really it was only two and a half years

406
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,580
that the entire thing that they built wild was there.

407
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,420
Yeah. What's crazy, too, is that Vegas goes in on this like family entertainment.

408
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,300
It's basically the same time.

409
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,260
It's a little after, but basically the same time as Disney tries to go after adults

410
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,740
with pleasure, pleasure island.

411
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,580
And it was like both ways.

412
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,820
I think each place was like, that's not quite what we do, is it?

413
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,940
You're right. Yeah.

414
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,500
I think that's interesting stuff.

415
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,700
They both are really no way.

416
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,620
Just like us with this sultry theme.

417
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,900
Yeah. We're going to back out of it real quick after a month.

418
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,020
Yeah. Disney's like, no, no, it's families and when there's not a bunch of

419
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,180
drunk people and teenagers fighting and Vegas is like it's gambling

420
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,820
and prostitutes and that's what it is here.

421
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,740
Yeah. And good restaurants.

422
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,260
That's what our branding is.

423
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,460
What? What year is

424
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,660
National Lampoon's Vegas vacation?

425
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,380
Ninety six or seven.

426
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,620
It's later.

427
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,220
So it's a little it's on the later end of this because I I remember

428
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:54,820
seeing that when I was pretty young on VHS and that vision of Vegas

429
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,660
is so dirty like it is the sleazy.

430
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,140
Like everything is just seen so grimy.

431
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,660
And the theme park Vegas, I feel like doesn't really show up in it.

432
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,380
I don't know. You got some like bright colors in that, though.

433
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,860
Yeah. The big bright cars they all get at the end.

434
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,660
I think of that as kind of a bubbly.

435
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,260
Are you thinking of the end where they go to the like shitty casinos

436
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,580
to win the money back? Yeah.

437
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,460
I think I'm thinking of the shitty like, yeah, because they start out

438
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,380
in like better ones and then the ideas they go to the casino with like guess

439
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,300
a hand and stuff. Oh, yeah.

440
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,660
Oh, yes. The Ray, the Randy Quaid casino.

441
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,140
Yeah. All the novelty games was not real.

442
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,900
So if that impacts any grime opinions, but Vegas is dirty.

443
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,060
Yes, it is. Yeah.

444
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:45,980
But they're saying that's almost encounter to that's almost coming out.

445
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:52,180
I think the the, you know, obviously the footage is lower quality,

446
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,580
standard def quality.

447
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,860
But I feel like the you know, now it's so many so much

448
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,860
LED lights and lasers and all.

449
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,660
And at the time in the 90s and before that, it was just like

450
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,500
popcorn bulbs and cigarette smoke. Sure.

451
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,940
You know, yeah.

452
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,220
You do. You're you're also saying like it's like

453
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,580
I do think it's probably like nicer now than it was.

454
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,220
Yeah. It almost makes more sense now for there to be a little bit more theme park

455
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,340
presence than there was maybe in the 90s.

456
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,340
Yeah. And I think there is slowly starting to be again, kind of more aimed at adults.

457
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:33,180
But like night, there's less 99 cent shrimp cocktails now.

458
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,660
And there's a lot more, you know,

459
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,140
celebrity chef kind of restaurant.

460
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,140
I'm so mad he missed out on that.

461
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,540
I don't eat shrimp. I don't eat shrimp.

462
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,300
So what any other guy you got chicken cocktail?

463
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,940
Oh, I love a big crowd. I love a crab cocktail.

464
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,940
Just lump crab meat and liver sausage cocktail.

465
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,740
Sure. Liver worst.

466
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,220
In a bunch of ice.

467
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,780
Yeah. I see liver sausage, please.

468
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,820
I see. I hear what you're saying, though, that it's almost like that,

469
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,740
you know, now it feels like they've kind of like weaved the gradient

470
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,180
where like if more family stuff started showing up, it would make a little more sense.

471
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:19,220
Yes. It almost seems like such a hard pivot for it being still sort of a grimy and smaller.

472
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,220
Yeah. Vegas and more cigarette-y Vegas, for sure.

473
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,820
It does feel like like what else could have triggered this?

474
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:32,820
But the like Disney decade, Peek Eisner, right?

475
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,940
Disney. I mean, obviously Disney World inspired a lot of theme parks

476
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,380
and travel destinations across the country and world.

477
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:47,380
But that Eisner era of Disney, MGM Studios, like it becoming a,

478
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,820
you know, three park and so many hotels and so much stuff to do.

479
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,500
It seems like there was such a boom at the end of the 80s that it must have

480
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,500
inspired this, right?

481
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,300
I'm that. And also, I'm sure just the idea of market share.

482
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,900
Oh, you know what we could do is like we could get into this other thing.

483
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,340
I mean, Disney is the maybe the best example of it in the 90s of like,

484
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,900
yeah, we can own a hockey team as well.

485
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,980
Oh, maybe we do this.

486
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,300
And then we were talking about that Marriott, but no, in that Marriott episode,

487
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:21,420
Great America episode, we got a hotel theme park makes sense.

488
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,220
Sure. So they were probably like, yeah, they saw Universal Orlando.

489
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,020
They saw all of it. They're like, you know what?

490
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,420
We got hotels. Just put some fucking rides back there.

491
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,660
Well, and then simultaneously, the hotels are just getting bigger.

492
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,060
There's an arms race to build more and more elaborate hotels.

493
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,980
I think the Mirage is the one that I mean, obviously, Caesar's Palace

494
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,420
long time themed and has just kind of constantly growing and growing.

495
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,180
Like, yeah, really, there's so many towers there now.

496
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,900
But the Mirage opens in the 80s.

497
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,500
It opens with the big free volcano show.

498
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,980
It's got all the gold front.

499
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,460
And then the the MGM Grand, this MGM Grand, the original MGM

500
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,500
Grand is now was Bally's is now Horseshoe Horseshoe.

501
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,260
Yeah. Weird.

502
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,020
There's a home to one of the largest skyscraper fires

503
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,060
in American history.

504
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,220
Eighty seven people died

505
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,460
due to faulty wiring, I think, in the food court deli.

506
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,700
I heard so.

507
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,220
So then at the end of 93, that's when there, if you've seen,

508
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:37,900
there's a commercial with a weird CGI lion, the giant lion, a giant

509
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,140
lion stomping down the street.

510
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,060
Really something like that's very speaking of your rat king, your animal king.

511
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,260
Yeah. Thing that the lion like plants

512
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:53,180
on the strip and then like forms the hotel towers out of its body is.

513
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,620
OK, this is related.

514
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,700
Is that Louie?

515
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,700
Oh, well, I don't know.

516
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,140
MGM lion named Louie is my question.

517
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,300
No, because the OK, what is this breakdown?

518
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,580
Because this is I did come across this.

519
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:15,860
I think the one that we know from the in the circle in the logo.

520
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,220
Yeah. Is Leo.

521
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,740
But the theme park one in the suit is Louie.

522
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,340
OK, so that was Louie is King Louie.

523
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,860
I'm sorry I didn't give him his title.

524
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,940
So that was Leo walking down the street, CGI Leo, maybe.

525
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,380
I'm going to say so because he's not like a silly cartoon lion.

526
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,060
Right. I believe I know he looks different.

527
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,460
I'm just trying to figure out if they if maybe the hotel lion

528
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,300
is different than the movie lion, maybe.

529
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,740
I don't think so. I think there was the confusion.

530
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:50,220
If you're on the MGM grand property, it's in some places you are seeing Leo the lion.

531
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,700
But as soon as you get to the theme park area, it is Louie the lion.

532
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,660
OK, so Leo is like the maybe harder

533
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,940
nose brother of Louie, probably related.

534
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,140
Yeah. Well, you know, it's like people grow up in different parts of the country

535
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,420
and live very different lives.

536
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,740
It's like when you when one grows up in like

537
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,860
on the Serengeti and one grows up in Toontown.

538
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,300
They are related. Yes.

539
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,500
It's a country mouse city mouse.

540
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,580
Yeah. Got it.

541
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,340
We owe a little more rough and tumble.

542
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:21,860
Understood.

543
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,700
That's why he roars in the logo and doesn't say, hello, you're right.

544
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,780
Is he a movie?

545
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:34,140
So this this happens because of I mean, so the theme park

546
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,860
opens up alongside the MGM Grand in 93.

547
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,860
They all opens on the same day, December 18th, 93.

548
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,940
And it's all at the hands of the then

549
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:53,580
owner of the MGM brand who bought and sold it several times, I think.

550
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,820
Kirk Kirkorian, he Kirk or Corian

551
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,460
built the MGM Grand that you mentioned, the one with the fire.

552
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,740
And before that, he built the International Hotel,

553
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,820
the Elvis Hotel, later Hilton, later Westgate.

554
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:16,180
All three of those upon their construction were the biggest hotel in Las Vegas.

555
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,100
So this guy built the biggest hotel in Vegas three times

556
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,780
at one point in time, Kirk, Corian, the richest man in California.

557
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,820
Therefore, at least I don't know what these are different stats,

558
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,860
but at one point, he's number one in Los Angeles.

559
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,220
Obviously, it'd have to be he's number one in Los Angeles.

560
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,820
Number two is Sumner Redstone.

561
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,140
Wow. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

562
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,780
And this is probably 1990s numbers.

563
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,780
So this or 2000 still, I mean, I think this guy.

564
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,340
I believe he's passed away now.

565
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,740
I wonder what those numbers are.

566
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,900
Yeah. Not enough.

567
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,060
Well, he's a fucking alimony.

568
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,900
Damn bitches. There will be.

569
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,140
Sumner probably hated him for being number one.

570
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,300
Yeah, I think so.

571
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,900
I'm so mad. I'm so mad.

572
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,660
I need a toe suck.

573
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:08,100
Oh, no.

574
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,860
I soiled myself.

575
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,700
Change my diaper.

576
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,940
Somebody change it.

577
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,300
I'll give you five grand to change my diaper.

578
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,420
This is why I lose so much money to Corcoran.

579
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,980
His brows work.

580
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,500
He changes his own diaper.

581
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,700
Ultimately, it's like Kurt's on top.

582
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,260
I got to hand it to him someday as bells will fail.

583
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,820
But so I don't really know the deal with Kurt Corcoran, to be honest.

584
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,420
I'm going to guess that there are some guy adjacent qualities,

585
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,660
because how can you be that?

586
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,660
How can you be the richest man in California without that?

587
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,580
It's yeah.

588
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,260
But there is like bombast from this guy.

589
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,780
This again, this being his third attempt at the biggest.

590
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,180
So he's got to go so much bigger.

591
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:53,860
It is like the it is the biggest casino when it gets built.

592
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,060
So he wants to stack up numbers.

593
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:00,100
And I probably as part of that, too, he wants stuff to do.

594
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,340
What are things that no hotel has done yet?

595
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,460
And I bet that's where the theme park thing comes from.

596
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,700
It's by the way, I guess it was this trend.

597
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,900
We act as if Vegas, like, you know, as if the mayor of Vegas decided

598
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,300
we should court families, it was probably a lot of people

599
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,780
were kind of separately having the idea, like forming this little

600
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,620
and like copying each other to some extent.

601
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,300
So maybe it is, Jay, you brought up Steve Wynn and Mirage,

602
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,940
and we're getting a little theme parky now.

603
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,020
Maybe that this must be Kirk Corian trying to like step it up.

604
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,180
Well, let's actually have Disneyland then.

605
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,220
Yeah, I he and then the the MGM Graham, we know now

606
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,140
the big green building.

607
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,460
I saw a video about the history of that area.

608
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,860
And, you know, there used to be the

609
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,260
I think it was the Tropicana Yacht Club around there.

610
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,340
It's a golf course, a golf course.

611
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,220
And then Corian builds a hotel called the Marina Hotel,

612
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,460
which it's unclear.

613
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,860
I don't think there's any marinas around.

614
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,140
But it probably had its own like the Disneyland Hotel used to.

615
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,460
It probably had a little like a little water zone.

616
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,380
But that eventually gets absorbed into the massive MGM.

617
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:19,020
Like as they're building the MGM Grand, that kind of gets absorbed in.

618
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,060
And it's still there.

619
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,900
I didn't realize that one of the buildings was this Marina.

620
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,420
The West Wing, the West Tower, which I've always heard.

621
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,460
You know, if you read about reviews of the MGM Grand, everything, I think

622
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,140
I think all the rooms have been updated at this point.

623
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,820
But for a long time, the reviews was like, do not stay in the West Tower.

624
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,260
You don't want to be in there because that building is decades

625
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,980
and decades and decades old.

626
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,500
Much, much older. Yeah.

627
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,460
And the other.

628
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:53,380
Yeah. So he's this is like he's building this sprawling complex.

629
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,700
And, you know, it wants to get in this theme park zone that nobody else has done.

630
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,660
But a wall is hit.

631
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,540
And I didn't know any of this history that there there is Disney

632
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,380
involvement and Eisner involvement in it, because if you're hearing

633
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,020
that there was an MGM theme park, you might be thinking of the other

634
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,860
MGM theme park, Disney, MGM Studios.

635
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,940
And obviously they had to work out a deal with MGM to get that library

636
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,860
and to get all the characters in the great movie ride and in all the clips

637
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,580
and what have you.

638
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,980
But I guess they didn't know the extent of it.

639
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,940
They were like, like the park.

640
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,460
Yes. Use our clips, use our characters, whatever.

641
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,380
But as soon as they Disney started saying, come film movies here

642
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:44,100
at Disney, MGM Studios, they viewed that as a breach of the contract

643
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,780
or an overstep that like, wait, but we're your competitor.

644
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,580
We're not your competitor as far as theme parks go.

645
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,740
But you can't tell people come film at MGM Studios.

646
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,180
And that's not us. Right. Yes.

647
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,660
Yeah. So I think a licensing.

648
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,420
Yeah, that was viewed beyond what they had agreed to.

649
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,140
I should know this.

650
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,540
But is that the reason why there was a whole thing with the have an icon

651
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,620
having to be like the Chinese theater to be covered up for years?

652
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,540
I don't know. Was that but is that true?

653
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,420
Is that like, was there an actual need to block?

654
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,660
Because it's you know, they don't own the Chinese theater.

655
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,140
No, I know. That's always what I heard.

656
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,940
And I realize I've never looked into exactly what it was.

657
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,620
I look it up.

658
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:29,620
I think that's more due to the ownership of the Chinese theater, not MGM.

659
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,820
Yeah. Do they lose that for a minute or is or are we overthink?

660
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,540
What did they just decide to build a big stupid ad?

661
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,860
The hat was there longer than the other stupid things.

662
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,540
Yes, much longer.

663
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,380
But I think there was a reason for it.

664
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,940
But I just I'm trying to remember what it was. Yeah. Yeah.

665
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,740
And I mean, I don't think some I always heard.

666
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:54,100
Yeah, it was some Byzantine legalese, you know,

667
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:59,300
I think the the eventual name change to Hollywood Studios, I think, was

668
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,380
the end of a licensing agreement.

669
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:07,100
And then the great movie ride the last few years that it kind of limped along.

670
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,460
So it's running well.

671
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,980
But in terms of like who is funding like they Turner Classic movies

672
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:18,460
stepped in and like had some, you know, some of their hosts in there.

673
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,460
And I think covered some of the bill.

674
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,380
Mm hmm.

675
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,900
So as long as if he could fire all the robots in the ride and tell him,

676
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,180
we don't have any more.

677
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:34,060
We don't. Yes. Can we send in Gene Kelly?

678
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,860
Can I please personally fire animatronic Gene Kelly?

679
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,980
Sorry, sir. No, we lost that October.

680
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,460
That's a sure he's not in the Batgirl movie.

681
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,660
He's sure he didn't get tossed out already.

682
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,300
Go find him. He's around somewhere.

683
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:55,420
So basically, they they sue Disney to try to get out of all this.

684
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:00,140
Eisner talks about this in his book, and he says they had no grounds for any of this.

685
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,540
They just suddenly look.

686
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,460
He actually he blames this guy, Kirk Corian.

687
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,900
Apparently, Kirk Corian didn't know he didn't know there was Disney MGM Studio.

688
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,580
Like lower people just kind of did it.

689
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,540
Yeah, he was vaguely aware.

690
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,740
And then once he gets the idea to build a theme park, they're like, well, there is.

691
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,340
We already made a theme park deal.

692
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,140
What? What do you mean we made a theme?

693
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,260
They had that Disney thing.

694
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,100
Ah, so Eisner views it as they just suddenly started

695
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,500
claiming all this stuff to get out of an agreement that they just didn't like.

696
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,460
So Disney countersued.

697
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:35,820
So early 90s, there's a volley of back and forth lawsuits between Disney and MGM

698
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,300
immediately after the park isn't open for like six months before.

699
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,780
We're all happy kids going to Disney MGM Studios,

700
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,340
and those entities are suing each other immediately.

701
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,980
And so the other so Disney says, well, if you're going to bug us about this,

702
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:54,060
you what do you mean you're building an MGM theme park?

703
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,780
We own your theme park rights.

704
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,780
You can't do that.

705
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:01,700
A judge had to parse all of this and it was he basically said, you're both right.

706
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,540
You can't have the name on the studio.

707
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,420
That's not good.

708
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,580
But and they get to wait.

709
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,700
How is Disney right?

710
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,180
I think like everybody can have your theme parks and you get to keep MGM

711
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:15,900
in their theme park.

712
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:20,900
You guys can build your Vegas park, but it can't be a behind the scenes of movies.

713
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,740
Theme park and they're like, yeah, sure.

714
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,860
OK, that's fine.

715
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,780
That's not exactly what we were going to do.

716
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,180
Hurry up, change it all.

717
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,700
Like this to me, the end will get into the park and the seemingly the weirdness

718
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,980
of the park, but I think they got caught.

719
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,980
I think like fuck, fuck, fuck.

720
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,980
We have to think of a new what this park is now.

721
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,460
Right. We can build it.

722
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:47,740
We just can't do what we foolishly let Disney take our name.

723
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:52,380
But then they also kind of did do a little behind the scenes.

724
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,300
Yes, there is that the ride that you mentioned, but it's like weird.

725
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,660
It's not there's not a tram.

726
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:04,660
So maybe and you're not you're certainly not seeing any actual movies being filmed.

727
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:10,220
Maybe they determined this is exactly the line or they never had the rights to do it.

728
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,340
And Disney threatened to sue again.

729
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,940
And they're like, fine, closing it.

730
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,020
We're building a pool.

731
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,220
Fuck, that's gone.

732
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,500
Convention Center.

733
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,900
That's what we wanted to do.

734
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,340
Anyways, don't worry about it.

735
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,020
We never wanted this right.

736
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:26,500
You know, while we're talking about actual movie based ride, can we

737
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,340
just briefly touch on the document I sent you guys?

738
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,100
Sure.

739
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,260
That's a listener gave us this a year or two ago.

740
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,700
They work in a they were they work in

741
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,300
an entertainment library or archive here in Hollywood.

742
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:48,140
And this is a fascinating document because I mean, just the title

743
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:54,060
is this are our creative amusement designs who have worked on a lot of rides,

744
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:59,780
a lot of parks and, you know, worked on this park.

745
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:06,540
But the title of this document Apocalypse Now, MGM Grand Theme Park Ride Concept

746
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:11,380
Storyline, and it's dated October 22nd, 1991.

747
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,940
You all know Apocalypse Now, the the rip rollicking good time

748
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:21,700
at the cinema about the insanity and violence of the Vietnam War and war.

749
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,060
And I've always wanted to.

750
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,860
I wanted to be in the movie.

751
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,340
It's so much fun.

752
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,380
It does sound fine.

753
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:32,340
Yeah. The movie about the insanity of war that almost drove everyone who worked on it insane.

754
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:37,060
Universal says ride the movies and then I get to Universal and my favorite,

755
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,340
the only movie I want to ride is Nowhere to be Found.

756
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:40,860
Yeah.

757
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:47,460
I don't get to see Kurtz and the what's Martin Sheen's name.

758
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,380
Willard, Captain Willard, Captain Willard.

759
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,380
And they were going to solve this.

760
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,020
They were going to.

761
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,780
So this is what I'm saying that, like, I think there was a point.

762
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,300
This is pre the lawsuit, right?

763
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:05,740
So I think there was a time where they were maybe exploring real movie properties

764
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:10,100
that we're going to do exactly what Universal and Disney MGM are doing.

765
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,180
And then they just kind of cheap out and genericify all of it.

766
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,300
But yes, there is this this incredible document.

767
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,100
It's so many pages long.

768
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,260
What a discovery.

769
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:24,500
And it's yeah, the first couple of paragraphs with the detail, though,

770
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:29,900
entering the queue line dock building, the guests are surrounded by various video

771
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:35,380
screens, an edited version of Hearts of Darkness is playing, which also includes

772
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:41,460
Mr. Coppola welcoming the riders to the MGM studio theme park and the Apocalypse.

773
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,460
Now ride Hearts Hearts of Darkness is the

774
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:50,980
documentary about the horror show that was making this movie.

775
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,300
Yeah, yeah.

776
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,180
So, you know, you want to.

777
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:01,100
Yeah, you'd you'd want to show you'd want to show overnight in the line for the

778
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,820
Boondock Saints, right?

779
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,820
It's

780
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:12,020
you want to see why not words and all Boondock Saints Veritas.

781
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,380
I that's really strange.

782
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,860
And what you know, I know that there's blue sky.

783
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,620
I know that, yeah, you know, you aim for the fences.

784
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:26,980
But the notion of Francis Ford Coppola say hello and on behalf of everyone here

785
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,700
in Hollywood, welcome to the MGM studio theme park.

786
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,540
I know he did Captain EO, but I don't know that it necessarily

787
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,020
whet his appetite for more.

788
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,140
No. Yeah.

789
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,700
George was a theme park guy.

790
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,060
George was the theme park guy.

791
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,660
Hi, I'm Francis Ford Coppola.

792
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,260
I'm here on the set of Dracula.

793
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,060
Keanu Reeves, Gary Oldman.

794
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,620
I'm here on the set of Jack.

795
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,700
Taking time out of my schedule to introduce you to.

796
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,060
I'm just at my winery trying new blends for exciting new endeavor.

797
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,380
Coppola wineries.

798
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:02,460
I I mean, that's the right move to get him to intro.

799
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,980
It would have been great to see a lazy intro from him.

800
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,060
Oh, man.

801
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:10,060
Imagine how this would be such this would be like we talk about this in every fourth

802
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,460
episode if there is there is. Yeah, sorry.

803
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,740
I could pull a video. Yeah.

804
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:19,180
Yeah. Is there a crazier movie that has been made into a ride like this?

805
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,700
Like in one that's because obviously like Jaws is a scary movie.

806
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,700
Isn't there a scary movie Europe?

807
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,980
Didn't we talk about a it's not crazier,

808
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:31,780
but isn't there an attraction based on you five seven one?

809
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,100
Kind of like that's right.

810
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,900
Very serious. Yeah, that's pretty serious.

811
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:42,780
But yeah, the the real war component of it, there's no three kings ride,

812
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,460
no three kings ride, no saving private Ryan.

813
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,140
I'm sure. Get in it.

814
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,540
Climb into your luck ever gets climb aboard a locker, which will magically take

815
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,140
flight. Yeah, Steven Spielberg.

816
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:55,900
Yeah.

817
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:59,540
He some of his more serious movies have not made it into the universal.

818
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,900
There's no Martin Scorsese.

819
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,180
There's no good fellows ride it out.

820
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,860
Well, that's no that guy.

821
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,020
He's a park rides as we know.

822
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:12,300
So he wouldn't want to have a raging bull experience.

823
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,820
No,

824
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,980
but the other thing about this document is

825
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:22,900
it only tangentially touches on Apocalypse.

826
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:28,900
Now there's a couple of moments where like a sound cue of Martin Sheen goes like

827
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,420
you better get back here in one piece and then later parts of it.

828
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,220
Don't die in the real war.

829
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:41,420
I later parts of it essentially do get built for the back lot.

830
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,460
River tour. Yeah.

831
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,740
Including some of the most notable parts of this ride,

832
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:54,220
which mostly involve various sizes of guns being pointed directly at guests.

833
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,020
Yeah, sure. Well, it's Apocalypse now.

834
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,260
What do you want? Yeah.

835
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,060
Yeah. Yeah.

836
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:05,860
Because there is a helicopter with like a gunner with like an animatronic gunner

837
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,860
like shooting at your boat in the back lot.

838
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,700
River tour. Yeah.

839
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,380
There's I think what's weird as you go through this document, too.

840
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,860
I mean, first of all, clue right there.

841
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,700
MGM Studio theme park.

842
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,380
That's exactly it.

843
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,220
Disney called their bluff and they had to do grand adventures.

844
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,900
It is now it's a place where you can go anywhere.

845
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,380
It's not about moviemaking.

846
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,540
But then like the dial.

847
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,300
This is what's really weird is that it's back and forth between Martin Sheen in

848
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,340
character. This is Captain Willard to PBR Excursion Patrol boat.

849
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:37,860
Come in.

850
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,100
And then before that, welcome to the Apocalypse Now River tour,

851
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,100
where we will show you how effects from that film and others are used to create

852
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,620
movie magic.

853
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:51,940
The most rote theme park, find the scenes, movie shit, but about like the most like

854
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,820
films are usually shot over the period over the course of two years and typically

855
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,700
drive everyone involved mad.

856
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,700
A little taste of that today, the behind the scenes stress of the film usually

857
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,900
exactly mirrors what's going on with the characters and becomes a metaphor.

858
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,460
In fact, for

859
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,820
the story being told, the

860
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:23,420
there is a fake temple sequence for a fake movie called Temple of Gloom.

861
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,260
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

862
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,940
That made it into the ride.

863
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:26,980
Well, that's OK.

864
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,740
So that right.

865
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,660
And you know, and then we, you know, we can talk about kind of like broader stuff

866
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:35,380
about the park, but it's like it is essentially I don't know.

867
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,540
Well, that's look, it's messy, right?

868
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,620
I think they they had to scramble.

869
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,060
What is this now?

870
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,940
So there's types of rides that we all know.

871
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,820
It's log flumes and rapids.

872
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:50,660
And those don't particularly have anything to do with movies or MGM.

873
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:56,300
And probably the only one that gets built that does is this back lot River Tour,

874
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,420
which is this.

875
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:02,700
So, yeah, clearly it was like a rewrite from Apocalypse Now because they didn't

876
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,860
get the rights to that or to anything.

877
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,340
It's all generic.

878
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:15,220
So they have to like just like come up with the kinds of names that movies would have.

879
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,820
It's so so like, again, it's it's the most strange mishmash because it's like

880
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:24,140
it's a ride vehicle that's a lot like Jaws Universal.

881
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,940
I saw a couple of videos say

882
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:33,140
these are the Jaws boats from the first fucked up for it because R&R

883
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,860
Creative Amusement Designs, as they were called at the time,

884
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:44,300
built was the original shitty version that the other company had to come in and fix.

885
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:44,980
Wow.

886
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,380
Then the boats were sold to MGM.

887
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:51,660
And these are the boats.

888
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,300
Yeah.

889
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:57,420
So I remember the shitty was trying to find more sources that say I saw a couple

890
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:02,820
of videos that said that and it did kind of seem right to the point where one

891
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:08,300
of the one of the bits of dialogue in this pitch document for the early version

892
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,980
of this ride just says, this has never happened before.

893
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,140
Stay calm and I'll get us out of here.

894
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,060
And I don't know if that's verbatim from one of the versions of the Jaws ride,

895
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,940
but it does seem like it. Right.

896
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,980
Like, well, I mean, sure.

897
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,380
But it also seems like a line that's in every theme park.

898
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,340
Right.

899
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,140
It's

900
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,580
head tight, everybody. Well, there's real people in there.

901
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,540
OK. Yeah, that's not everything.

902
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,980
Jungle cruise to

903
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:34,980
the new minions. Right.

904
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:35,780
Actually, probably.

905
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,420
And then it was the strangest thing.

906
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:42,420
We the guests went from being in peril to being the ones who saved the day ourselves.

907
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,060
Yeah.

908
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,420
It's funny how that happened.

909
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,620
Our heroism.

910
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:54,100
So so it's yes, you climb aboard shitty Jaws boats and you go

911
00:45:54,300 --> 00:46:01,220
along a river where there's a wisecracking captain and you but you in this case,

912
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,900
you see places where movies are filmed.

913
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,780
But why are movies being filmed along a river?

914
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:12,060
Why are there five separate productions all right next to each other?

915
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,540
All very different genres.

916
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:19,740
It seems to me that the river would only get in the way of camera positions

917
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,700
and equipment would make it all much more of a mess.

918
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,460
I agree. This is a real backlog.

919
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:28,660
I agree with you. It seems impractical to do a set of productions like this.

920
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:33,260
Yeah. Also at the loading dock, there was some crates or like the shooting

921
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,420
schedule sign was labeled MGM movie world.

922
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:39,300
And I was like, that's not the name of this part.

923
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,980
Another one. Yeah.

924
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,980
They keep

925
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:46,340
they like the company got the prop done early.

926
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,860
Like, can you revise that?

927
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,060
No. On to the next one.

928
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,380
Pay us more, please.

929
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,900
Ten dollars and we'll write.

930
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,500
Nope, we don't have ten dollars.

931
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:58,020
We barely want to do this part to begin with.

932
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,540
So

933
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,420
so, yeah, you get your little board of what's being filmed here.

934
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,820
River Trader Swamp Creature,

935
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:11,180
Ironclad, Temple of Gloom, Jungle Storm.

936
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:16,540
So you ride by all these scenes and they all kind of represent different genres.

937
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,500
The one that stands out a lot to me as soon as the first time it ever occurred

938
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,380
to me to do YouTube digging of this park and I found the one home movie

939
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,860
ride through of it is definitely what really stands out is

940
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:33,460
those just a normal place to do crazy going on

941
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:38,540
and a big monster burst out that is like a pseudo creature from the black.

942
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,620
Yeah, yeah.

943
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,900
But it's just the like saddest, most teetery guy.

944
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:44,620
Yeah.

945
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:49,340
You would only be you're startled by just that something's happening.

946
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,060
It's not the monster itself.

947
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:51,580
Right.

948
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,940
So give him credit, I guess, for making a big sound.

949
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,300
But once you have eyes on it, he's pretty dopey.

950
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,700
It's yeah, it is.

951
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:00,700
It looks funny.

952
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,900
It looks like it like the still picture of it looks like it was like a joke or

953
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,540
something. Yeah, yeah.

954
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,660
It looks like it was not meant.

955
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,860
I mean, I guess they weren't thinking it was deadly serious or anything.

956
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:13,020
I'm just saying for like a movie, you would want it to be like a scary monster.

957
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,820
I know it's kind of a Home Depot Halloween decoration.

958
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:16,300
Yeah.

959
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,580
Some of those are scary.

960
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,940
Some of those are a little bit scary.

961
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:19,740
Are scary. Yeah.

962
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:20,980
Yeah, increasingly.

963
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,700
But very much an off brand like off brand Doc Brown.

964
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:29,980
This is off brand, you know, every creature, off brand monsters, off brand

965
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:33,700
productions is that that presumably is swamp creature.

966
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:38,020
Does one that is like it seems I think it's like the Civil War.

967
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:41,700
So we get two real wars represented in this one attraction.

968
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,500
There's one indoor scene.

969
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:48,860
You go into kind of a temple and the creature like a stone guy comes to life.

970
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:49,900
He's all right.

971
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:50,660
That's OK.

972
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,500
Yeah, yeah.

973
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,260
Yeah, I don't know.

974
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:55,140
That might be my favorite part of it is the stone man.

975
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:59,820
I mean, I also here I am like snarking on it, of course.

976
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,940
But I think if I well, I did.

977
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,900
There's I haven't said this. I went I went.

978
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,180
I was in there. Yes. OK.

979
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,780
I was there, I think, in 94, I believe.

980
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,540
And I have fond memories of it.

981
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,460
I think I did do I must have done this ride.

982
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:18,100
And I think I was scared of the swamp creature.

983
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,020
Well, yeah. Then.

984
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,300
And I think I would have been fine.

985
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,020
This very cool.

986
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:25,020
This like miniature version of the Universal Tour, you know.

987
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,180
Yeah, that makes sense.

988
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:31,260
I seeing all the pictures of it and seeing it presented this way,

989
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,100
it does look like absolute shit across the board.

990
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,980
The whole park looks bad.

991
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:39,860
Everything looks like the money they've said they spent.

992
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:44,140
It seems like a complete waste of that much money in the 90s.

993
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:48,220
Everything else that like this, I would make sense looking at some of those

994
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:52,140
photos to go, oh, this was open in 1972 when they like added some things to it.

995
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,700
Sure. But you see it like, oh, this open in the 90s.

996
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,340
This is like it was complete shit.

997
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,100
Yeah. Well, you're absolutely right.

998
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,940
Like you would cut it some slack if it had been there forever.

999
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:08,540
But for a brand new like glistening part in 93,

1000
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,820
there's this one photo.

1001
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:15,820
I don't do the listeners much good, but let me show you guys this.

1002
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,340
There's look at this.

1003
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,700
This is like

1004
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:26,260
this is a postcard of the park and it is rendered like any concept art you'd see

1005
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:33,540
in the early 90s of any of the universal parks where it is like sprawling and glowy.

1006
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,820
There is a glow on everything.

1007
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:42,260
And there's, you know, a giant helicopter coming out of an explosion over in that

1008
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,620
back lot river. It looks just like, you know, the Miami Vice thing.

1009
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,740
And there's fireworks going on.

1010
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:52,300
Like, I mean, this photo is so exciting.

1011
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,180
Oh, yeah. And dynamic.

1012
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,260
And we're at this.

1013
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:59,540
I mean, this I want to go to this park very badly.

1014
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:05,300
But you see it in the light of day and it's just like, like, here's here's an actual

1015
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:10,700
shot of the park and this is a corner of like the New York street is what it is.

1016
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:14,620
Yeah. And I think a lot of it just the atmosphere

1017
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:19,700
was it seems like it's like an AI of a theme park.

1018
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,500
It's like an almost there.

1019
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:22,340
Well, you're right.

1020
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:26,100
You did like take some theme park locales and kind of put them in a blender.

1021
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,780
And that is sort of what a theme park looks like.

1022
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,620
What I'm showing you guys right now,

1023
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:35,220
does that specifically resemble anywhere that you can recall?

1024
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,580
No, no.

1025
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,900
I think it looks exactly like the kind

1026
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:44,380
of the corner where the parade returns in town square.

1027
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,820
OK, yeah. Main Street.

1028
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,580
Yeah, right. You know, like the corner where the Lincoln Theater is.

1029
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,340
But just like all rendered a little bit worse.

1030
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,660
Yes, it's not.

1031
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,740
And again, I would go as with all of these things.

1032
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,700
You got to pin it on

1033
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,860
amount of money spent space because it was small.

1034
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,700
It was like 33 acres, I believe.

1035
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:11,140
33 acres, which is small, less than half of California Adventure today.

1036
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:15,980
And that's, you know, a park that was deemed too small when it opened.

1037
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:20,140
It actually I think there's a lot of overlap with California Adventure.

1038
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:27,580
The way it opened, where it's part of a big billion dollar enterprise.

1039
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,540
Like this company is going to build a ton of stuff.

1040
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:35,300
And some of the space and some of the money are going to a theme park.

1041
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,180
How much? Enough. It's enough.

1042
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,300
Don't worry about it.

1043
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,900
Yeah. But where it feels a little bit like like an afterthought.

1044
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,740
It's a little too small.

1045
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:48,340
Things aren't done, you know, quite to the present value.

1046
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:54,500
Yeah, the numbers, the expedition theme park video had a really good

1047
00:52:54,700 --> 00:53:00,180
list of numbers of like DC when DC, I guess, when DC are

1048
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:03,740
a started, that was 55 acres.

1049
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:06,740
MGM Grand Adventure's 33 acres.

1050
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:11,940
To put in perspective with the movie theme park, Universal Studios Florida,

1051
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:17,700
the original universe studios, Florida Park, 125 acres.

1052
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,980
Wow. Wow.

1053
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,700
That is crazy. Geez.

1054
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,020
So a quarter. Yeah.

1055
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,820
Yeah. And then when MGM

1056
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:35,220
Grand Adventure's gets cut down, it gets cut by 40 percent down to 18.8 acres.

1057
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,500
Ninety six almost daily.

1058
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,540
It's crazy.

1059
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:44,100
And 33 acres in Las Vegas is incredible.

1060
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:48,780
That's a huge amount of space that they have like done giant things with.

1061
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,260
Of course, in theme park world.

1062
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,900
Oh, my God. The standard is so high.

1063
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:55,700
How much space you really you need to do something that really matters.

1064
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:59,900
Let me talk about my experience there a little bit.

1065
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,100
I have very fond memories of it.

1066
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,220
Definitely. I was trying to remember what to like.

1067
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:09,380
I asked my parents about it, and the only thing I just remember at the time,

1068
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:15,500
I remember like as a kid, the big theme of the of the visit, just being like,

1069
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:20,380
oh, my God, the walking God, you walk a mile through the play,

1070
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:23,180
you get lost down there, and it is true.

1071
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:27,820
It is like all the way at the end of a really massive it's you're all the way

1072
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:32,740
through the casino and then all the way through a very long row of giant

1073
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,220
restaurants. It's what now is the path to the pool.

1074
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:40,660
If you've ever stayed there, which is very, very long.

1075
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:45,060
I mean, not I think now that I've stayed there a bunch, I'm like, Dad, cool.

1076
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:47,140
It was come on.

1077
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,740
It's big, but not knowing walk back.

1078
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:55,100
Yeah. Not knowing where you're going oftentimes makes everything feel long.

1079
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,580
That's everywhere.

1080
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,620
That's everywhere. That's a Six Flags.

1081
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:01,060
That's a casino. That's true.

1082
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,060
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's the idea in the casino.

1083
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,300
Yes. Get lost.

1084
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,060
But then it maybe shouldn't be the idea.

1085
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:11,620
And that's the idea to Six Flags, too, is that you get lost and then

1086
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,540
you end up spending another six hours there.

1087
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,660
Then you get so frustrated that it's what

1088
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,900
almost happened to me at Great America.

1089
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:22,180
I almost went in for the fast lane thing.

1090
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,180
That's like I've been wandering around.

1091
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,220
I just want to get on a ride. How much is this thing?

1092
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,260
That's still too much. Never mind. Crap.

1093
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,340
Works on some people.

1094
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:34,180
I mean, I think you can get a scope of the full property if you look at it now.

1095
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:37,460
If you look at the satellite views now,

1096
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,580
the MGM Grand Hotel is very large.

1097
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,580
The Convention Center and the like

1098
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:47,540
70,000 seat arena is large.

1099
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,460
The pool complex is large.

1100
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:54,940
And then there's also a Topgolf and then the signature at MGM Grand,

1101
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,500
which is a series of condo towers.

1102
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,940
Is there the MGM Grand?

1103
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:00,940
Is that what you're talking about?

1104
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:01,740
Is that what you're talking about?

1105
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:02,300
Yeah.

1106
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,340
The MGM Grand Arena.

1107
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,620
Because that was like 16,000.

1108
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:05,860
16,000.

1109
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,820
So 70,000 is all I am.

1110
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,620
I just didn't know if there's a different one.

1111
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:10,380
No, no, no.

1112
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,500
I've seen wrestling.

1113
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,900
The place we go, there's wrestling shows, a lot of boxing, I feel like happens there.

1114
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,220
I just didn't know if there was a second place.

1115
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:18,860
I wasn't trying to shame you.

1116
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,060
That's OK.

1117
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,060
Often on this show, I am trying to shame you.

1118
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,180
But not in this instance.

1119
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:24,020
I was not trying to.

1120
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,700
I was just pulling off the dome.

1121
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,740
I was trying to remember.

1122
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,260
I just wanted to make sure we were talking about the same thing.

1123
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,140
I was pretty impressed.

1124
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,940
Wait, were you also pulling off the dome, Mike?

1125
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:31,900
Or did you look it up?

1126
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,780
I thought that it was under 20,000 and I looked it up.

1127
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:39,540
OK, so I it was off the dome, but I confirmed it off the dome before.

1128
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:41,260
Your gut was off the dome.

1129
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:43,180
It was you were going off the dome of your gut.

1130
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,460
That's correct. Yes.

1131
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,900
I OK, so tons of walking.

1132
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,020
It's massive. That's the thing.

1133
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:54,380
And then I asked my mom for memories of it and all she could.

1134
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:57,460
I think she was like the rides were fairly nondescript.

1135
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,300
And I probably skipped a bunch because I was still pretty little.

1136
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:03,460
And I only started going on theme park rides while I've known you guys.

1137
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:04,140
That's right.

1138
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,540
I mean, you know, the good high octane.

1139
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:10,940
Yeah, which they still did not have very much of kind of, I guess,

1140
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:16,060
a weird let's build a family park without lots to do for little kids.

1141
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:21,660
So the only thing my mom really remembered was the the opening

1142
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:26,460
like the like the cutting of the ribbon in the morning, she said, was it

1143
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:29,140
surprisingly grand ordeal?

1144
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:33,860
It was a it was a big old thing and just waves of characters kept coming out.

1145
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:35,820
So many real characters.

1146
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,100
She was shocked by the amount of characters.

1147
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,900
And it is sort of true if you if you get into it.

1148
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,620
And I like this part, you've seen Louie.

1149
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:44,220
Yeah.

1150
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:49,740
But here's a photo from my family that my mom took of Louie.

1151
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,220
Any feelings about Louie?

1152
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:56,300
I mean, he's very he's he's in the theme park host mode that we're

1153
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,180
familiar with with Mickey.

1154
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,900
He's a tux guy.

1155
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,300
And that's what lets you know he's in charge.

1156
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,220
He seems more wholesome than characters around that time.

1157
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:06,900
Like we've said before, mascot characters,

1158
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,740
oftentimes like a Chuck E.

1159
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:12,220
Cheese, you know, it feels like kind of they're like they present them as the

1160
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,020
owner and they're a little shady. Yeah.

1161
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:17,500
But he does seem a little more, I don't know, pure of heart.

1162
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:18,580
Well, here he is.

1163
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,300
Can't does he have a crown on?

1164
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,500
He does have a crown.

1165
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:26,180
OK, he's a benevolent king, a king in a tuxedo.

1166
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:27,580
Right.

1167
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,980
It's a funny blend now that I think I don't know if I've ever seen it out in the

1168
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:34,380
world, a real king in a tuxedo.

1169
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:38,340
Usually in something kind of fancier than a tuxedo.

1170
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:41,980
Maybe in the Princess Diaries, the royalty.

1171
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:44,300
That's like royalty in modern times.

1172
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,460
Charles was a tuxedo, right?

1173
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:47,420
Yeah. Charles.

1174
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:50,460
But even then, you still got kind of like, you know, it's not like that.

1175
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,820
Two dads.

1176
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,100
Yeah. Honors pins.

1177
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:53,980
Right.

1178
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,660
You know, the Southwest airline wings.

1179
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:58,940
Right. Yeah.

1180
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,820
Yeah. Here's well, here's a cartoon of him.

1181
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,260
This is from a map or something.

1182
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:03,580
And he looks I like him.

1183
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,420
I'm not I'm not creeped out by Louie.

1184
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,620
I like him. That doesn't seem like much of a bar.

1185
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,780
But, you know, there's a lot we all know.

1186
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,700
There's a lot of creepy theme park characters.

1187
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,020
Yeah, I like him.

1188
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,900
Yeah. And I like him here where he's holding

1189
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:22,180
a giant pocket watch with his own face in the in the face of the clock.

1190
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:25,980
I think the king might be like a nickname and it's like a jughead kind of crown.

1191
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,500
That could be it. Yeah.

1192
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,660
He's like a hipster of entertainment.

1193
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:34,620
He's a hipster that wears a suit, ironically, or a tuxedo, ironically.

1194
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,820
Yeah, he sort of Louie was the king.

1195
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,300
Louie is the original hipster.

1196
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,620
That's right. Yeah.

1197
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:42,500
Now, do you have the names of some of the other characters?

1198
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:43,860
I don't. They're pretty funny.

1199
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,260
Let's hear them.

1200
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,900
Louie Jr. Oh, I think that's a kid.

1201
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,060
I miss Louie Jr.

1202
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:51,580
Congrats on the I'm sorry.

1203
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:54,820
I should have congratulated Louie on on his prince sooner.

1204
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,140
Oh, my gosh. He is a kid.

1205
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:57,900
I think you have one kid.

1206
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:58,820
Well, yeah.

1207
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:02,700
And then I think there is a lady lion named Lucy.

1208
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,460
OK, is that his lady friend?

1209
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:08,860
I'm assuming they're a family that they're an item.

1210
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,460
OK, I found Louie Jr.

1211
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,660
gaming token from 1993.

1212
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:15,700
OK, so was Louie Jr. was on money?

1213
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:18,580
Was on like their currency, their arcade tokens.

1214
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,940
Yeah, kids are going to love them.

1215
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:23,260
You're going to want some Louie Jr. to take home.

1216
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:24,700
Is Louie Jr. cute?

1217
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,580
Maybe he's cute.

1218
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,860
Yeah, I think he's cute.

1219
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:30,860
It's kind of a weird drawing and I'm it's hard to see on a back of a token.

1220
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,700
It's here. I just found the mythology.

1221
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,820
It is Louie Jr. is Louie and Lucy's kid.

1222
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:40,220
But Louie and Lucy are siblings.

1223
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:41,700
Does that say that?

1224
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,300
Yeah, I was in the guy map.

1225
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,260
They wrote it.

1226
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,260
Yep. Right next to here's where the bathrooms are.

1227
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:47,980
Here's first aid.

1228
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,460
And just so you know, Louie and Lucy are siblings.

1229
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:56,060
That's the sort of horror that you would expect in like Apocalypse Now or something.

1230
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,700
But I insist

1231
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:00,900
that's what the horror is.

1232
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,500
There's a lot of he had to have sex with his sister.

1233
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:04,460
Seen stuff.

1234
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:07,100
There's a lot of unnerving stuff in Apocalypse Now.

1235
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:08,620
That's what must have been in the longer cut.

1236
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:13,180
Reminds me how it's in the French plantation scene in Apocalypse Now.

1237
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,660
OK. Oh, in the background, some brothers and sisters are doing it.

1238
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,660
That reminds me how I think like, look,

1239
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:23,020
their little treatment for the apocalypse now, right, seem pretty good.

1240
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:27,340
But what it could have used is because you're looking at it.

1241
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,820
There's no Kurtz. You're looking for Kurtz.

1242
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,220
Yeah. It's a point in the movie.

1243
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:38,580
So that's so at the end, it should be a 30 foot tall animatronic Kurtz.

1244
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:39,540
Oh, yeah.

1245
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:42,020
It's King Kong and he rocks your boat back.

1246
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:44,180
And he says the horror, the horror.

1247
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:47,620
And everyone cheers as he said the line.

1248
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,300
He's like the Yeti on Everest.

1249
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,380
Yeah. Yeah.

1250
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:51,140
OK. Yeah.

1251
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:56,580
And then he gives a giant Larry King a big kiss on the mouth

1252
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:58,860
to the boat.

1253
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:00,540
He kids. Yeah. OK.

1254
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:04,900
He kisses your boat as I'm going to kiss you like you, Larry King.

1255
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:09,380
It's the only thing that I remember about the last 20 years of Marlon Brando.

1256
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:14,020
Sure. I mean, it's at the forefront of most of our minds or our minds.

1257
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:17,140
Yeah. I mean, I also the thing I the other one I love about him is when there's

1258
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:23,860
that Michael Jackson tribute concert before 9-11, that like all the biggest stars

1259
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:25,940
are on this thing, it's insane.

1260
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:31,140
There's Liza Minnelli and Diana Ross and Whitney Houston in sync and Britney.

1261
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:34,100
But then Michael's friends, all these actors, they got to be part of it, too.

1262
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:37,220
So Elizabeth Taylor has to talk mildly incoherently.

1263
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,420
And then Marlon Brando has to talk really

1264
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:42,420
incoherently, so they just roll out.

1265
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:46,780
This is just suddenly a couch on the stage and he's sitting there in sunglasses.

1266
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:50,220
And he starts just muttering and most of you don't know what the muttering is.

1267
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:51,620
And the only part anybody could make

1268
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:57,060
out is like, you know, they're killing the chopping up kids with machetes.

1269
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:58,660
Where?

1270
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:02,940
Who is specifics on that Marlon?

1271
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:04,620
Can you put are you done?

1272
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:07,620
Can you bring out Usher now, please?

1273
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:12,580
I whatever I feel like I've seen that whole special, but I really don't remember

1274
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:15,900
Marlon Brando. That was not on the television version.

1275
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:18,860
OK, that makes a lot of sense.

1276
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:20,820
I've seen all of that show.

1277
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,780
Oh, yes, I've seen that many times.

1278
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:27,820
Because I like what happened with that special is like, OK, we filmed it great.

1279
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:30,300
Now to cut out all of the parts that are

1280
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:34,340
bizarre and not suitable for television like Marlon Brando ranting about

1281
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:40,100
machetes and now also to digitally touch up all the not all the performers, maybe

1282
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:44,860
certain performers for many, many months before this is suitable to be aired.

1283
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,180
Wow, I got to go home and where you watch this now.

1284
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:50,700
Check it out. Yeah, that's two thousand twenty years ago.

1285
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:51,940
Like retouches to.

1286
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,140
Yeah, I bet it.

1287
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,180
I bet you can tell that it doesn't hold up.

1288
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,700
Yeah, but it's no dial of destiny.

1289
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:58,500
Yeah.

1290
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:01,500
Because people have been to be getting touched up for the last so many years at

1291
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,500
movies, but I bet the technology is pretty good that we only have the technology then.

1292
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:07,500
Yeah, Elizabeth had at first.

1293
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:10,340
Sure. They used it on the Flintstones.

1294
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:13,460
The only way I do the film.

1295
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:19,380
Now I give it to you, Michael Marlon Brando in in a Michael Jackson music video.

1296
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:20,740
Right. Yeah, exactly.

1297
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,340
Same time, the same couple of months.

1298
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:23,140
Yeah. Yeah.

1299
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:24,340
My world.

1300
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:28,100
Yeah. He shows up suddenly and like

1301
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:31,860
he's like in a white suit and a bar and like Michael's.

1302
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:35,580
Who is in the car with Michael on 9-11?

1303
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:37,180
I think it was in a Marlon.

1304
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:41,220
Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando was one of them driving.

1305
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,060
Maybe.

1306
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:44,500
Which one of those three would you trust to drive?

1307
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,140
Oh, my God.

1308
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:49,140
Oh, what a question.

1309
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:50,540
Yes.

1310
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:52,260
I can't say Michael.

1311
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:54,260
There are so many pills.

1312
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:55,140
Yeah.

1313
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:56,260
No, God.

1314
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,100
Oh, that's a really good question.

1315
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,540
Oh, shit. I think I think we have to choose.

1316
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:01,820
Yeah, we have to choose.

1317
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:03,420
OK, we're not as good.

1318
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:05,340
We each can have our own choice.

1319
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:09,820
Elizabeth, I think Liz Taylor, I think that option either.

1320
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:10,740
But I bet.

1321
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:14,500
Yeah, I bet she for some reason was doing better with the pills than the other two.

1322
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:15,740
Yeah. And what's the story?

1323
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,300
They flee the city.

1324
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,940
They fled the city.

1325
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:20,220
I think so.

1326
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:22,460
Yeah, I think the three of them in a car together.

1327
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:23,060
Car.

1328
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:25,580
Someone should write that as a movie, probably.

1329
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:29,660
Well, there was some like was an attempt to make some TV version of it.

1330
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:32,580
And that's why I'm thinking of it like a

1331
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:38,100
white British actor plays Michael Jackson and says he regrets it to this.

1332
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,860
Is it Joseph Fiennes?

1333
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:41,340
It's like a major actor.

1334
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:44,500
And Brian Cox, I think, is Marlon Brando.

1335
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,140
Oh, yeah. Here's a there's a people.

1336
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:49,300
Elizabeth Taylor, Michael Jackson, Marlon Brando's rumored 9-11 road trip.

1337
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,580
The truth behind the myth.

1338
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:54,980
Michael, we're going to have to repopulate the earth.

1339
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,100
I think that's the start of the apocalypse.

1340
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,900
I would know I was in apocalypse now.

1341
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:01,100
This is the apocalypse now.

1342
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:06,300
So you and I are both going to have to take turns with Liz repopulating.

1343
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,300
I'm at the taxicote.

1344
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,140
You want corn nuts or combos?

1345
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,820
This says this never happened.

1346
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:14,740
This people article.

1347
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:17,460
I mean, that's probably probably.

1348
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:19,940
It sounds too fun and silly.

1349
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:23,020
It says Elizabeth was in New York with Debbie Reynolds.

1350
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:25,420
She did not get in the car.

1351
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:27,340
She didn't run.

1352
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:30,620
There's only one way to get away from the Twin Towers.

1353
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,220
We have to we all three of us have to get in a car right now.

1354
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:37,100
All right. So we interrupted a list of sorry.

1355
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,820
Yeah.

1356
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:40,020
I will look.

1357
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:47,340
Let me just throw out this one that here's here's a pretty good photo of me

1358
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:51,220
and my sister, and here's us hanging out with Bluto.

1359
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:52,660
Oh, wait, Bluto or Bruto.

1360
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:53,140
What is these?

1361
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:55,700
Bluto. It's Bluto.

1362
01:06:56,020 --> 01:07:00,860
Because this was one of the many theme parks from over the years where you could

1363
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:07,020
meet the Popeye gang, another place to get some quality time with our pals.

1364
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:11,500
And it's a good thing that this we don't know what kind of lockdown they had on

1365
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:15,500
the rights because if this place hadn't closed so quick,

1366
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:19,460
maybe your beloved Islands of Adventure couldn't have built your beloved build

1367
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:26,140
rat barges, build barges, one of the wettest water huts maybe in the world.

1368
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:28,060
Popeye getting soaked.

1369
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:30,620
Oh, yeah. You get drenched, drenched on that.

1370
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:32,020
And Dudley do right.

1371
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:34,140
Yeah. They take no prisoners.

1372
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:34,540
Yeah.

1373
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:35,420
We talk about that.

1374
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:37,820
But yeah, they had Popeye do it.

1375
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:39,660
There's so few photos.

1376
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,660
Is there was there like an olive oil walk around?

1377
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:43,180
Was it just Popeye and Bluto?

1378
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:48,260
There was olive oil and they're like, I guess you would say for character.

1379
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:49,820
They're not face characters.

1380
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:52,620
You should call them for characters.

1381
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:56,620
The turns face characters are for characters like.

1382
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,540
So would you call these for characters?

1383
01:07:58,660 --> 01:07:59,820
That's what I was trying to figure out.

1384
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:02,100
We ever said that on the shows, God.

1385
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,220
I don't think so.

1386
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:03,540
Yeah.

1387
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:05,020
Like Peter Pan.

1388
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:05,940
I know what you're talking about.

1389
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:08,820
A face character that we've never used before.

1390
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:11,180
It is strange when it's not an animal.

1391
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:11,820
Yeah.

1392
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:12,860
That's what I was trying.

1393
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:14,340
I was thinking about this.

1394
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,460
I was like, would you call these for characters?

1395
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:18,460
They're just big, puffy human.

1396
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:21,380
Carl from up is a fur character.

1397
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:22,340
Yeah.

1398
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:25,180
That starts to feel very skin is furry.

1399
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:28,140
If you were to touch it, Edna mode is a fur character.

1400
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:31,420
There's some that are both sometimes.

1401
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:34,020
Like, I'm trying to think.

1402
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:41,020
There has been the good fairy or the fairy godmother.

1403
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:42,380
She's the fairy godmother.

1404
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:42,900
Right.

1405
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:45,660
Sometimes she's a human face and sometimes he's a for character.

1406
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:49,340
Horrifying like strangers kind of mask.

1407
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:49,700
Yeah.

1408
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:51,260
But that's for character.

1409
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:55,860
I need further information.

1410
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:57,740
You need to know what the mask is made of.

1411
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:01,940
Well, now I need to know if there is a further information is the

1412
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:04,860
further information for character enthusiasts.

1413
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:05,220
Yeah.

1414
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:09,100
Well, that's the polite way of saying furry.

1415
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:09,500
Yeah.

1416
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,580
Not that it has to be a polite way, but I'm just saying.

1417
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,380
I mean, one of the most fascinating

1418
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:17,980
juxtapositions is the the short lived Islands of Adventure show,

1419
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:24,260
the cartoon circus show that was in that giant theater, amphitheater in like

1420
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:31,940
Intune Lagoon, and it was half like Dagwood and Blondie are face characters

1421
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:36,580
with like weird grotesque stuff on them, and then there's like Rocky and Bullwinkle

1422
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:42,620
too, and it's all kind of set up in a way that it's like, oh, it is certain.

1423
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:48,540
People are doing nice throwing and like unicycle acts and stuff.

1424
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:52,100
I well, I hope it's the face characters.

1425
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:53,140
Yeah. Yeah.

1426
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:53,820
Yeah.

1427
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:57,980
Well, the fur characters, if you miss a knife, it like gets caught.

1428
01:09:58,180 --> 01:09:58,980
You know? Oh, yes.

1429
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:01,860
True. Yeah. There's more protection.

1430
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:05,860
So and they know Dagwood rock.

1431
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:07,540
OK.

1432
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:08,340
I saw.

1433
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:09,460
Yeah, there's all my fun.

1434
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:10,180
Oh, sorry.

1435
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:14,060
The song is the circus is coming to tune.

1436
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:16,460
I love what I love.

1437
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:21,900
Video, video, this which I love, but I call me crazy.

1438
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:22,900
I love it.

1439
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:23,860
It's coming to tune.

1440
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:27,340
You remember saying it in 1999 going, what?

1441
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:30,900
What is what's going on?

1442
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:34,780
I have a photo of them in the holiday mode as well.

1443
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:40,300
You ever wanted to know what Popeye looked like dressed up like Santa?

1444
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:41,580
I would like to know that.

1445
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:44,860
Now, you know, wonder no longer.

1446
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:47,180
This is a big day.

1447
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:53,220
The so you can meet the Popeye gang and you don't have to go all the way to Malta to do it.

1448
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:58,180
And then here's this in keeping with what my mom was saying that the characters just

1449
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:02,300
keep coming here now, we're at a location called the Tumbleweed Hotel.

1450
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,860
Must be like an old West area.

1451
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:09,140
And then here's a bunch of characters and they all look like giant babies with

1452
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:15,540
single teeth and like they're they're they're cowboys and different, you know,

1453
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,940
marms, whatever you want to call it.

1454
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,260
And I'm like, these look really specific.

1455
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:24,980
It seems weird that they would be just completely invented for MGM Grand

1456
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:35,180
Adventures, but no, in fact, these are from an old comic strip called Tumbleweed.

1457
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:39,220
Does anyone know that name is familiar, but I know nothing past that.

1458
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,420
This is again now.

1459
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:47,180
And again, we're in the upper echelon of podcasters who know about really obscure,

1460
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:50,780
unpleasant comic strips that started in the 60s.

1461
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:52,740
And that's what this is.

1462
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:55,860
Too recent, too recent.

1463
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:59,500
I don't get in on any of that hippie shit.

1464
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:02,260
I check the date my comics were started.

1465
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:05,540
If it's pre-depression, I'm in.

1466
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:07,220
I have seen these.

1467
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:08,740
I have seen Tumbleweed.

1468
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:10,300
I have seen Tumbleweed as well.

1469
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,580
I've never read a single strip, though.

1470
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:16,540
I don't know anything about the thought of seeing them in like puffy costumes

1471
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,700
in three dimensions is very weird.

1472
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:25,260
I don't want to see a fur character of Tumbleweed or of sorry, I've not vetted

1473
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:27,300
this description epic.

1474
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,900
That's the name epic.

1475
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:36,660
Tumbleweed's toothless alcoholic plug chewing sway back second horse once a US

1476
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:40,620
cavalry horse, but now but drummed out of the service.

1477
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:43,420
So, hey, kids, come to Las Vegas.

1478
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:47,060
Your dad's going to gamble today, but you get to meet epic.

1479
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:51,380
A drunk horse was drummed out of the core.

1480
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:54,180
The leaving Las Vegas.

1481
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:58,700
There seems to be some.

1482
01:12:58,700 --> 01:12:59,980
I'm going to see at this point.

1483
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:01,460
There seems to be some stuff that's aged

1484
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:06,260
poorly in tumbleweeds from the quick glance at it in the old west.

1485
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,100
You're sorry.

1486
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:07,540
Yeah.

1487
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:09,660
But the horse that drunk horse sounds good.

1488
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:10,940
Are you saying anyone in this?

1489
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:15,740
Why is anyone in this photo that my mom took in 1994 age poorly?

1490
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:17,060
I'd have to look a little closer.

1491
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,740
Any poor cultural depictions?

1492
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:21,860
No, maybe a quick look

1493
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:22,860
for tumbleweed.

1494
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:25,620
So Tumbleweed ended in 2007.

1495
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:26,500
Geez.

1496
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:27,100
Wow.

1497
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,700
Just there in plain sight.

1498
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,060
Everyone passing it.

1499
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:30,940
All of us.

1500
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:32,500
You guys like the funnies.

1501
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:33,700
Aaron likes the funny.

1502
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:38,660
She's like, I have just passed tumbleweed for year after year.

1503
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:39,620
No interest.

1504
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:41,300
Fifty years of tumbleweed.

1505
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,460
Fifty years.

1506
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:46,940
Maybe it was just too close in the lineup under Prince Valiant.

1507
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:48,620
I just skipped over the whole.

1508
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:49,460
Yes.

1509
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:54,460
Was this did this rip off F troop or did F troop rip off this?

1510
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,300
What year did F troop come out?

1511
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:02,260
I think F troop may have sailed along without any awareness of tumbleweeds.

1512
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:03,180
They're the same.

1513
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:06,420
I think it is never even knew about it.

1514
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:08,420
They come out the same year.

1515
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:09,300
Oh, my God.

1516
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:10,260
Wow.

1517
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:12,380
This is a job for me.

1518
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:18,540
This is a little project for me to figure out if F troop and tumbleweeds had any

1519
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:20,420
connection holding your daughter.

1520
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:25,460
If you're a listener who might not know what F troop is, it was a sitcom in the 60s.

1521
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:26,620
1965.

1522
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:31,020
I know it. I watched it growing up a little, but I couldn't produce one character name.

1523
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:31,660
I couldn't.

1524
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:33,180
Corporal Agar.

1525
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:37,780
I think was Larry Storch, who just passed away at 99 a couple of months ago.

1526
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:39,460
Not a PT or kill him.

1527
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:42,180
I think I brought Larry Storch up recently.

1528
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:43,540
I wouldn't put it past you.

1529
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:44,540
Yeah.

1530
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:49,460
I apologize to the Storch estate, the Storch family, if I brought him up and he died.

1531
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:52,460
And F troop is not Hogan's heroes.

1532
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:54,140
One is of course.

1533
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:55,940
One is the Wild West.

1534
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:57,540
Hogan's heroes more popular.

1535
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:58,860
Much more popular.

1536
01:14:59,060 --> 01:14:59,900
Yeah.

1537
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:06,460
In terms of characters, though, I did see footage, some of the preserved footage of

1538
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:09,180
like the characters coming out.

1539
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:14,500
First off, the characters were led by like a team of employees and khakis and very

1540
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:16,420
loud windbreakers. Great.

1541
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:20,740
And then I think there was an announcement of the characters of like King Louis,

1542
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:24,740
Louis Jr., Lucy, Wacky Wolf.

1543
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:27,380
And I really couldn't find much about Wacky Wolf.

1544
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:33,540
If you want to talk generic, it just was a very generic wolf in like a polo or

1545
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:36,220
something and itchy and scratchy and friends.

1546
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:37,780
They had to invent some friends.

1547
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,060
Yeah.

1548
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:40,340
Manic mailman.

1549
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:43,300
And then it was Popeye, Olive Oil and Bluto.

1550
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:50,220
And then it cut to the windbreaker like dance like the windbreaker employees were

1551
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:57,100
like all dancing, like not super choreographed dancing either.

1552
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:03,020
Yeah, there's also I got some purple dinosaurs here.

1553
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:05,100
I don't know what they are.

1554
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:09,340
They not Barney, more of a brontosaurus.

1555
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:14,180
No, no, they didn't have the Flintstones because you would have seen the Flintstones.

1556
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:14,820
Yeah.

1557
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:19,060
But there's a couple of things in this you can see in the background, just very

1558
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:22,540
clearly the MGM Grand Parking Garage.

1559
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:25,340
So, you know, sight lines.

1560
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:26,860
Oh, sight line, Oliver.

1561
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:27,580
Yeah.

1562
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:33,020
But then I just noticed this right now is that there's a hanging sign for a wedding

1563
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:39,580
chapel. I think you could get married in this lame theme park.

1564
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:42,140
I guess I didn't come across that.

1565
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:43,340
Oh, wait, here it is.

1566
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:45,700
This is from an article from around the time.

1567
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:51,140
A section of the park designed to resemble New York has no muggers.

1568
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:55,100
OK, but it does include two express

1569
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:59,420
wedding to two to two wedding chapels.

1570
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:00,420
There's very few.

1571
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:02,980
They have the same amount of rides and wedding chapels.

1572
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:08,180
The demand was going to be so high that they needed to be prepared.

1573
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:09,420
It's like Tower of Terror.

1574
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:13,260
If you load on two different levels, you get done that much.

1575
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:14,460
Yeah, crank through.

1576
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:17,180
Yeah, get that wedding line down.

1577
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:23,060
There is also an old English village street with a not so quaint Burger King.

1578
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:26,300
There is just a Burger King in Old England.

1579
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:30,340
And and and you know, well, what else was in Old England?

1580
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:31,980
Rides or attractions?

1581
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:33,900
Answer No.

1582
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,820
Well, welcome to Old England.

1583
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:40,100
Hey, while you're here, check out Burger King and then get the fuck out.

1584
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:46,660
I saw a group of performers in the Old English section, just a little shortest

1585
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:50,620
little clip, and they were, of course, singing

1586
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:55,260
Consider Yourself from Oliver Oliver.

1587
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:58,700
British, you know, Oliver Twist, you know.

1588
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:01,380
Have I have I mentioned

1589
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:05,420
that I played that in the marching band in high school?

1590
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:09,820
OK, yeah, that seems like a good director, because our director would intro everything

1591
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:13,340
and he would say the band, the Shamrock High School band would like you to consider

1592
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:16,620
yourself one of us and then we'd be

1593
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:23,060
and in hindsight, it's just a funny like during a football game, like everyone's

1594
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:26,300
going to be like, hell, yeah, consider yourself.

1595
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,580
Wow.

1596
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:31,660
I thought I thought I was cool because I'm on the football team.

1597
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:35,260
But now I know today I'm one of the marching band.

1598
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:42,580
Yeah, that could be me playing the off key to man be as cool as the artful Dodger

1599
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:44,140
himself.

1600
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:48,780
It's where I developed my play philosophy.

1601
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:50,860
I try to play like the artful Dodger,

1602
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:55,140
duck and weave like he through the streets of London.

1603
01:18:55,740 --> 01:19:00,900
The opposing team is that mean Bill Sykes coming for me.

1604
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,060
It I've said this before, too, though,

1605
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:07,780
the next the next year or the year after that we did we had an all sticks show,

1606
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:09,300
though.

1607
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,900
God, how many are there?

1608
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:15,700
What do you mean? Songs? Yeah, we did three or four.

1609
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:17,660
OK, too much time on my hands.

1610
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:20,900
Mr. Roboto and I was ambitious.

1611
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:22,260
That's like a sweet.

1612
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:23,620
We did all thing.

1613
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:25,380
I'm trying to think what else? What are the hits?

1614
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:27,100
What? I can't think of the third.

1615
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:29,100
They're all sweets. Come sail away.

1616
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:30,020
We did come sail away.

1617
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:32,740
We did not do sweet man of blue.

1618
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:37,060
So a lot of changes, like a lot of like, yeah, sweets like you're saying.

1619
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:40,340
I got to go through my trumpet case, see if I have the old sheet music for it.

1620
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:42,180
You got your trumpet is out of here with you.

1621
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:43,860
Yeah, my parents moved out of here.

1622
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:44,580
All my shit's here.

1623
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:45,900
Yeah, sorry.

1624
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:50,740
Do you really need to go through your old trumpet case and get the old?

1625
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:52,820
What's going to then what will happen?

1626
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:56,940
I have then I'll know for sure what it was and I'll know the arrangements and I'll

1627
01:19:56,940 --> 01:20:00,220
know what like the truncated versions of the song you could start playing stuff.

1628
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,340
You could start playing solo sticks.

1629
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:04,700
Well, I've shows in full disclosure.

1630
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:08,460
I just bought a new mouthpiece and some new tuning grease.

1631
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:10,700
And because I haven't played a trumpet.

1632
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:13,180
What? Really? I haven't played trumpet many years.

1633
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:15,780
I play guitar and everything, but I haven't played trumpet.

1634
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:17,900
Well, I'm like, you know what? I can play this.

1635
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:18,540
I know how to play.

1636
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,900
You can start playing taps to wake up your daughter.

1637
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,820
That's right. There'll be taps and patriotic.

1638
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:24,860
Yeah.

1639
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:27,740
Finally, she'll understand

1640
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:29,100
my patriotism.

1641
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:30,460
Well, she's going to grow up in an era

1642
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:33,260
laden with AI and the challenges that come from that.

1643
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:36,420
What better way to teach her all about it than with Mr.

1644
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:38,100
Roboto? That's right.

1645
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:40,460
Dennis DeYoung was way ahead of this whole trend.

1646
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:44,140
And when you play an instrumental of that song,

1647
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:49,140
a trumpet, she needs to know a blaring trumpet bass from an old from a like

1648
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:55,780
student level trumpet from purchased in nineteen ninety five missing a couple.

1649
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,580
I've played it since fifth grade.

1650
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:59,220
A couple of buttons. What do you call them?

1651
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:00,260
What do you call the things you press?

1652
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:03,100
Valves, valves, fifth grade.

1653
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,420
I think I had it since.

1654
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,140
So it's an old ass.

1655
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:10,180
I don't want to disclose my age at this point, but

1656
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:11,940
it's 30 years old.

1657
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:13,460
It's less than 30. But yeah.

1658
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:14,660
So anyway, I'm getting there.

1659
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:16,380
They're like, wait, I thought Mike was a teen.

1660
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:17,540
I know. I know.

1661
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:20,060
Cool. And knows about all the teen stuff from topic.

1662
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:21,580
You're telling me he's north of 30.

1663
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:22,820
Yeah, I'm north of.

1664
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,980
Let's just call it there. I'm north of 30.

1665
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:26,860
Yeah. Believe it or not.

1666
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:31,100
So, yeah, I'll I'll update everybody on my trumpet.

1667
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:32,260
Yeah.

1668
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:34,380
You're making a promise for the show.

1669
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,860
Yeah. For one of these shows.

1670
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:39,700
Oh, you had a Kenny Rogers Roasters in there also.

1671
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:40,900
And those were that was new.

1672
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:45,380
I think a lot of people's first experience with Kenny was at this park.

1673
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:50,180
Actually, I found a Reddit thread and people were talking about their memories.

1674
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:53,900
And someone said, I don't have a lot of memories of the rides,

1675
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:57,580
but I remember eating at Kenny Rogers Roasters.

1676
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,660
That's like the most popular IP there at that point.

1677
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:02,100
Kenny Rogers IP.

1678
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:04,100
I think so. Yeah, because they got no movie.

1679
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:05,580
They didn't end up with Apocalypse Now.

1680
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:08,420
And they didn't like, you know, on the Club Three,

1681
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:13,540
we're going to talk about this Wizard of Oz walkthrough that was in the casino

1682
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:18,940
and not the theme park. The theme park is bereft of anything of that nature.

1683
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:22,260
There's no I couldn't tell you what's in the MGM library exactly.

1684
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:26,660
But, you know, you associate MGM Grand with Wizard of Oz.

1685
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:29,900
And that's why it's the color, the emerald.

1686
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:32,020
And but none of that is reflected in the park,

1687
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:35,540
which maybe that is due to the Disney licensing stuff.

1688
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:37,100
Right. But it is.

1689
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:41,820
Yeah. All you get, you get Kenny Rogers and you get Popeye.

1690
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:43,340
Yeah.

1691
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:45,380
It's yeah, I don't know.

1692
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:48,580
If you're coming to meet your friends, you're not going to meet a lot of friends.

1693
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:49,660
There should have been a gamble.

1694
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:52,260
The Gambler ride or something. We're in Vegas.

1695
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:53,700
It's this big song. Yeah.

1696
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:55,860
Yeah. Jason was excited.

1697
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:57,220
He's been the whole show.

1698
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:58,580
Yeah.

1699
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:01,380
Well, there seems like I was going to say the,

1700
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:07,020
you know, to to allude to the club, the Wizard of Oz animatronics in that walk

1701
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:11,620
through look pretty good. The animatronics in the theme park.

1702
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,660
There's like two or three in the Backlot River.

1703
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:17,020
You got an off brand Creech Friend Black

1704
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:20,540
Lagoon, you have a helicopter gunner shooting at you.

1705
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:24,700
And then you have a squirrely crew member at the very end of the ride.

1706
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:25,900
What is that about?

1707
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:27,740
I mean, guy with a broom.

1708
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:33,020
So in the pitch document, the apocalypse now, it does mention a crew guy with a

1709
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:36,220
cigarette hanging out of his mouth at the end of the ride.

1710
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:38,980
They I think they just gave him a bushy mustache.

1711
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:41,020
Yeah, that's strange.

1712
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:46,060
They they also refer to this did not make it into the ride.

1713
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:54,860
But they say like and suddenly around the boat, you know, animatronics,

1714
01:23:55,180 --> 01:24:01,940
special forces, Navy SEALs come out of the water with their M16s pointed at you

1715
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:04,660
in wetsuits and blackface on.

1716
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:07,460
And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't know if they call it that.

1717
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:09,620
I don't know. That's the official name.

1718
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:14,540
Paint has to be like an official military term like paint.

1719
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:16,300
Yeah. Dark gray paint.

1720
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,260
I think they mean camouflage paint.

1721
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:20,060
But like, oh, I don't I don't know.

1722
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:22,500
That's I think do another pass on that.

1723
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:24,220
You know, I don't know.

1724
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:30,260
I loved the ride or a bunch of people in blackface pointed military weapons at your

1725
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:35,820
boat and then later on a different guy in a helicopter shoots at your boat.

1726
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:39,900
Ladies and gentlemen, the most canceled ride

1727
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:41,980
no, didn't have that nor did.

1728
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:45,980
Yeah. How many how are they going to get all those characters popping out of the water?

1729
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:52,260
That's crazy. Well, this is a good way to maybe segue into a ride called Grand

1730
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:54,860
Canyon Rapids. They had a rapid ride.

1731
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:56,020
I don't remember if I did this.

1732
01:24:56,020 --> 01:25:00,220
This might have been my first rapid ride or that or it was a Hershey Park a couple

1733
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:02,060
of years later.

1734
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:05,780
But Disney didn't have these yet.

1735
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:08,340
You know, this this was still I guess regional parks did.

1736
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:10,340
But Rapids Reds were still new a little bit.

1737
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:14,700
And I'm going to give them a little credit on this one because there were

1738
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:18,780
animatronics, though, so so many.

1739
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:25,460
And I discovered this was the very first big professional gig of Garner Holt's

1740
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:28,140
frequent presence on the show.

1741
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:32,620
Now Disney stuff has done things, great animatronics everywhere.

1742
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:33,900
All the not stuff that we like.

1743
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:43,540
And evidently he he came out of just insanely complex haunts and mazes.

1744
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:45,220
That's what kicked off his career.

1745
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:51,460
And somebody part of this saw his work there and said, hey, do you want a shot?

1746
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:52,620
Yes, I do.

1747
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:53,580
This is the big time.

1748
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:54,900
This is what I've been waiting for.

1749
01:25:55,100 --> 01:26:00,220
Then he saw the scope of it and the budget that he was allotted and thought,

1750
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:04,020
if I don't make this work, this might be it for me.

1751
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:09,420
Actually, I think this was an extremely stressful endeavor for Garner Holt.

1752
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:11,700
But he thought this is the way to get his foot in the door.

1753
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:12,940
And it worked out.

1754
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:14,620
Yeah, this was a big success.

1755
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:17,540
And kicked off a really amazing animatronic career.

1756
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:23,660
I would love to know a very detailed version of how you get that together.

1757
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:25,620
Like you're like, but a humble robot

1758
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:29,180
maker, and then all of a sudden you get contracted to do a really big project.

1759
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:31,100
And then it's like, oh, shit.

1760
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:32,540
Like, how do you pull it together?

1761
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:36,260
Like that's a whole podcast, probably in and of itself talking to him.

1762
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:38,780
We should probably we should pursue a Garner Holt.

1763
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:42,220
That was something that was maybe going to happen before the pandemic.

1764
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:43,380
We have picked up again.

1765
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:44,660
Yeah.

1766
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:46,420
But

1767
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:49,700
he claimed now, like

1768
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:50,980
according to Mr.

1769
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:53,500
Holt, he swears this ride was actually pretty good.

1770
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:55,500
He's proud of his work on it.

1771
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:57,460
I found some photos.

1772
01:26:57,580 --> 01:27:00,140
Some of the info on this came from there's a website.

1773
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,820
You guys may have found it for other stuff.

1774
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:03,460
That's not called theme park university.

1775
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:04,060
Yeah.

1776
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:05,860
But I think it's not around anymore.

1777
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:10,140
Yeah, I was trying to find a placeholder website.

1778
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:11,980
Now I think you have to go to Internet Archive.

1779
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:14,460
You got archive.org it.

1780
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:17,060
They have a bunch of like a big extensive

1781
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:19,460
articles about a lot of these rides and some pictures.

1782
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:24,700
Yeah, like an old prospector guy and is like in his red pajamas and bathhouse.

1783
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,580
He's got some character, right?

1784
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:27,820
Yeah, this is pretty good.

1785
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:33,380
And then just kind of I don't know what this this this shape is just man one JPEG.

1786
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:36,620
Here's kind of somewhat off putting, but well done.

1787
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:37,700
Just bald guy.

1788
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:38,140
I don't know.

1789
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:40,020
Was he working on the railroad?

1790
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:40,900
Is he a butcher?

1791
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:41,860
I don't know what he is.

1792
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:44,020
Dick Tracy villain ask face.

1793
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:46,140
I'm not saying he's a bad, but he seems nicer.

1794
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:46,940
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

1795
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:48,060
It's kind of just like, yeah, I don't know.

1796
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:49,060
He's got a big chin.

1797
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:50,220
I ain't so bad.

1798
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:51,340
Yeah.

1799
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:56,540
But this is Darren's recollection, too, because she went to this park and it was

1800
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:58,220
it was still open when she went.

1801
01:27:58,420 --> 01:27:59,780
She's that's the one she'll say.

1802
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:00,660
Rapid's OK.

1803
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:01,740
Rapid's not so bad.

1804
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:03,500
Fourteen characters.

1805
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:08,780
Garner made most of the props to big dynamite explosion ending like what ended

1806
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:09,860
up in Big Thunder.

1807
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:14,780
Keep in mind also Disney, a couple of years later, opens

1808
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:17,620
Grizzly River Rapids, no animatronics on that.

1809
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:21,860
Still not probably better like environments in that thing.

1810
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:24,460
Yeah, I give him credit for I don't know

1811
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:30,180
that it was common or still is common to have animatronics on Rapids ride.

1812
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:35,300
So maybe this this might be the one zone where I say Grand Adventures did it right.

1813
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:41,300
Well, the one that I think of is the one at Nautz they redid in that Garner whole

1814
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,940
production was involved in redoing.

1815
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:44,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1816
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:46,780
Which is so that's that's nice.

1817
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:49,020
It's a throwback to this little charming thing.

1818
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:54,620
I'm also I would like to shout out the place that you mentioned, Jason,

1819
01:28:54,820 --> 01:29:01,100
are in our creative that did that mock up of the Apocalypse Now concept.

1820
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:04,060
They were involved in two of the ones we've

1821
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:07,820
mentioned already, Backlot River Ride and Grand Canyon Rapids and one we should

1822
01:29:08,020 --> 01:29:10,260
maybe head into called Deep Earth Explorations.

1823
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:14,620
And I think they're pretty responsible for the the environments,

1824
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:18,460
which, you know, on a budget, pretty well done, I'd say.

1825
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:20,820
And I realized this I was on their website.

1826
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:25,820
They are behind a ton of things that I have mentioned in the last month.

1827
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:31,380
Those that I've been very charmed by those being the pirate mini golf at Santa Cruz

1828
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:32,500
Beach, for a while.

1829
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:33,700
I recommend this again.

1830
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:34,860
Really good mini golf.

1831
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:38,340
They did the rides up their haunted castle and cave train.

1832
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:43,980
And at Gilroy Gardens on the second gate, I was going on and on about a couple of

1833
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:48,660
rides, the round boats and the 20s slash 50s car track.

1834
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:50,340
That's way better than Autopia.

1835
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:52,460
Right. This place did those.

1836
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:57,100
And the animatronic show that I didn't get to sing were all that I didn't get to see

1837
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:00,500
where all of the fruits and vegetables sing Salads USA.

1838
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:02,300
Oh, man. Now I know where it came from.

1839
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:03,860
It came from this this little place.

1840
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:10,020
So they've done a lot of these kind of good non Disney, non universal ties together

1841
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:11,820
a bunch of really recent history.

1842
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:14,380
So I'm all for R&R.

1843
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:15,460
Do you have it in front of you?

1844
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:18,980
Do you know what's the newest thing they've done or does it list anything chronologically?

1845
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:20,820
It's a pretty ancient website.

1846
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:26,060
Yeah, I didn't tell them they were still around.

1847
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:27,540
Yeah.

1848
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:28,740
Maybe you don't.

1849
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:31,940
In this line of work, maybe the websites don't have to be.

1850
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:32,980
That's maybe right.

1851
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:34,940
I did the website.

1852
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:37,260
I feel like said founded in 1981.

1853
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:39,060
We've been doing this for 30 years.

1854
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:43,780
And I was like, well, that would put us to 2011.

1855
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:44,660
Is that right?

1856
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:45,740
So maybe not.

1857
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:47,740
So I don't know.

1858
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:48,860
I the contact.

1859
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:50,500
There were no social media links.

1860
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:54,300
It was just a contact form.

1861
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:55,740
You want to talk a little bit.

1862
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:57,460
Deep Earth Exploration.

1863
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:58,580
Yeah, the one that they worked on.

1864
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:04,860
And now this it's kind of impossible to tell if this one you might also give the nod.

1865
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:08,300
They actually did OK on it because there's not a video.

1866
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,660
I don't think there are some photos.

1867
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:14,500
I think a lot of these probably it's just it's a level of darkness that an old

1868
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:17,260
camcorder is not going to be able to pick up.

1869
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:18,940
So they're kind of lost to time.

1870
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:21,540
But this one sounds interesting.

1871
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:23,460
I have no idea if they pulled it off,

1872
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:32,260
but it's described as sort of a proto Spider-Man slash Indy in that it's a

1873
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:35,740
simulator car on a track.

1874
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:40,180
So you're moving from room to room and the vehicle is doing the stuff,

1875
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:44,900
simulating motion that the track is not actually capable of.

1876
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:52,260
So maybe, I mean, if they got to that mechanism first and did it OK,

1877
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:54,740
yeah, you got to give them credit for that.

1878
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:56,740
But I don't know. It may have sucked.

1879
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:57,740
It may have sucked.

1880
01:31:57,940 --> 01:32:01,900
We have to get like the people like like your Tony Baxter's.

1881
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:05,660
The world seemed to have gone to all these places when they opened and stuff.

1882
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:07,980
Like he's talked about Star Trek experience and stuff.

1883
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:13,380
So I would love to like talk to people who like the pros who remember it and be

1884
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:15,020
like, oh, yeah, that was actually really good.

1885
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:17,180
Or we stole some idea from that or something.

1886
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:18,580
Yeah, it's possible.

1887
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:19,140
You never know.

1888
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:25,460
It's also a ride where you go deep down into the earth and find crazy stuff down

1889
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:30,660
there and that not too long gets done at Tokyo Disney Sea, the rising ride journey

1890
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:31,500
to the center of the earth.

1891
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:33,780
So they got to deep earth first.

1892
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:36,580
They got to simulators first.

1893
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:42,100
The thing that makes me skeptical is that I think like, OK, and we're up and running.

1894
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:44,140
Yeah, let's get these cars out there.

1895
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:47,420
And then it was basically that like

1896
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:52,300
windows open and close, kind of like that's the web slingers now.

1897
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:56,060
So some of the gaps would be filled in with you.

1898
01:32:56,060 --> 01:32:57,340
Now you watch your screen.

1899
01:32:57,340 --> 01:32:59,100
And this is what in theory you're right.

1900
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:02,820
We're showing you like exteriors kind of before you're somewhere.

1901
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:03,620
Yeah, I think so.

1902
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:07,260
Or like maybe now we go to a model and that's something that the right where the

1903
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:08,740
ride couldn't take you and then the window.

1904
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:09,020
Right.

1905
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:11,300
So now we're looking at a bunch of magma or whatever.

1906
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:11,620
Right.

1907
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:17,820
But apparently that video was a laser disc player and it had to get moved out

1908
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:21,140
of the cabin because the all the motion made it skip.

1909
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:22,700
Oh, no.

1910
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:27,820
They may have victimized this ride a little bit bad.

1911
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:29,740
I don't know, but it sounds kind of good.

1912
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:30,340
I don't know.

1913
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:34,260
You see crazy creatures and rock slides and gorgeous.

1914
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:39,460
This at least would sound like it has enough stuff to have been memorable either

1915
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:41,220
way, if that makes sense.

1916
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:42,060
Yeah. Yeah.

1917
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:45,060
It's not just like, oh, it was like if it was if it was bad,

1918
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:47,060
I bet it was kind of interesting and bad.

1919
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:48,780
Or if it was good, it was good.

1920
01:33:48,980 --> 01:33:49,340
Yeah.

1921
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:51,740
I know it sounds like an interesting ride system for the time.

1922
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:54,380
Sounds like there was a lot of show scenes.

1923
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:59,700
So I guess I'm just I'm giving it credit for if we could see it, we would talk about it.

1924
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:01,220
Yeah, I think so.

1925
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:03,780
Yes. But it's just a mystery now.

1926
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:09,660
Just like if Tumbleweed and F Troop were better enemies.

1927
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:10,340
Right. Yeah.

1928
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:11,780
One of life's great mysteries.

1929
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:12,180
Right.

1930
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:15,820
We'll have to really put some time in to find that answer.

1931
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:17,500
So there's that.

1932
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:19,740
What are big ones that we've not?

1933
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:22,580
Well, the King Louis Theater,

1934
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:26,380
that I saw something in the King, assuming that the King Louis Theater.

1935
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:27,740
Wait a minute. I don't know.

1936
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:30,980
I don't know, because there was also

1937
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:34,460
there was another name for a theater that I saw.

1938
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:35,540
Wait, let me find my show.

1939
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:39,300
King Louis Theater gets renamed to Manhattan Theater at some point.

1940
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:42,820
You're talking about that you're in the movies or the Gold Rush Theater.

1941
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:43,540
I see.

1942
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:47,380
I don't what I saw was in the Magic Screen Theater.

1943
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:48,860
So maybe that's different.

1944
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:52,500
Wait, do we have OK, let's let's start with the one you mentioned.

1945
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:54,340
That is a different entity.

1946
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:56,580
I think I think there were like three theater.

1947
01:34:56,580 --> 01:34:57,500
Well, that's pretty good.

1948
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:59,580
You know, I hear later Manhattan Theater.

1949
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:02,140
What would you see in there?

1950
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:06,100
Ice skating spectacle starring King Louis.

1951
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:08,180
That sounds good.

1952
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:08,780
Sounds good.

1953
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:10,220
Yeah, I'd like to see him skate.

1954
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:11,860
Can he keep the crown on?

1955
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:12,860
I would love to see that.

1956
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:15,460
I assume he did keep the crown on.

1957
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:16,940
I don't know which theater.

1958
01:35:16,940 --> 01:35:17,620
Oh, you know what?

1959
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:18,940
I think this is Magic Screen.

1960
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:22,060
I'm sorry. It's all I can speak to is Magic Screen.

1961
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:26,700
One of my only memories, and it's kind of crazy that I can remember this.

1962
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:32,540
Like, I remember my point of view seeing this in 94 or whatever it was.

1963
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:34,420
I saw a show.

1964
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:37,980
I was like, I felt mad typing in.

1965
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:40,540
MGM Grand Adventures Blacklight show.

1966
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:41,460
That's all I could remember.

1967
01:35:41,660 --> 01:35:46,940
It was a show that utilized black light so that there could be a bunch of people

1968
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:51,940
just in all black like theater style moving stuff around and you couldn't see

1969
01:35:52,140 --> 01:35:56,500
it was all the props glow, but all the people puppeteering blend into the

1970
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:58,620
background and I found it.

1971
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:00,300
The show is called Kaleidoscope.

1972
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:01,020
Oh, OK.

1973
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:06,020
And let me now expel this from my brain onto you guys and the listener.

1974
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:12,300
I specifically remember that this show was so inane like I think the puppeteering

1975
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:15,380
all plenty impressive and everything and the pride.

1976
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:17,580
I remember it like popping and looking kind of cool.

1977
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:19,100
But I remember this one.

1978
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:22,140
Now we're back to this kind of like a movie theme.

1979
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:26,860
And I remember that there was a astronaut scene and the astronaut was on a big

1980
01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:33,580
cord getting him back into the connecting him to the ship and that somebody then

1981
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:37,900
year a voice, I don't know if it's the astronaut or a director says cut and then

1982
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:44,860
a big pair of scissors comes out and then the same voice says, not that kind of cut.

1983
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:47,900
Why do I remember that?

1984
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:48,540
Wow.

1985
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:49,860
Is that in my brain?

1986
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:55,020
And then I also then I remember turning to my mom as if to go, do you think this

1987
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:58,300
is good? And she did the same thing back to me.

1988
01:36:58,500 --> 01:36:59,460
Like, I don't know.

1989
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:00,860
I don't think this is good.

1990
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:01,380
Yeah.

1991
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:06,460
And it was maybe a kind of a loss of innocence where I was used to the top

1992
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:11,140
tier entertainment at Disney and Universal that my mom took me to and was excited to

1993
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:14,060
take me to. And now she's like, I'm sorry, son.

1994
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:15,860
I don't think this one is good.

1995
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:16,980
Not up to the standards.

1996
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:19,620
Not that kind of cat.

1997
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:21,380
You can't find a video of this.

1998
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:22,620
I don't think so.

1999
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:24,020
I tried.

2000
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:25,100
Very funny.

2001
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:30,780
I didn't go through everyone's home movies of it, but I'm dying to now just to.

2002
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:31,900
And what if I made it up?

2003
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:37,740
Well, maybe somebody listening could maybe do your work for you and send it to you.

2004
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:40,780
Are you buying it or something?

2005
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:43,940
You're a commercial pilot and you know what Scott's talking about.

2006
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:49,180
Please send us that clip so he doesn't have to narrow or an area or the reasons

2007
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:54,660
to contact us. Scott, can I did you see the other shows that that would play in the

2008
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:56,500
Magic Street?

2009
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:59,180
You got BMX grind.

2010
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:01,980
That's BMX bikes and inline skating.

2011
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:02,740
Yeah.

2012
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:10,780
And then this is the only the only proof I've seen of just the phrase a live

2013
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:15,260
recreation of the three stooges, three stooges live.

2014
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:20,100
Yeah, that's there are people on it's got a little sad.

2015
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:24,340
Yeah, because there's an Instagram I think I might follow where guys are

2016
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:26,780
just doing three stooges.

2017
01:38:26,980 --> 01:38:32,980
They're doing new versions of the classic gags, not the care, not the

2018
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:35,180
cast of the movie from 10 years ago.

2019
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:42,260
Well, I am aware that there is if you want a little more authenticity in your three,

2020
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:47,540
in your modern three stooges, then I would direct you towards a gentleman

2021
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:50,540
who professes to be Curly's grandson.

2022
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:52,460
I know exactly. Yes. This is what I'm talking about.

2023
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:53,900
I wasn't actually even going to say it,

2024
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:56,380
but yes, I follow Curly's grandson on Instagram.

2025
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:57,260
Oh, OK.

2026
01:38:57,460 --> 01:38:59,540
That's what I'm talking about.

2027
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:03,100
I know all about Curly's grandson.

2028
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:06,140
I well, I hate to brag.

2029
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:11,940
I hate to brag, but I was on a zoom in early pandemic times when the zooms were

2030
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:13,460
still fun. I remember that.

2031
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:16,100
And there was a

2032
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:19,220
on one week of this zoom of watching weird stuff.

2033
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:22,500
Curly's grandson was there.

2034
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:24,620
It was where we watched clips of Curly's grandson.

2035
01:39:24,820 --> 01:39:28,780
And then the very next week, all of a sudden a box appeared.

2036
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:30,940
Who is this joining the zoom?

2037
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:34,020
Oh, my God. It's no way.

2038
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:37,900
So, yes, I have been on a zoom.

2039
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:40,220
Who put it together?

2040
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:43,180
I don't think you'll mind me saying Jason Waller.

2041
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:44,940
OK, all right.

2042
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:46,260
It makes a lot of sense.

2043
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:47,900
Yeah.

2044
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:48,940
That makes sense to me.

2045
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:53,580
I found a way to get a hold of Curly G, Curly's grandson.

2046
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:54,380
Wow.

2047
01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:57,980
In my head, I was thinking, I was like, it sounds like a Jason Waller project.

2048
01:39:58,180 --> 01:40:00,700
Yeah, it sounds like a Waller special.

2049
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:04,340
He put some true magic together in those early days.

2050
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:08,180
Can I ask on the same, not the zoom where Curly's grandson showed up,

2051
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:11,220
but the previous zoom or clips were being watched.

2052
01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:15,140
Was Sunglass, Sunglass's Jack shown?

2053
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:16,220
Do you know what I'm talking about?

2054
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:16,980
I don't recall.

2055
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:18,220
Oh, no, my God.

2056
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:19,340
What is this?

2057
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:23,300
I think it's Sunglass, Sunglass or Sunglass, Sunglass's Jack.

2058
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:28,620
It's a man who's Jack Nicholson impersonator and he's got a lot of followers,

2059
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:31,220
but he also like dances and stuff, too.

2060
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:35,300
He does like other stuff that is not really in the character of Jack Nicholson.

2061
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:38,740
But he's very, he's very popular on Instagram.

2062
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:40,740
SunglassesJack.com.

2063
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:41,780
Yeah, there he is.

2064
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:42,780
Yeah.

2065
01:40:42,980 --> 01:40:46,580
As you guys can see, as you listeners can see,

2066
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:51,340
podcast the ride Sin City Nights is a world of difference from the regular podcast

2067
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:57,660
the ride. We talk about crazy stuff like Curly G and SunglassesJack and F Troop

2068
01:40:57,860 --> 01:41:02,660
and old, old comic strips, which, by the way, is King Features Syndicate.

2069
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:04,060
If you were, I didn't want to leave you.

2070
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:04,780
Tumbleweed.

2071
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:06,020
Tumbleweed. Yes.

2072
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:08,380
That one, not a mystery.

2073
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:11,940
So, yeah, three, that's very miserable.

2074
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:13,220
There's also something called Clint

2075
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:16,220
Carvalho and his extreme parrots.

2076
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:17,940
By the way, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

2077
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:19,220
It is SunglassesJack.

2078
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:24,700
That's his name and it's three hundred and thirty thousand followers on Instagram.

2079
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:29,140
And I do I hate again, we have to watch just like I haven't seen these.

2080
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:32,860
This is just some of the audio listeners need to know.

2081
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:34,940
But it's

2082
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:41,660
Jack Nicholson impersonator playing the bongos.

2083
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:45,540
And then he like I think he recently started doing the voice, but he was not

2084
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:47,300
doing the voice a lot. What?

2085
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:50,500
Wait, he built a following without doing the voice.

2086
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:52,580
I think he's doing the voice maybe now.

2087
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:54,140
Let's hold on.

2088
01:41:57,860 --> 01:41:59,460
He's just dancing here.

2089
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:04,740
I can I attest that I am looking at a Jack Nicholson impersonator while that music

2090
01:42:04,940 --> 01:42:07,620
like, wow, Jack Nicholson impersonator, huh?

2091
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:10,620
You must do a great impression of him.

2092
01:42:10,820 --> 01:42:12,860
That's not really the point of it.

2093
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:17,540
Maybe a more pedestrian impersonator might do an impression, but kind of do like

2094
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:21,900
the ice bucket challenge more like that.

2095
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:27,580
He's just walking around with Joker makeup on here.

2096
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:31,740
I'm trying to find how many followers do you have?

2097
01:42:31,940 --> 01:42:34,580
Three hundred and thirty thousand.

2098
01:42:35,660 --> 01:42:37,780
Do we have five?

2099
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:38,300
I don't know.

2100
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:40,580
But here we are with our notes and our research.

2101
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:45,860
I learned about Kirk Corian fucking eating shit to Sunglass Jack.

2102
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:52,020
This is a niche show for a small amount of weirdos and Sunglass Jack.

2103
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:54,460
Sunglass Jack is what the people want.

2104
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:55,620
This is a mass entered.

2105
01:42:55,820 --> 01:42:59,780
When all the networks and streaming services go belly up, all that's going to be

2106
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:04,380
left is guys like Sunglass Jack giving the people what they want and not.

2107
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:10,460
This is not the drill from Twitter, which is Jack Nicholson, like a warped photo.

2108
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:13,940
Jack Nicholson and Sunglass's drill.

2109
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:14,900
Yeah, drill.

2110
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:17,660
He writes the jokes on Twitter for like, oh, I see.

2111
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:18,660
We're decade. Yeah.

2112
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:19,300
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2113
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:20,580
No, it's not. This is a different.

2114
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:22,580
This is that is a different sunglasses.

2115
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:23,820
If I tell you how long he's been reading

2116
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:28,700
the 2009 or so, the best account of Twitter.

2117
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:31,020
OK,

2118
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:36,340
there's a ride that is probably best mostly skipped called The Haunted Mine.

2119
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:37,740
Haunted Mine. Huh.

2120
01:43:37,940 --> 01:43:38,700
What's that about?

2121
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:41,100
Is it about what's in there?

2122
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:47,260
Frankenstein's and the vampires and it's like a Native American thing.

2123
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:50,980
Yeah. Look, that's not a good

2124
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:52,500
they aren't monsters.

2125
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:53,980
They're no. Yeah.

2126
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:55,100
Maybe you shouldn't.

2127
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:59,940
They're not just about vengeful and they lead them and curses on the one wiki.

2128
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:02,780
I'm on. They leave that part out of the description.

2129
01:44:02,980 --> 01:44:04,620
Yeah. Yeah.

2130
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:06,420
The review I'm reading.

2131
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:10,260
Well, it did have a big on the plus side, a big spider on the minus side.

2132
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:14,340
It was kind of clever, but also mildly offensive and not terribly scary.

2133
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:17,340
So that's the Haunted Mine.

2134
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:20,340
There is a roller coaster.

2135
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:23,660
Yeah, I want to I want to talk about this lightning bolt.

2136
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:27,740
This is an indoor coaster space themed

2137
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:31,420
because that's easy to do inside in the dark like Space Mountain.

2138
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:32,820
No sense. Yeah.

2139
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:38,660
The the journey of this coaster, it was indoors.

2140
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:45,140
And then in 97, they moved it outdoors and they made it twice as long.

2141
01:44:45,340 --> 01:44:50,340
That is one of the strangest roller coaster journeys I have ever heard.

2142
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:52,060
Yeah.

2143
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:55,420
I believe

2144
01:44:55,580 --> 01:45:00,220
and Aaron, it only went on the outdoor version, but I think this was kind of a

2145
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:06,460
tame roller coaster and I think that maybe the indoor part hid the tameness.

2146
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:09,780
So I think because when there's a mystery

2147
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:13,660
of what's happening and where you're going to go and maybe there will be a big scary

2148
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:17,340
drop or something, but outside it cannot hide its lameness.

2149
01:45:17,540 --> 01:45:19,900
It says 35 miles an hour.

2150
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:23,340
This is but probably that's top speed.

2151
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:24,900
What is Space Mountain around?

2152
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:25,780
Thirty five.

2153
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:27,700
Yeah, Space Mountain's not that fast.

2154
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:30,980
I mean, it's not a lot of wind, a lot of wind.

2155
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:32,460
So but I don't know if it goes.

2156
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:37,020
I don't know if we went thirty five for like a half second or something.

2157
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:38,860
I don't know.

2158
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:41,140
What sounds a little cool is that they kept it.

2159
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:47,260
It was like you're going to space and then you come back and that's indicated by a

2160
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:49,700
black light model of the strip.

2161
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:50,820
So that sounds good.

2162
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:56,620
That sounds like something notable and proprietary, but again, impossible to

2163
01:45:56,820 --> 01:45:58,740
document in a dark room.

2164
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:01,420
It looks like 35 miles an hour is Space Mountain here.

2165
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:03,380
So this is as fast as.

2166
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:04,020
Yeah.

2167
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:07,740
Then that doesn't feel like maybe if you put it out, if you put outside, would

2168
01:46:07,940 --> 01:46:09,540
Space Mountain be lame?

2169
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:13,900
It wouldn't be lame, but I think we would be shocked at how much less fast it felt.

2170
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:14,500
Maybe.

2171
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:20,060
Yeah, because not that I still kind of feel fast and sometimes, but I still feel

2172
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:23,340
like it, oh, it's a little feels out of control this time or whatever.

2173
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:28,780
But I do think times when I'm less anxious on it, I'm like, this actually is

2174
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:32,020
fooling me, I think it's going faster and faster.

2175
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:36,260
A lot of cold air blowing at you and a lot of lighting effects.

2176
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:36,700
Yeah.

2177
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:41,420
And getting an air blowing at you, I think makes you think you're going fast.

2178
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:44,180
Yeah, I think like, yeah, I don't know.

2179
01:46:44,380 --> 01:46:44,780
I'm not.

2180
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:46,220
I didn't actually even think about that.

2181
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:48,540
If you think they're blowing wind on you.

2182
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:50,700
I think so. It always feels so chilly in there.

2183
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:52,260
I don't know about that.

2184
01:46:52,460 --> 01:46:56,100
Like all of it, the whole track, certain parts.

2185
01:46:56,300 --> 01:46:57,500
I don't know that. I don't know.

2186
01:46:57,700 --> 01:46:58,460
I don't really know.

2187
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:00,300
I don't want to look like a fool if I'm wrong.

2188
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:07,500
I think I think I got to be a gambling man here in in Sin City Nights Month.

2189
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:09,540
That doesn't feel right to me.

2190
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:13,500
This could also be be

2191
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:17,860
a magic trick that it's just dark and you're going a little fast.

2192
01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:21,580
Heavy duty air conditioner and there's certain pockets of cold air from just

2193
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:23,580
the trajectory of that.

2194
01:47:23,780 --> 01:47:25,780
That's not the same as a cannon.

2195
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:29,740
It's not making me feel like it's going faster.

2196
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:32,500
I don't think there's a cannon of air.

2197
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:34,100
No, I don't.

2198
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:39,260
I think I think it's just like some AC really like turned up.

2199
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:43,220
You're saying a cold environment, cold environment, zooming through it.

2200
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:46,340
You can't see you're going a little fast in the dark.

2201
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:47,740
Jason, back down a little bit.

2202
01:47:47,940 --> 01:47:52,580
I think you were positive cold air is being blasted at you to simulate

2203
01:47:52,780 --> 01:47:57,340
like fans, fans blasting cold air, but it's fans to make you feel like you're in

2204
01:47:57,540 --> 01:48:00,820
space, not fans because it's a hot room.

2205
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:03,260
How about is Google? Are there fans on Space Mountain?

2206
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:04,580
Well, they will.

2207
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:09,460
We think we know that there's fans, but it's a question of are the fans placed?

2208
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:11,740
No. What's the purpose of the fans?

2209
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:14,980
Are the fans to cool or are the fans to simulate?

2210
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:16,300
Certainly to cool.

2211
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:18,740
But certainly the fans are there to cool.

2212
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:20,060
I should hope. Certainly.

2213
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:21,460
That's what most fans do.

2214
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:27,980
I'm also just saying this is this is the story my mind is completing in the darkness.

2215
01:48:27,980 --> 01:48:29,180
Michael, raising my hand.

2216
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:33,380
And here's the first thing that pops up when I write, are there fans on Space Mountain?

2217
01:48:33,580 --> 01:48:37,980
Something just a secret to many of many of the Space Mountain attractions actually

2218
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:42,140
have fans blowing air on you throughout the ride track.

2219
01:48:42,340 --> 01:48:43,500
Oh, my God.

2220
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:45,700
Oh, my God.

2221
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:47,500
Oh, well, how about this?

2222
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:49,260
This is why Mike stayed out.

2223
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:52,540
This is why I stayed out because I didn't want to look like I didn't want to look

2224
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:55,220
like a fool, quite frankly. Look at this king.

2225
01:48:55,420 --> 01:48:58,100
King Jason over here.

2226
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:00,140
They got no one to roll them.

2227
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:03,780
God, that's why you're so excited about the song.

2228
01:49:03,980 --> 01:49:06,180
What is the hang on? What is the site, though?

2229
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:06,900
Hold on.

2230
01:49:07,100 --> 01:49:09,700
Wait, there's an inside the magic, too, that's discussing this as well.

2231
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:11,460
We can always trust them.

2232
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:13,020
Most trustworthy source.

2233
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:14,300
What's the date?

2234
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:15,740
Because all that.

2235
01:49:15,940 --> 01:49:17,540
It's

2236
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:19,660
October 23rd, 2021.

2237
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:20,580
Fuck.

2238
01:49:20,780 --> 01:49:24,140
It is post-reigling turn theme park center.

2239
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:26,380
Do we have we ever been on theme park center?

2240
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:30,300
I've been on Dink Park Center Center Center since 2009.

2241
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:31,020
Writes the jokes.

2242
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:34,020
Space Mountain tips and secrets.

2243
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:37,300
Secret one is not only a space on the first indoor roller coaster.

2244
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:39,820
It's also the first roller coaster to be controlled by computers.

2245
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:41,900
Secret two says many of the Space Mountain

2246
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:45,300
attractions actually have fans blowing air on you throughout the ride track.

2247
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:48,540
This is to make you feel like you're going faster than you actually are.

2248
01:49:48,740 --> 01:49:49,220
Fuck.

2249
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:54,820
I think the fact that anyone else is saying this does make it seem legitimate.

2250
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:56,740
Well, wow.

2251
01:49:56,940 --> 01:49:59,660
There's a couple other places that look like they have

2252
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:03,700
something similar to that piece of information.

2253
01:50:04,700 --> 01:50:05,220
Wow.

2254
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:06,780
This is wow.

2255
01:50:06,980 --> 01:50:08,580
I mean, this is we're a little trick.

2256
01:50:08,780 --> 01:50:09,660
We're stunned here.

2257
01:50:09,860 --> 01:50:10,820
What do I do now?

2258
01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:12,500
I feel like how do you recover from this?

2259
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:13,980
I don't know.

2260
01:50:14,180 --> 01:50:15,900
Can the listener ever trust me again?

2261
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:19,180
Yeah, I just really I was also ground in.

2262
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:20,340
I'll say this earlier.

2263
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:24,220
I was trying to quickly figure out the answer to that question about the big hat.

2264
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:28,500
And it looks like some of that might all just be rumors, too, and no one's quite sure.

2265
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:31,500
So that was not easy as to confuse you.

2266
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:34,780
I know this is conclusive as this is what I'm really saying is I'm like, oh, shit,

2267
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:37,500
I'm going to be able to quickly answer my own question.

2268
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:38,380
But that did not happen.

2269
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:40,500
And this one seems like

2270
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:41,740
the man's right.

2271
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:42,540
I don't know.

2272
01:50:42,740 --> 01:50:44,820
Boy, I just stepped right in it.

2273
01:50:44,820 --> 01:50:45,940
He's putting his crown right.

2274
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:48,180
Oh, he's putting a crown on right now.

2275
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:52,980
And I got my big pocket watch with my face on it.

2276
01:50:53,180 --> 01:50:57,420
How he's floating you to make it feel faster.

2277
01:50:57,500 --> 01:51:00,300
So now I think you're also dealing with the fact that you've been kind of do you

2278
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:02,060
thought Space Mountain maybe went faster?

2279
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:02,940
I think so.

2280
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:04,780
Yeah. And it was more of a scary.

2281
01:51:04,980 --> 01:51:08,140
So I'm mad at myself for stepping in it.

2282
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:12,060
And I'm mad at the ride for being all tricks.

2283
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:13,820
It's all tricks. Yeah, you know what?

2284
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:17,300
This is like a lot of casinos don't have windows.

2285
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:20,700
They don't have clocks on the walls and they are blowing air.

2286
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:22,780
They're blowing air on you and those casinos, too.

2287
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:23,980
They better be. Yeah.

2288
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:26,220
And they got this weekend.

2289
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:27,380
They do.

2290
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:31,820
I think some of the ones that still have a lot of smoking areas have really complex

2291
01:51:32,020 --> 01:51:35,700
ventilation systems to sort of like they say no smoke out.

2292
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:39,020
I'm not going to say you're wrong here because you're on a hot streak here.

2293
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:42,340
But sometimes I go in one of those places where they allow smoking and I go,

2294
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:44,380
it sounds like fucking smoke in here. Yeah.

2295
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:48,380
Yeah. But I think that I think it could smell like worse.

2296
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:49,620
I see. That wasn't well.

2297
01:51:49,820 --> 01:51:52,460
I look if you're saying it, I believe it today.

2298
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:55,620
Tonight, Jason's up when he's up, he's up.

2299
01:51:55,820 --> 01:51:57,460
Jason's up.

2300
01:51:57,660 --> 01:52:00,500
Yeah. Starting this week on a hot streak.

2301
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:01,980
Hats off to you.

2302
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:03,420
Crowns off to you.

2303
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:05,100
I get. Wow. That's an interesting one.

2304
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:07,860
Something we would have known maybe if we ever did it.

2305
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:09,620
Space Mountain.

2306
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:11,820
But we got this to get through first.

2307
01:52:12,020 --> 01:52:15,220
I think we're I mean, we're heading to the exit here.

2308
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:17,820
I mean, so

2309
01:52:18,020 --> 01:52:23,940
this place, it seems like it opens to like there's some interest.

2310
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:27,780
But the really damning thing is that they're like, we're going to keep

2311
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:31,580
we're going to make sure only 10,000 people come in every day.

2312
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:33,140
Right. Just to make sure it's comfortable.

2313
01:52:33,140 --> 01:52:34,180
And those lines don't get too long.

2314
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:36,300
So, you know, we're just going to cap it.

2315
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:38,100
We're going to have it.

2316
01:52:38,620 --> 01:52:40,300
Sir, the tenants figures are in.

2317
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:42,220
It's nowhere close to that.

2318
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:43,740
Well, good. Good. That's what I said.

2319
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:45,900
I wanted to be I wanted to be small.

2320
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:50,860
So great. My plan with and we will cap it at 10,000 as this place gets more

2321
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:52,740
and more popular. That did not happen.

2322
01:52:52,940 --> 01:52:56,500
It kind of was just floating along, doing OK.

2323
01:52:56,700 --> 01:53:00,860
And then but they just they wanted to do other stuff.

2324
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:03,780
I think they were trying gimmicks of like, we'll do it'll be

2325
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:06,380
scream park for Halloween.

2326
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:09,540
I mean, people like that from what I saw.

2327
01:53:09,740 --> 01:53:11,060
Yeah. And I'm not saying it's good.

2328
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:13,820
I feel like some people had fond memories of it.

2329
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:18,060
And there's a commercial with like it says Jack is back.

2330
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:20,980
Now, it was Jack. I that's my question to you guys.

2331
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:22,540
Did you come across who Jack is?

2332
01:53:22,540 --> 01:53:23,900
I'm not saying I know the answer.

2333
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:25,260
Sunglass, sunglasses.

2334
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:27,380
I don't think it's sunglass Jack, though.

2335
01:53:27,580 --> 01:53:31,980
I think it's a different Jack from 1997.

2336
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:36,340
But like the the night of the Jack is the thing we saw a couple of years ago.

2337
01:53:36,540 --> 01:53:40,580
We drove through like Jack is sort of a like name for Halloween characters.

2338
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:42,340
Got pumpkin had a character.

2339
01:53:42,540 --> 01:53:46,380
Yes. He screamed Park three Jacks back right there.

2340
01:53:46,580 --> 01:53:49,380
Mm hmm. So I'm not sure.

2341
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:53,060
Yeah. Means nothing to me if I don't know what Jack's capable of to begin with.

2342
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:59,300
And it's probably they did not make the leap of like, OK, Jack Pumpkinhead is in

2343
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:03,980
the later Wizard of Oz books and I think Return to Oz.

2344
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:04,860
Yeah.

2345
01:54:05,060 --> 01:54:07,500
Does he show? But it's not in the movie Return to Oz.

2346
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:08,220
Yeah.

2347
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:09,740
Pumpkinhead. Yeah. Yeah.

2348
01:54:09,940 --> 01:54:14,780
He is not in MGM Grand Adventures or in the hotel.

2349
01:54:14,980 --> 01:54:18,260
Right. Because MGM is more of the original movie.

2350
01:54:18,460 --> 01:54:19,820
Yeah. Or the second movie.

2351
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:22,540
That's actually the second Wizard of Oz.

2352
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:25,140
There was another Wizard of Oz. Am I wrong?

2353
01:54:25,340 --> 01:54:28,620
There was like a different Wizard of Oz movie made before the Judy Garland one.

2354
01:54:28,780 --> 01:54:30,420
I don't know the answer to that.

2355
01:54:30,420 --> 01:54:31,460
I don't know if I ever know.

2356
01:54:31,460 --> 01:54:33,260
I'm scared now. I'm scared to be wrong.

2357
01:54:33,460 --> 01:54:35,820
Right. Maybe I'm thinking of a different movie.

2358
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:36,980
Let me tell you something.

2359
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:41,500
If you put yourself out there and you get something wrong, it's humiliating.

2360
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:43,420
I don't want to be wrong.

2361
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:44,940
I'm stewing over here.

2362
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:46,260
Don't risk it, Mike.

2363
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:47,260
I know I'm right.

2364
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:49,740
1910, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

2365
01:54:49,940 --> 01:54:52,140
Oh, nice. Nice. Nice.

2366
01:54:52,340 --> 01:54:53,460
I got to see this.

2367
01:54:53,660 --> 01:54:57,180
The feeling of being right about a movie from 1910.

2368
01:54:57,260 --> 01:54:59,580
Oh, man. 100 year old movie.

2369
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:01,460
It was a silent film.

2370
01:55:01,660 --> 01:55:05,860
Yeah. Oh, that was probably a horrifying Wizard of Oz.

2371
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:08,940
Yeah. However, they're rendering those creatures then.

2372
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:13,220
There one one other thing about the

2373
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:16,980
park, there was a giant

2374
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:20,020
theater, Altawer Theater with a pirate ship and a lagoon.

2375
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:20,900
Oh, yeah.

2376
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:22,180
Yeah.

2377
01:55:22,620 --> 01:55:25,900
And it had a pirate stunt show.

2378
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:29,700
The MGM Grand opens December 1993.

2379
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:35,740
The Treasure Island Casino up Las Vegas Boulevard opens October 1993.

2380
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:41,340
So there is a point where you could see two competing pirate shows on the strap.

2381
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:42,780
Wow. Right.

2382
01:55:42,980 --> 01:55:44,460
But one is free.

2383
01:55:44,660 --> 01:55:47,380
One isn't locked up behind a gate.

2384
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:48,820
Extremely free.

2385
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:53,460
And then you can also turn to the side and see a volcano.

2386
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:55,380
You know, it's

2387
01:55:55,540 --> 01:56:00,020
the pirate thing kind of looked again like fun in some ways.

2388
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:01,660
There was obviously like standard stunt

2389
01:56:01,660 --> 01:56:03,780
stuff in there that we it's in every stunt show.

2390
01:56:03,980 --> 01:56:05,980
But sure, it looked fine.

2391
01:56:06,180 --> 01:56:07,060
You know what I saw?

2392
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:08,460
I seem to have seen it.

2393
01:56:08,660 --> 01:56:09,940
It was in a photo album.

2394
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:13,060
OK, I have not very many memory.

2395
01:56:13,060 --> 01:56:15,340
This is the theme of a lot of people who went to the place.

2396
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:18,020
Yeah. It just seemed like this place lacked a personality.

2397
01:56:18,220 --> 01:56:18,980
Yeah, a little bit.

2398
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:21,500
I think just kind of like it is a theme park.

2399
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:24,420
It has some of the things that theme parks have.

2400
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:27,580
But maybe there's not a lot of like, but what's the character?

2401
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:30,340
What's the feel that only we have?

2402
01:56:30,540 --> 01:56:33,300
Right. Not literal character, but character personality.

2403
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:36,700
And yeah, no, they're they got tumbleweed.

2404
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:39,180
They have to wait, but they missed the point.

2405
01:56:39,380 --> 01:56:41,300
They were real true characters.

2406
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:41,820
Yeah.

2407
01:56:42,020 --> 01:56:47,740
So then it's 96 and they decide some things that they want are a convention

2408
01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:49,940
center and a much bigger pool area.

2409
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:52,820
So it's chopped by 40 percent.

2410
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:58,500
And the 40 percent that is closest to the entrance is all the best.

2411
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:01,180
All the ones that we said, maybe this was OK.

2412
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:02,380
Not the Rapids, right?

2413
01:57:02,380 --> 01:57:03,140
That's in the back.

2414
01:57:03,340 --> 01:57:03,940
So that's safe.

2415
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:04,660
Long film safe.

2416
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:09,460
But Backlot River Tour, which is the closest thing it has to like, what is it?

2417
01:57:09,460 --> 01:57:13,340
It's kind of a movie adventure park gone out deep earth exploration.

2418
01:57:13,340 --> 01:57:17,900
The one that's a little bit ahead of its time out gone coaster indoor coaster.

2419
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:19,180
Pretty OK.

2420
01:57:19,380 --> 01:57:21,420
Got to move it. It's going outside.

2421
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:27,660
So it just so happened that the front of the park has all the best stuff and well,

2422
01:57:27,860 --> 01:57:33,300
shit. OK, so now we're down to lesser, more generic rides.

2423
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:36,660
They put in one of those the Skyscreamer

2424
01:57:36,860 --> 01:57:41,180
sky coaster episode we did with Hanford twice and only one came out.

2425
01:57:41,380 --> 01:57:44,380
We know about sky coasters

2426
01:57:44,580 --> 01:57:47,460
ended up is the one at Fun Spot America.

2427
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:48,380
Yeah, that was it.

2428
01:57:48,580 --> 01:57:51,060
Orlando. OK, wow.

2429
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:55,900
Some other stuff that closed during the reduction, that Manhattan Theatre.

2430
01:57:56,100 --> 01:57:58,740
And then this is a funny note on the Wikipedia.

2431
01:57:58,940 --> 01:58:04,180
Although unaffected by the layout change, the haunted mine was also closed.

2432
01:58:04,380 --> 01:58:08,700
So another ride just gone for no reason, no reason.

2433
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:11,380
They didn't even need to.

2434
01:58:11,580 --> 01:58:13,220
Seems like it's for the best.

2435
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:15,020
That's really funny.

2436
01:58:15,220 --> 01:58:20,300
And then so then it's just it's like an increasingly miniature theme park.

2437
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:25,140
Just like sliced and sliced until there is not much left.

2438
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:29,940
I, you know, probably good moves.

2439
01:58:30,140 --> 01:58:32,100
That pool area is fantastic.

2440
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:33,740
The player is sprawling.

2441
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:34,740
It's so huge.

2442
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:37,020
And that was always the guessing game.

2443
01:58:37,220 --> 01:58:39,340
I was like, well, what was this park?

2444
01:58:39,340 --> 01:58:41,020
I couldn't figure it. So it's just everything.

2445
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:42,180
It's all the periphery.

2446
01:58:42,380 --> 01:58:46,260
It's what's now Pool Convention Center, those signature suites,

2447
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:50,540
the switcher three big towers and Topgolf, which requires a lot of spit, you know,

2448
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:54,020
to any driving range, much less a giant one.

2449
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:57,860
All that. So the MGM fun zone,

2450
01:58:58,060 --> 01:59:01,980
all the stuff that isn't casino and hotel rooms was all a theme park.

2451
01:59:02,180 --> 01:59:04,380
Now it's a bunch of other stuff and more

2452
01:59:04,580 --> 01:59:08,180
hotel rooms, and it seems more like what they they need.

2453
01:59:08,180 --> 01:59:11,300
They also changed the name of the most generic thing you've ever heard.

2454
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:14,580
It was then the Park MGM Grand for a while.

2455
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:16,900
That just sounds like you don't want to be doing.

2456
01:59:17,100 --> 01:59:18,020
No, at all.

2457
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:20,500
Do you give it that name?

2458
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:22,020
You seem embarrassed by it.

2459
01:59:22,220 --> 01:59:27,260
It's like something could be called the Park at MGM Grand now when it could be

2460
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:29,060
one of those food things you mentioned.

2461
01:59:29,260 --> 01:59:30,500
Oh, food hall. Yeah.

2462
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:31,540
That could be a hotel.

2463
01:59:31,740 --> 01:59:34,260
It means nothing. Hotel called Park MGM.

2464
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:35,140
Yeah.

2465
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:37,740
No, those are just generic words.

2466
01:59:37,940 --> 01:59:39,100
World around.

2467
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:42,140
I saw I was reading it, saw videos.

2468
01:59:42,220 --> 01:59:48,820
People are like, OK, I'm going to try to find remnants of MGM Grand Adventures.

2469
01:59:49,020 --> 01:59:54,500
The remnants were the lazy river at the pools called the Backlot River.

2470
01:59:54,700 --> 01:59:56,860
Unsure if that's current.

2471
01:59:57,060 --> 01:59:59,540
And then there is a sign in the parking

2472
01:59:59,740 --> 02:00:07,020
garage with an arrow and it says like Convention Center Pool Grand Adventures.

2473
02:00:07,220 --> 02:00:08,420
So it still says that.

2474
02:00:08,620 --> 02:00:09,500
Yeah, I know.

2475
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:11,940
Sign from the last few years.

2476
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:13,620
This video actually haven't been to them.

2477
02:00:13,820 --> 02:00:16,380
Is there a lazy river at the MGM Grand Pool at the pool?

2478
02:00:16,580 --> 02:00:17,740
Yeah.

2479
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:18,820
Give it a. Yeah.

2480
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:20,260
Maybe I switch. You know where you stand.

2481
02:00:20,260 --> 02:00:21,180
Oh, yeah. You have to switch.

2482
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:22,900
I do know it's a very good point.

2483
02:00:23,100 --> 02:00:25,740
And it's also the home of Wet Republic,

2484
02:00:25,940 --> 02:00:28,940
which I would have to imagine is one of the douchiest pool party.

2485
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:29,980
You're not.

2486
02:00:30,180 --> 02:00:30,940
Yes.

2487
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:31,660
Party.

2488
02:00:31,860 --> 02:00:32,900
I want to go to. Yeah.

2489
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:35,020
What Republic? Of course.

2490
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:35,820
Over there.

2491
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:36,460
Maybe I got to switch.

2492
02:00:36,660 --> 02:00:37,020
So this is.

2493
02:00:37,060 --> 02:00:39,620
So it's a plus up to you because now there's more.

2494
02:00:39,820 --> 02:00:41,020
There's no no theme park.

2495
02:00:41,220 --> 02:00:42,060
It's a minus for you.

2496
02:00:42,260 --> 02:00:43,540
But now. But plus.

2497
02:00:43,740 --> 02:00:44,580
Douchy Vegas.

2498
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:47,940
But you see my you see that I like both things.

2499
02:00:48,140 --> 02:00:52,260
I'm excited about a lazy river, but I'm also excited about a group of the world's

2500
02:00:52,460 --> 02:00:56,780
worst people getting together in one place in the pool to listen to loud music and drink.

2501
02:00:56,780 --> 02:00:57,140
Yeah.

2502
02:00:57,340 --> 02:00:58,380
Listen to loud music.

2503
02:00:58,580 --> 02:01:00,980
You don't know where you don't.

2504
02:01:01,180 --> 02:01:05,500
Except none of my favorite songs except at the rehab pool party when I was

2505
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:10,620
there at Hard Rock and they played the start of Circle of Life and the crowd lost

2506
02:01:10,820 --> 02:01:14,540
their minds. It was so exciting.

2507
02:01:14,740 --> 02:01:19,540
People were like, it was all of a sudden the whole that came on.

2508
02:01:19,740 --> 02:01:21,100
Everyone just went nuts.

2509
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:22,540
And I was like, this is good.

2510
02:01:22,740 --> 02:01:24,620
Wow. I'm enjoying this.

2511
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:26,220
This is great.

2512
02:01:26,420 --> 02:01:29,580
So, yeah, so once in a while you'll hear a Disney song.

2513
02:01:29,580 --> 02:01:32,980
I've already been wrong once in this episode, so I don't want to be done for

2514
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:34,980
but I'm going to challenge you on the point.

2515
02:01:35,180 --> 02:01:36,060
This is good.

2516
02:01:36,260 --> 02:01:38,180
It is good.

2517
02:01:38,380 --> 02:01:43,460
And now I know about that cold air, but I know what's good and what's not good.

2518
02:01:43,660 --> 02:01:45,500
I don't know how it wasn't even a remix.

2519
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:47,540
They wasn't even they weren't even putting like a beat under it.

2520
02:01:47,740 --> 02:01:50,380
It was just literally the opening of it, which I don't know.

2521
02:01:50,580 --> 02:01:51,620
Do you like that?

2522
02:01:51,820 --> 02:01:55,300
I guess I don't even say you like the start of Circle of Life.

2523
02:01:55,500 --> 02:01:56,500
Yeah, fine.

2524
02:01:56,700 --> 02:01:58,740
Jason, you like the story of it?

2525
02:01:58,940 --> 02:02:02,380
Well, because you said you just said this is a classic American.

2526
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:06,780
I was debating it like I was in a courtroom, like I would at least agree.

2527
02:02:06,980 --> 02:02:09,940
You can you not agree that the Circle of Life is good?

2528
02:02:10,140 --> 02:02:12,340
I think I can intellectually prove that.

2529
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:13,540
Whoa, whoa.

2530
02:02:13,740 --> 02:02:17,740
Way down a waiter or waitress and get a complimentary drink.

2531
02:02:17,940 --> 02:02:20,700
You're both a little worked up.

2532
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:23,460
Hey, slow down. You're not in Vegas yet.

2533
02:02:23,660 --> 02:02:25,260
Yeah,

2534
02:02:25,460 --> 02:02:27,220
we're not in Las Vegas yet.

2535
02:02:27,220 --> 02:02:28,620
Yeah, here's my question.

2536
02:02:28,620 --> 02:02:29,420
Winding it down.

2537
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:29,700
Yeah.

2538
02:02:29,700 --> 02:02:32,780
You know, we don't we aren't very good about doing the old,

2539
02:02:32,980 --> 02:02:36,420
you know, burn it down for insurance money scale.

2540
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:39,100
But I think for these Vegas ones,

2541
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:44,340
I think we could do a Vegas specific analysis of was the right decision made

2542
02:02:44,540 --> 02:02:47,700
here, and I think we could play by blackjack rules.

2543
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:51,060
So that is and this is it will do it in past tense, which will confuse it.

2544
02:02:51,260 --> 02:02:54,780
But what should the we know what they did,

2545
02:02:54,980 --> 02:02:59,500
but what should the MGM Grand have done with MGM Grand Adventures hit?

2546
02:02:59,700 --> 02:03:03,500
Stand double down or cash out.

2547
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:05,940
They certainly cashed out.

2548
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:10,020
They cashed out 40 percent of their chips and then then slowly all the rest.

2549
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:14,820
But it's kind of an interesting actually to, you know,

2550
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:18,660
hit implies put a little more muscle into it.

2551
02:03:18,860 --> 02:03:20,140
Just take it a little further.

2552
02:03:20,340 --> 02:03:22,820
Stand implies don't change it whatsoever.

2553
02:03:23,020 --> 02:03:26,660
Double down is way more, way harder.

2554
02:03:26,860 --> 02:03:28,900
I guess individually,

2555
02:03:29,060 --> 02:03:31,860
what is the face card you think?

2556
02:03:32,060 --> 02:03:38,180
What does everyone think the face card you're seeing of this part is?

2557
02:03:38,380 --> 02:03:41,140
It's a it's the face of Kurt Korkorian.

2558
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:43,300
I don't want to have a theme park anymore.

2559
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:44,540
You see,

2560
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:50,860
like this took it doesn't go that far because it's 15.

2561
02:03:51,260 --> 02:03:53,700
Your car is a blackjack or is it five car stud?

2562
02:03:53,700 --> 02:03:55,380
We're playing here or is it Holden?

2563
02:03:55,380 --> 02:03:56,700
Which game are we playing?

2564
02:03:56,700 --> 02:04:00,500
That's also important to know before I decide to like Auntie.

2565
02:04:00,700 --> 02:04:03,660
What if I see my bet or if I?

2566
02:04:03,860 --> 02:04:05,460
OK, let me say this.

2567
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:11,300
I think they were right to fold at the time.

2568
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:13,420
Now, if there was a different timeline

2569
02:04:13,620 --> 02:04:18,420
and this is maybe kind of an OK park in 2011, 2005 or something,

2570
02:04:18,620 --> 02:04:23,020
and then they last for 10 years, I think because of the growing up

2571
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:27,900
theme park adult audience, I think a doubling down later might have made

2572
02:04:27,900 --> 02:04:30,940
more sense, but it would have taken another 20 years to get there.

2573
02:04:31,140 --> 02:04:31,500
Yeah.

2574
02:04:31,700 --> 02:04:35,020
For to see it like an audience there that would want it.

2575
02:04:35,220 --> 02:04:38,420
So I think they were correct to to to fold them.

2576
02:04:38,620 --> 02:04:42,660
And I think that's a big thing in Vegas.

2577
02:04:42,860 --> 02:04:48,340
A thing that might keep coming up with, you know, a lot of parks you need to you

2578
02:04:48,340 --> 02:04:54,780
need to hold before you double that you either need to double down or you need

2579
02:04:54,980 --> 02:05:00,780
to stand because you need to let people get used to it.

2580
02:05:00,980 --> 02:05:03,700
And yeah, building that audience.

2581
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:08,940
But I think in Vegas, a town that just prints money every minute

2582
02:05:09,140 --> 02:05:16,180
with gambling, you know, I don't think they were willing to commit

2583
02:05:16,340 --> 02:05:18,700
to like keeping this around.

2584
02:05:18,900 --> 02:05:23,340
Should the scale really be knowing when to hold them, knowing when to fold?

2585
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:24,740
Is that what we're discovering?

2586
02:05:24,940 --> 02:05:26,300
OK, that's a good idea.

2587
02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:30,020
But I'd also like to introduce the concept of maybe they should have bluffed,

2588
02:05:30,220 --> 02:05:34,100
which is a totally different concept, and they should have just kept it at the same.

2589
02:05:34,300 --> 02:05:36,860
They said we're going to do more, but then didn't.

2590
02:05:37,060 --> 02:05:40,580
And it's still open, but in a shitty way now.

2591
02:05:40,780 --> 02:05:45,580
I'm I'm confused about how you would bluff in terms of owning and operating a theme

2592
02:05:45,580 --> 02:05:48,820
park. OK, maybe that doesn't was not one to one.

2593
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:53,300
But in the in the fun poker way, I think it kind of makes sense.

2594
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:57,060
Well, if we're adding, if we're breaking the rules and adding more that we're not

2595
02:05:57,260 --> 02:06:00,700
on my list, then I think they should have flipped over the table.

2596
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:04,140
OK, sending all the cards and chips flying everywhere.

2597
02:06:04,340 --> 02:06:06,140
That's good. And then run away.

2598
02:06:06,340 --> 02:06:07,580
That's kind of what they did.

2599
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:08,980
They can. Yes, they did.

2600
02:06:08,980 --> 02:06:10,020
That is what they did. Yeah.

2601
02:06:10,220 --> 02:06:12,300
And then somebody had to clean up their mess.

2602
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:13,780
Yeah, I don't know.

2603
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:14,500
I think they should have.

2604
02:06:14,540 --> 02:06:15,860
I think it's you doubled.

2605
02:06:16,060 --> 02:06:20,060
I think you quintuple down and just way, way more Garner Holt.

2606
02:06:20,260 --> 02:06:26,660
Yeah. Animatronics do scary King Louie's Louie, Louie Junior's animatronics bursting

2607
02:06:26,860 --> 02:06:29,700
out of every and of course an animatronic Kenny Rogers.

2608
02:06:29,900 --> 02:06:31,780
Oh, my God, that would have been the greatest.

2609
02:06:31,980 --> 02:06:34,260
Just don't mind me roasting in here.

2610
02:06:34,460 --> 02:06:37,580
He pops out of the window every once in a while.

2611
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:42,380
Do kids go like do people bring kids to Vegas in this day and age?

2612
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:45,820
I don't hear in there a little bit, but like not a lot.

2613
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:50,820
And then I bet a little and probably there's stuff you can do.

2614
02:06:51,020 --> 02:06:53,700
Yeah, it's probably more like you're vaguely local.

2615
02:06:53,900 --> 02:06:56,300
But do you really take like a big trip?

2616
02:06:56,500 --> 02:07:00,860
But even my my trip was like a couple of nights on the way to, you know,

2617
02:07:01,060 --> 02:07:03,300
elsewhere in the southwest. Right.

2618
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:07,300
So maybe it's that I think there's stuff to do if you're going elsewhere.

2619
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:12,220
But I don't know if you do like a lot of them still have pretty big arcades.

2620
02:07:12,260 --> 02:07:14,580
You know, a lot of the outskirts, casinos,

2621
02:07:14,780 --> 02:07:16,420
I think a lot of good arcades.

2622
02:07:16,620 --> 02:07:17,060
Yeah.

2623
02:07:17,260 --> 02:07:25,860
Catering to the local crowds have the like all inclusive casino resorts with like

2624
02:07:26,060 --> 02:07:33,980
an IMAX screen and a regal theater and a bowling alley and an arcade and like.

2625
02:07:34,180 --> 02:07:35,340
So that's all plenty.

2626
02:07:35,540 --> 02:07:37,660
So somewhat somewhat.

2627
02:07:37,860 --> 02:07:41,180
So if we see a kid, we shouldn't call the police.

2628
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:43,740
OK, yes, we don't need to be worried.

2629
02:07:43,940 --> 02:07:45,740
Got it noted.

2630
02:07:45,940 --> 02:07:49,620
Unless it's like an Oliver twist.

2631
02:07:49,820 --> 02:07:51,820
Part of that yourself pocket.

2632
02:07:52,020 --> 02:07:55,460
Yeah. Then call the police and get your phone out because otherwise,

2633
02:07:55,460 --> 02:07:56,940
if you aren't holding it, he's going to take it.

2634
02:07:57,140 --> 02:08:01,340
But if they're charismatic enough, I might join their little gang

2635
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:05,740
because they'll consider consider myself one of them.

2636
02:08:05,940 --> 02:08:08,060
So yeah, yeah, yeah.

2637
02:08:08,260 --> 02:08:09,460
They need a tall guy.

2638
02:08:09,940 --> 02:08:13,660
Everyone is on to their trick of two or three of them in a big trench.

2639
02:08:13,860 --> 02:08:17,060
I can't believe you're over 30.

2640
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:18,620
I thought you were

2641
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:21,100
20, young, young.

2642
02:08:21,300 --> 02:08:22,340
Look at your joints.

2643
02:08:22,540 --> 02:08:24,900
They're working well.

2644
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:27,260
Your hair, it's brown.

2645
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:34,180
Your enthusiasm about circular life at a pool party convinces me you're the most

2646
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:36,740
youthful youthful boy there is.

2647
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:38,060
I thought you were Billy.

2648
02:08:38,260 --> 02:08:39,340
I was his other brother.

2649
02:08:39,540 --> 02:08:41,060
I thought it was Billy and Phineas.

2650
02:08:41,260 --> 02:08:43,060
And you

2651
02:08:43,380 --> 02:08:47,380
meanwhile, my pockets have been thoroughly picked

2652
02:08:47,580 --> 02:08:52,580
on your weakness being complimented on your youth by children.

2653
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:58,140
Oh, that's kind of you to say you finally fully sliced your Achilles

2654
02:08:58,340 --> 02:08:59,460
your weak spot.

2655
02:08:59,660 --> 02:09:01,820
Why'd you have to do that?

2656
02:09:02,540 --> 02:09:04,140
You stole from me already.

2657
02:09:04,260 --> 02:09:07,460
You're not going to catch us, big boy.

2658
02:09:07,660 --> 02:09:10,620
You look like you're 55 in reality.

2659
02:09:10,820 --> 02:09:12,300
Oh, fuck you.

2660
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:16,380
Oliver Twist, the deepest cut of all.

2661
02:09:16,580 --> 02:09:18,580
All right. Well, watch out for pickpockets.

2662
02:09:18,580 --> 02:09:21,540
We got to, you know, we got to get on our game here because we're on the way.

2663
02:09:21,740 --> 02:09:24,820
But we've we've at least kicked off the trip here with this.

2664
02:09:25,020 --> 02:09:27,780
You survived podcast the right Sin City nights.

2665
02:09:27,980 --> 02:09:29,460
And I'm so happy we're in it.

2666
02:09:29,660 --> 02:09:31,780
Yeah, lots of fun stuff to talk about here.

2667
02:09:31,780 --> 02:09:32,220
What do you got?

2668
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:38,180
I just have you can get one of the pieces of merch, which was the King Louis plush.

2669
02:09:38,380 --> 02:09:39,500
Wow.

2670
02:09:39,700 --> 02:09:41,340
And this is on eBay for 10 bucks.

2671
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:46,020
It looks like a large head to the large head, tiny body.

2672
02:09:46,020 --> 02:09:47,540
And I just not see it good enough.

2673
02:09:47,540 --> 02:09:49,900
I think he looks I mean, he's got certainly a big head,

2674
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:51,140
but I don't know that it looks like.

2675
02:09:51,340 --> 02:09:52,260
Let's bet on how big it is.

2676
02:09:52,460 --> 02:09:54,500
Maybe I can maybe I can get one right.

2677
02:09:54,700 --> 02:09:58,980
OK, the end here, we can even up that important rule of gambling.

2678
02:09:59,140 --> 02:10:02,620
You stick around long enough, you can win it back.

2679
02:10:02,820 --> 02:10:04,940
That's somewhere in Kenny Rogers lyrics, isn't it?

2680
02:10:05,140 --> 02:10:05,940
Right.

2681
02:10:06,140 --> 02:10:11,500
Hey, keep up with PTR Sin City Nights on socials at podcast the ride.

2682
02:10:11,700 --> 02:10:13,580
We've got a

2683
02:10:13,780 --> 02:10:20,500
yes, what I just got popped up ad for some bootlegged

2684
02:10:20,700 --> 02:10:26,380
Dr. Evil and mini me figures pop up and well, like, you know,

2685
02:10:26,460 --> 02:10:29,980
there's a thing a night of you should see that wasn't a pop up ad.

2686
02:10:30,180 --> 02:10:31,900
Mike, you should see this.

2687
02:10:32,100 --> 02:10:33,180
Well, I do want to see it.

2688
02:10:33,180 --> 02:10:37,100
Yeah, I hear you talking about being concerned that you're not youthful enough.

2689
02:10:37,300 --> 02:10:38,660
Well, a couple of Dr.

2690
02:10:38,860 --> 02:10:42,900
Evil and mini me action figures fix that two grand for these.

2691
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:44,580
What

2692
02:10:45,460 --> 02:10:52,220
for Professor Sinister and Little Guy by hundreds and hundreds of

2693
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:53,740
Louis the Lions for that.

2694
02:10:53,940 --> 02:10:54,780
That's true. Yeah.

2695
02:10:54,940 --> 02:10:57,620
OK, we've got a month's worth of Sin City

2696
02:10:57,820 --> 02:11:01,980
episodes here on the mainstream bonus episodes on podcast the ride.

2697
02:11:02,180 --> 02:11:07,180
The Fremont Gate at patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2698
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:13,660
The next episode of the series will be on the high roller tier Club Three.

2699
02:11:13,860 --> 02:11:17,420
And that, as as mentioned, is selected by the Club Three audience.

2700
02:11:17,620 --> 02:11:24,060
A little more MGM grand, the 1990s Wizard of Oz, theming and walkthrough

2701
02:11:24,180 --> 02:11:27,620
at the MGM Grand and maybe some other peripheral MGM grand stuff.

2702
02:11:27,820 --> 02:11:31,740
So join Club Three if you want to hear that.

2703
02:11:31,940 --> 02:11:34,900
But otherwise, I think we're wrapping it up.

2704
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:37,900
So I guess I'll say cut.

2705
02:11:38,100 --> 02:11:41,140
No, not that kind of.

2706
02:11:45,980 --> 02:11:48,260
This has been a forever dog production,

2707
02:11:48,460 --> 02:11:53,340
