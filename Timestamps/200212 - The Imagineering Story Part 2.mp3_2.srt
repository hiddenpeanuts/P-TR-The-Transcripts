1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm Jason Sheridan here with Mike Carlson.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yep, I'm here.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And Scott Gardner.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Correct.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's part two of our look at the Imagineering Story, the Disney Plus limited series, I guess you'd call it, six-part documentary.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I think they saw a little discussion of that maybe there's more due to the success of this, seemingly.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I don't know how to measure Disney Plus success because they don't release numbers because streamers all decided they don't release numbers.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It seems like it went over well and there might be an appetite for more of this.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I think so.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I mean, I think they could do deep dives on stuff.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
For whatever reason, when Disney Plus was launching, I thought this was 10 episodes and a few episodes in, I was like, wow, they're really going fast.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What are the last few episodes going to be?

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I mean, I think if they could piecemeal ride specifically, they could do longer profiles of certain Imagineers.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I mean, I think if they were willing to give us behind the scenes looks at every new thing that comes out, or if they put a new one out in a couple of years,

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and then they've documented the making of Runaway Railway or a longer Rise of the Resistance or whatever.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It does feel like they should just use the team to do the lead up, like what they would have done on ABC to promote Runaway Railway 20 years ago.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
They might as well just use this team.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Do it this way, because then you get deep dives, you get better footage, it's not just these promotional pieces.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And the newer stuff, obviously, in these documentaries, there's a lot less drama that they reveal.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes. Well, that's what I was going to say.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The last three episodes shift from, slowly shift from history, like a look back, and people are a lot more frank and stuff has come out,

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and much more to recent history of more like making of.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It shifts a lot more to cruise ads.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Well, yes.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm going to go ahead as a complaint I have about the back half.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't know. Why don't we, we don't, I feel like the three of us don't care about these cruises at all.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Oh, I have, let me see. Did I write it specifically down in here? Hold on. I think I wrote more cruise stuff.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I have a similar now.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah, I just wrote in all caps, cruise stuff.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I had a friend who was really digging the first few, and then I said, oh, you got to make it to four.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Four is where it gets crazy with all these failures and this in Superstar limo.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And then he wrote me and said, hey, four is pretty good. I could do with less cruise ads though.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah, the cruise thing is very interesting. So yeah, if you don't know what we're talking about, there's part in four, part in five and six.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Maybe.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I think it was just four and five are the ones I remember because the Disney dream is in four.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And then magic is in five. The Disney magic.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You know more than I do, my man. I don't know the names of these ships.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
They like cram the, and I guess here's the thing. The cruise is a popular business for them. People go on them. I've never been on them.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm not like against going on them, but I think I might be against going on them.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's any cruise.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's fair. I mean, I've never been on a cruise.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah, me neither.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So I've been on one. Right. When I was pretty young. Yeah.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But they put so much cruise, like it's so much less interesting. Who gives it like, you know what?

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I could have done for one cruise segment. I thought this is the right. Yes. The smokestacks.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah. Okay. You know what? I'll say a nice thing about the cruise too. The segment is I was interested that they build the two halves of the boat.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah. And then they like put them together and like weld them together. And that's how they put the whole boat together. I go, oh, interesting.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And I like that Eisner yelled at them about how it needs to look like a ship.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah. And then you saw the mockups and there was a big duck one. I mean, that's called the mighty duck.

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I, the problem, I like that. I go on that boat. I think we might like the mighty. Yeah. I know at that age I would have liked the mighty duck a lot.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah. There's like a giant yellow rubber ducky. There's a giant like Donald Duck in Shanghai Disney. That's like floats in the water. Nice.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's like really cool. Like it doesn't look quite like that drawing, but it's giant. And I feel like if I could travel on a big duck, I would like to.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I would are like penguins duck vehicle in Batman Returns. Oh, yes. That's very good. Yeah. That's very good. So if it was like that.

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Mm hmm. I feel like it would have been that's the kind of thing you would have liked for the first year.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And now they're in year 23 of the giant rubber duck and it might. Yeah. Oh, it would look like shit by now. Yeah, it would look really bad.

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It would not have held up well. Whatever. Like the aesthetic that they used to like to design it at the time would have be, it would be wildly out of date.

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's a great segue into episode four, into the projects covered in chapter four hit or miss.

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now, when we were talking about how to discuss the Imagineering series, I do think a way to view this is like in pair.

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Like I think one and two, three and four, five and six go well nicely together. They kind of make sense together.

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That said, if we had done an episode that ended with episode chapter four hit or miss, boy, it's grim.

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Like rewatching it, I was like, oh, this is much grimmer than the first time I watched it.

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm sure everyone though, because hearing about all that and that they are like open about all of the nonsense and all the failures, it's they could have like just brushed past all this.

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And I love that we got like polished documentary with the nicest footage of Superstar Limo. I think that exists. Right.

67
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I mean, as soon as you open, they talk about like anything you do is the potential that you've miscalculated the audience misfires and that they immediately show shots of Disney Quest to the ESPN.

68
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah, thrown under the bus right away. Right away. Yeah. Well, and then those kind of viewed as like, you know, like we used like not that long ago, we were building these like massive sprawling adventure play in Indiana Jones.

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And now we built like a building. Here's like a place where there's like a pinball machine with John Madden's head in it or something.

70
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Like if it got so just got dull more than anything, I don't know.

71
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Just like less adventurous and and so like corporate branded time that like ABC.

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So now they have to plaster ABC and ESPN on stuff. They redesigned the ABC studios in Times Square, which I know I didn't know.

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And Angel Stadium. Yeah.

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Has that big rock work feature. Fake Rocks. Angel Stadium.

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
If you haven't seen an Angels game or been to that stadium, it is fake rocks.

76
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So if you're not a fan of baseball, but you do like fake rocks, you know, you won't hate all of the baseball game you go to.

77
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
They did not mention the Encounter, the restaurant in the center of LAX, that weird spidery looking building.

78
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I would have liked to not Encounter.

79
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Because that they imagine years worked on that, too, when they redid it and it was reopened for a little while.

80
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But it's never open anymore. Like it's open for shooting film and television.

81
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But it seems like any any attempt to get it back off the ground as a restaurant.

82
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I've never been there, which is amazing because I like airport hotels and bars and stuff.

83
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And but it's so it's yeah, it's barely open and it's really inconvenient to get to might be the most inconvenient thing in the city.

84
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah, why would you want to go?

85
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I had a reservation one night and then it turned out to be that night that they were trying to stop the ice blockade.

86
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, shit. Well, my Encounter reservation is ruined.

87
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I guess I'm not having firecracker shrimp tonight or whatever.

88
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Damn you protesters. Think about who you're hurting.

89
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The big thing they kind of point at in this chapter is they filled, you know, Frank Wells is dead.

90
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Eisner had a heart attack and needed to go a little easy for a while.

91
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Geez, that too. And they said they promoted businessmen.

92
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Eisner promoted businessmen. Eisner promoted businessmen to fill voids.

93
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Pressler thrown under the bus. Yeah.

94
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The biggest villain of the series.

95
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I think he kind of is. Yeah.

96
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Now, yeah. So Paul Pressler was promoted out of he ran Disney stores and was a rare case of that kind of person,

97
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
a retail merchandise person, then running the creative side of the Disney parks.

98
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And as a California resident and a nerd with no friends who was looking at Disney message boards through the late 90s,

99
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
there was no bigger enemy than Paul Pressler. Right.

100
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He was like, truly. I mean, like we'll see some scuttlebutt about JPEG this or people don't like that.

101
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But sure, sure. But I don't think he has nearly the level of fan hate.

102
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh, yeah. No, no, no, no. People were so and people used to call Paradise Pier Pressler Pier

103
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
because it was like indicative of how lazy the whole area was.

104
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Like this was his dream. This is what he wanted was like off the shelf rides.

105
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
They are. This technically rides here. OK, now now by like.

106
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And then he also helped lead seemingly to the merchandise being really boring that for being a merchandise guy,

107
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
you would think that he'd want like a crazy variety.

108
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But I remember around that time you'd go into Frontierland, Tomorrowland, Fantasyland, wherever.

109
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And it's just the same shirts that just say Disneyland. Yeah.

110
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The merchandise also got extremely boring and generic. So even his area wasn't fun anymore. Right.

111
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This is a thing I think Universal still needs some help with.

112
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Like you get the same stuff is everywhere. Yeah.

113
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Convenient if you forget something and you want to go back for it.

114
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Scott invented the best like just all this like this is not this is not a merchandise.

115
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's a food thing. But you invented the drink at Jurassic World with the Mr. DNA sugar.

116
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh, yes. Something like that.

117
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Like they don't have like with merchandise and food and beverage, they don't have the vision.

118
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
They don't have their Mickey ears. They don't have like right.

119
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Here's this like goofy thing you can put on only when you're here.

120
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I mean, they have the potential because the Harry Potter stuff is so specific and detailed and a lot of it nicely made.

121
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah. That merch is all yeah. The merch. That merch is all.

122
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The Potter stuff is great. I mean, I would argue for I think everyone,

123
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I think America needs to wake up to the Homer slippers where you put your foot inside his mouth.

124
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I think that stands a chance to be as iconic as Mickey.

125
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Here's everyone to walk around the park, dirtying up their yellow slippers.

126
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's the trouble. I think maybe OK, maybe.

127
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah, you don't want to wear slippers around a theme park. There's so much walking.

128
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So I think they need to develop like a nicer version of the Homer foot.

129
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
They need to partner with Converse or Nike or something nice.

130
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And so everyone slips on their shoes.

131
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There should just be like a shoe cubby like when you would go into like a ball pit where you put your shoes.

132
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Man, the shoe cubbies in a long time.

133
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah. You put your shoes in there when you come in and then you put your feet into Homer's mouth and then you go.

134
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's the only way. Yeah. They got a lot of work to do.

135
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
They have to build infrastructure to make. I'm just saying don't sleep on.

136
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't own them myself, but they delight me when I see them.

137
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't even know exactly what you're talking. I can I can imagine it.

138
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't think I've seen the ones where you put your feet in the home.

139
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
There's two Homer heads. His mouth is open and you put your feet into his mouth.

140
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That aspect of it, you have two Homer heads. Yeah, that's weird.

141
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Funny in and of itself. It's not like minions or there's multiple of.

142
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
There's only one Homer. So you have to buy two Homer faces and stick your feet in two of his mouths.

143
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
One of them should be Yankee Herb. That would be better.

144
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh, yeah. I mean, the fact that they don't like merch out the Simpsons into oblivion with like weird niche.

145
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I know that's shocking to me that they don't like exploit the first eight or nine years of the Simpsons with merchandise.

146
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah. I mean, they have like I have some of the toys which they have all those characters and I have, you know, yeah.

147
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Hank Scorpio and Gil and everybody.

148
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You like want to wear that big cowboy hat and have the like air blower that Homer has.

149
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And that was that during Wacking Day. I forget why he has those things that they should sell the Wacking Day, Matt, like the club.

150
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
They should sell a lightsaber experience for Wacking Day. Yes. A fan man backpack.

151
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's good. That's good. Yeah. They should sell toy Homer's car.

152
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I don't think they had the Homer, the green car that I loved as a child.

153
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I didn't understand why everyone hated it. It was bad. They played the cucaracha on every horn.

154
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And a horn here, here and here. You never find a horn when you need one. This is awesome.

155
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Lisa Pearls and Marge Pearls. Yes, that seems like a no brainer.

156
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Everyone wants to wear who wouldn't love wearing just big round pearls everywhere.

157
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The closest they've come is the Bort license plate. OK. They do sell a Bort license plate.

158
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That took a little while. It did take a little while. They did not launch with the Bort license plate.

159
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But a Mr. Plow jacket. Yeah. They're making like Chalkaline as a company that makes all these crazy jackets now with properties.

160
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Homer mouths. There should be a big brown bulbous beard line. Terrifying.

161
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Everyone should wear Homer masks everywhere. Yeah.

162
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Remember those realistic when people render a realistic human to look like Homer?

163
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Just have it be like that. Nightmare. That character should be a walk around.

164
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Realistic Homer. Yeah, realistic Homer. They got to up their game. Disney's done it.

165
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Disney's gotten better with the Mer... It was just a supremely boring time.

166
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Very, yeah. I feel. And then Pressler is really shanked at the end when they really like...

167
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Without any commentary, they just say, Paul Pressler left to become CEO of the Gap.

168
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And that tells you everything. There's technically no commentary in there.

169
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Right. But it certainly does tell you the, wow, the man in charge of Disneyland, who in charge of starting the second land of Disneyland, became the CEO of the Gap.

170
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And then I got curious about his time at the Gap and what he did there.

171
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He, of course, started kind of a second gate of the Gap.

172
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:05,000
As you guys know, everyone say with me, fourth and town. We all remember the Gap's second store, fourth and town.

173
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Wait, was it a store? Yeah. The phrase sounds familiar-ish.

174
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Just because those are words in English language.

175
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It sounds correct in the Banana Republic family of brands. It sounds...

176
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It sounds like Crabtree in Evelyn. It's like something ampersand something. Seems like a store in a mall.

177
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Well, we just haven't thought about fourth and town in so long because it was only open from 2004 to 2007.

178
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And then he was out. He thought of this new Gap brand, immediately failed and then out by no more of that.

179
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And now he's like on the board of directors of some nightmare family of brands venture capital.

180
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Just a legacy of shit. He's never made less than like five million dollars in the last 25 years.

181
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. The destruction and like a portrayal of destruction in his wake.

182
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It is a shame Robert Forrester is no longer with us because, man, he could have played Paul Prezler.

183
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's not like as soon as Paul Prezler showed up on screen, I'm like, that's what he looks like?

184
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's I was just so caught off guard. And also, too, you know, I don't I don't want to speak for Irvine and Baxter.

185
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
They're very professional, but you can just tell they're furious that they're not happy.

186
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah. Paul Prezler still. Imagine having to start a theme park under those circumstances where the like we, you know,

187
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,000
we covered the monotony of downtown Disney for so long and that downtown Disney cost like as much as they were allotted for the theme park.

188
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yeah. So stupid. And they built a very nice hotel. But even though it's hell feels like kind of like fakey, it's like nice to me.

189
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But it's not like it doesn't feel like this. Like it's not the level of Grand Floridian. Nice.

190
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And it's like detail and molding. There's pieces of it that I like a lot. But then there are some. I like it.

191
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I like it. Yeah. I think the outside still looks sort of like it looks like California Adventure Cheapo, which we get into here in a very interesting run.

192
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You get to hear, I believe the imagineers, Kevin Rafferty, who's later responsible for Cars Land, and you get to hear him just music to my ears,

193
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
just breaking down what sucks about early California. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

194
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Is that what's just all stucco and cheat that Golden Gate Bridge was bad. The idea of the Golden Gate Bridge being your entry point and where the monorail goes through.

195
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Great. That was not a good Golden Gate Bridge. It looked like Legos.

196
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And in my favorite snippet of maybe the whole series, when he says then the icon of the park is a big gold sun, like a metallic sun that could be at a mall in Newport Beach.

197
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Why is it in our theme park? I don't like a sailing malls in Newport Beach. Fashion Island is a wonderful place.

198
00:17:48,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But but yeah, truly that completely and to hear that from the guy who built what is now the icon of California Adventure and why you love California Adventure in this wonderful, detailed, incredible land to be in.

199
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What's so interesting there? I think there's a couple reasons. Obviously, it's a it's it's fact that this was a failure because they fixed California Adventure for the most part.

200
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And you really want to build up how dire it was before the hero shows up, the hero CEO shows up.

201
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yes. So I think because of that, yeah, because of that, this section of all, like almost not of all, but like this section, I feel like there could be six episodes on California Adventure.

202
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yes, please. Justin, like if they're willing to trash it and throw like press under the bus and whatever, let's get it.

203
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Because all the Imagineers you could tell are just dying to complain about what the situation is.

204
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Any SNL book, any SNL oral history, clearly the most interesting part are those bad, say the Rod Denny Jr. year, the first Eddie Murphy year that didn't work, the Gene Dominion year, the fall apart years are always.

205
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And that like Disney has that Disney has like a maze. This is definitely the Anthony Michael Hall era of Disney parks.

206
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Just years, years of everyone being frustrated and just put the camera in front of all the people that still work there, whoever they can get. And man, would that be a good series?

207
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah, that would be the best.

208
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:25,000
This is I feel like this is the last bit in the documentary because you're at a 20 year distance, but it starts to slide into recent history.

209
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And I feel like people are less critical of recent history. One, there's less perspective to a lot of people still alive. But this is far enough. It's far enough away. It was a big enough kerfuffle.

210
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Everyone agrees. Everyone agrees.

211
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
There's no like other viewpoint on this.

212
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:54,000
The combination of the smaller part of DCA, Disney Studios Paris and Hong Kong, where they're like, we build smaller parks now and everyone's like, this is not as good. What did you do?

213
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's so dreadful when Angela Bassett says that this strategy had failed for a third time. Man, and that's like darker than you'd think they would frame it.

214
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yeah.

215
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yeah, I swear though, it's only the reason is because they need to get it in the narrative to be at the lowest possible point for the hero to swoop in.

216
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah.

217
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And then he comes in.

218
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yeah, they're the villains, but they're also the heroes, which is what they, I don't know, is interesting about this whole series. It's like one hand of Disney is the hero and one hand is the villain.

219
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
We said in the last episode that we were comparing the imaginary story to Boogie Nights.

220
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yeah.

221
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And I, the way it's slotted kind of like before the dawn, when it's dark as before the dawn, I think especially the footage of Superstar Limo is like when Dirk Diggler is like jerking off in the car and somebody's watching him and then he gets beaten up.

222
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And then like, well, Don Shields got blood on his face from the robbery. And do I take the money? And like, this is, this is the grid. This is everyone's meltdown happening at the same time.

223
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Mm hmm.

224
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's a Superstar Limo is a sad car jerk off.

225
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Paul Prezler throwing fireworks in meetings, like setting up little fireworks.

226
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Who's that weird little guy? He's from the Gap. Don't worry about him.

227
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Don't worry about him.

228
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah. Ah, I fucking love this song.

229
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I wonder if they even, they, I, you know, they probably don't. I should, I answering my own question is I think it, there were like safety problems. That's a minor way of putting it during the Pressler era.

230
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah.

231
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And I was like, I wonder if they're going to even go here. They obviously did not.

232
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
No.

233
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Why would they? But like still like, that's how bad it got is like maintenance issues killed people.

234
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah.

235
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
In the grimace ways. I don't think we revel in like, let's talk about the deaths.

236
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
No, no.

237
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:00,000
This was bad. This was very like other Disney deaths had felt more accidental and that guy just didn't listen to the instructions and he flew out of the thing. This was like, this was bad.

238
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And for sure due to budget cuts.

239
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Yeah. And like what I understand is like, like a budget cuts of like, well, we're going to let it go completely broken.

240
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Something has to like break before we fully fix it as opposed to like, that's a little wear on that. We may want to replace this.

241
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I don't think any of us are desiring to talk about it.

242
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
No, I don't.

243
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's the Columbia thing and there was a big thunder thing.

244
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Yeah.

245
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That was later I guess. But Columbia was truly like, everyone look it up on your own. Don't make us be sad.

246
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

247
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
We don't want to do that.

248
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's really bad.

249
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:45,000
A lot of Disney getting dragged, I think in this one publicly. I mean, historian David McCullough dragging Disney when they, because they briefly touch on Disney's America.

250
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Yeah.

251
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Well, just again, they just didn't have the guy who handled that. They didn't have Wells, who probably could have navigated that.

252
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That's so interesting that Eisner says if Wells was alive and I was healthy, we would have just done it.

253
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
We would have plowed through.

254
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Plowed through. Yeah.

255
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah.

256
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
That's interesting.

257
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Wow. If people don't have this thing memorized or haven't watched it twice. Yeah. He had a, Eisner had a quadruple bypass. It's a crazy.

258
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I forgot about that.

259
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:29,000
No, not really. No. And that's, wow. Without that, a death and a, this is kind of a grim, crazy story. Without a death and a quadruple bypass, they could have taken over a bunch of Civil War battlefields.

260
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yeah.

261
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Built a park that probably would be like weird and unpopular now.

262
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
With a roller coaster that made you feel like you were in like World War II planes. Was that the idea? Or like.

263
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Something like that.

264
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Something like that.

265
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
That's what they say in it. I think it was World War II. There's like, there's a dueling coaster with World War II planes.

266
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
We really got to do, we're way over doing it in America.

267
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I, yeah.

268
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I, my parents, I think dad remembers, he's like, yeah, I remember it was in the newspaper. We're like, oh great. Disney, Disney Park two hours away, a drive as opposed to a two hour flight. How convenient.

269
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
That would have shaped your middle school and you might be working there now. You'd be like a blacksmith.

270
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I could be a congressperson. I was so inspired.

271
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Right. Yeah. You were, you were in the Trump administration now because you love America so purely.

272
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm the head of HUD.

273
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I did, now one things I know it had, where it was going to have, that are kind of shown in this, there's a Lewis and Clark raft ride.

274
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yes. Yes.

275
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And an industrial revolution mine car. Like you're going through a factory or something.

276
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I mean, I do want this. Obviously we want this to be built still.

277
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yeah. Maybe there's a chance. Well, there was, and then there was the weird that they were going to buy a Knott's Berry farm and reuse some of these ideas.

278
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Right.

279
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And make that the overarching theme.

280
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
We don't want that to happen.

281
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It would have also, it's not really talked about in this, but I think it's very possible that Soarin could have ended up in that park originally.

282
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
For sure.

283
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Which they frame in the California adventure stuff. Like that's the one thing. It's a, we can all admit they got Soarin right.

284
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
So it really could have elevated Disney's America too.

285
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah.

286
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Made it completely work.

287
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So nice that, yes. So that's one of the nice things in this chapter. Soarin, they really give, do a thorough talk about Soarin and Animal Kingdom.

288
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah.

289
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
This is the first Joe wrote. Joe wrote. He gets a lot of time in this and later on.

290
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Yeah.

291
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I was just going to real quickly. I love it that they were just getting like political cartoons.

292
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Like in every newspaper.

293
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And they're like, he was like, we, I was like, we were getting hammered every day.

294
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And then like fat mouse.

295
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Like a big loaded mouse with a cigar.

296
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Isner seeing these on his desk every day.

297
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Oh god.

298
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It's the one Mickey Mouse.

299
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
The one I remember was Mickey Mouse meeting Lincoln and Lincoln going, where's Grant when you need him.

300
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And it's like, do you mean that Grant would do an assault on the Disney core six?

301
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Is that what you were implying?

302
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Whoa.

303
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Where's Sherman to burn down his company?

304
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Isner in these interviews, correct me if I, he seems like he could play kind of a mob boss in a movie in his older age.

305
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
He's got the voice and the gravitas.

306
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And then when he says like, we would have just pushed through it.

307
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Like I was like, Ooh, this guy's this guy, he's got a whole new demeanor now in his older age.

308
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Yeah.

309
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
So you're saying he, we know he has acting ability.

310
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
When does he start showing up in Irishman type?

311
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
That is what I'm, yeah.

312
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Is a heavy.

313
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
We're a softy brothers, you know, one of their unconventional castings.

314
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yes.

315
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
We know they're good at like bringing unexpected people.

316
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Yeah.

317
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Who do we know that's making things?

318
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Put Michael Isner in a Michael Isner in it.

319
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Um, I mean we want to be making things.

320
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
We had Charles.

321
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Oh yeah.

322
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Let's get him in search party.

323
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yeah.

324
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Put it in a serious part.

325
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Isner in a serious role.

326
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Like a chilling.

327
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Yeah.

328
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
All right.

329
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Well you all have your own.

330
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
We named us the one person we can name.

331
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Charles.

332
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Who's making anything?

333
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Charles, help us.

334
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Charles, please.

335
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Please.

336
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It's not even for us.

337
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It's for this old man who doesn't know we're getting him.

338
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's going to be so good.

339
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Get him an Emmy.

340
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Get him best actor.

341
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Well, let him beat Alec Baldwin and best guest actor at the Emmys next year.

342
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
He has like $10,000 hours behind the camera.

343
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Lauren too.

344
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Hey, why not?

345
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
We know people at SNL.

346
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
He should.

347
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Oh yeah.

348
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I mean like we need like another guy to like a Bob Barr.

349
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
The next sort of like new figure who rises in impeachment world should be played by Michael

350
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Isner.

351
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah.

352
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I think that's good.

353
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
That's the next cameo.

354
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Audience freaks out.

355
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Yeah.

356
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
He'll kill it.

357
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Wow.

358
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
That's a great idea.

359
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah.

360
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Yeah.

361
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Muller comes back if De Niro's tired.

362
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,480
Put the wig in the eyebrows of Isner.

363
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
It's time.

364
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,480
Wow.

365
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,280
But yeah, Rhodey shows up in this in his kind of first appearance, like sort of like walking

366
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,480
through Animal Kingdom in a bright yellow hat and shirt.

367
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,560
And this also feels very cinematic, like the appearance of some, some new character oddity

368
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,440
and like, what do you mean?

369
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,360
Like that weirdo in the back is going to be part of like getting the ship back on track.

370
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,360
Yeah.

371
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,360
Wait, wait, wait.

372
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,360
No, no, no, no.

373
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,360
Let's listen to him.

374
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
The weird, he's a freak.

375
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
No, no, no.

376
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,360
But he might have some good ideas.

377
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,360
He's got a funny mustache.

378
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,120
No one with a funny mustache is a good idea.

379
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,840
It shows he's willing to think outside of the box.

380
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,840
Yeah, you're right.

381
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,280
And he didn't think outside of the box.

382
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,240
It's funny how Animal Kingdom is framed as this like scrappy.

383
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Yeah.

384
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,240
Yeah.

385
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,960
Like it's against, against, I mean, there was obviously like problems when they were

386
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,880
opening it and the animals and stuff, but also like just in conception.

387
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,680
It's like, oh, we don't, who knows if this will work.

388
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:51,160
He almost describes it as like a toss of like Michael Eisner saying, what's the quote?

389
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,620
We have the magic kingdom.

390
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,080
We should have the animal kingdom.

391
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,800
And it's like, well, yeah, that's turned out right.

392
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
That turned out good.

393
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
Yeah, that was a good idea.

394
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,120
And then he was, it's up to him to figure out what does that mean?

395
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,800
What is, what is the Animal Kingdom park?

396
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,240
And now you've got the narrative of we recruited the experts onto our side.

397
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,200
This time the experts are ours.

398
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,960
We bought Jane Goodall.

399
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,180
Jane Goodall vouching for them.

400
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:21,020
They touch on, I think they show a clip of some otters and one of the protesters explaining

401
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,880
that animals had died.

402
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,400
I believe if memory serves what happened was they put different types of plants in the

403
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:34,700
otter habitat, one of which was they should not have put there because it was poisonous

404
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,780
to them.

405
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,460
But it was such chaos.

406
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,980
I mean, they describe that area as part, what was it?

407
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:47,060
Part swamp, part sinkhole, part cow pasture that they had to turn into animal kingdom

408
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,780
that they had to turn into lush savannas and different habitats.

409
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,780
And yeah.

410
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,340
And then they, yeah.

411
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:58,820
So Jane Goodall was always like, I'm so curious with the Goodall Disney relationship because

412
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,500
like it seems like she was involved early.

413
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Yeah.

414
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,940
But like, but as, yeah, what, what, I guess you just pay her enough money and she comes

415
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,100
in and is like, they're trying their best.

416
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,260
Well then that's like sort of her vibe where she's like, they were trying.

417
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:16,540
They weren't trying to harm animals.

418
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,540
Right.

419
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,540
Yeah.

420
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:23,460
They didn't have, she's like, some zoos shouldn't exist and some zoos they're trying.

421
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,460
Yeah.

422
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,340
They, they credit her with saying like that.

423
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,540
She said that the animals should have a nice place to live.

424
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,060
Disney's like, I hadn't thought about that.

425
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,060
Huh.

426
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,060
All right, fine.

427
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,060
Okay.

428
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,060
A place to live, eh?

429
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,380
We were just going to have them in a cage, a tiny cage.

430
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,380
Food, eh?

431
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,380
Huh.

432
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,380
Okay.

433
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,260
So she helped.

434
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,740
So she helped and then she helped here with the spin, the PR spin.

435
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,740
She's still helping.

436
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,740
Yeah.

437
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,180
And check out Disney nature and Nat Geo, one of the pluses on Disney Plus.

438
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:01,460
I have not, I always read like, not that she's like Mother Teresa, but you always read like,

439
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,180
oh, you know, Mother Teresa wasn't, she had bad stuff.

440
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,220
And like, I wonder if there's a whole like ex-Bezan Jane Goodall.

441
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,220
There might be.

442
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,220
Maybe.

443
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,220
No one's perfect.

444
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,220
Everyone's human.

445
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,220
Well, that's true.

446
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,580
I mean, I didn't, like personal issues were, you know.

447
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,580
Oh, okay.

448
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,980
I'm just, I don't know.

449
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,980
She yelled at people.

450
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,980
She threw stuff at them.

451
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,980
She was mean.

452
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,980
She was mean to a monkey.

453
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,980
Shut up, Coco.

454
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,980
Stop talking.

455
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,340
Did she know Coco?

456
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,340
Probably just in passing.

457
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,340
Okay.

458
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,340
Sign language gorilla.

459
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,860
They acknowledge each other at a party, but they weren't like best buds or anything.

460
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,860
Yeah.

461
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,860
Yeah.

462
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,860
They would see each other backstage at stuff.

463
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,900
Did we talk about, did we talk about on the show where like people are saying like the

464
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,100
Coco thing was fake?

465
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,540
Coco didn't really know sign language.

466
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,820
I think that's Eva's a big proponent of like that is a fraud.

467
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,500
Coco is fake.

468
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,300
Is that a conspiracy theory?

469
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,060
Is that like the Stevie wonder isn't blind conspiracy theory?

470
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,060
I don't know.

471
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,060
I'm just asking.

472
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,060
I'm just asking questions here.

473
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,060
We're just asking questions, folks.

474
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,060
I don't have answers for you.

475
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,340
You can't put limits on that.

476
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,340
This is America.

477
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
Okay.

478
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,260
You can ask whatever question you want.

479
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,660
Was Coco a fraud?

480
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,860
Why didn't they build a berm at DC?

481
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,740
Why did they leave it so you could see active city streets?

482
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,740
We'll never know.

483
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,900
If you have the answer to these questions, let us know.

484
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,140
Hey, sorry we messed up about Y2K.

485
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,140
Remember that?

486
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,140
Oh my God.

487
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,220
People are mad at us.

488
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,660
We don't know what we're we don't know about anything that isn't berms and stuff.

489
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,660
I what do you want from us?

490
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,220
I qualified if I say I don't know what I'm talking about.

491
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,140
So I think we were not trying to be a historical.

492
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:46,180
I think we were just talking about our personal experiences as adolescents and, you know,

493
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,580
people's memory in the popular conscious.

494
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:55,060
Yeah, I said like people like parents I knew who were working on in the computer field

495
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,740
like had to do a lot of work for it.

496
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,740
Sure.

497
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,740
Yes.

498
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,740
Well, you know what?

499
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,460
Actually, I still think it's a hoax.

500
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,460
Yeah.

501
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,460
No.

502
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:07,580
And a good evidence, you know, and if that was a hoax, then is it possible global warming

503
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,580
could be too.

504
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,860
I'm just asking questions.

505
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,140
Yeah, we're asking questions.

506
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,420
You can't limit our ability to do that.

507
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,940
I can't put handcuffs on our amounts.

508
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,540
No, no, we could say whatever we want, especially behind this.

509
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,540
Delicious paywall.

510
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,540
Sure can.

511
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,540
Yes.

512
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,540
We can live it up back here.

513
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,940
We can live it up back here with our bad opinions.

514
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:30,020
Jane Goodall killed Coco.

515
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:34,700
She orchestrated the whole conspiracy that Coco could talk with sign language.

516
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,700
She planned it out.

517
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,300
Bring down a pig.

518
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,260
When Coco when it was revealed, then she took Coco out.

519
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
She took Coco out for good.

520
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,100
And she's been on the Disney payroll.

521
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,100
Take the shot.

522
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,100
Take the shot.

523
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,500
Take the shot.

524
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,500
But everything Mike just said, including that quote, had a question mark on the end

525
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,460
because we're just asking questions, just asking questions.

526
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,460
Is the earth flat?

527
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,460
Take the shot.

528
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,460
Take the shot.

529
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,260
She was just asking questions to just asking questions.

530
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:11,260
So anyway, I don't you get to watch Jorodi looking at a roof like a tin roof.

531
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:15,460
He's pointing at it and saying, like, when you look at this roof, there's a message about

532
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,100
ingenuity, there's a message about economics.

533
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,220
And you're looking at like some tin and then more tin.

534
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,100
And of course, it's well-themed and it's wonderful.

535
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,500
But as he's saying all the things that there's a message about in the roof, I was like,

536
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,500
what does this remind me of?

537
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:32,500
And it took me a minute. And then I was like, oh, Jordan Schlansky, Conan's producer,

538
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,100
who they go wine tasting.

539
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,380
Yes. And he has so many thoughts about what's in every sip.

540
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,420
And Conan is like, eat your mush.

541
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,180
There's definitely some crossover there.

542
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:47,380
When Conan's taking them house shopping or when they're looking for houses, when he

543
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,700
moves to Los Angeles for the Tonight Show, that's one of my favorites, because he's

544
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,980
talking about what he's looking for in a home and he's talking about like a certain

545
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,420
energy that he's looking for and like certain like vibrance, I don't know, specific

546
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,460
vibrancy or whatever.

547
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,540
And Conan goes, oh, you mean windows?

548
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,060
You're looking for windows.

549
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,740
OK, why didn't you just say windows?

550
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,780
Yes. Very good.

551
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,540
There's a Jordan Sienzki bit with our friend Nick Mundy if the audience hasn't seen

552
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,540
it. And Mundy bled for the pee.

553
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,900
If you look closely, he smashed a beer can against his forehead.

554
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,220
Yeah, I would have said he bit.

555
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,220
He bit the can with his teeth.

556
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,740
Yes, and he bled.

557
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,540
There's two. There's a male and female stripper in the sketch.

558
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,620
Mundy bites a beer can.

559
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,700
It's all in and it's all in Schlansky's office.

560
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,380
It all takes place in Jordan's office.

561
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:41,340
Oh, no. If you ever if you were so mad at Mundy, you wanted to watch him bleed.

562
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,780
He did. Does he bleed from him?

563
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,900
It hits his head. Is it from the forehead?

564
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,460
I don't know. I actually didn't know that he was bleeding.

565
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,180
I've seen it, but I didn't notice the blood.

566
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,060
I think they mostly cut out the blood.

567
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,260
They did not want him from the audience.

568
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,740
Mundy bites into the can and Conan, I think, is just legitimately shocked.

569
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,660
Like, oh, God, I think he does like a thing where he goes, oh, like he there's this

570
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,180
noise that comes out of him because he's like scared because that's like a dangerous thing to do.

571
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:14,740
Yeah. And like, I assume Mundy hadn't been doing that maybe since college.

572
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,700
So maybe he's not even in the best.

573
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,740
Like, I'm just saying he probably didn't want him like 20 a night

574
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,580
when he was in real good bite and.

575
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,660
Yeah. But but yeah, maybe.

576
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,820
I don't know. Back in the saddle.

577
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,980
But, you know, back in the bicycle.

578
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,060
Turn the TV, turn the TV cameras on.

579
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,300
You got to do it.

580
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,020
Old habits die hard.

581
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,900
Where he buttons this episode to with

582
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:41,460
imaginary as a place is very frustrating for business minded people.

583
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,940
Oh, I love all that. Yeah.

584
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,100
Yeah. And that's a good.

585
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,340
That's a good explanation of just creativity and business

586
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,820
working against each other.

587
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,660
And they I thought this was a nice visual of like the big painting

588
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,820
that had angry Mickey pointing at like happy go lucky Mickey.

589
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,340
Like as he's saying that, like.

590
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,580
Yeah, yeah.

591
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,220
Of course, then this rolls over into

592
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,620
the next one with the business minded person.

593
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,940
Who's a hero?

594
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,540
Who's the superhero?

595
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,260
Are we dead? Wait, before we move on.

596
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,460
I got a couple of things from four.

597
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,060
So the well, because I'm just my list is just like you get to see

598
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:26,500
when you get to see Tokyo, Disney, see shit in progress, like half mug.

599
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,180
Like human like people pushing around

600
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,860
mock up 20,000 leagues vehicles.

601
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,940
And like now that they're all my friends, now that I'm seeing

602
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,620
like a not built aquatopia, like a not finished aquatopia car

603
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:42,980
spinning around and the lava monster lava, my good friend.

604
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,660
I oh, God, you got to get to Disney.

605
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,180
You got to do it. I mean, yeah.

606
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,180
Get there. Everyone listening, go that you go there.

607
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,300
You got to go there, Jason. You got to go to Japan.

608
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,140
Yeah, but I'm going to take a bath on like Olympics year pricing.

609
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,300
If I go in 2020, maybe, yeah, I guess you could.

610
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,660
Yeah, but I want to go in 2020.

611
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,660
Yeah, maybe after I think you can get a deal.

612
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,300
There's a clip. Somebody this is not my own thought.

613
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,860
Somebody pointed this out

614
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:14,100
online that they think there's some generic roadie footage

615
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,340
at the end of him just like looking through.

616
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,540
There's a roller coaster.

617
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,660
I was thinking the same thing.

618
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,300
And people people are speculating like this is roadies tomorrow.

619
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,740
Yes, because he he physically picks up

620
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,260
the Carousel of Progress building.

621
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,380
Yes. And moves it away.

622
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,380
It looks at the land like, hmm. Yes.

623
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,580
Yeah, I didn't catch that second watch.

624
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,540
I'm so glad you brought this up.

625
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,660
This is a like this is a.

626
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,580
I couldn't figure out that because there was a big black roller

627
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,860
coaster track that looked like an internal like an inside roller.

628
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,740
It looks like rock and roller. It does.

629
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,500
And I was comparing it to Tron. Is it Tron?

630
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,820
I don't think it's Tron. It's not Tron.

631
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,100
For sure. Something else.

632
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,460
Well, this is there's been working on Marvel a little.

633
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,020
He's not. But that Marvel.

634
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,660
There's some I don't think that's could be because if he's doing

635
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,980
a little bit of Marvel, that's not the rock and roller is becoming.

636
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,460
He's not the head of Marvel anymore.

637
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,180
He was the head of the Marvel project.

638
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,900
But then that's somebody else now. OK.

639
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,940
I know that. But do we think he's doing tomorrow?

640
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,700
That's a rumor. I have heard.

641
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,060
Oh, I've heard that for a few.

642
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:22,260
Rumor around D23 was that he had been spotted for like two hours

643
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,100
walking along the people mover track in Anaheim.

644
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,620
That was how because he doesn't have the panel was going to end.

645
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,860
The panel just ended on right.

646
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,220
Was the cruise ship while there was? Yes, there were.

647
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,780
Yeah, there were Brian Cornell.

648
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:41,780
We know tomorrow and redo tomorrow and redo has been coming in some form.

649
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,860
It needs to be coming for a few years.

650
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,940
But the rumor is roadie.

651
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,220
He doesn't have a major project that we know because I throw bridges

652
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,820
the head of all the Star Wars stuff.

653
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,780
Well, he has an island.

654
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,020
Oh, yeah, that's true.

655
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,820
He announced that at the 23.

656
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,180
Yes, he has a roadies island.

657
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:03,300
But yeah, I there's been so many rumors.

658
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,900
I can't even keep them all straight.

659
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:11,020
But I've heard a rumor that they they just demolish all of Tomorrowland

660
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,460
in the end, including redo redo Space Mountain.

661
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,260
Sure. I'll take anything.

662
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,900
Anything you got. Great.

663
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:23,860
Which I would say I would sacrifice Star Tours for.

664
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,980
I don't want Star Tours to go away for nothing.

665
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:30,620
Yeah. But for some like toss together, you know, it's the I don't know

666
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,740
what they're they're promoting.

667
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,780
It's a lady in the tramp simulator now.

668
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,380
But like as long as it's not some shit like I would let all of tomorrow

669
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,580
all of Tomorrowland.

670
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,580
I'll say this, and I've gone back and forth on this a lot over the years,

671
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:46,900
but I think my current thinking is that Autopia and the subs got to go.

672
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,620
Yeah, of course. The future.

673
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,540
I mean, we we face an existential threat with climate change.

674
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:57,180
And if you're doing a land about tomorrow, about the future,

675
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,900
you cannot have gas guzzlers and a giant water sink.

676
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,180
Well, that's really is cars that exist in the world.

677
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:09,580
Millions of gallons of water just stagnant and used.

678
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,620
Like you can't have those.

679
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,020
Well, sure.

680
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:17,260
I mean, I know it's always like Tony Baxter talks about, you know,

681
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:21,820
it's your first time in driving a car and there's moments people have memories.

682
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,980
There's a better way.

683
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,300
There's got to be a better way.

684
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,100
You can replace them with like equally interesting,

685
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,900
the transformative children ride thing.

686
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,580
There's no reason that that has to be completely.

687
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:38,940
This whole documentary is about Walt was was bold and did big, bold things,

688
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,940
took big, bold swings.

689
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,620
I think what will be the first to blow up the Autopia?

690
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,900
I think that's right.

691
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,260
Kill it. Blow it up.

692
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,220
Is it possible?

693
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:51,700
Ash, is it possible that track is a new track for Tomorrowland?

694
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,780
Is that for Space Mountain?

695
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,180
Maybe. Is that possible?

696
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,660
Boy, I because I think what I think what's happened,

697
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,420
what I've read is at least like the people mover track and everything

698
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,700
is so intertwined with the land that there'd be so much construct.

699
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,780
Like you would have to at the very least,

700
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,380
Space Mountain would have to go down for a long time while they cleared track out

701
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,460
and like change the infrastructure around.

702
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:21,380
Wow. So is there just a chance of what we may as well just like redo it

703
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,580
completely, make a cool space?

704
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,780
Is it possible? Yes.

705
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,260
Make it more like Paris.

706
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,300
Is it possible that's a new space mountain?

707
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,940
It is. Please, please.

708
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:36,220
But I think the Anaheim Space Mountain, I don't know that it needs it.

709
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:40,300
It's the Florida Space Mountain needs some fixing.

710
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:44,460
And I could see after Tron opens them like fixing that track because that's

711
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,820
rough. I don't think I don't think though that the tomorrow

712
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,780
they don't feel like Florida's Tomorrowland is as big of a priority.

713
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,740
I don't think it's not because I think it's got stuff people like.

714
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,500
Yeah. And I think it eats people.

715
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,300
And I think, yeah, I think you'll probably you'll probably have to get

716
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:04,020
to the other side of the 50th anniversary of Disney World

717
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,460
for them to even consider putting their space mountain down.

718
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,940
Like, yeah, like I think that that has to run the whole year.

719
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,500
OK, sure. Not longer. Yeah.

720
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,940
But they can now that they have Galaxy's Edge open, like so capacity isn't the same.

721
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,460
People have plenty of places to go. Yes.

722
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,340
They could just say Tomorrowland is closed for three years.

723
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,500
I mean, that's what we all kind of were hoping.

724
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,060
Yeah. What's going to happen?

725
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,300
Yeah, I don't know. Jim Hill on the newest podcast.

726
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,700
You listen to the new ones. There's pretty behind.

727
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:35,820
Yeah. But I swear, Jim Jim claims Marvel's the e-tickets opening

728
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,140
in like twenty one twenty one, which I'm skeptical of.

729
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,060
That seems too fast.

730
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,660
Because I think in the last episode, I said there's no way that's coming soon.

731
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,340
And then he said, I swear, twenty twenty one.

732
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,820
Have they broken ground?

733
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,780
I don't think so. Yeah.

734
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,460
But I don't know.

735
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,980
So, yeah, but with Marvel and open with Galaxy's Edge open.

736
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,900
Yes. Tomorrow shut all of Tomorrowland down.

737
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,180
But they just put up a new sign or they put up a new sign.

738
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,740
They're going to redo the like landscaping there.

739
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,940
And they just put up a reflective wall.

740
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,100
I haven't seen this.

741
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,020
We did the wall by shiny.

742
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:06,900
Yeah. OK.

743
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,940
Which has always looked like kind of like that.

744
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,020
Yeah, I didn't understand.

745
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,380
That was a big deal. Yeah.

746
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,300
Somebody yell is now mad at us for saying.

747
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,300
Instagrammable now.

748
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,740
Is it more Instagrammable now?

749
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,340
No, maybe. Maybe.

750
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,780
But it's always they're doing those little things.

751
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,780
They're getting rid of those rocks.

752
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,540
I feel the seeds of it.

753
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,020
And I think it's coming.

754
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:27,580
Yeah. So I think Jim, the carousel progress thing.

755
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,300
Yes. Yeah.

756
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,420
Nothing I would rather say than watching that building just get removed.

757
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,620
Literally, Joe Rody himself picks it up and throws it in the trash.

758
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,620
Do something. Anything.

759
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:40,060
It's time. Let's do it. I've read.

760
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,860
So, yeah, real quick, I've just I've read versions where it's like Tron.

761
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,740
Tron is sort of the thing that gets you into Tomorrowland.

762
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,700
It's a different version of the Tron track.

763
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:53,460
OK, they keep Space Mountain as kind of as is, I think.

764
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,500
Maybe they have to shut it down for infrastructure.

765
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,700
People have speculated of putting you could like put a flight of passage

766
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,900
style thing over where the. Sure.

767
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:07,860
Where a thousand trees and just have every just make it the green future

768
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:11,820
and just the glowing, the colored lights of the Tron built perfect.

769
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,820
Yeah, it's great.

770
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,380
And there's no reason you don't have to do it as Avatar.

771
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,820
You can do it as a new thing.

772
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,140
Like a new thing. If it's a tech now, if you just want to clone it,

773
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,180
at least make it like a different ride thing.

774
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,540
Yeah. Timekeeper bring timekeeper back.

775
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:30,340
Bring the timekeeper or the eagle, the same eagle from America Sings.

776
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,580
You fly behind, fly behind him while he sings Polly Wally Doodle.

777
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,580
Jason's favorite song.

778
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:38,900
I need a minute.

779
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,220
CGI Polly Wally Doodle.

780
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:43,940
Just bliss out. We'll cut out the bliss.

781
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,660
Polly Wally Doodle 2.0.

782
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,060
Camp town races.

783
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,540
Remix my Diplo.

784
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,300
And then, yeah, so Star Tours goes away.

785
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,900
Buzz Lightyear goes away. Sure.

786
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,380
It's just it's just you can't even get into it for two years.

787
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,100
You can't just I think is the plan. Let's do it.

788
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,700
I sign off. We sign off.

789
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,380
Yeah. Future Eisner helpers as we establish.

790
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,340
Go even further with like Mike.

791
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:14,020
Mike, the Star Wars food of like plant based stuff and Boba bubble thing.

792
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:17,420
Like make it like and what they're doing.

793
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,380
What seems like they're doing in Epcot, which I like a lot.

794
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:24,820
And they need to do in parks and general more multi level

795
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,180
like spaces to hang out.

796
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,700
Yeah. Yeah.

797
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,900
Like like like the castle in Shanghai, which comes up.

798
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,460
Yes. I didn't actually realize that until watching this.

799
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,500
I don't think I did either. There's like four stories.

800
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,900
Yeah. Yeah. But like a couple different like literal like Tomorrowland Terrace.

801
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,180
Make it a terrace that's above.

802
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,900
And you can sit there and have a meal and watch lights and fireworks.

803
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,580
Go up there because there used to be a ride on level three.

804
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,500
Another ride on level two. Right.

805
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,580
Now is now you can't go anywhere. Yes.

806
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,980
So I am assuming, you know, they know that that's cool.

807
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:00,260
So they'll do that. But I feel I love hearing this roadie stuff.

808
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,500
This is great, too. Yeah.

809
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,660
I wish there was a little more than in Galaxy's Edge.

810
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,180
I wish there was a second level somewhere you could sit and just kind of enjoy

811
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,740
look out over the atmosphere.

812
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:13,500
Yeah. You get kind of elevated above the Falcon like that outside of docking bay.

813
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,460
Yeah, that's true. There's some like tears, but a little more.

814
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,140
A little more.

815
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:21,060
I mean, speaking of like finding out little Easter egg things.

816
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:25,460
OK, so Tony pitches Westcott, but it's going to cost three billion dollars.

817
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:28,540
And it's this it's this sad thing for his career that doesn't happen.

818
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,780
But then there's a meeting and then what are we going to do?

819
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,940
Let's figure out some new concepts and California adventure comes out of that.

820
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:40,580
I did a little freeze frame in that section and you can see cards indicating.

821
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,460
Yes, I did this to do the same thing.

822
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,100
It seems to be like cities of America.

823
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,300
There's like a Nashville.

824
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,180
It says Nashville, San Francisco, San Francisco.

825
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,180
We all notice this Yosemite, New Orleans.

826
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,060
There's going to be like all the big pieces of culture.

827
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,460
That's an interesting park idea.

828
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,220
That's not a bad park.

829
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,020
Not a bad park.

830
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,580
I mean, they have a see of like New Orleans Square and Disneyland.

831
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,060
They've done a little of like that.

832
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,540
Did you see what one of those index cards on the other side of the board said?

833
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,620
I think I know what you're going for, but play.

834
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,380
Oh, no, I didn't notice.

835
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,420
Oh, did it just say play?

836
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,660
It just said play.

837
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,100
And I was like, you got to be shit.

838
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,340
You got to be.

839
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:19,900
That's been I think the idea of play has been to me.

840
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,220
It went by so quickly.

841
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:26,060
And I was like, oh, that yes, stuff never goes away, huh?

842
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,940
What I saw was Chicago gangster shootout.

843
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,380
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

844
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,540
And we get our crime stoppers finally.

845
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,180
Yeah. Yeah.

846
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,660
And we're going to go to sing sing.

847
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,420
We have a guy who could work on it.

848
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,100
Reddit, Ted, Ted.

849
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,260
We know a perfectly castable person.

850
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:43,860
They ever bring this around.

851
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,740
And there's and there's another I feel like there's another one of these later,

852
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,140
like a little freeze frame there.

853
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,940
Or maybe maybe I was thinking of the ready thing.

854
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:55,740
But what else and for I mean, I we slowed you down, Jason.

855
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,460
Oh, no, I was just coming.

856
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,820
Oh, you know what? They didn't mention all of this.

857
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,060
They talked about the cruise line so much.

858
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:07,260
They did not mention the phrase that sticks in my head.

859
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,300
The big red boat.

860
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,940
Oh, yeah. It's free.

861
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:13,580
I mean, that was wrapped up by like the early 90s.

862
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,420
But Disney had the licensing deal.

863
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:21,300
I think they had two ships in a fleet operated by a now defunct cruise line.

864
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:25,020
And in the early, early Disney parades, I remember watching as a kid,

865
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:28,340
they would always be like, come to Disney World, then take the big red boat.

866
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:32,540
Yeah. And yeah, I think the guys there was the one who's just like,

867
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,580
let's just make our own cruise line.

868
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,420
But they just keep expanding.

869
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,820
Yeah. Yeah. Which has been nothing but a money printer for them.

870
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:40,780
Pretty much.

871
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:44,340
Do we tell is this in my my notes are too far away to read.

872
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,820
Was this where Eisner defends himself?

873
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:51,780
I think it's in four could be always where financial limitations.

874
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:55,820
Well, he says he says, you know, he acknowledges that people don't like

875
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:00,060
they can complain about the parks, but he says like Disney was never he's like,

876
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,420
you never want to put in jeopardy the institution.

877
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:07,340
And he says at the very least he never put the company at risk.

878
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,220
After 1983, very dramatic.

879
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:12,900
Yes. He's never going to not be a Disney company.

880
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,940
That's I think where I really felt like he was at his most mobbiest, his mob

881
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:20,300
bossiest. Yeah. Where he's like, but you listen to me.

882
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,020
I never put the company in danger.

883
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,260
I protected the family.

884
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,540
Let me tell you something.

885
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:30,540
Orlando, the greatest city in the world, the greatest city in the fucking world

886
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,700
is my city. I'm Michael fucking Eisner.

887
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,220
He's the god of you.

888
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:37,740
You got your no show jobs.

889
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,380
OK, you got your no show jobs.

890
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,380
What do you want?

891
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:45,620
You got 20 no show jobs for you wanted to ride with a little more fucking character.

892
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:46,580
Is that what you wanted?

893
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:49,540
You don't think Cindy Crawford is a good character?

894
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,060
Well, fuck you. Fuck you.

895
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,500
Should have bought more coffee mugs.

896
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,900
Asshole. We could have built more.

897
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,420
Drew Carey is funny.

898
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,100
Go fuck yourself. Watch the show.

899
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,500
Then you'll like to ride more.

900
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,340
Melanie Good, young Dakota.

901
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,780
You should have seen Dakota's face looking at her mom, Melanie's role bit.

902
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:08,780
I thought that was the that was the prettiest damn sight she ever saw.

903
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,140
Made her want to be an actress, too.

904
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,900
And she's a big star, make a big bucks.

905
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,380
I did that. Me.

906
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,180
I protected a family.

907
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:19,540
Something I was thinking about watching this again, thinking about the competition.

908
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,820
I was wondering this isn't a perfect one to one comparison.

909
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:27,180
But the Disney this era of Disney were like,

910
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,500
was this the episode?

911
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,700
Maybe it was the previous one where Marley Marty's Claris got like people would go

912
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:36,300
to lunch together and the Disney sea people would have unlimited money.

913
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:40,060
And the California adventure people would have a very tight budget.

914
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:47,820
And I wonder if the mid 2000s at Universal will be looked back in a similar fashion

915
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:54,820
because you had a run of those screen based Simpsons, Kong, Fast and Furious.

916
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,380
And that's all happening.

917
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:03,100
And then the Harry Potter division just gets unlimited money to do the most detail

918
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,900
rich like like work.

919
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:09,220
And I know some of that universal was like, well, let's put in the studio tour

920
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,140
and then we'll expand it to a bigger ride in Florida.

921
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:17,340
But it did feel very similar of like, well, there's the expensive version of this.

922
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:21,100
And then there's the kind of like quickie cheaper version of that.

923
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,060
Yeah. Yeah.

924
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,500
I mean, I've said it many times how insane

925
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,260
it is that California adventure is happening at the same time as Disney.

926
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:32,540
And seeing that illustrated, just like like what an unbelievable just like a

927
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:38,500
world beautifying project they're doing in Tokyo and then cutting and then intercutting

928
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,740
with like there's a really sad shot of like they're finishing the Hollywood area

929
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:47,260
of California Adventure and there's tarps over everything just kind of like flapping.

930
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:50,740
And then there's that milkshake with star sunglasses.

931
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:55,740
That's often like after you've just learned about like, yeah.

932
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:01,380
So we had seven cannons propelling smoke and fire into the air out of the volcano

933
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:06,780
and LED lights lighting up the lava and then a fucking milkshake with sunglasses.

934
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,380
And the other

935
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:09,940
that shit.

936
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,220
Oh, yeah.

937
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,540
It's really depressing.

938
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:17,300
It'd be like in the 90s, if like a writer from one of the Seinfeld rooms went to

939
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,860
lunch with someone on the single guy, like right.

940
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,580
How's things at the single house?

941
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,100
Things at Boston Commons.

942
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,500
I can't.

943
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:31,020
It's sort of like like if I like that, there's these like

944
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:34,060
lights in dark times.

945
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,540
It's like, you know,

946
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:40,740
Disney is like John Lovitz being on the worst season of SNL.

947
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,340
There's one good thing.

948
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:47,940
You see equals John Lovitz and the cruise lines equal Dennis Miller weekend update.

949
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,180
There were two things that worked in an otherwise dreadful time.

950
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,460
Right.

951
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,500
It's a good way to think of it.

952
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:59,260
Hong Kong Disneyland equals Randy Quaid.

953
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,860
That's like a neutral.

954
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:02,820
I don't know.

955
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:03,380
It's all good.

956
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,380
Disneyland.

957
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:07,380
It's kind of that didn't work initially.

958
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,100
Just people were just for a long time.

959
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,500
I think it took some saving.

960
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,780
That kind of works on paper like Randy.

961
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,860
Right. Like Randy Quaid on SNL works on paper.

962
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:21,020
You would think it would be a slam dunk, but it's not.

963
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,300
There was some thought.

964
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:26,140
There was some thought there because they got the Feng Shui

965
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:28,660
Feng Shui consultant.

966
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,300
And they changed the entry.

967
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,020
Like, I thought that was very interesting.

968
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,100
I like that it was like, you're about all the water.

969
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,620
No water. We can't have water.

970
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,700
One Feng Shui guy says, how about some water?

971
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,380
OK, let's go to water.

972
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,420
You're going to have problems.

973
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,900
Of course, the bench is sinking into the cement.

974
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,020
Very similar.

975
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,100
Again, history repeating itself.

976
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,060
Boy, they really drive home.

977
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,620
I mean, we know this, but like the drive home,

978
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:54,940
like these people that, you know, go and work in this country, like a country for years.

979
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,660
I mean, Tony did it.

980
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:00,220
So many of these people go over to this country and like just devote their life

981
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,420
to opening this park. Yeah.

982
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:05,300
And like, especially with something when it's like ends up being overwhelming

983
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:09,020
and underwhelming, it's got to be just so bitter.

984
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,380
It's so like draining.

985
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:18,100
I love when Tom Morris, the Imagineer, says that they were considering a done in flats,

986
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:23,940
small world style castle, that the castle wasn't going to be three dimensional.

987
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,140
That is wild.

988
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,540
Such a that really illustrates that I'd never heard that fact.

989
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:31,380
And the mock up they show is pretty chilling.

990
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:35,500
They really I get this is another thing where like there's so much stuff here

991
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,060
for the Imagineers to pitch about.

992
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:37,860
Yeah. Yeah.

993
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,060
I just want more of it.

994
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:40,020
Yeah, truly.

995
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:46,900
I also how Shakespearean is it that Roy Disney brings Eisner in?

996
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:49,900
Yes. And then shanks him 20 years later.

997
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:53,180
He's the very person he has to do it against him.

998
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:56,740
Well, it's like I don't want to spoil too much about Irishmen.

999
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:01,940
But, you know, Frank has to do the job to his best friend.

1000
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,660
You know, this is sort of who else do you want to do?

1001
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,140
You know, that's actually the perfect.

1002
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,420
Get so close. Right.

1003
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:10,940
I hear you paint flat castles.

1004
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,660
Do you want to be a part of this history?

1005
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:16,380
Yeah. I mean, that's a I'm trying to think.

1006
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:18,580
Of course, he has that a lot in his movies

1007
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:22,420
where like the guy's best friend has got to kill him and not their best friends.

1008
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:26,660
But obviously thought highly of him to make him the CEO.

1009
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:30,780
And then the opening of Hong Kong with Eisner on stage next to Iger,

1010
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:33,980
sharpening his knife, sharpening.

1011
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:37,780
So, well, yeah, now the hero, a hero rises.

1012
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:38,860
Yes.

1013
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,260
Yeah. Let's start.

1014
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,060
Chapter five is called a carousel of progress.

1015
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:47,700
And the description I saw in the app under Bob Iger's leadership,

1016
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:52,100
the Imagineers begin a creative renaissance, plussing parks worldwide.

1017
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:55,580
You're giving away the game too much.

1018
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,060
You're giving away.

1019
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,860
Well, I mean, they want it.

1020
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,500
Look, they wanted this all to get approved.

1021
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,420
That's true.

1022
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:07,060
And in and in like, you know,

1023
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:12,500
I think like sad victims of this zone, especially when they're going through.

1024
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:17,300
OK, so Pixar is killing it, but the Disney movies flop after flop.

1025
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,140
And then Emperor's New Groove is in there.

1026
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,740
And you're like, hey, what?

1027
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:22,900
Yeah, like that.

1028
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,700
Why is that? What a diss of Emperor's New Groove,

1029
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,460
which you can watch elsewhere on this streaming service.

1030
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:32,340
They again, they just need to.

1031
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:35,300
You just want it to be like the companies at its lowest.

1032
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,980
They just have to present it that there's nothing cool going on.

1033
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,220
Yeah. Yeah.

1034
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,220
And then which was true.

1035
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:45,700
I don't dispute that. No, no, it's all exaggerated.

1036
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,660
Certainly. That's what I'm saying.

1037
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:52,300
Perfect hero, Eiger, who himself has the physique of like of a superhero.

1038
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:56,740
He looks like he could play like an older Superman.

1039
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:01,060
I have somebody who's like, oh, he looks like James Bond.

1040
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:06,580
He we let's revive our discussion of can CEOs get it?

1041
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:12,580
Well, I mean, the thing I figured out watching Eisner and Eiger this back to back,

1042
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:18,820
I was like, I think one of the I think Eisner just has a warmer voice,

1043
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:25,660
like a friendlier way of speak and more endearing way of speaking and more casual

1044
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,020
and is better style.

1045
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,860
Yeah. Here's a robot.

1046
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:34,780
Yeah. And I think Eiger just a little more

1047
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,580
stiff, a little more polished.

1048
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,300
And I think Eisner just seemed a little more human.

1049
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:44,740
I think you have to let's be on a technical basis here, just like standards of beauty.

1050
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,380
We were praising the looks of Card Walker and Ron Miller.

1051
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:51,980
Right. I think Eiger is a more attractive man.

1052
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,540
He is.

1053
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,060
Well, you don't get that magnetism.

1054
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:58,460
He doesn't have the he doesn't have the style yet.

1055
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,100
He figured the style out, I think, a little later, too.

1056
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:05,260
When you see him like coming on stage here, it's like you can see he's handsome.

1057
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,900
But I don't think he's got his dress down.

1058
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,180
I don't think he's got the suit.

1059
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,620
The suit doesn't look I know it's also the style of suit at the time.

1060
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:13,460
And I think Eiger, his hair got a lot better.

1061
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,020
That's what I'm saying.

1062
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:18,460
I mean, it is queer, I ask, like bringing out the best of inner version of himself,

1063
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:21,700
because now he always looks like immaculately dressed.

1064
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,820
It's like the perfect fitting clothes.

1065
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:27,860
He's a he and the Honda Anacca are one in the same.

1066
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,540
He goes very realistic.

1067
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:35,020
He goes into imagineering and a team dresses him like they dress Honda Anacca.

1068
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:40,220
There's just roadies feverishly pointing out all the actuators like so he can do

1069
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,260
anything that a human face would be able to do.

1070
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:44,980
He can buy any company you want.

1071
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:50,500
He can he has the ability to point over and say yes, buy and he can do anything.

1072
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:51,900
Anything you want.

1073
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:55,580
This is one of the most realistic robots we have.

1074
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:57,580
He can merge companies.

1075
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,900
He's the first time a robot's been able to.

1076
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:03,540
In Lincoln era, you never could have dreamed of a robot that could

1077
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,220
know kickstart mergers.

1078
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:06,180
No, he can fight.

1079
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:09,900
He can fire 20000 people from the company he's bought.

1080
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,900
That was a little that was another bit of narration.

1081
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,180
It was a little too cutesy for my

1082
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,220
Bob Iger went on a franchise spending spree.

1083
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,740
And it's like that's one way to put it.

1084
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:23,100
I don't know that like a kid's are a

1085
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,020
toy run.

1086
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,300
How many can we throw in?

1087
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,220
It's a supermarket sweep of.

1088
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:31,660
I think we usually just call that media consolidation.

1089
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:32,820
Yeah.

1090
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:34,140
Yes.

1091
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:40,900
Yeah, it's getting more Marvel getting Marvel is like getting the giant ham

1092
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,580
and supermarket sweep.

1093
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,580
Oh, yeah.

1094
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:45,420
Yeah. Yeah.

1095
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:47,940
You got to go for that twenty dollar that big plump.

1096
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,220
That's Marvel. They're all hams, though.

1097
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:53,300
You know, if you because you that would there's it's a shopping cart with nothing

1098
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,300
but hams. Yes.

1099
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,340
And there are the fun little items, the fun little snacks that delight us

1100
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,140
through our week after we've shopped.

1101
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,300
Yeah. You're right.

1102
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:05,820
The Star Wars ham is turned the Star Wars ham.

1103
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:07,460
No, that was recalled. That was recalled.

1104
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,540
We forgot to take that one.

1105
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,380
They

1106
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:15,420
I hope in this Leslie Jones supermarket sweep that they don't.

1107
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:18,700
I understand maybe it's a more sensitive like people are eating less meat,

1108
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,660
hopefully these days, but they need to retain the hams.

1109
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,020
Impossible hams.

1110
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:27,340
Impossible and possible ham because it's so much.

1111
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:28,540
You know, we were talking about.

1112
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:33,420
Yeah, because it was so much fun to see people load a ham into their cart,

1113
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:35,860
like multiple hams. Yeah.

1114
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:37,580
One request on this show.

1115
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:40,380
My name is fine.

1116
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:44,380
It's that the Star Wars ham wasn't prepared the way that the the

1117
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:48,900
way that the the the the pig farmer requested.

1118
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:50,100
Like now make sure.

1119
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,420
Yeah. That when you serve the ham that it's done like this.

1120
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,500
I just put it in the microwave. Yeah, sounds good.

1121
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,940
That's easier. Yeah, that's a better.

1122
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:58,140
I think that's a better way.

1123
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:01,460
Better way of putting it of like, you know, like mom makes requests.

1124
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:03,180
But yeah,

1125
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:08,220
mommy said just don't don't get crazy just to the pineapple and the cherry.

1126
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:11,180
Just do the traditions like what about Chipotle this year?

1127
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:12,140
Chex mix on it.

1128
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,780
Put Chex mix and Chipotle seasoning.

1129
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:18,260
No, it's it's too much.

1130
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:22,580
One of the hams is like Maker Studio, too, right?

1131
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:27,060
Like a really expensive ham that fell on the floor.

1132
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:28,620
Who cares?

1133
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:31,900
That was the Listeria lettuce.

1134
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:35,220
God, I forgot about Maker Studio.

1135
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:36,460
Like a billion dollars.

1136
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:37,740
Yeah, the dog.

1137
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:41,620
Yeah, the dog got sick after.

1138
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:44,620
Oh, well, that happens in a franchise spending spree.

1139
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,220
What do you mean dogs can't eat grapes and chicken bones?

1140
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,220
I thought they loved that.

1141
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,660
They choked. What do you mean?

1142
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:56,660
There should be more like they should have like done an animation of him

1143
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:59,220
buying two. There should be like a cartoon.

1144
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:03,620
Iger like putting a big bag of money on desks like they should have done something

1145
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:06,180
like that, say grabbing big hams.

1146
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:10,060
That's that's one of them says Muppets.

1147
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,300
No, that was Eisner.

1148
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,260
He bought the Muppets.

1149
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:15,380
Oh, he did.

1150
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:17,380
Like, why did you do this?

1151
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:18,700
We did not want this.

1152
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,100
Tired to make it right.

1153
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,740
Yeah. To seal this deal.

1154
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:23,940
Always better.

1155
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,180
Never closed it.

1156
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,660
Yeah.

1157
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:31,220
So back to this home, the home run after home run.

1158
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:35,380
Yeah, the rest of this special knocking hams out of the park.

1159
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:40,860
This is sort of where the series starts to I get a little tired of watching

1160
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:45,420
the series because the drama is lower as we said, we can't really talk about

1161
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:48,620
anything and it is just like success, success, success.

1162
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:53,180
I don't impression in my head of how the narration starts to become

1163
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:56,100
the imagineers were in grave trouble.

1164
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,340
They had to figure out how to do a thing.

1165
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:02,900
Fortunately, they figured out how to do the thing.

1166
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:06,220
The imagineers had done the thing.

1167
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,860
And that's sort of what it becomes from here on out.

1168
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:10,580
Yes. The ear.

1169
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,500
I guess that's drama.

1170
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,980
Yeah. Which is what were they going to do?

1171
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:20,220
Right. If he had misfired the ear and chopped off somebody's neck with it.

1172
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:24,700
Fortunately, they banded together and figured it out.

1173
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,860
Yeah, it's not there.

1174
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:31,300
There is just the most superficial of problems.

1175
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,780
Yeah, that's all they're allowed to bring up.

1176
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:40,380
Usually solved by extra few months of building and

1177
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:43,500
like two million dollars extra than they thought.

1178
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,260
Like, I don't know what to tell you.

1179
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,220
It was freed up.

1180
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:49,820
It took longer and it was more expensive.

1181
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:52,420
Why there's not so much you can feel the

1182
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:55,100
scrappiness in some of these earlier eras.

1183
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:58,460
And that's why a soren in a cheap era feels like such a triumph.

1184
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:02,540
But now it's just like there was plenty of money and the money was spent and the

1185
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:05,060
money was spent on a pretty good thing. Wow.

1186
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:06,100
They did it.

1187
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,740
I mean, it's fun that there's footage like I like them.

1188
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,260
They're pitching Midway Mania.

1189
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,660
There's a little video of that.

1190
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:17,700
And I would love to have seen like the pitches for all the rides that made.

1191
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:19,980
They probably won't show us stuff that didn't make it.

1192
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:23,220
Obviously, that sounds great to see pitches that didn't make it because they

1193
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,260
might use them again. But still, that is interesting.

1194
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:31,380
Like, is if like, you know, you watch old reels of people auditioning for Star Wars

1195
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:36,260
or famous movies and it's like Kurt Russell auditioning for Star Wars.

1196
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:39,100
It does seem like that's that's you could open that up.

1197
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,660
That would be fun to look and see if they're willing to.

1198
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:43,780
Yeah, they should be more so.

1199
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:44,500
And why not?

1200
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,380
So there's like little pieces of stuff I

1201
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,540
find interesting, but they only show a little of it.

1202
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:50,580
And I sort of I don't know.

1203
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,340
Maybe I miss this entirely when it happened.

1204
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:56,500
I recently discovered this lore and it's really spelled out in this.

1205
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:00,620
And I'm sure it was a surprise to a lot of people in the imaginary story that they

1206
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:04,620
were separately preparing Car Land, right?

1207
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:07,660
I'm aware of cars, the movie.

1208
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:10,420
And then they merged it into Cars Land.

1209
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:12,700
I see our land and fake.

1210
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:13,780
Yeah, I know.

1211
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:19,540
I think there was talk of Route 66 in original DCA and it was cut.

1212
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:25,220
OK, I don't know as detailed as it became.

1213
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:28,420
Yeah, I don't know.

1214
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:33,060
I mean, I thought it was interesting when they were like they made this big

1215
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:38,540
commitment of the redo of DCA during the 08 09 like recession.

1216
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:42,180
That was an interesting bold move.

1217
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:46,060
I've already said this other places, but

1218
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:50,740
could it could have done without all those Lasseter sound bites in this one?

1219
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:51,820
I don't know.

1220
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:53,300
Well, it's tricky.

1221
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,460
It's tricky.

1222
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:58,180
There were cuts of this that were there was a cut of this, I'm sure, where Episode

1223
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:00,100
Five was all was all Lasseter.

1224
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,020
It's the story of Lasseter saved it.

1225
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:04,460
But like, yeah, not at all.

1226
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:08,660
But like Lasseter, who they kind of have erased, although they were still trying

1227
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:13,020
to get rid of his wine a year ago with DCA, still trying to get through a few

1228
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:16,420
palettes, I can help him with that.

1229
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:22,940
It's tricky because like you build a land like his his like the cars is like his

1230
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:28,060
thing, yeah, so it does feel like you have to acknowledge him.

1231
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:30,460
But yeah, I don't know what the disc.

1232
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:33,820
This is disgraced filmmaker John Lasseter.

1233
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:36,300
Like, what is the they don't really.

1234
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:36,780
Yeah, they don't.

1235
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:41,260
It doesn't say anything particularly revolutionary that they had to.

1236
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,580
I was a kid.

1237
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:44,580
I loved the cars.

1238
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:48,300
And our app, which is they go vroom, vroom.

1239
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,980
And I

1240
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:53,300
they could go fast, but they could also stop.

1241
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,100
And that's why I love the car.

1242
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,700
Lightning McQueen is red.

1243
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:01,140
And as a kid, I loved red.

1244
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:03,580
I ate apples.

1245
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,020
I

1246
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:08,260
is like stop signs.

1247
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:09,660
I like all the red thing.

1248
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:12,700
That's fun. You've done your your Lasseter before.

1249
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:17,500
And now I just did a little to do it audio, but it's all just it's yeah, it's

1250
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:21,020
Robert Earl very similarly to say little arms flapping.

1251
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:23,140
Every word gets the flap.

1252
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:25,980
It's fun. I was just that's my first time doing it just now.

1253
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:29,780
And it is a fun, fun impression to do.

1254
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,740
Well, that could be we could both age.

1255
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:34,340
That's maybe that's what we're like in our 60s and 70s.

1256
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:36,100
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Wearing a Hawaiian shirt.

1257
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,420
Big, big flapping arms.

1258
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,420
Hopefully not women running away from us.

1259
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:43,740
I would certainly hope not because we're

1260
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:47,700
like ice, like being a menace in the workplace.

1261
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,260
Yeah, I don't need hugs that badly.

1262
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,700
I can go.

1263
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:54,340
I assume people don't want to hug me.

1264
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:55,420
Yes.

1265
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:57,740
I usually initiate the and then some people will.

1266
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:59,540
And I'm actually I'm happy to hug.

1267
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:00,740
I'm just saying this in general.

1268
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:03,820
But like, I don't I don't assume not

1269
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:04,860
hungry.

1270
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:09,060
And then I feel like I maybe I'm rude if somebody's trying to hug.

1271
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:13,260
And I don't seem like I went in for it immediately in the perfect way.

1272
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:18,220
You know, you turn around one eighty as if to avoid the hug and they have to hug

1273
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,700
you from behind. Yeah.

1274
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:21,740
When I see somebody, I go, hello.

1275
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:24,100
And then I turn my back to them.

1276
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:25,860
Then they like sometimes hug my back.

1277
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:27,620
You wait. You count to 10.

1278
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,820
Make sure that they are not desiring a hug.

1279
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,900
And then you turn and begin the conversation.

1280
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:37,580
Who's among us does not love being approached from behind

1281
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:41,580
being a big surprising hug from behind.

1282
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:45,740
That's a Monday move.

1283
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:47,460
That is a money.

1284
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:50,100
There's I forget somebody did that to me like a couple of years ago.

1285
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:52,460
It is just the worst.

1286
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:53,780
So scary.

1287
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:55,420
Monday hugs are wonderful, though.

1288
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:56,420
He's good. Yeah, yeah.

1289
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:59,580
I'm not saying like I would see like but this person,

1290
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:02,140
the one I'm thinking of is somebody I didn't know even was there,

1291
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:03,620
like ran up and did it to me.

1292
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:06,060
And I was like, what the hell?

1293
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:09,820
This is I'm an adult man and like a horse.

1294
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,820
You kick if you get surprised.

1295
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:13,260
I saw out of your field of vision.

1296
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:14,060
You kick.

1297
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:16,980
Well, someone once said I walk like a fancy horse.

1298
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:19,220
Oh, so that's not a joke.

1299
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:20,540
Why was that said?

1300
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:24,060
Well, because I have sometimes when I'm like being slow, like when I'm walking

1301
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:28,340
and it kind of the lazier way, I have this weird like cloppy walk.

1302
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,300
You're a tall man.

1303
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,780
You have a graceful, you have a tall gate.

1304
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:34,140
I think sometimes if I'm kind of like

1305
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:38,460
lingering a little bit or if it's not, I'm not headed in somewhere specifically.

1306
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,940
I kind of like shuffle a little bit.

1307
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:48,420
Sometimes my friend Luke has a he's been doing an impression of it since I was 15.

1308
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:51,580
So, yeah, so there's a little weird.

1309
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,540
I don't know. Check out my walk next time.

1310
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:54,620
I'm going to ask him to do it.

1311
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:56,860
I want to see it from him.

1312
01:10:56,860 --> 01:11:01,780
His impression, too, I think at the time I was like a lot of allergies as a teenager.

1313
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:03,740
So his impression is also coupled with me,

1314
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:07,860
like like touching my face and like blowing my nose.

1315
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,220
So his impression of me is just this like

1316
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:15,300
massive a human who is like shuffling, walking while he's trying to deal with like

1317
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:18,300
excess mucus. I'm sure your confidence was very high.

1318
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,820
Very, very high.

1319
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:22,060
You I grew up.

1320
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:24,540
You're so much more together now.

1321
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:25,580
Yeah.

1322
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,900
Yeah, I was up for that clop.

1323
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:30,500
But you people describe it as graceful, I guess.

1324
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,660
Yeah, the clop is better.

1325
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,660
My clop has been fixed.

1326
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:37,460
Your clop. You had an eye glow up.

1327
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:44,940
The Eiger glow up in this episode and in Cars Land, you get to meet Zolt, the fake

1328
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:48,860
rocksmith, Zolt.

1329
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:51,260
Zolt's very much seems like a protege of

1330
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:57,340
Brody, because Zolt has some very fascinating style, stylistic choices.

1331
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:03,380
Yeah, I never knew that the fake rocks were made by like a guy who's like

1332
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:05,740
Martin Short in Father of the Bride.

1333
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:07,460
He's like a

1334
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:10,260
kooky. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1335
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:12,380
Zolt, the fake rock man.

1336
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:15,100
Namesake of the Disney wedding pavilion.

1337
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:15,860
What's that?

1338
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:19,740
Martin Short's character in Father of the Bride, the Disney wedding pavilion at the

1339
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:22,820
Grand Floridian is named after that character.

1340
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:24,220
That's funny.

1341
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:26,100
That is such a great Easter egg.

1342
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,300
Yeah, I kind of like that.

1343
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:30,180
Franck has got to come back and Disney Plus, right?

1344
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:31,540
Full Franck series.

1345
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:32,620
Full Franck series.

1346
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:34,540
70 year old Franck.

1347
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:35,220
Yeah.

1348
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,780
Fresh off the morning show.

1349
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:38,700
Can they? Yeah.

1350
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,100
What? Is Martin Short in the morning show?

1351
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,180
Yeah. Oh, no.

1352
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:46,860
Playing a character named Dick Lundry, which rhymes with Nick.

1353
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,740
It almost rhymes with Nick Mundy.

1354
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,580
Oh, yeah. Very close to his Twitter handle.

1355
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:51,340
Dick Fundy.

1356
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:52,260
That's a good point.

1357
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:53,980
Dick Lundry.

1358
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:58,740
Disgraced director Dick Lundry, who was a whole song and dance in the morning show.

1359
01:12:58,740 --> 01:12:59,740
You get to see.

1360
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:03,260
Yeah, because you're like, well, so is this guy like a stand in for Woody Allen?

1361
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,260
I guess. Yeah, that must be it.

1362
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,940
And then you watch him perform a song and dance.

1363
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:11,060
Like, well, now I don't know what he is.

1364
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:12,260
That's unbelievable.

1365
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:14,140
Sure. We're going to sing and dance, right?

1366
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:15,620
He's playing like a Woody Allen type.

1367
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:16,860
Would he really? Yeah, sure.

1368
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:18,420
Yeah, I know.

1369
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:20,820
It's very like you haven't seen it, Jason.

1370
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:21,780
You got to see it.

1371
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,700
And I do like Citizen Kess.

1372
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,060
A certain man.

1373
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:28,700
It's like a big song celebrating Steve Carell.

1374
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,620
The man. It's such a sorkin.

1375
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:35,380
It's not a sorkin show, but it's such a sorkiny like sounds like the worst part.

1376
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:35,820
Yeah.

1377
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:36,780
It's in the past.

1378
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:37,900
So it's very newsroom.

1379
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,020
Yes, yes, yes.

1380
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:41,460
And but it's also a studio 60 ish.

1381
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:42,020
Yes.

1382
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:45,180
Well, Gilbert and Sullivan love Gilbert and Sullivan type.

1383
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:46,700
Oh, no.

1384
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:47,820
You know what I'm saying?

1385
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:50,180
If people have not done, let's say I know we're talking about another streaming

1386
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:54,820
service here, the morning show starts real strong, then it gets kind of boringly OK.

1387
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:58,460
And then it finishes wonderfully schlocky bad.

1388
01:13:58,660 --> 01:13:59,420
Oh, boy.

1389
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:01,820
Like, just stick it out or just skip ahead.

1390
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:03,780
Just don't jump to the last three.

1391
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:04,980
You can just. Oh, yeah.

1392
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:07,540
Go to Vegas, get to Vegas, get to Vegas.

1393
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:08,900
And now morning shows rolling.

1394
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:11,860
I haven't done all of it, but I've seen a couple episodes and then the clip of.

1395
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:12,860
Have you been to Vegas?

1396
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:14,180
No. Go to Vegas.

1397
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:15,300
It's all about Vegas.

1398
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,220
I won't even tell you what's up in Vegas.

1399
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:19,300
We get so sorkiny.

1400
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,740
Oh, my God.

1401
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:22,700
We're visiting past events.

1402
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,100
Just get to it.

1403
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,940
Get your ass to Vegas.

1404
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:29,540
All right. All right.

1405
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:30,740
What else?

1406
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:32,100
Oh, my God.

1407
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,060
The

1408
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:38,540
camera, everyone's mean to Kim Irvine because we're putting changing attractions.

1409
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:39,860
Yeah. Running thing.

1410
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:43,380
I know I feel so bad for her that I said, I think I said in the other.

1411
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:45,140
There's an article about her when she was

1412
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:47,540
what she was redoing the colors on the castle.

1413
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:50,700
She's just so concerned with like making people happy.

1414
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:54,180
Yeah. And people are so who's making her afraid to go out at night?

1415
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:56,540
She says she was afraid to go outside.

1416
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:58,220
Yeah. Cool it on Kim.

1417
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:00,740
What are you doing? She sees she's very nice.

1418
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:02,380
She tries hard.

1419
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:03,260
Yeah.

1420
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:05,380
Delivers like, I don't know.

1421
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,820
I think the characters in Small World are cute.

1422
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:08,700
Yeah, I know.

1423
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:12,860
Imagine her wants to put Cinderella into a ride about dolls.

1424
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:14,100
How dare you?

1425
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,180
You go live in a hole.

1426
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:17,980
I don't understand this one.

1427
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,340
Why was anyone ever mad about this?

1428
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:21,420
Everybody cool it.

1429
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:23,900
Haunted Mansion Holiday, a huge hit.

1430
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,340
Runs a little long for our taste, but huge.

1431
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:27,900
You can't deny those lines.

1432
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,340
You know, you can't deny this.

1433
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:31,420
I'm still not against it.

1434
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:36,780
I'm taking I'm sticking with I'm fine with it and I'm fine with the timeline.

1435
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:38,180
Oh, you you're fine with it.

1436
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:39,820
September to December.

1437
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:41,740
Yeah. OK.

1438
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:47,700
People really need I need my Haunted Mansion on Halloween Day.

1439
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:51,140
I need this so much that I'm going to be mad about it.

1440
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,060
Well, it was fun to go on the

1441
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:57,380
mansions. I realize that's so fired up about it really.

1442
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:00,700
I go to the parks if you haven't heard fairly often.

1443
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:03,020
So it's not like I don't get to go on it.

1444
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:05,980
But I get the argument that it's a little too it would be interesting.

1445
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,580
Like it would be fun to go on Halloween.

1446
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:08,580
I just don't.

1447
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:13,580
I'm like I enjoy the change up and I enjoy the change of two.

1448
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:17,260
So I this is not like I don't really

1449
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:21,540
it could be a couple of I feel like the tide turned where people now hate the thing.

1450
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:23,860
Well, I still think that that's a minority.

1451
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:27,780
I still don't think because the lines are still crazy for it.

1452
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:31,220
It's always like double the amount of the regular Haunted Mansion.

1453
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:35,260
It's these vocal minorities that that's that sounded horrible.

1454
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,940
And I just said, oh, God, oh, my God.

1455
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,220
That's OK. Let me finish this.

1456
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:43,220
You're a cancer theme park, a small group of detractors.

1457
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:44,180
There. Thank you.

1458
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:45,300
Thanks for saving my.

1459
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,500
Oh, God, please.

1460
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:49,100
No one use that clip.

1461
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:52,740
We're going to go through your Lasseter impression.

1462
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:53,900
No, that's not going to help.

1463
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:57,300
Oh, sorry. I mean, we're going to need what I can only assume is the fixer

1464
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:58,700
character from the morning show.

1465
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:01,220
There's got I'm assuming there's a fixer or a crisis matter.

1466
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,220
We need Ray Donovan.

1467
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:03,100
We need Ray Donovan.

1468
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,140
Not really. That's the problem there.

1469
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:09,180
If they be on they'd be on Cloud 9 if there was a if they had a solid fixer,

1470
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:10,820
they spent all season trying to fix it.

1471
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:11,900
It doesn't get fixed.

1472
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:12,820
It's tough game.

1473
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:14,060
Morning show game.

1474
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:19,620
Well, I think I wrote Bob Iger is the fixer of the Disney company on my note.

1475
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:21,500
Oh, he's the Michael.

1476
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:22,580
He's Michael Clayton.

1477
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:24,500
Yeah, Disney.

1478
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:26,420
He comes in and cleans up the mess.

1479
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:28,420
Sure. Yeah, yeah.

1480
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:29,260
He does it.

1481
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:34,300
We put sparkles on Peter Pan and Peter Pan makes it all in a small world.

1482
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:35,220
It's all better now.

1483
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:38,540
This one's the but I'm if I will say five is my least favorite episode

1484
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:40,780
because six you get like the new cutting edge.

1485
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:43,340
Yeah, dogs, avatars, the Star Wars.

1486
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:44,220
I think that's fair.

1487
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:46,940
And this one's just kind of like, OK, world of color.

1488
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:50,180
Fine. There is the ducks.

1489
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:52,620
There's a cute moment where some ducks take up

1490
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:56,300
habit, like start living in the Peter Pan construction site.

1491
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,260
That was cute. Yeah.

1492
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:01,060
The they talk about

1493
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:05,180
designing lands with no or more minimal queue lines.

1494
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:09,580
Very interested in that design area, the virtual queues or the play.

1495
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:12,940
I feel like the play area, like the the Dumbo.

1496
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,940
You don't really wait in the line for Dumbo in Florida.

1497
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:19,340
You go in like a play area and then they call your number, whatever.

1498
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:23,660
I'm interested in how that goes on, how it develops.

1499
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:24,980
Uh huh.

1500
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:27,500
Yeah, it's not working for everywhere.

1501
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:30,820
Yeah. Tease Jimmy Fallon episode.

1502
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:34,060
Yeah, they show too much.

1503
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:35,460
I watched the Mystic Manor.

1504
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,700
I have never watched a Mystic Manor ride through.

1505
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:38,340
Oh, really?

1506
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,980
So this I was like, all right, fine.

1507
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:40,300
I'll watch.

1508
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,780
Because like, am I going to go to Hong Kong soon?

1509
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:43,540
Probably not.

1510
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:45,500
But I watched that stuff.

1511
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:47,900
I have broken and watched that right through.

1512
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:49,020
It's so good.

1513
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:50,060
I know. Good.

1514
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,940
And it really reads as a ride through to.

1515
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:55,820
So I can only imagine being there using music to tell the story.

1516
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:56,820
I thought was interesting.

1517
01:18:57,020 --> 01:19:00,380
Getting Danny Elfman to make original music for it.

1518
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:02,420
Again, very interesting.

1519
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:03,980
Yeah, I got that.

1520
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:07,420
The earthquake, the Japanese earthquake segment is very moving.

1521
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:09,860
Oh, my God. Yeah, it is.

1522
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:11,380
It's a devastating.

1523
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:15,220
So, you know, I got to maybe I'm underrating episode five because it is this.

1524
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:20,580
Which is that is probably the major heart emotional highlight of it.

1525
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:22,020
I always wonder.

1526
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:26,140
I'm always like everyone who's involved is like getting very emotional about it, too.

1527
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:28,580
So I shouldn't like doubt its claim,

1528
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:31,700
but I'm always like a little suspicious of corporate propaganda.

1529
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,020
But I still was like very.

1530
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,020
Asking questions.

1531
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:38,900
And I mean, I remember just like in general,

1532
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:43,300
like when something people love reopens after a horrible tragedy, it's such a

1533
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,060
cathartic. Yeah.

1534
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:46,460
Like SNL.

1535
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,140
Much like. Can we be funny?

1536
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:51,300
Can we be funny? Can we ride rides again?

1537
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:54,420
And so just so OK, so when this overlay,

1538
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:55,940
and you guys will be fine with this, right?

1539
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:58,340
Duffy is Giuliani.

1540
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:01,380
The signal that we're ready to reopen.

1541
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:02,540
Uh huh. Yeah.

1542
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:03,620
Great. Moving on.

1543
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:05,300
Everyone approves. That's yeah.

1544
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,860
That's one to one. Yeah.

1545
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:11,180
It is very know that there's Duffy's being handed out posts.

1546
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:12,180
Oh, I know.

1547
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,780
That's how do you not well up?

1548
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,580
I know. It's really.

1549
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:18,740
Yeah, it's really people.

1550
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:23,940
I remember people posting on Twitter as that was happening and people.

1551
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:27,540
Yeah. Being given blankets, everyone being fed and taken care of.

1552
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:29,580
Yeah. Yeah.

1553
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:32,340
So I guess, yeah, I guess the end, it ends strong.

1554
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:35,660
It ends with it does well.

1555
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:40,020
But this one has because we've said there's some very good cliffhangers.

1556
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:43,540
This one, you know, indicating the rise of Eisner.

1557
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:46,220
There's just cool ones in general that the company might stop making parks.

1558
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:47,860
This one, I think, is the worst cliffhanger

1559
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:52,780
because it implies that the company's future depends on Robert Eiger

1560
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:56,180
making a business deal with China.

1561
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:59,420
Yes. Well, how will this play out?

1562
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:02,020
The the phrase

1563
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:05,540
for the 60th Disneyland Park looked immaculate.

1564
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:07,340
That is not how I remember it.

1565
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:10,060
I remember it looking a little chintzy.

1566
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:14,380
It had some blue some ribbons, some ribbons that were up for a while.

1567
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:16,420
It did look better than it had.

1568
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:19,740
It looked better than it had, but there wasn't really.

1569
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:23,900
I mean, the 50th seemed grim, but like the 60th didn't seem.

1570
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:29,380
After all that 2012 plus up, the 60th felt very quiet to me.

1571
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:31,860
I just remember it like it looking better.

1572
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:34,660
That's all this around.

1573
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:37,900
It's around the time, though, and it ties into this,

1574
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:41,220
like the Shanghai is sucking up the budget.

1575
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:42,300
That is true.

1576
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:45,820
I don't know how it actually ends up lining up.

1577
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:49,140
Now, it's I know very little about Shanghai

1578
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:52,780
because we don't do a lot of watch and ride through the things.

1579
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:54,460
You know, so things that come up like that.

1580
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:56,300
There is a whole big area in front of the

1581
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:59,860
castle called the Gardens of Imagination and his rides in that.

1582
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:01,660
It's not just like a little hub, things like that.

1583
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:02,380
I did not know.

1584
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:06,660
So I'm so this thing was educational Shanghai wise and Shanghai seems incredible.

1585
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:09,780
Oh, yeah. I mean, I watched the Pirates ride in the.

1586
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:10,340
Yeah.

1587
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:10,860
And Tron.

1588
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:11,860
Obviously, those are great.

1589
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:15,540
Those seem like two of the greatest rides on Earth, probably for sure.

1590
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:20,780
And I there's been rumors of them building a version of the Pirates, right?

1591
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:23,900
Because like Tron is coming, obviously, so we'll get to do that.

1592
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,660
But you would think they have this crazy

1593
01:22:25,660 --> 01:22:28,940
ride system for pirates that they have not used anywhere else yet.

1594
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:29,460
Yeah.

1595
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:31,340
So there was rumors of like a Jungle Book

1596
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:34,460
version of like the Pirates ride coming.

1597
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:37,460
The boat guided by magnets, right?

1598
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:37,860
Yeah.

1599
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:39,660
So it can spin and move you.

1600
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:44,140
I heard the rumor was Epcot in like a new pavilion, maybe.

1601
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:45,300
But a giant ticket.

1602
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:47,460
I don't know if that's just the thing I read.

1603
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:49,940
So but yeah, it's such a like one of the best.

1604
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:52,900
So many different like ride, like like

1605
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:57,940
technologies and newer versions of it, there's like that big screen area that you

1606
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:02,020
can do like project, I don't know if it's 360 completely, but it's like,

1607
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:03,260
you know, I'm talking about when you go

1608
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:08,420
like under the water and the Pirates Shanghai ride, like crazy stuff.

1609
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:11,460
There's this discuss, I saw people were a little mad about this.

1610
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:16,380
But imagine your Bob Weiss says that for when he takes

1611
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:21,380
Chinese guests around pirates who have no nostalgia for pirates, that they say

1612
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:22,940
that the ride is slow and boring.

1613
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:23,260
Right.

1614
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:26,300
And I saw people upset about that or how dare you had to.

1615
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:30,540
But like, it's also a you can't argue their perspective.

1616
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:31,500
Sure.

1617
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:38,180
And B, don't we want to even think that the stuff that we think of as the Bible

1618
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,420
could be improved a bunch?

1619
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:40,740
Sure.

1620
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:43,020
I think that's like, I think he has the forward thinking.

1621
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:44,140
I don't agree with it.

1622
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:48,820
I love pirates, but like you don't get this incredible new ride without.

1623
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:55,020
But if you don't have the reference point for it and the historical perspective,

1624
01:23:55,220 --> 01:24:01,300
I mean, I'm sure there is plenty of Chinese culture I would not understand or

1625
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,940
stuff I would say was slow and boring.

1626
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:08,820
But it's like, no, no, this is like the keystone to something.

1627
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:09,420
Sure, sure.

1628
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:12,260
There's probably teens, though, that would go on pirates right now.

1629
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:15,620
And they've been to six flags and they've been to other places and going on rides

1630
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:17,140
and go, this one's boring.

1631
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:17,740
Yeah.

1632
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:18,340
Slow.

1633
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,940
This is where the Breck Eisner story comes from.

1634
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:22,140
Which is fine.

1635
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:25,820
I think what you need is a mix of I think if that this is slow and boring and then

1636
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:31,100
you rip out something that's sweet and charming, I think that's a bummer.

1637
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:36,740
But if you're just building new, I think the optimal Disney park has

1638
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:42,460
like little sweet, charming things and crazy high tech and thrilling stuff, too.

1639
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:44,340
That's the optimal balance.

1640
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:50,180
In 2020, there's no reason to recreate the ride that opened 50 years ago.

1641
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:52,020
Yeah, there's no reason to do that.

1642
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:52,940
Yeah. Yes.

1643
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:56,980
Why would you just go and stamp just because, yeah, people expect it to be

1644
01:24:56,980 --> 01:24:58,220
the exact same, I don't think.

1645
01:24:58,420 --> 01:25:02,940
And if tastes differ, I mean, they make a point of like, yeah, Main Street is

1646
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:04,820
different. There is no railroad.

1647
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:06,860
There is no steam, but they don't.

1648
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:14,380
These things did not come in the same way in this country, and they don't really

1649
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:18,100
have the affection for it or the knowledge base for it that it would be

1650
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,660
enticing to them.

1651
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:20,460
Sure, sure.

1652
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:23,220
No small world, no Haunted Mansion, no Jungle Cruise.

1653
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:24,820
Yeah, that's a crazy Disneyland.

1654
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:30,180
No small world feels a little I don't

1655
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:31,300
that one feels weird.

1656
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:32,860
Some of this feels weird.

1657
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:34,300
Some of the.

1658
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:35,660
What do you mean?

1659
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:38,500
The Chinese governmental system of like

1660
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:43,100
the Communist Party, but it's also the most capitalist place on Earth.

1661
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:47,180
They have a space program that launches over villages and parts of rockets fall

1662
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:50,060
off on the like, you're saying there's some weird shit in China.

1663
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:52,500
The weird parts of the government.

1664
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:56,340
It's sort of like it wouldn't have been appropriate to put that into China.

1665
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:58,540
Is there one in Hong Kong?

1666
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:00,860
I don't know the answer to that.

1667
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:02,700
I'm not sure.

1668
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:07,780
But I mean, I think that they can't have Winnie the Pooh because people make fun

1669
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:12,180
of President Xi Jinping because he looks like Winnie the Pooh.

1670
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:14,140
And you can't insult the president.

1671
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:16,860
It's like, OK, well, that's a little.

1672
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:20,500
Well, that's I mean, the politics of putting these parks in different countries.

1673
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:21,100
Yes.

1674
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:23,700
Any other returned bears?

1675
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:29,740
Could you have the guy like Robin Hood's friend, Little John, Little John?

1676
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:33,220
Like that would be OK just because nobody's made that comparison.

1677
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:34,620
Right. But then if you built a whole

1678
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:38,820
ride about Little John, we're going to visit Little John Little John's forest.

1679
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:42,460
But then like that day, somebody said, oh, it's like Xi Jinping.

1680
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:44,460
Then, yeah, it's got to go coming out.

1681
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:48,220
Yeah. They had a country bear Jamboree and somebody called him Big Al.

1682
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:49,580
That's rough coming out.

1683
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:51,780
I think you can't even play with fire with country.

1684
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:53,820
Oh, yeah. No, no, no.

1685
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:59,340
Yeah. Does he is it about the appearance or does he is he like a bear?

1686
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,700
In any way, Cuddly is the is he?

1687
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:04,620
I don't know. I don't have the idea.

1688
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:05,580
I don't quite know.

1689
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:10,660
I think people picked up on it on the Internet that like Disney is coming to China.

1690
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:15,020
It's like, oh, you know, the president's kind of a little round, like low.

1691
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:17,500
And those people were all shy.

1692
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:23,580
And yeah, she's check them out at the bodies exhibit.

1693
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:26,180
The bodies exhibit.

1694
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:28,300
So that's behind the second gate.

1695
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:30,660
I mean, look, I know here is here, right?

1696
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:31,660
No, no, no, no.

1697
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:33,380
Owners, they got to subscribe.

1698
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:36,860
You know, five thousand years of culture.

1699
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:41,700
I you know, it's a really lame thing in this that you

1700
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:45,580
hearing this, you know, in the imaginary story documentary, you get to hear where

1701
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:48,220
the Haunted Mansion came from, you know, the story about Pirates of the Caribbean.

1702
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:52,100
And then you get to hear how Robert Ager thought of the phrase authentically

1703
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:56,460
Disney, but distinctly Chinese, and then you hear about it again.

1704
01:27:56,620 --> 01:28:01,660
It's like your dad repeating a not that good story to you several times.

1705
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:04,100
That's so that's how I thought of this.

1706
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:06,740
That's so yeah, that is.

1707
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:11,580
I just remember it occurred to me just so like I didn't even

1708
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:14,220
know effort just like a flash.

1709
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:16,180
So poetry, I don't know.

1710
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,420
Is it possible that's like his biggest

1711
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:21,820
contribution to the whole project other than giving like funding it?

1712
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:24,020
Is it like, you know, like he thinks I think.

1713
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:26,060
Right. Like that's like this was the best

1714
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:31,420
thing I did were pretty we're being like we have soft hands about this one emperor

1715
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:35,060
in this episode and then about another one where you have to pretend that

1716
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:39,340
authentically Disney, but distinctly Chinese is an important cultural

1717
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:40,660
contribution. Yes.

1718
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:42,340
Make sure you show it again.

1719
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:45,300
You know, I think is I'm disappointed is

1720
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:49,900
that I did not try to speak Chinese at the opening of Shanghai like Eisner,

1721
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:53,100
what if, yeah, and butchered the language.

1722
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,700
Look, I for one welcome our Chinese over at Lourdes.

1723
01:28:55,700 --> 01:29:00,740
But I will be the first to say I do not understand this country that is everything

1724
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:05,820
all at once like Blade Runner, billions of people

1725
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:11,180
in a Blade Runner esque like the most futuristic buildings and then also ghost

1726
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:14,780
towns because they built towns for the Olympics and no one lives in them.

1727
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:16,820
And we'll learn.

1728
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:20,420
Wow. You'll get out works when that's how America is.

1729
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:21,700
Well, yeah, sure.

1730
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,380
Yeah, we'll be there in a few years.

1731
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:24,700
We'll be there in a few years.

1732
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:26,980
They don't get into this is that this is

1733
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:30,140
the Shanghai thing at the time when they were building Shanghai Disney.

1734
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:31,900
It was way behind schedule.

1735
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:34,260
They they allude to that in the special

1736
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:37,860
that there were issues and like people were Iger was talking about how stressed

1737
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:42,500
he was about it, but I remember this time because I'm selfish.

1738
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:46,620
I remember this time being, well, we were going to build some cool stuff,

1739
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:49,500
but the money's all going to Shanghai.

1740
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:51,420
It's over. It's all going over budget.

1741
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:53,460
And I do remember around this time,

1742
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:57,460
like garbage cans filling up with garbage in Disneyland.

1743
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:59,740
I remember like they've cut maintenance.

1744
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:01,340
That's what message boards were saying.

1745
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:06,100
And I do remember going like I can feel like they have cut staff here.

1746
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:10,180
I remember almost getting crushed in a crowd on Main Street for like a parade

1747
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:13,980
because there was no one directing like, all right, here, if you're going to stand

1748
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:17,340
and watch from here, if you're just trying to walk and then people getting irate.

1749
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:18,940
And I'm like, where are you?

1750
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:20,580
Like I found the cast.

1751
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:22,060
I was like, what is going on?

1752
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:25,660
Like some fights about to break out if you don't get down there.

1753
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:28,380
Like I remember this time in Disneyland.

1754
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:29,980
Yeah, I remember.

1755
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:32,500
Yes, it would always be like, oh, Shanghai.

1756
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:37,100
They have the budget problems and every other park is feeling it.

1757
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:41,860
Yeah. 2012 to like Guardians and Avatar opening.

1758
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:46,580
There was like pretty minimal development, I feel like, in terms of new attraction.

1759
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:48,100
Oh, yeah.

1760
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:49,420
Guardians.

1761
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:52,940
This is the episode where Guardians and Avatar open the same weekend.

1762
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:53,620
Wow.

1763
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:55,740
Rhodey just just

1764
01:30:55,940 --> 01:31:01,740
goes to go both his projects hitting at once like Phil Collins being both live aids.

1765
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:03,300
It's

1766
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:04,500
all.

1767
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:05,980
Yeah. Wow.

1768
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:13,260
It's crazy that I don't know why my brain, my brain thinks Avatar opened five

1769
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:16,500
years earlier than Guardians or like a few years earlier.

1770
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:17,140
It's not.

1771
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:20,020
No, I guess it's just a different coast.

1772
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:24,740
That description that it's like tossing a baby up and down and it makes you laugh.

1773
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:28,620
Like, wow, that just explains what is the sink.

1774
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:35,460
Yes, completely explains what that ride is and why it is worth doing and having a

1775
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:37,340
different version than Tower Terror.

1776
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:42,740
Yeah, he really lays it out, the whole thing in such a way that's very clear.

1777
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:45,740
I mean, sometimes, yes, he's very like heady when he's describing things.

1778
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:48,100
But that one's just succinct as can be.

1779
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:48,500
Yeah.

1780
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:49,660
And that's they ask him.

1781
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:50,620
I don't forget which one it is.

1782
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:52,340
They ask him, like, do you ever get it?

1783
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:55,540
Do you ever get a sign stuff that you're not excited about?

1784
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:56,540
And he says, yes.

1785
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:57,020
Yeah.

1786
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:57,900
But Avatar.

1787
01:31:58,100 --> 01:31:58,580
Yeah.

1788
01:31:58,780 --> 01:31:59,340
Yeah.

1789
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:01,780
But like, I wonder if I don't know.

1790
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:03,700
I wouldn't think he would be like super

1791
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:09,420
excited to destroy a ride everybody likes and have this.

1792
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:09,700
I don't know.

1793
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:10,500
He just doesn't.

1794
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:12,740
It doesn't seem like a fit for him.

1795
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:16,980
He doesn't seem like an irreverent or whatever he says about the movie.

1796
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:20,700
But like he figured he did figure all the angles out.

1797
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:26,460
Hey, that's yeah, he might have that ability to like, I'll I'll find my in on this.

1798
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:26,860
Right.

1799
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:27,780
Make it work.

1800
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:32,780
And it is like it's using that ride system in a different way.

1801
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:34,060
It's not scary.

1802
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:35,620
It's like there's thrills.

1803
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:38,340
And the baby thing is I never even thought about that.

1804
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:42,540
He got the music like, oh, people like the old music.

1805
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:44,660
In these movies, like people like the sound.

1806
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:45,980
Let's get some songs.

1807
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:50,900
He just sold the seemingly the feel of Guardians of the Galaxy into like a like

1808
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:52,980
more than the story.

1809
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:53,540
Yeah.

1810
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:56,020
Let's let's portray all the things that happen in the movie.

1811
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:57,820
Just like got the vibe really.

1812
01:32:58,020 --> 01:32:58,660
Yes.

1813
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:03,300
He like, yeah, he's he's he's a good I'm trying to think what you would an

1814
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:07,100
interpreter or what like he's he's good at synthesizing.

1815
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:11,940
I mean, there's no one I think I would want to redoing Tomorrowland more.

1816
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:14,820
It's great news because it seems like

1817
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:20,380
an optimist and very and then future forward thinking, future thinking of like,

1818
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:23,700
I'm not going to design this for the future of twenty twenty one.

1819
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:26,500
But like the future that will like stick around.

1820
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:31,540
Everything he does is authentically Disney, distinctly roadie.

1821
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:34,380
Very good.

1822
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:36,020
That's a very true.

1823
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:37,060
I like that.

1824
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:38,420
I'll say it again later.

1825
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:39,500
His sketches.

1826
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,220
It's crazy.

1827
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:45,260
Like his sketches are so deep, like it's like, oh, my God, like

1828
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:46,980
the sketches are so wild.

1829
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:47,980
Yeah.

1830
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:53,220
You also with Avatar, you get to see what this great melding of worlds,

1831
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:57,300
character people that we know meeting other people, roadie meets Cameron.

1832
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:59,140
And they get along famously.

1833
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:05,620
Buds and Cameron's producer, John Landau meets Zoltz, fake rock Zoltz,

1834
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:10,460
and you meet another fake rock guy named

1835
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:14,660
we what's a Fabrice Fabrice and Zoltz, the fake rock man.

1836
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:16,660
It's so nice to know they did not.

1837
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,900
These characters did not disappoint.

1838
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:22,460
Can we get fake rock people for Breeson Zoltz on the show?

1839
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:23,860
Are they Disney employees?

1840
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:26,580
Are they I think current Disney employees are tough.

1841
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:27,460
Right. But that's what I'm saying.

1842
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:29,220
Are they Disney rock people?

1843
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:30,460
Are they a different company?

1844
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:32,180
Rock people. That's what we have to look into.

1845
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:35,700
I think at least one of them was credited as an Imagineering executive.

1846
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:37,460
OK, I thought it was interesting.

1847
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:40,620
Some of these people they interviewed in this episode,

1848
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:45,780
their jobs ended in 2018 when they clearly wrapped a lot of Shanghai.

1849
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:47,260
Oh, interesting.

1850
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:49,820
Yeah. Yeah, that happens when a big project ends.

1851
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:51,260
Yeah. Tons of people get fired.

1852
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:52,540
Yeah.

1853
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:57,980
Yeah, that's so yeah, I like the Cameron and he's like a road,

1854
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:59,620
Joe Rody got Avatar.

1855
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:01,940
He understood it was really.

1856
01:35:02,140 --> 01:35:04,460
It's what a fun meld of people.

1857
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:07,140
I wish there was footage of them in like a sub together.

1858
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:09,500
Rody must have gone in the sub, right?

1859
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:13,180
Maybe they traveled the world.

1860
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:16,540
The whole section, I think this is I'm getting ahead of the whole section,

1861
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:21,740
but Cameron talking about like how he fixed Flight of Passage essentially.

1862
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:23,580
Oh, yeah. It was really funny to me.

1863
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:26,580
What did he say? He said it was like very aggressive.

1864
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:28,100
Oh, yeah. The ride.

1865
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:33,180
But he said, no way back it off to like that's too aggressive, which I wonder.

1866
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:34,380
I'm always interested.

1867
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:35,820
They left that in.

1868
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:37,900
So maybe that is just a fact.

1869
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:40,020
But I think that's interesting.

1870
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:41,460
Yeah.

1871
01:35:41,660 --> 01:35:47,020
They talk about the river journey, like an attraction to inspire serenity,

1872
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:50,620
like not a feeling you associate with like parks necessarily.

1873
01:35:50,820 --> 01:35:51,740
Yeah, that's that's true.

1874
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:55,940
I do find it very interesting and pleasant and soothing.

1875
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:58,060
I think people

1876
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:02,860
are a little critical of it because the wait time balloons so easily.

1877
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:05,740
But I like I just thought it was nice.

1878
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:08,140
I just thought it was very all of Avatar.

1879
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:11,220
I found so moving and pleasant.

1880
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:12,780
And you could do another.

1881
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:15,380
I think if it's like a couple of it was a couple of minutes longer.

1882
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:18,740
I feel like people are expecting a little like a little bit longer of a

1883
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:25,380
transformative experience. I was getting ready to not be in the world of

1884
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:30,260
I think that was my personal like, you know, some people cried because they had

1885
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:36,100
to leave out there. I was like, hmm, bed hotel room.

1886
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:37,100
I can't wait.

1887
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:38,500
We were up early, though.

1888
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:40,660
I was a rougher day.

1889
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:41,940
Yeah.

1890
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:46,140
They do a lot of talk about the Shaman of Song and I'm trying to just let me to

1891
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:49,260
think and maybe I've asked this question on the show before and I forgot.

1892
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:53,620
Is the Shaman of Song in any of the Avatar sequels?

1893
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:55,420
That is my big question.

1894
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:56,620
Was she in the first one?

1895
01:36:56,820 --> 01:37:00,060
No, that's an original character for that ride.

1896
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:05,820
And if she walked on screen, would I have any idea that's what was happening?

1897
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:07,300
Well, the answer is no.

1898
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,740
Someone someone pitched us for a second

1899
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:13,260
gate episode and it's an easy fix for you and me.

1900
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:16,460
We watch Avatar for the first time and then talk about it.

1901
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:17,540
I watched Avatar.

1902
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:18,980
Oh, wait. Yeah, they're wrong about that.

1903
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:19,700
Really?

1904
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:21,380
I guess I'm just the only one.

1905
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:22,340
Hmm. Then you.

1906
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:26,620
There is a narrative starting and I like to think that I'm responsible for this,

1907
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:30,580
but there's a narrative starting that Avatar is fantastic.

1908
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:35,060
The new ones are going to make so much money and they're also going to be fantastic.

1909
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:37,340
It's kind of like Star Wars reactionary.

1910
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:43,340
It is seemingly we need a new IP that won't like the Marvel phase one is done.

1911
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:45,980
Well, I'm seeing it from Skywalker stories done.

1912
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:47,060
So we need a new.

1913
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:50,860
I'm seeing it from, I guess, people we know mostly who are all prequel.

1914
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:52,700
Also the same thing with the prequels.

1915
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:54,420
Yes, prequels are amazing.

1916
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:57,260
There's not a single problem with them

1917
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:58,660
and you don't understand them.

1918
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:02,020
Of course, the correct, the unassailably correct opinion.

1919
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:04,660
Yeah. And I'm seeing that happening now with Avatar.

1920
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:06,820
Yeah. And I think that'll continue to happen.

1921
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:09,500
But I'd like to take some credit for it for years ago.

1922
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:12,860
Talking about Avatar and the money.

1923
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:16,500
I think here's what happened when we started talking about Avatar in the pockets.

1924
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,500
We were all like smiling, a gleeful smile.

1925
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:22,580
I think Jason and I, our smile was because Avatar is kind of lame, right?

1926
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:25,220
And your smile was, no, I love it.

1927
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:28,580
And it touched me and it moves me and its spirit is in me.

1928
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:30,740
I think you're mostly right.

1929
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:31,660
You're mostly correct.

1930
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:33,580
But it's also like Buffett where you like,

1931
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:35,260
I'm going to get into this to make fun of it.

1932
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:37,140
Oh, wait. Well, yeah, yeah.

1933
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:38,820
You end up coming out on the other side.

1934
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:41,580
I mean, I am going into watching this movie fresh,

1935
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:44,900
but with a ton of goodwill from these attractions and this land.

1936
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:48,100
I think, though, Jason sees it and loves it actually more than me.

1937
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,820
Jason loves movies.

1938
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:55,020
I it's very rare that we don't see a movie and you don't go like, hey, it was good.

1939
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:59,100
I just I mean, I do like the experience of going to movies a lot.

1940
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:02,700
And I definitely can think of some clunkers.

1941
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:06,980
Rolling up in your sweater as rolling up in my sweater and backwards.

1942
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:08,900
It's the only movie you could possibly do.

1943
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:11,580
There's the only movie I've sucked.

1944
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:14,700
I mean, that's easy.

1945
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:16,900
We got one on the horizon that we're not

1946
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:18,900
optimistic about what we're going to see.

1947
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:20,020
Oh, yeah, we should.

1948
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:23,500
We'll see if it's interesting to talk about or not.

1949
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:27,380
But the only time I've ever seen a come out of a movie with you and you were upset

1950
01:39:27,580 --> 01:39:30,740
was Infinity War. I just thought it was too sad for the kids.

1951
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:36,220
You were just like, the children will see this and they'll be so sad.

1952
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:39,420
And I was like, yeah, but it was like actually was good and dark and like it's

1953
01:39:39,620 --> 01:39:45,220
a cliffhanger. You're like, yeah, but they're all going to be so sad.

1954
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:51,060
But yeah, but also like 25 years of Marvel comics just not letting up on the dark.

1955
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:53,220
Unlike Grim and Gritty, I just think it's funny.

1956
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:55,820
That's the only one. So like Avatar is not that sad.

1957
01:39:56,020 --> 01:39:57,380
There's some sad. It looks hopeful.

1958
01:39:57,580 --> 01:39:58,980
You're singing the song.

1959
01:39:59,180 --> 01:40:00,380
He's going to be the biggest fan.

1960
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:02,380
I mean, we'll see. Yeah.

1961
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:07,100
We've made it to Star Wars, but I'm I need to go soon.

1962
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:08,380
What do we do?

1963
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:11,580
We also we haven't watched the Rise of Resistance.

1964
01:40:11,980 --> 01:40:13,300
I haven't either.

1965
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:16,100
I like scrubbed really fast.

1966
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:18,820
And when I stopped seeing Star Wars stuff, I picked up.

1967
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:25,380
And so the the end, the last six minutes of this episode,

1968
01:40:25,580 --> 01:40:28,460
they kind of like tie up like, well, we're still working on stuff.

1969
01:40:28,660 --> 01:40:32,820
And they show the flipping robot, the flipping robot man that clearly is

1970
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:37,020
making Spider-Man poses as it comes back down in the art for the Marvel land.

1971
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:40,820
I believe that I don't know if it's the same thing, but there's a there's a little

1972
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:45,060
hook on the Spider-Man ride that's clearly for Spider-Man to swing,

1973
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:47,420
like an actual Spider-Man to swing outside of.

1974
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:50,140
And I don't know if it's that one or there'll be a performer.

1975
01:40:50,140 --> 01:40:54,700
I'm not sure, but hopefully it's that crazy robot that flips.

1976
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:58,220
I liked, oh, the Shaman of Song, before I forget, when she says,

1977
01:40:58,220 --> 01:40:59,900
I look forward to seeing you on Pandora.

1978
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:02,900
Was that OK? Like like it was a real actor doing it.

1979
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:05,300
Yeah, that was. Yeah, I remember.

1980
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:08,980
I just hadn't seen it in years and I was like, oh, that's fine.

1981
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:10,540
Yeah, that is nice.

1982
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:12,140
It's so unnerving.

1983
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:14,020
They talk about Star Wars.

1984
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:15,420
I mean,

1985
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:20,780
look, again, the execution of Batuu is very good, but Pandora is so beautiful.

1986
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:25,420
Pandora is, Batuu is meant to be weathered and beat up and lived in.

1987
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:27,740
So it's it's two very different things.

1988
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:29,020
Yeah, we talked about that.

1989
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:30,460
We've talked a lot about that.

1990
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:35,420
You know, I like running between the Turkish market that they visited.

1991
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:37,740
So I like the Grand Bazaar.

1992
01:41:37,740 --> 01:41:42,340
I really like seeing the Millennium Falcon ride, like what it looks like.

1993
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:43,700
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1994
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:46,980
The turntables. Yeah, that's a really impressive mechanism.

1995
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:51,460
So much of it that's, you know, for whatever problems we have with it,

1996
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:53,180
so much of it's so impressive.

1997
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:56,180
And Scott Trowbridge talking about like they knew they were going to do it,

1998
01:41:56,180 --> 01:41:57,740
but they didn't like they approved it.

1999
01:41:57,740 --> 01:41:59,420
But this technology is not there.

2000
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:02,140
And they haven't figured it out until like a couple of months before.

2001
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:03,060
It's pretty impressive.

2002
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:06,380
It's crazy. Yeah, yeah, we have our little problems, but it's like, I don't know.

2003
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:10,020
I think I think there's a couple of things that can get Falcon to be like crazy.

2004
01:42:10,220 --> 01:42:12,380
I think there's a few simple fixes.

2005
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:13,500
Yeah, yes, for sure.

2006
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:16,820
But then showing like sort of what the screen kind of looks like outside of the

2007
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:22,620
cockpit is crazy, because like it's all designed to make you it's like almost.

2008
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:24,060
Yeah. If you if you could see the full

2009
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:27,020
picture of all of it, you'd probably be more impressed in a weird way.

2010
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:29,340
They do it so see everything so seamless.

2011
01:42:29,540 --> 01:42:32,260
The cockpit changeover is so seamless.

2012
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:33,900
Everything is so perfect.

2013
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:37,580
It almost minimizes actually what's going on.

2014
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:40,460
Yeah, it just feels like a tiny little screen and it's shaking.

2015
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:42,900
But like the crazy this contraption with

2016
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:47,540
turntables that have the cockpits on them and so many of them are going at once.

2017
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:48,460
It's crazy.

2018
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:51,180
The fact that it loads so quickly and so many people are up and in.

2019
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:53,140
But yeah, look, resistance we haven't won.

2020
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:57,380
Now, by the time you're hearing this, we we've probably hopefully been on the ride

2021
01:42:57,580 --> 01:43:01,220
and we can, you know, we'll say what we thought about the clips of it in this

2022
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:03,300
documentary.

2023
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:06,020
But for now, we can't do it.

2024
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:08,500
We're not we were afraid of spoilies.

2025
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:10,940
Show the clip of George Lucas.

2026
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:14,980
Oh, they dedicate they show the clip of him going like, well,

2027
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:16,260
this looks great.

2028
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:19,620
It could have gone very bad.

2029
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:20,780
It's so fun.

2030
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:26,300
Like you can tell he doesn't have exactly when he starts talking, he doesn't know

2031
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:28,020
exactly what he's going to say.

2032
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:34,100
And then when he comes, when he finds it, it gets a big laugh because it is so like

2033
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:36,860
what does he get? He doesn't have to worry about offending.

2034
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:38,180
And it was George fucking Lucas.

2035
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:41,580
He's deciding, do I call them white slavers again?

2036
01:43:41,780 --> 01:43:46,580
Do I use the word because this would be the time white slavers would really land

2037
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:47,900
at this event. All right.

2038
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:48,780
I'll be nice.

2039
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:52,300
Yes. In case you know what Scott's talking about, he refers to Disney as white

2040
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:56,260
slavers in a Charlie Rose interview after Force Awakens because he was upset that

2041
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:59,380
they made so casually is what's funny.

2042
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:02,220
That phrase is so, so shocking.

2043
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:03,820
But then you watch it and just, you know,

2044
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:07,540
because the white slavers and they didn't like he didn't say it like in a big bowl,

2045
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:14,500
like Yelly way because he's so like so repressed or what he's so inside.

2046
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:18,620
Like that's probably the most rage he can express at this point.

2047
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:21,380
But obviously that's a mad and furious term.

2048
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:22,740
You go to fucking hell.

2049
01:44:22,940 --> 01:44:25,740
Yeah, that's a term you don't throw

2050
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:27,420
around lightly.

2051
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:28,700
Yeah, no.

2052
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:34,260
But that's like that that illustrates what he feels happened to his characters.

2053
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:35,860
Like that's how upset he is.

2054
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:37,700
Shock. No, he apologized for that.

2055
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:42,780
Also that back the dump truck of money of like make a new movie, George.

2056
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:44,100
We're talking about it.

2057
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:45,420
Look, it could happen. Yeah.

2058
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,220
I don't think that's out of the question that he comes.

2059
01:44:47,420 --> 01:44:48,660
He's been back also.

2060
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:50,820
That's what's funny, too. And that's what's funny about that.

2061
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:52,260
Red tails. No, no, no.

2062
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:55,220
I'm saying he is like there's always like, oh,

2063
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:57,300
he visits the set of The Mandalorian.

2064
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:59,860
Like I think there's something in the contract that he has to sort of still

2065
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:03,380
like kind of be the godfather of all this until they were great.

2066
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:06,900
Animatronic that takes his place until they build an amateur with a lot of

2067
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:10,620
actuators in the face that can take and he doesn't have to go do anything anymore.

2068
01:45:10,620 --> 01:45:11,780
Luckily realistic, George.

2069
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:12,780
And then he'll be walking around

2070
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:16,220
Galaxy's Edge so that everybody can go, oh, he looks he loves it.

2071
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:18,020
Luckily, they don't hear all the time.

2072
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:20,140
They don't they don't have to use the new

2073
01:45:20,140 --> 01:45:22,580
robot technology because he doesn't emote very much.

2074
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:24,940
So they can use just the Lincoln animatronic,

2075
01:45:24,940 --> 01:45:26,740
which is probably too much.

2076
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:28,860
It emotes too much for his face.

2077
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:31,660
They don't need the tiny motors the size of a pinky.

2078
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:33,620
They can use the old hydraulic fluid ones.

2079
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:36,460
Nobody hated white slavers more than Lincoln.

2080
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:37,700
There you go. That's true.

2081
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:39,340
Put a stop to them.

2082
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:40,900
There you go.

2083
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:43,860
There's some wrap up.

2084
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:45,500
I was going to do another.

2085
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:46,780
We were two running over.

2086
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:48,980
Yeah, I do need to leave.

2087
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:51,020
There's some thoughtful wrap up.

2088
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:54,700
So I think it's actually in the previous episode where the maybe it's Bob Weiss.

2089
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:57,140
Asked John Hench like, what does all this mean?

2090
01:45:57,180 --> 01:45:57,900
What do we do?

2091
01:45:58,100 --> 01:45:59,020
Yes, I like this.

2092
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:01,740
This doesn't make me the parts.

2093
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:05,220
Tell you that you are going to be OK.

2094
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:08,180
It's all going to be OK no matter what happens in the world.

2095
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:09,860
I think we're there all the time.

2096
01:46:10,060 --> 01:46:11,260
Yes, it's true.

2097
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:13,100
I mean, yeah, he cracked it.

2098
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:17,500
I wonder I wonder if that's his own thought or that was like Walt figured that out.

2099
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:18,180
We're going to war.

2100
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:20,340
We're going to be like hiding in the bathrooms overnight.

2101
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:21,740
We never have to leave.

2102
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:23,420
Yeah, it's going to be huddled.

2103
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:27,300
We're like, OK, so crouch above the toilets so they don't kick us out at night.

2104
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:27,940
Yeah.

2105
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:31,700
Can we stay at Disneyland for four and a half weeks straight?

2106
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:32,820
A good question.

2107
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:34,780
I think we could I think we can crack that.

2108
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:36,140
Yeah, I think for sure.

2109
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:39,220
That's what we'll work on in 2020 is how to actually live there.

2110
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:44,140
The very least we could like figure out which lots are open, sleep in the car

2111
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:46,540
for a couple hours and then go back into the park.

2112
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:49,180
Yeah. With a mobile in our car.

2113
01:46:49,180 --> 01:46:50,940
That's like our favorite characters.

2114
01:46:50,980 --> 01:46:56,060
It's Mickey and Hondo and Eisner and Eiger and a little Chime.

2115
01:46:56,260 --> 01:46:58,700
So we never have to leave our favorite little universe.

2116
01:46:58,900 --> 01:46:59,820
Yeah. Yeah.

2117
01:47:00,020 --> 01:47:01,620
That's the rest of our year.

2118
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:02,380
I have to leave.

2119
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,940
So I'm going to say you survived podcast the right.

2120
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:07,220
The Imaginary Story.

2121
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:08,940
You have more, though, clearly.

2122
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:10,460
You have an anxious low.

2123
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:12,460
It'd be funny if you just left.

2124
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:14,220
If you guys want to keep going, I just have to go.

2125
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:15,500
Yeah, you should just leave. All right.

2126
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:16,420
Well, say whatever. All right.

2127
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:17,940
Well, then you said Scott's part.

2128
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:20,780
But all right. Well, I don't know.

2129
01:47:20,980 --> 01:47:22,140
I don't have anything left.

2130
01:47:22,340 --> 01:47:23,980
But you need to say that much.

2131
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:24,740
I don't know.

2132
01:47:24,940 --> 01:47:27,500
There was a roadie wrap up quote at the very end.

2133
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:31,020
I mean, they show a lot of like Tony Baxter looking at Big Thunder, Bobger

2134
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:31,900
greeting people.

2135
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:34,620
There's a Marty Sklar dedication at the very end.

2136
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:39,140
He says you have to let yourself feel emotion to do this work.

2137
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:40,620
And I think that's the big thing.

2138
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:41,580
That's the whole big thing.

2139
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:44,140
People get very emotional doing this work, coming to this place.

2140
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:45,500
We get very emotional.

2141
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:47,980
Anything to tell me about Randy Gerber, too?

2142
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:50,540
I have a few thoughts about Randy Gerber now that you mentioned it.

2143
01:47:50,780 --> 01:47:52,020
And you survived here.

2144
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:53,020
You guys wrap up if you want.

2145
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:54,140
I got to go. All right, Scott.

2146
01:47:54,140 --> 01:47:55,100
Bye. See this.

2147
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:57,140
I'm just documenting this to show that this is real.

2148
01:47:57,140 --> 01:47:59,020
This is not a bit for Scott.

2149
01:47:59,020 --> 01:48:00,260
Has to leave here. He's going.

2150
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:03,180
He's leaving. He's leaving.

2151
01:48:03,380 --> 01:48:05,580
Here's Edwin. Edwin is going to follow him.

2152
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:08,020
Luckily, he didn't knock over the recorder.

2153
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:09,420
Scott is gone.

2154
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:10,620
All right. There's Jason.

2155
01:48:10,820 --> 01:48:12,940
Now we are continuing the podcast.

2156
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:16,740
Yeah. The roadie thing about feeling emotion and the hinge thing that you're

2157
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:20,500
going to be OK. I mean, those those felt like the most concise, like sum up.

2158
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:26,060
I'm like the closest I've ever gotten to a feeling of like, oh, well,

2159
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:29,380
what's the start of the answer to the question?

2160
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:31,500
Why do you like this so much?

2161
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:37,580
And yeah, yeah, I think that's yeah, I think we've talked about that before

2162
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:39,820
of what it is that that makes you feel.

2163
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:42,820
I mean, the others all you can get into, like what it is that makes you feel

2164
01:48:42,820 --> 01:48:45,620
comfortable, a lot of it's nostalgia, a lot of it's being a child.

2165
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:49,220
Yeah, a lot of it's living with characters and it just, you know,

2166
01:48:49,420 --> 01:48:51,100
it pushes bad stuff out of your brain.

2167
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:54,460
But of course, it's the Disney bubble that people talk about, too.

2168
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:56,460
Yeah. Which is nice as well.

2169
01:48:56,660 --> 01:49:00,460
So, you know, a nice doc, a nice series overall.

2170
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:02,580
A nice series. I thought pretty good.

2171
01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:07,580
Would love to dig in, as we said, this is just to sum up, but like love to dig in

2172
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:13,020
more with this team and let them like, yeah, really shit talk.

2173
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:18,260
I think like there's a very interesting either it's the first 10 years

2174
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:22,780
of Disneyland or first 10 years of Disney world of like almost like an oral history.

2175
01:49:22,780 --> 01:49:25,380
And that maybe that's more of a book sort of approach.

2176
01:49:25,580 --> 01:49:30,420
Yeah. But like, like really down to the nitty gritty operational.

2177
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:32,780
Like, well, here's actually what went wrong.

2178
01:49:32,780 --> 01:49:35,020
And here's like the crazy stuff we haven't.

2179
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:38,340
It's been a century or it's been half a century.

2180
01:49:38,540 --> 01:49:40,420
We can talk about this now. Right.

2181
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:43,940
But I mean, yeah, like like how big it was going to be.

2182
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:45,900
Mark Davis is Western River.

2183
01:49:45,900 --> 01:49:47,020
What is it? Adventure?

2184
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:48,300
What is it? Expansion.

2185
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:50,060
Sorry. Or Big Thunder.

2186
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:54,940
Like there's a there's two hours of that and talking and showing sketches from the

2187
01:49:55,140 --> 01:50:00,220
what could have been with the River Ride versus Tony with all of that.

2188
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:02,340
I mean, there's so much you hear Tony talk

2189
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:04,860
on season pass or any of these other interviews.

2190
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:08,820
And there's just so much material and stuff that obviously happened.

2191
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:12,140
So anyway, we've talked a lot.

2192
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:15,540
Is this two hours? Are we going like over two hours?

2193
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:19,260
Maybe unbuilt, unbuilt, imaginary.

2194
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:20,740
Oh, that would be a sequel.

2195
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:22,820
I don't know how much they want to.

2196
01:50:23,020 --> 01:50:25,780
Well, that's a lot of stuff out there like with Westcott and stuff.

2197
01:50:25,780 --> 01:50:27,660
It's like there's a lot of art out there.

2198
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:31,460
And Tony's talked about it again on season pass podcast a lot.

2199
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:36,740
He's talked about all the 45 minute boat ride that had like so many robots and you

2200
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:38,620
could get on it at four different points.

2201
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:41,500
So like he's he's talked about a ton of stuff.

2202
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:44,740
He's talked about, you know, Geyser Mountain that was going to go back.

2203
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:46,580
Yeah. Over where Star Wars is.

2204
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:48,860
And that was going to be like their tower of terror, essentially.

2205
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:50,540
So like so much stuff is out there.

2206
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:53,340
This doesn't even know about all the season pass podcasts.

2207
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:56,860
I don't know. I don't know exactly what the deal is.

2208
01:50:57,060 --> 01:51:01,420
Tony was talking about that Ozland they were going to build for the Franco.

2209
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:03,820
The Franco Wizard of Oz.

2210
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:08,060
And he like explained like he didn't explain, you know, he he was a little bit

2211
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:10,860
self-censoring because he said like he explained how you were going to go into

2212
01:51:10,860 --> 01:51:13,700
the tent and see the Wizard of Oz.

2213
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:17,460
And like he was going to like do some magic and the tent would flip around and

2214
01:51:17,460 --> 01:51:19,020
then you'd open up and you'd be in Oz.

2215
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:20,460
So like a very cool entrance to the land.

2216
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:22,260
I'm assuming some sort of hot air balloon.

2217
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:25,060
Some sort of I think it was going to be like a medicine showy tent.

2218
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:27,260
Yeah. Wagon cart or something.

2219
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:30,100
But then he said there was some sort of e-ticket with technology that he didn't

2220
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:32,380
want to talk about because it would be maybe used later.

2221
01:51:32,580 --> 01:51:36,740
Right. But still, like that's you could you could talk about it up until that point.

2222
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:40,660
Sure. You could show some art from some old timey Huckster.

2223
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:42,540
Yeah. Trying to sell people something.

2224
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:45,300
I'm always more more Huckster characters in the park.

2225
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:46,580
I'm always down for that. Yeah.

2226
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:48,420
And then that maybe could be a job for you.

2227
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:50,060
I would love that.

2228
01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:51,940
All right. Well, yeah, that's good.

2229
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:53,140
Yeah.

2230
01:51:53,340 --> 01:51:55,340
You've survived podcast right again.

2231
01:51:55,540 --> 01:51:57,700
Yeah. And Scott is in his car.

2232
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:59,660
Yeah, we wish him well. All right.

2233
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:00,780
Bye. We'll see you later.
