1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Warning!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The following podcast may contain

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
sincerity!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Uh oh!

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Don't worry, we balance it out by making fun of

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Jason's Phillyisms.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today on the show, we make it about us.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Even more than usual.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's some big life news on

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Podcast The Ride!

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:44,000
MUSIC

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride!

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
A theme park podcast hosted by

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
three men who now have a collective

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
three kids

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
to protect from ever hearing

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
this show. I'm Scott Gardner

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and there's Mike Carlson.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Three kids among us.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Is that where you're going to leave it?

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A collective three, yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Just getting the fact out.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It gets a little personal to reveal more than that.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Jason Sheridan, hi.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I will go a little further.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I will elaborate and say that

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
yes, among the three of us

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
there are now three children

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
which means I can say

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Jason, congratulations!

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yay!

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Little William Holden Sheridan

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
has entered

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
our world.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No, my brain

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
lesions are my little babies.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
They're all more special

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
than the ones that appeared before

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
them.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So many little bundles of

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
joy. My little bundles of joy.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh no.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They make you go, oh, your hand hurts now.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No explanation for that.

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's the thing, the little

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
bundles. The little bundle you can't.

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Unexpected chaos

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
to your life.

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
God's little angels.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So exciting, but this isn't about

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
me today.

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Although I made it about me.

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Who is it, unless the title already was a joke

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
that revealed it.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Who forgot to wrap it up, fellas?

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh, I see what you're saying.

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You're just being bloody.

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He says naughty voice.

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Who had a big accident?

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No, no, no. I am happy

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
to say that Aaron and I have

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
welcomed into this world our second

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
beautiful child.

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Congratulations.

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you so much.

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes, I overcame my

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
100% discomfort with

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
the act of human sexuality.

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And somehow made

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
this happen.

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes, very excited. So excited

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
to share with the audience.

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And now let's do the

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
gender reveal.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's a good boy.

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Once again, copy paste

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
that from when this happened

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
four and a half years ago.

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I have two

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
boys. I have two boys that were

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
recording in the garage and just several

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
walls away are two great

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
boys. Wow, the prophecy

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
of the Disney daddies continues

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
to become closer to reality.

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's almost there.

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
If you haven't heard this runner

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
in a while, the notion that we would

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
convert into a different kind of podcast

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
where we're three dads who

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
have three sons. Three each.

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Three sons each. And they're all

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
a handful. They're all a handful.

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We got a long way. I mean, it steps

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
us there, but just do it a boy. You have a

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
girl. You have three more

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
boys to have.

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's a lot of work.

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You have a young daughter

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and you would still have three boys

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
to add. You'd have to keep going until

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
you got there. Yeah, no, it seems hard

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
at this point, but you're doing great with it.

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm putting up really good numbers.

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's not a girl and it's not an aberration

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
in sight as a girl

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
would be in this goal. In the goal to have

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
three sons. Yeah, yeah.

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That sounded so...

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes, I wasn't able to

113
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
give birth to a life giver.

114
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
A human life vessel, which is

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
what I call women. Baby pod.

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No, I'm so excited.

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I think we would have been very happy with

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
a girl too, but given

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
the number one

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
reason to do

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
this. When you're weighing having a second

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
child, especially if you make

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
a pros and cons list. And the cons list can get

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
very long because you know the effort that it

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
will involve and your life is very hard already

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
with one. And you're like, how is this ever going to work?

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And the biggest, a gigantic

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
neon pro

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
in the list was

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
our first son is spectacular.

131
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He is so great

132
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and with each passing month

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
just gets cooler and

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
sweeter and watching him develop his

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
interests. But he's just a

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
solid guy and already

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
the big brother

138
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
he has been.

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll just flesh out the

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
timeline here, but they have

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
not even been in the same house as we

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
record this for 24 hours.

143
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And yet the

144
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
indelible, the like, I will

145
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
never forget heart melting

146
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
memories of

147
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
them meeting and my oldest

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
singing to the new

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
one and welcoming him home.

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And then before bed he's like, I hope it will

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
be morning soon so I can see

152
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
my brother again.

153
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Like my god, it hasn't

154
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
even been 24 hours.

155
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He is just, just firing.

156
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Tossing off bar, tossing off baby bars.

157
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's been so great.

158
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So anyway,

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
all that to say like,

160
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
a sequel, a boy again

161
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
given how much we love the first one

162
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
is amazing. And I also, it also

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
gives me the opportunity

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
to do this with this announcement

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
of who I now have in my house.

166
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Two brothers

167
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
on their way.

168
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Two brothers on their way.

169
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
One just poops

170
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and sleeps all day.

171
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It all comes together.

172
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

173
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm sorry to Sully with the serious

174
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
song with

175
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
you to have any fun with it because that

176
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
is a moment where you go to a Disney

177
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
theme park and you all

178
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
joy evaporates from

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the heat. It's very sad. You're not allowed to

180
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
have, is it, wait, now two brothers

181
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
is that, that is in American Adventure

182
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and then it's in, has been in

183
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Lincoln. Right. Is there any

184
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
anticipation of two brothers going away

185
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
now that, now that there

186
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
is a split, a joint

187
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
custody, if you will. I'm putting things in parent terms

188
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
between the

189
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Walt robot and Lincoln robot. That's a good question.

190
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah, because there's going to be a Walt show in the Lincoln

191
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
theater at Disneyland. But I think they're

192
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
going to alternate the Lincoln show and

193
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
the Disney show. So I don't

194
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
know if there's. After the initial run, they're

195
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
going to alternate. Yeah, I don't know if there's any,

196
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Lincoln is going to come back with different songs.

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But with the fun of, now that you've

198
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
got Walt and Walt presumably

199
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
doing Walt's greatest

200
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
hits, putting on the Walt review,

201
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
pointing at the map, saying, Disney

202
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
will never be complete as long as his imagination

203
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
goes. What are the other big Walts?

204
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So never forget, I'll start with a mouse. We're going to, this is

205
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
going to be, I actually hadn't thought about the Walt

206
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
show to this end and

207
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
how much we are going to get

208
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
five timers. Let's say, like,

209
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
you know, let's say, hey, a thousand timers,

210
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I think is what that show is going to be.

211
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes. And I don't think, I think people have confirmed

212
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
there's no A.I. Walt voice,

213
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
which is what people were worried about.

214
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh, so they are

215
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
sticking with using

216
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
recordings of him and not,

217
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
okay. Right. So, yeah,

218
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I think, yeah, you're not,

219
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
they aren't going to start deploying, you know,

220
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
what James Earl

221
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Jones, RIP, has, what he

222
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
announced before his death

223
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
that he's passing over to the A.I.

224
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
realm. Yeah, he signed his voice away

225
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
to A.I. before, so Vader can have

226
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
his voice forever. But they couldn't just get a Walt

227
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
impersonator, like

228
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Tower of Terror Rod Serling?

229
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Is that too,

230
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
that is a serious question. That Tower of Terror was

231
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
really, that was East Coast, buddy.

232
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I know. You do it every time.

233
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I called it that last time. But I was like, that was even

234
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
ten times from my point of view. But you know what's funny is that I feel like

235
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
we've done entire episodes about

236
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
the Tower of Terror, multiple of them,

237
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and it never struck me then.

238
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But I think that what's happening is some kind of, like,

239
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
you haven't gone back home in a little bit.

240
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I think that is, like,

241
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
your voice aching with nostalgia

242
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
for your coast.

243
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But it's coming out now, lately.

244
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Tower of Terror.

245
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's how it's telling you, you gotta go home.

246
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If Phillies clinched

247
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
their playoff spot,

248
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I am traveling back home

249
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
in October, is that I was like,

250
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I gotta get these tickets now before they

251
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
get playoff crazy

252
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
prices, you know?

253
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yes, that's true. But yeah, they could do

254
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
a Walt impersonator, I suppose, but it would maybe

255
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
not match the actual real audio.

256
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But, I mean, it would be

257
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
funny. I mean, it would be funny

258
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
if he could, like, plug Cotino

259
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
or do some other dialogue

260
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
that we've never heard before.

261
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah, yeah. No, if they could have him,

262
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and they could always claim

263
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
that it's old recordings.

264
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, sure. Just lie about it.

265
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah, yeah. Actually, he did have the plans for Cotino.

266
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And he had the plans to put James

267
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Earl Jones.

268
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I got my eye on a young actor.

269
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He was real good in that Kubrick film, and I

270
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
think he's gonna go far, so we're gonna use, we're gonna

271
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
develop computer technology to capture his voice.

272
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It would mean a lot to me if I got to,

273
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
you know, continue

274
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
my story in

275
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
my home where I lived, and I just wish

276
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Walt could tell me

277
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

278
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Maybe Hazel George has some old,

279
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
like, tapes from their sessions.

280
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
His nurse Hazel? His nurse Hazel

281
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
who would work on his polo injury

282
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
at, like, five o'clock sharp every day.

283
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But if, but those tapes

284
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
are probably just like,

285
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
ah, yeah. Well, you could,

286
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't know, you could use them in the show somehow.

287
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't know. When he gets up from the desk,

288
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
like, they don't, they don't have a lot of that audio

289
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
of just, like, kind of moving around.

290
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So maybe that's the stuff you could use.

291
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You're looking for audio of Walt in

292
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
agony. Agony

293
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
or ecstasy. Oh, okay.

294
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Either way. Close door Walt

295
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
is what we want. We all know Uncle Walt from TV.

296
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah. I want to see what he did

297
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
when cameras weren't around. Only

298
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
hidden microphones. Right.

299
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Or he, or he, or he was

300
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
recording in a Nixonian, paranoid

301
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
way. Yeah, possible.

302
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What was his choice? I'm not sure. I also,

303
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I, uh,

304
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
in that Tower of Terror run I was trying to go, like,

305
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
what would be, if, if

306
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
the Phillies hired a new player,

307
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
is there a name that would get

308
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
the most Philly pronunciation?

309
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If it was, like, Trevor Terrarian

310
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
or something.

311
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And then the whole crowd, then he comes out and the whole crowd just

312
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
goes, Terrrrrrrrrrr!

313
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Ricky Scoocles stepping up.

314
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He went a whole other way with it!

315
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh, no no, I love that. That is

316
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
a great vessel for Phillyism.

317
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh god, I'm trying to think of a name.

318
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Where does it come out the most? What are the...

319
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Wooder.

320
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah

321
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,540
Tommy wooder Tommy get over here Tommy Tommy wooderson

322
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Tommy wooderson

323
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,640
Well, hopefully if it was an ideal filly name out there

324
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:35,980
Anyways per my stuff. I'm very happy. He is great. Aaron is doing so great

325
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,860
She did incredible the delivery is like it was nothing

326
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:45,460
Maybe she doesn't feel that way, but I'm looking at her like I can't believe she's someone who gave birth to a baby in

327
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,460
The last two weeks I couldn't believe it

328
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,500
days after the fact and she just like bounced right back in and you know

329
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,340
Handling everything for now our oldest. This is a thing. I have to shift to I feel like I'm doing like

330
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,100
Ceremonial things that are helping me, you know, like I just look alright

331
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,180
I'm not gonna say that I'm gonna keep up the policy of not saying the name on the show

332
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,900
So Mike, I'm gonna need you to be on the trigger about deleting the okay

333
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:16,020
I end up saying it but here's as close as I will get if you need like if the audience needs a visual or name

334
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,420
Manifestation of the kids. This is a moment. I was really looking forward to recently

335
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,620
We did an episode about Park stars and I probably talked about this before that

336
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,300
I have this little like mantle or a little it's like a little nook in the hallway

337
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
we're probably a phone used to go and

338
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,660
I

339
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:39,660
Put my wedding cake toppers there where Erin and I were represented by fancy robots and when we became a fuller family

340
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,380
I added my now oldest and he's represented by the Park star of smart one

341
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,860
and I did it was a lot of like who is the second one gonna be and

342
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,860
I ended up sticking with Park stars and my new addition

343
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,180
My little one is represented by the fun Meister the pleasure island. Yeah

344
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,220
Mascot which is a very cute Park stars

345
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,060
I like him in Park star for more than I like him in the logo when I like them in the logo, too

346
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,380
Park star I recently purchased

347
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,380
Yeah, yeah, oh right right. Oh, yes, which you did an unboxing but you got screwed on eBay I hate to

348
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,440
Scott's thing, but he got screwed. They said it was on open. I'll nap while you they said it was sleep

349
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,160
I bought a couple where I knew what I was getting and then I bought two which I thought were totally unopened blind box

350
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,300
Right, and they were tape. It just been resealed. This guy got screwed on eBay and I keep telling him

351
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,740
He's got to file a claim. It's easy. They'll they'll give you money back. Sure

352
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,020
Yeah, but then but is it worth the is it worth the hassle for you?

353
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,340
It's not that much of a hassle

354
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:47,940
Well, you need to send me a link cuz I tried to find a file a claim link and I could not find it

355
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,740
It's so easy. Well, first of all, you should just email the person who sold it to you

356
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,900
Well, I don't want to start something with a seller

357
00:13:53,900 --> 00:14:00,980
But then then that's because eBay will ask if you tried and then if they see you tried then oh, okay

358
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:06,140
Yeah, how often have you done this Mike a couple times? Yeah, I bought a quarter scale

359
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,900
Adam West Batman big Batman and it came and they said it was new

360
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,100
It was not new would have been opened and I went back and forth and I was like well

361
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,620
I'm gonna open this anyway, and I was being nice and I said I'm gonna open this Batman anyway

362
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,100
Whatever it's clear it's in good shape from what I understand from what I see I open the box

363
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:32,740
It smelled like a smokers house in there and I went no no no and I went right back and did it and I mean

364
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,340
That's what happened with that when we did the Joe Camel episode

365
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,420
I got all this information from this Joe Camel coffee table

366
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:46,140
Uh-huh that as I turned the page it just like released ancient smoke. Yeah, but that's a Joe Camel book

367
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,820
That's expected that adds to it Adam West should not be no no

368
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:57,420
Smoker yeah, no that book was infused with you know, the fine aromas of flavor country

369
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,540
Oh god, I forgot to lick it. I gotta I gotta get a hold of Joe ask if I can lick his book

370
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,180
Yeah, my friend's not not to can't I don't believe Joe cam my friend Joe Carnegie

371
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,700
the only book that when licked produces the reaction of

372
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,700
I

373
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,980
Missed out I gotta get that thing out Jason you start looking

374
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,140
Give me your phone and just give me the passcode and I will take care of it from there

375
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,780
Okay, and I'll take care of anything else you need in there

376
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,580
I don't know why that felt lascivious to me

377
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:36,220
I got I meant more app wise and mm-hmm, but I guess I could do sex thing. I don't know

378
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,580
Yeah, I mean this is not something that Jason needs currently

379
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:45,340
But I do wonder if does that apply to your checking brain is that your desire to do things for people

380
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,860
You also don't need to be

381
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,180
flirting online dating

382
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,580
but you feel like as with checking that you your ability to

383
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,500
Do things from afar that help people and you're volunteering it again with this eBay thing

384
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:05,500
Do you feel like you could like get somebody into a solid little relationship or just a little sexual message?

385
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,780
Yeah

386
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:12,380
The answer is I don't I don't have any experience doing this but the answer is yes

387
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,840
I do believe I could you do think you could because don't both you and I

388
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,300
Got into committed relationships before there were dating apps at all, right?

389
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,500
and you've

390
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,700
Via the character McGruff composed a song very critical of hookup absolutely

391
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know if you share any of those beliefs or if that

392
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,840
Beaks into your personal philosophy well the end he says delete all the apps

393
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,240
He doesn't like any of the apps except for maybe one or two. I forget

394
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,560
But yeah, no, I I honestly I do I feel like I have a good

395
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,940
I have a good sense of this and maybe I'm completely wrong, but I feel like I've got I've advised people

396
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,940
But I've never taken their phone and done it for them

397
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,160
Yes, you and Geo looked at my dating profiles before they went lie

398
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,640
Well, that's a whole yes, we threw that up on the TV and we were watching Jason go through you all writers rimmed it

399
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:08,280
Well not well, he would do any Jason wouldn't take any advice from us Jason threw up his his phone

400
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:15,480
Whatever the app was on the TV and we watched him go through people. I don't remember I remember we were at

401
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,960
What's the French like diner place?

402
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:28,840
On Vermont Street, I don't know by the old toys are us in not important. What happened there me me me me me?

403
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,400
The French bistro, what was the name of that we like?

404
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,240
Denny's

405
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,200
Denny's that sells wine

406
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,160
We were at st. Patrick's Day at the historic Tamo Shander

407
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,600
And then we went to get something to eat and I was like I'm making dating apps right now Wow

408
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,520
Making great pages. Did you have a note that you're willing to say?

409
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,920
Did you have to was there something you were strongly suggesting he get out of there?

410
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,440
I

411
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,680
Probably I wish I remembered specifically because I think I definitely had notes

412
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,920
All I really remember was you like swiping no on a bunch of doctors

413
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,240
Wait what no, thanks brainiac what watching him swipe no one like

414
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What do you know about the X-Men

415
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Like well, they don't know alt-comedy I

416
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,400
Did not say

417
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,520
Definitely something in that vein where Gio and I were just like dumbfounded

418
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,200
They won't know what they won't know what a second beat is

419
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,200
Drop Harold they'll say second beat. Is that about a heart beats?

420
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,960
I don't want to hear about your heart surgery. I think that would have been more like oh, they don't want a bum like me

421
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,080
You know

422
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,880
Yeah, we were shocked at what you who you were saying no to it's chaos

423
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,600
Eventually, I've learned I know it's now eventually I met Jane on bumble sure work down, right, right

424
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,520
I don't invite and that's then that's a profile that had no input from no idea. I had no input on that. No

425
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:09,820
Wow, he did it himself. Yeah, you inadvertently did cuz I probably just copied over my all my tinder stuff

426
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:17,620
Maybe maybe I wish I wish we had a document of us assembling that profile because I do wish I I should remember that

427
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,820
I guess I don't remember a specific about it. Yeah

428
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,100
I know I feel like the audience deserves to know I know they do deserve they deserve screenshots

429
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,340
We are open books and that is why I'm now going to describe every step of the

430
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,420
dilation of how the

431
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,420
Patoson kicked in. Oh, yeah

432
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,960
No, they're like I don't need to talk much about how it played out. But the

433
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,480
The funny

434
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:47,160
aspect of it like here's my it begins story for this delivery was that I

435
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,520
we were like resting pretty easy because we were at 35 weeks and

436
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,480
felt like

437
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:01,240
You know like I mean all plans have been sort of like maybes and asterisks and that's in my personal life and that's with

438
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,120
You guys and records and things we wanted to do for the show. Everything was like, you know could be nudged

439
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,440
I was living in that zone for a while which gets a little frustrating

440
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,440
But I was like, you know, it was the end of a long day

441
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,640
Like my my oldest had, you know a glass of milk. He's winding down

442
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,280
We're about to put him to bed and I'm like, you know, this is this is a long one

443
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,400
This is kind of purgatorial. I'm gonna go see a movie. I'm gonna get out of here. I'm gonna see Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. I

444
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,080
Purchased a ticket online

445
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,240
clicked the purchase button and I swear as my finger released like in the exact second of the up of

446
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,320
That motion I hear from the other room. Uh

447
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,360
Scott

448
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,600
Yeah

449
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,440
Water broke. Oh my you're and then like, you know, there's no there's no joy in that moment

450
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,920
That's a you are kidding me

451
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,000
you like, you know the moment where it becomes like

452
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:57,520
It's now and the degree of energy that I have and on this day right now

453
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,320
This is what I have going into this. Yeah. Oh my god. So then like well no Beetlejuice

454
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,040
I guess I'll try to get that and then you know what AMC doesn't refund for those convenience fees

455
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,440
Yeah, you still I'm out 250 now

456
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,800
I was gonna say when you got that refund Jason would be upset about that

457
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,880
He would have still tried to make the movie already a beautiful little angel coming in the world, but so much tragedy

458
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,640
He's operating at a loss that let's let's milk I can put in his mouth, right?

459
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,160
Oh, I bet like Beetlejuice if you asked three times they'd give you that

460
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,920
They operate if you give Chicago you give me your phone I could try to get that. Oh, that's right. Yeah

461
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,680
Yeah, same you want to unlock take care of that for me too. Yeah, tell this to you this man had a baby

462
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,080
You understand there was nothing convenient about that, right?

463
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,880
so

464
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,660
Anyway, I'm like, oh my god

465
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,920
We got so we got to like, you know, all right call grandparents get still get our oldest down

466
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,880
So things are calm for him, but then like oh god get over there Aaron drove herself incredible

467
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,320
You know, but but then like then things calmed down they did due to the 35 weeks

468
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,200
They they told us as soon as we got there, which was bummer to hear but it just our expectations

469
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,920
They did say at this timeline. That is an automatic NICU stay

470
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,460
Yeah, neon neonatal intensive care unit. So we we knew when we got there

471
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,840
We are not gonna be leaving right this child, which is a tough pill to swallow

472
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,840
But you know

473
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,600
Plus sides to that because you got a little extra care. It was never scary. It was never it was never bad delivery went great

474
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:42,040
But you know just need a little extra help ended up staying for 11 nights that that dragged out

475
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,280
That was a long time and again most the majority of that not scary

476
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:53,120
It kind of demystified the what Nick you to me in general because I'm expecting scary boy in the plastic bubble

477
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,160
I don't know. I like I heard it and I got a little shiver and I'm sure people's experiences are that and have been that

478
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,520
But most of was very nice everybody in there all nurses fantastic

479
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,820
and I still got to it required like putting on headphones and like

480
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,560
Emotional music and turning off all the mini be there just like dozens and dozens of beeps and alarms

481
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,080
Happening with all the babies at all times, but I still got to like burrow in and have like true

482
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,560
Bliss moments just staring at him and it was really nice

483
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,040
but the budding comedians have to go back and forth all the time and

484
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,880
Now I'm happy to say as we record this that that last night was the first night that he spent at home

485
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,720
And then all of the gardeners were together and it was really nice. I will throw out a theme park related thing

486
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
That meant a lot

487
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,040
Coming back and seeing this particular item

488
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,840
The first that Aaron and I went to knots Berry farm

489
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,620
I want to say post-pandemic but it was not at all post-pandemic who was in that zone of like well

490
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:57,200
We will open the outdoors again, and there are the knots did all these like food festival

491
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
I forget if you guys went to any of those

492
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,800
but

493
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:06,840
We went we went to one and like they had like shops open too and they had the wood carving thing where you can yeah

494
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,680
Yeah, you get an old

495
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,640
It's something I wanted for a long time because my great-grandparents had one of those just like, you know

496
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,400
Old-fashioned woodcarve sign with a family name on it and we started like, okay, we're doing that

497
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,720
We're so happy to be back here and we got a baby now. This is great. And we filled out the form and

498
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,880
And and like and so what do we put on it?

499
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,720
And I was like our well our names mom dad and so and so right and Aaron said well shouldn't it be the Gartner's?

500
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,360
I was like, oh cuz yeah. Well, you don't want to leave anyone out

501
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,800
Sure, that was cool. That was a little it still took a long time after that to get our heads around it

502
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:48,380
but ever but I have like certainly stared at the knots the Gartner's sign and like

503
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:55,200
imagined more of those and what is that story and how does it play out and now all the Gartner's are at home and

504
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,480
the sign is

505
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,720
Remains accurate the knot sign is yeah, even more accurate than ever before

506
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,640
I mean there's accuracy wouldn't have been the issue, right?

507
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,120
If it was just the three names those are three names that right exists

508
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,040
It wouldn't have been inclusive that I guess is the you know, it's important

509
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,600
It's time to get Papa Gartner to fright fest extreme

510
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:25,960
Well, this is another aspect of it because I'm just I'm trying to tell all the stories here that that pertain to our subject matter and

511
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,400
You know, like I said caught me off guard

512
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,520
The beginning of the 35th week and you know

513
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,160
We were trying to set plans in motion and there were a lot of plans where I was like

514
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,160
I think we'll be okay there that I think we could do

515
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,160
Baby a process started on a Monday night that Friday night what became four nights later

516
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:51,720
Mike Gio and I were supposed to go to freight fest extreme at Six Flags Magic Mountain

517
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,120
Yeah about that for a while. I'm like I wanted to cuz I and I declared on stage last year in a Halloween show

518
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,200
I'm joining which I didn't even get you guys sold me on it during the show

519
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,960
I was not gonna make that declaration right after all of all the tails you weaved and like I'm doing it this time

520
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,400
And like I think that's gonna be clear. I think I could do that should be fine

521
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,120
Early showed up before that. Yeah, which is so now freaky to think about the possibility of

522
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,560
If we had cut that closer

523
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,600
The possibility that when Aaron's water broke and we had to go to the hospital that I was I could have been deep

524
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,120
It had six flags. You could have been in the sewer of souls

525
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,120
The maze where there's a big pile of shit

526
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,180
Could have been in there your phone buzzes or you like rings or something. Oh my god

527
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:45,720
And then it's and then having to navigate my way out two miles of walking out of six flags from wherever suit

528
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,760
The sewer of souls is over by like kind of like I think by Tatsu kind of up on a hill

529
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,080
Yeah, in my mind this now how way much land that park covers. Yeah

530
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,120
Well, so that might have been the deepest part of the park

531
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,940
Yeah, and then they're like this year the sewer and soul is extra extreme extra long

532
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
two miles sewer

533
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:13,400
I'm in another county at this point now. Just like now just punching shit monsters or whatever's in there

534
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,920
Yeah, I have to go to be with my child

535
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,240
Scott we were gonna do the West Coast cost of roller coaster. You can't leave now

536
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,760
Okay, you're right quick West Coast customs, okay, I'll buy one of those front of the line passes

537
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,440
I run into the shop like how much of those if you buy them day of?

538
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,080
$225 sure sounds good fair price to me

539
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,280
Go on terrible roller coaster that hurts me you get stuck on the roller coaster

540
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,480
to call

541
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,200
I'm sorry, and then she's like well, what time did you go on the coaster?

542
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,120
Was it after I told you that the water broke and you have to like well, she's like I want to see time stamps

543
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,120
I know it's been a three hour

544
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,560
delay, you see

545
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,440
You told me you were going through the sewer of souls I meant no well that not literally mentally

546
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,720
I meant that I'm in a mental sewer of souls because I'm stuck on West Coast customs

547
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,280
Well, a teen a teen is like hey, sorry guys gonna have to wait till morning. I'll see you tomorrow

548
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,080
Try to rest up everybody tilt your head back make sure that blood doesn't go

549
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,760
It's kind of like babies imagine that you're all babe newborn babies if you can imagine those

550
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:30,020
Oh god, no, I just tip you don't want your heads to tip forward because then all the blood goes down

551
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,160
You're neck weakens if anybody has any loose $20 bills

552
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,720
I can go buy a Marvin the Martian blanket for you keep you warm tonight

553
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,560
But if not, sorry, you're gonna have to use a garbage bag

554
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,760
I need two $20 bills for that blanket. Just a heads up. It's not a single it's a $40 Marvin the Martian blanket

555
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,680
We can put a tray of Michelada's on a hook and send that up your way if anybody's hungry

556
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,780
That's the only food we have at this hour. Just lick those rims. You should stay sustained

557
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,320
Also, you are by a speaker and we don't know how to turn the sound off

558
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,840
So you're gonna be hearing whoa cool car all night every

559
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,520
45 seconds

560
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,640
Loud exhibit could layering exhibit I cannot conjure what an exhibit song wait

561
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,120
No exhibit has nothing to do with that exhibit is pimp my ride

562
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,600
Yeah, yeah my ride isn't wait. Is there any affiliation between West Coast Customs?

563
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,000
That was that that wasn't the group that did pimp my ride. Oh my god

564
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:33,200
Isn't that how they kind of got no maybe that's right. Yeah, I don't want to speak. I don't want to speak

565
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:39,720
And I need to figure it out this is the kind of thing this is really important my new son in yeah, West Coast Customs

566
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:46,440
I need to teach him both spellings of exhibit. Yeah, you'll take the yeah

567
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:54,720
You'll take your two boys to Six Flags one day. They'll go into Bugs house. They'll learn where Bugs lives in this weird single room

568
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,400
with no furniture

569
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:04,480
Like the the room rivers Cuomo lived in at Harvard everybody talks about when he after Pinkerton was such a disaster

570
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,360
A sad room. He had like a sad the pitch black room with the lizard. Yeah

571
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,080
Well, that's scary where Bugs lives at Six Flags and the rivers Cuomo

572
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:21,640
The work on on pimp my ride was done by West Coast Customs until season five

573
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:26,480
When it was done by Galpin Auto Sports going forward Galpin Wow

574
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,200
And yet Galpin Auto has no roller coaster. Yeah Galpin. That's unfair

575
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,440
They do have a diner the horseless carriage in the middle of their mile long

576
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,480
Row of car dealerships in Van Nuys. Well, that's good to know

577
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,720
That's a themed experience

578
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,520
Yeah, really almost happened though, and I'm glad the timing played out. Okay timing has been

579
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:58,000
Insane for me throughout this and this is where I will get to my other piece of news here

580
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:05,240
Which is that there's this there is an opportunity that I have been pursuing for weeks months

581
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,640
I don't even know

582
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,360
The way things have played out in the literal hour that my new son was born

583
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:17,980
I received an official offer for a very big directing opportunity

584
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:25,420
Like a big big thing I don't want to say much about him I apologize for being a to Dr. Strange three. Yeah. Yeah you got

585
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,980
Fine I'll say they the NDA

586
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,000
You can only you can say it if it's guessed, okay

587
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,220
So guys we have a lot of talking to do you're gonna have to care

588
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:42,500
I did so much bullshitting you're gonna have to catch me up on a lot of mythology. Yeah, I said told him I'm a fan

589
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,360
And I said, please don't ever listen to my podcast

590
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:51,280
You did pitch them though that dr. Strange teams up with a podcaster named Jason from Philly

591
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
By the way, you're not playing Jason

592
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,240
Just feel like we can aim higher on Jared Leto's playing Jason

593
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,560
He's snakes me again

594
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,800
He's method to he's gonna mocap into a shorter body

595
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,620
It's gonna be awesome. He's gonna bring that those jit those definitive Jared Leto box office results

596
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:21,260
See over and over again, he's sending that Oh equals money, right? Of course. He's sending hot taffy to all the cast members

597
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,980
He's really like twisted this time

598
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,380
He's rubbing the taffy though to

599
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,340
Outside everyone's trailers

600
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:42,500
No, I can't say too much about what this is don't go imagine

601
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,280
I don't think I don't think you can't guess what this is, but hopefully you'll hear down the road

602
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,420
But it is it is a cool thing. I worked really hard to get it. It's an awesome

603
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,540
It's a it's a type of thing. I have never done before

604
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:59,420
And it's really unique and it's with old friends and new friends and I'm so excited to do it

605
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:03,100
The timing has been insane and and I've been barreling towards

606
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:09,460
Like well is the as a baby gonna show up as I'm getting ready for this if this comes together

607
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:15,220
Boy, my youngest a real producer a real he like it's like he heard the chatter

608
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,940
Right around him about the timing and he's like I'll take care of them. I'll get out of here

609
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,420
You don't gotta worry about me. You can start doing this thing because that's the deal with this thing

610
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,000
It will be very fast and all-encompassing. It's it's it's kicking in like

611
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,820
Now like so fast. It's gonna be a whirlwind. I'm excited to tell you more

612
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:39,220
As time goes on shows in season five. We're all looking forward to it

613
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,460
Jesus riding it down with the palm fronds. Someone's got a

614
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,740
I'm I will be ushering

615
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,380
So when you hear the IP that I am I see you're some of your favorite IP out there

616
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,600
And I am ushering onto the screen snaggle pusses back

617
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,360
I

618
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,640
Think sort of a snaggle puss by way of Deadpool

619
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:07,200
I don't know snaggle bus who breaks the for the snaggle bus who who makes jokes about like another cartoon reboot. Yeah

620
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,960
But

621
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,920
Anyways, I'm I'm thrilled. This is good. This is gonna be really neat. My son is really neat

622
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,920
It's really my son is really neat. You can hold me on that son

623
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,120
If you ever hear this that's how I feel about you

624
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,080
But it is going to be so much work on top of having a very new

625
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,240
newborn and the sum total of all of this is that in the

626
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,800
Coming months you will be hearing less of me on podcast the right

627
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:42,160
That's as much as I want to commit either way to what it actually means because I don't know how much less or for how

628
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,760
Long I actually have no idea

629
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,520
It's also not gonna be right away because you will hear me throughout

630
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:54,920
Haunt cast the fright through of a lot of those and maybe even a little beyond and then I don't know maybe

631
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,960
Sporadically here in there. I don't know. So that's all I'm gonna say is less

632
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,960
It may not be a long hiatus. It may not even be like a full all the way through hiatus

633
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,440
I maybe I'm overthinking. I'm I'm hold. I'm doing too much hand holding through this process

634
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,360
Well, look as you're looking at the sheet for dr. Strange 3, you know, all those actors come in and out

635
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,960
You know don't necessarily know how long they shot for and I feel like that might be the case here

636
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,440
Maybe people won't necessarily know. Mm-hmm a lot of stuff. We have a lot of stuff in the can a lot of variable

637
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,560
Yeah, they have told me no actors. Well, I'm in the belly of the beast. No actors will be films together, right?

638
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:38,320
Yeah, it's all green screen in their every Avenger if everyone who's ever played an Avenger is committed is shooting but may be cut

639
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:44,920
Right. Yes. So just in case we're getting 400 actors done. So yeah, it's it's a tough one. It's

640
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:51,400
It's 45 pages a day. Well, you know that a budget of 1 billion dollars

641
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,520
Every continent there's a green screen. Yeah, cuz we got to go to them

642
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:02,880
No, it's yeah, it's a whole thing and I did the good news is I do anticipate being fired very quickly

643
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,560
Oh, okay. Yeah, I think I'm making it four days if I'm lucky, so I might be back here ASAP. Okay. Yeah

644
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:14,480
So we'll see anyway. Yeah, I don't know you guys have been been great about it

645
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:21,880
Thanks for for understanding and sure operating and work with and and taking care of our storied franchise

646
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,880
All right. All right be in my in my absence

647
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,320
Well, well for the next month it will be our IP, right

648
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,360
But yeah, I do appreciate it. It's almost insane

649
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,280
This hasn't happened before like, you know, I feel like I've been able to balance things

650
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,920
animated shows and the like which go

651
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,320
Extremely excruciatingly slowly, but this is gonna be fed

652
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:50,880
This is like, you know what? This thing is like this is like a launch and I in the past have been a no launch queen

653
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,020
Well, and it is on me to metaphorically speaking rise to the challenge

654
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,440
Civico of being a launch queen. Well, at least creatively

655
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,360
Which I feel good about it and I am gonna do and I'd rather do this than go on West Coast Customs

656
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,280
Pick the ride, which I don't know if that's a launcher. No

657
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840
Car is a launch

658
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:17,200
Yes, did you go is that the one you went to when it was a little cub reporter session?

659
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,360
You put the hat on the helm the hard hot hot. Excuse me the hard head

660
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,960
Yeah, I saw it in production and you did the opening day. Whoa, you were like the ride guys

661
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,640
You were like universals. Oh the right video brand the ride guys who go into like they I watched them go on that

662
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,800
What is it celestial? Yeah racers that name epic universe

663
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,660
They went on that and then a cut like as soon as they got on the right car

664
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:46,040
The rumor is there's a flux capacitor on the back of each car really or at least on some of them. Yeah

665
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,440
That's cool. You know, the vibe is like if you're gonna have zappy energy from some

666
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,680
Yeah, then why not and no lights at night except for like the cars. Oh, I did like that. Yeah, that is really neat

667
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,160
It looks like it's a practical light. Oh like a shooting star. Yeah, that's right

668
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,680
So in the distance you see it is like comets and stuff

669
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,880
We're on I drive and you see that when we're leaving Taffer's Tavern, Orlando

670
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:16,080
See that we see the glimmering tail of your bleary eyed from so much Taffer's whiskey

671
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,920
But a bourbon excuse me from the sweetest sweetest

672
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:28,200
Your stomach is clawing its way out of your body despite the fact that you only ate french fries we're gonna

673
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,960
Seems impossible that you would have that big of a reaction to a simple fried potato

674
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,840
We're gonna yeah, and we're gonna oh, yeah, that is we're gonna have that experience. I

675
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,480
For months we've been talking, you know people have been like, oh, you know, this thing's gonna open early open early

676
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,440
And now I'm hearing there's like the big rides are like they're not working yet

677
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,720
Classic stuff

678
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Universe or taffers

679
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,680
I when you said rides it gave me a clue my big mechanical tongue isn't working

680
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
It's lapping everybody off

681
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:09,640
They're crashing into the ceiling fans. You're gonna fix this thing the panini press won't close

682
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,480
We can't make panini

683
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:21,920
He was inspired by like the big weekend head that you enter at horror nights for his house

684
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:29,720
My big uvula like crusty the clown. Yeah. Oh you were gonna do horror nights, too

685
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,960
We should have mentioned too. Like you were all set for horror nights

686
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:38,320
That's happened already. I've happened too. That was right after and I guess like you'll hear some like, okay

687
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:44,080
In a hot in a pre-banked Halloween episode you will hear me trying to weave the narrative of like

688
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,280
Let's see how much I do this year, right? You just spoil it now. It's not none

689
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,680
There was also the possibility that then the baby then it's like over then the baby is what?

690
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,960
Surprise and one where people cut me slack, right? Right? Are you sure I can't be up there? I can't yell that

691
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,920
I need my rest. Well next year you should declare next year. Oh, wait, let me finish my thought real quick

692
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,640
Yeah, but I feel like I've heard and maybe it's like Alicia Stella podcast or YouTube where it's like

693
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,360
Monsters and Harry Potter not working like yeah

694
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,360
And then like so when they describe but the most the most incredible experience we've ever like well

695
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:30,080
That's the downside to the platitudes you say about every single ride in this park means that it also might not work

696
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,760
Yes, cuz like is there channel park stop. I'm sorry. Is that the name of it? Yeah, Orlando parks out

697
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,040
Yeah

698
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:42,400
but like I think that there's just like massive screens and tons of robots Harry Potter thing and like they gotta get it all to

699
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,160
coordinate and then I think she floated the idea that people are like

700
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,080
phased opening

701
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:54,640
So then I'm like, oh this sucks for us because I'm like I want to go right when it opens but like if there's big stuff closed

702
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,880
I don't know. We'll see. I don't know. We'll be there next year

703
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,000
As long as East Coast Bowser's challenge is there we do have Bowser's challenge

704
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:09,520
It's right here. Wait is only three and a half hours. Well, that's the nice thing about horror nights

705
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,440
So we walked right on okay walked right on bars or challenge and it's mmm

706
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,840
Doesn't bother me as much when you don't have to wait. No, it changes

707
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,400
Everything I also came in not to repeat things we said long ago

708
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,240
But my feeling about Mario is very different when we got to go on this press day and we did the cool little like Bowser Jr

709
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,880
Game, you know, if there are no lines, that is everything. However, there are never no lines. So

710
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,240
That's good. That's a good tip though. That is a good horror night tip though

711
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,280
And I think it all tickets have it or maybe it's just the express item

712
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,400
I'm not sure but like there's no one in there. We walked right into the toad

713
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:48,760
Toad place restaurant and oh, that's right. We got that tip. Yeah that the toad cafe is yeah

714
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:55,560
You're gonna you actually can get in there. So next year you'll do all of it. You said I think I'm gonna have to at this point

715
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,360
I mean, I'm I am especially disappointed admittedly about Fight Fest. I was ready to do it

716
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,720
Yeah, and we can it's not happening in general Geo didn't end up able to do it either

717
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,600
So we got to really commit now next year. Yeah, but that's you know, hey, you know, you can't

718
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,040
That's why there's space between dr. Strange 2 and dr. Strange 3 right Scott Gertner is

719
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,520
You know, you got to wet the appetite. You got to get people excited, you know, give them a little break from the franchise

720
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:25,880
So yeah, hopefully Friday fest 3 and I've got some other thoughts about things to do, you know down the line

721
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,360
But I do want to say it just if I'm tossing out things and you know, you don't have to listen to anything

722
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,800
I say a while I'm gone. It's hey, it's it's it's yours take

723
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,960
Drive this baby as fast as you want as slow as you want, whatever you want to do

724
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,440
But I will say, you know, don't shy away from big stuff

725
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,080
Whatever you got to do in my app don't like save anything for me unless it's so this

726
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,820
It's another Beach Boys episode or Ben look Leno either save Beach Boys and Leno for me

727
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:55,520
But otherwise do whatever do whatever you want. November is Space Mountain Pirates

728
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,440
Daddy's away the cats will play

729
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,440
No, I you know what do big stuff actually I say specifically

730
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:13,560
Do big stuff do the things that the whole audience has been asking for. Oh, I've got a good idea

731
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,960
Yeah, oh, I just had an I won't tell you what it is. Oh good idea. Okay. Okay. All right. I'll tell you

732
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,700
Let me tell you I'll tell you I'll tell you Indiana Jones to November

733
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:27,080
This would be the time we're doing it. You are finally free

734
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:33,040
Yeah from the person blocking your dream of a sequel to it. We're doing it already done. We're doing it

735
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,680
Six Flags Friday has to open the door

736
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,880
The door well, but that's a different that's sort of a different the crimson door the red door

737
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,680
Yeah, no, this is like has been open fucking Scots. You're just a boy

738
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:55,000
It's just the boys are left then then the narc is gone. We can do whatever we want now. Okay, so I mean

739
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:01,260
Seven years ago. Did we talk about the ice falling cuz Tony Baxter said that there was ice in the original

740
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,280
Bachelor PTR bachelor party, baby

741
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,400
Yeah, we both were going to go wildly counting on the other one to listen to the original episode in neither of us

742
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:17,280
We're just gonna cover the same stuff. I'm not gonna do it. Yeah, I'm gonna try to do it word-perfect

743
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,960
like

744
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,800
important upcoming alike psycho 99

745
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:28,880
Do the psycho make yeah very soon. Yeah. Yeah, very good. Yeah, look we have some Jason

746
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,400
I've already discussed some topics also, so

747
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,960
Okay, very good. Yeah

748
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,600
Plans are but and again, I won't be right away. You'll hear me in October

749
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,120
But you know, yeah November is what's gonna be insane for me

750
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,480
and that's why just like

751
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:46,920
Do whatever you want cover the blockbusters if you need to if you look would this drive me insane to miss this?

752
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,360
Of course

753
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:54,240
But if you were cornered and you had to do wailing flowers and madam without me, I would understand

754
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,840
You know ultimately at the end of the day

755
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,100
I have a beautiful baby boy and I could cope I could look in his eyes

756
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:06,240
Yeah, would help me cope with the pain of having missed madam right while I was gone

757
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,720
Well, if you if you have to only if you have to

758
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:17,000
That's a hard one. Yeah, but I think we're gonna save that for next year, too. Okay. Good. Well, I think we're gonna say

759
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,800
I just got an email. The shoot has been extended for a year here. Yeah. Yeah. Oh Dr. Strange four and five have been added

760
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,400
Before he gets bladed, you know

761
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,320
Where you showing the door?

762
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,120
if you had look if you had to

763
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:42,460
Convert the entire show into being an album by album Green Day dissection podcast, right while I was gone

764
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:49,380
I would understand I could I could cope with that if this had to become you talking dookie to me

765
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,860
I

766
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:58,740
Will I will cope as much as I would love to hear more about how warning influenced your guitar?

767
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:05,700
Your guitar it's sort of the foundation of my guitar playing honestly is sort of learning those power chords. Well that way

768
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,980
Yeah, I mean like well, that's why we got to get you with

769
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:13,200
Marin because Marin loves talking about like you drive into like well, so you are you a buddy guy guy

770
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,820
Are you a Robert Johnson guy? Yeah. Well, I'm kind of what's his name was Joe Armstrong. Oh, oh, that's him

771
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,900
Oh, he's the guitarist. Oh, yeah, I'm a beyond kind of ability

772
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,700
Yeah, look castaway

773
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:30,360
Warning all these songs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's at the heart church on Sunday

774
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,220
Mm-hmm great song. See this is like I'm gonna soak it up

775
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,120
Well, I can the naming of these songs

776
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,260
we all because knowing that I might leave and that you guys might just

777
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:45,140
Take episodes to name all of these songs and get it out of your system permanently forever

778
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:51,160
I think it just get us more excited to say it later, you know when Scott's when Scott's back, you know, we gotta do

779
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,540
Say more names

780
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,860
Say more names

781
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,820
Anyways, well, we'll we will see how this plays out

782
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:05,580
I do look I want to say this as I'm doing right now. There are episodes

783
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,020
of this show where I play up my beleaguer mint with

784
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:15,620
Certain lines of conversation and certain lengths of those lines of conversation

785
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:20,620
You'll hear that mode of Scott on the show from time to time. You will hear it in future episodes

786
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:25,120
I would say but let me be very clear. I love doing the show

787
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:30,800
It's not ideal to have to step away from the show and I'm excited to be back whenever I'm back

788
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:35,740
This show it's it's such a invaluable creative vessel for me

789
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:42,940
It gives me sanity and and and something to do when the rest of the careers are very slow and when the career is faster

790
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:47,180
it keeps me sharp and is a great outlet then to and

791
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:53,620
At the ultimately I just like having fun with you guys and it's always after

792
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,940
Seven-year we're heading for the seven-year anniversary and it's still a guaranteed

793
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:03,260
I sit down and have fun and laugh a lot. And so I'm I hope I'm not away from that for too long

794
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:09,420
Well, thank you for saying that we will miss you we've already done a couple and I really Scott is in the room even when

795
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:14,820
He's not in the room. Let me just say that too. His presence will be felt AI

796
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,900
It's a waltz style animatronic, what do you think Scott?

797
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,620
So it will yeah a glass of wine

798
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:31,300
You won't be too far from these episodes if they go the way of the few that Jason and I have already done

799
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:38,620
And yeah interesting to hear yes, and so yeah, you will be around we will not be replaced

800
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:42,380
Permanently by mr. Morrow or anything, but I don't know. We'll see

801
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:48,860
With all this joy in my life well as new in my life that there's still

802
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:53,740
Like in the back of my head that I walk out of here as soon as I leave

803
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,500
Who comes buzzing in like a bee into a pocket?

804
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,220
But mr. Morrow and suddenly then I come back and there's no place for me

805
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:08,340
There's no possible my chair is full this Scott chair has been this musical chairs has reached a permanent end

806
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:11,820
No offer has been made or anything. I so so I wouldn't worry about it

807
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:17,300
But you know, we'll see we're gonna experiment. We're gonna have a little fun while you're gone boy

808
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:22,300
and we'll see yeah, we'll see we'll see who who's on the show and

809
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:29,100
What crossovers could possibly happen that cardona just put up a video where he was talking about being a free agent

810
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:34,140
But he thinks it's time for a home and I think everyone's gonna be surprised where he lands

811
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:41,060
Where is where is he just left? What was his he's been around? He wrestles in GCW. He's wrestled in impact

812
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:46,460
I think he's talking about trying to sign with a WWE or an AEW but Jason is he going with WWE?

813
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:50,940
Is he going with AEW? No, he's going with PTR. Yeah PTR. Maybe that's what Jason's alluding to

814
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,180
I don't know. We haven't discussed that off Mike, but got to make an offer

815
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,740
Can we make an offer?

816
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,740
competitive with professional wrestling

817
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:05,260
Yeah, and how much how much of your guys how bad do you want them?

818
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:10,580
Well, how much yeah, how much does your third become not a third Jason's willing to give up some of his

819
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:16,380
But yes, congratulations Scott on all this stuff, this is all very exciting and

820
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:23,460
We will we will carry on but I don't I don't anticipate it being so

821
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,740
Long or jarring to the listeners

822
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:34,060
Yeah, I hope not. Again. Again. This is going incredibly quickly. Yeah, this is gonna be this is going to be a whirlwind. Yes

823
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:39,980
Which is some of the excitement of it just just diving in. Yeah, so yeah again

824
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:45,500
Thanks for thanks for being cool and that goes for the audience too. And it seems like there's some hijinks afoot too and

825
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:52,780
I would like to do one more little thing that sort of plants the flag for when I'm like fully back

826
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:56,660
And then hopefully them and at worst saves my job, right?

827
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,940
Because this is what I'm about to bring out. I don't know if this is something mr

828
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:05,320
Morrow is gonna bring the table interesting. So this is you know, consider this a negotiation tactic

829
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:12,420
But yeah, this is here's something that I've been wanting to fit into which into the show for a long time since March actually

830
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,740
this goes way back and this seems like the slot because

831
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:22,260
Back in March. I took a great trip just the then three of us

832
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:28,820
My family to Escondido to the the Welk Resort. That's something I've brought up here and there

833
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,660
this this very charming little place was a little like shopping center and

834
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:38,820
You could stand with a statue of Lawrence Welk and then and it's really it's down in San Diego County

835
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:44,940
So you can like it's you know, it's in the like picturesque area of San Diego County a little more north and

836
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,980
You know a ton to do around there and that trip ended up being

837
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:50,780
We were having so much fun

838
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:56,540
We added a day and when that day became our day to go to Legoland and I haven't really talked about that on

839
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:59,900
The show Legoland was wonderful. We had a great time

840
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:06,820
Ultimately, I have not been like fast-tracking an episode about it because that's kind of what I have to say about it

841
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,060
So it was very pleasant. My son liked a lot. There's a lot of cool Lego stuff

842
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:18,340
That doesn't you know, it's neither here nor there it's neither the greatest thing I've ever done ie Casa Bonita nor the

843
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,420
Worst thing I've ever done Elitch Gardens

844
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:26,660
These seem like the avenues to make a good PTR. So it's caught in that middle

845
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:32,620
Maybe I don't know we I'm sure we could do it at some point. You should get down there with your daughter Mike

846
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:35,700
Well, and that maybe it can all coalesce into something

847
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:41,540
But what I actually want to talk about is something that back in that trip that I did on my way back

848
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:48,140
A place where I stopped to grab a bite and I actually picked up a couple of things for you guys. Oh

849
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,060
I've been sitting on this for a while

850
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,780
Let me throw it your way crinkle crinkle

851
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:03,180
Why I'll decide this is for you Mike because this looks like what you put on the rim of an alcoholic drink or a non

852
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,620
Alcoholic drink here. Can you catch that? I think I can that is

853
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,400
Sound effect for the mic. Yeah, really that is some

854
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:13,300
breaking bad blue rock candy

855
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,300
Officially licensed product

856
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:25,260
And I will toss to you I mean that's the big ticket item, but I also wanted somebody to get and therefore Jason you will get

857
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,660
Crunch Los Poyos Hermanos

858
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,620
gummy chicken

859
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:39,420
So we have here official breaking bad food stuff my gosh now

860
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:48,100
Enjoy that but mainly is this does this make your head Mike go to where I might have picked up these items. Oh

861
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,900
That's a go interesting. Oh

862
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:59,780
Hmm, and it's on the way to Legoland. It is I mean it's in that county

863
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:02,060
It's in sort of like I forget if it's Riverside of San Diego

864
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:07,420
But you know kind of like south. I mean, should I say the town? Yeah, say the town is Temecula

865
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:13,820
Yeah, do you now that you really did you do it? I went to no way swing in cafe

866
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,300
Dean Norris's

867
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,700
barbecue

868
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:23,580
In Temecula, which if you're listening closely to the show Mike has mentioned. Oh my god a handful of times

869
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:28,580
your fascination with this place with an Instagram account where

870
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,500
Dean Norris Hank from Breaking Bad

871
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,140
Slash total recall and all that great stuff before Breaking Bad

872
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:41,580
Where he he pops in he talks about like I'm grilling up great stuff today. All right, we're out of meat

873
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:46,300
We're out of ribs today. Don't work coming. You're driving in. Don't come sorry about that

874
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:50,260
Out of it handle you don't got chairs either

875
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:56,140
Yes, I went to Dean Norris's barbecue restaurant in Temecula

876
00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:01,700
I've been sitting on this for six months so much bigger news than my six months. My god

877
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,220
And it was the main thing making me want to do because honestly Lego land

878
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,420
I just don't have that much to say all very pleasant nice

879
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:07,740
Yeah

880
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:13,340
But but what I was wanting to put in there was this reveal secret was you guys catching a bag of candy meth?

881
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,340
This is six month old candy man. Yeah

882
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:19,260
Six month old candy. I can't imagine it impacts Jason

883
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:24,020
Shelf stable. I'm not really worried. This might be years old

884
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,900
in the initial batch of the

885
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:30,740
During Breaking Bad mania ten years ago breaking bad candy at his

886
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:35,220
Well, this was one of my big questions is how is his celebrity?

887
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,900
Reflected in the restaurant, right?

888
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:42,740
Now I didn't have I'd say the full experience especially because I didn't have barbecue what this ended

889
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:45,220
This was on the way back from Escondido

890
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:51,620
So it made sense as a breakfast as a pre-drive breakfast a great breakfast nothing too Breaking Bad about it

891
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,700
I mean I may have I'm trying to remember if I

892
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,660
Broke the bacon into my age

893
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:03,380
Be the way there is a lot of breakfast in Breaking Bad actually, yeah, it does all it does thematically tie together

894
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:09,260
But I haven't done barbecue. That means I think Mike you got to do barbecue. You got to get down there

895
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:13,260
I maybe make it part of a Lego land or you know, you're in San Diego for a mount

896
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:17,980
That's what I was saying. Yeah dad have the full experience and maybe ideal worlds

897
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:24,140
We got to try to get a whole Dean Norris. Well, I pitched to the doughboys that we take a party bus to Temecula

898
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,020
Not agreed to it

899
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:34,140
And I was like if we could get Dean on the party bus either to or coming from

900
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:41,020
Wow, I'm not no one's approved that no one has said this is happening. It's a big leap to from his now

901
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:43,020
We're talking it. Well, I don't know

902
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:48,100
Seven people minimum. Why why not? Why should I? Yeah, let's do the fucking party bus

903
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:51,580
Yeah, this is I got exhausting months ahead of us if at the end of that

904
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:54,740
Oh, yeah, I was taking a party bus to Temecula to hang with Hank

905
00:56:55,740 --> 00:57:02,100
I think there's no doubt we could talk to Dean if he's around. I don't know we get him on the bus

906
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:07,900
I mean we get him on the bus if the bus is parked outside the place. Yeah, I'm sure we could do like couple shots

907
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:12,220
It's technically, you know, it's old town. It's it's not the widest streets. That's the only warning about the bus

908
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:16,120
But we can't this man. I don't know the whole alien. We might have to like pull up and pull up behind

909
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:21,900
Yeah, you know old old dusty roads. That's part of the charm of old town Temecula. Yeah, I gotta push

910
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,620
Yeah, I've pushed a couple ideas on doughboys about

911
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,540
Barbecue guy

912
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:35,900
Great sure who doesn't it seems so it looks solid from the Instagram. Yeah, and

913
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:42,580
We're worth trying. Yeah boy. Well if we a good little experience I had I'd love to do the full tilt experience

914
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:46,100
And this is my way of saying as we think about

915
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:49,580
2025 when my insanity is done and I'm back

916
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,260
I

917
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:56,140
Know probably before that a little bit, but the this is my way of saying should we make it official?

918
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:03,580
Celebrity to yes, celebrity to is where we do is happening. We're really calling shots today. Yeah. Yeah

919
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:08,600
I mean cuz I want to think ahead I want to have a big PCR thing to look forward to

920
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:13,580
besides an episode at Indiana Jones to for which I am absent

921
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,800
What if it's Indiana Jones to with Tony Baxter

922
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:25,220
But I waited I think it'll happen but opportunities and I have to turn down others

923
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:32,940
Well, let's you know, because I've been keeping a running. I I have notions and pitches of what could go into celebrity, too

924
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:36,500
Yeah, I think there's very cool possibilities and this could certainly be one

925
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,220
if my work is

926
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:46,620
Delayed if I if Marvel if Feige fires me and rehires me and I get preoccupied again, we could just

927
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,140
Turn it into celebrity April

928
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:52,540
We could we sure. Yeah, always the bump option. However

929
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,980
Celeb you may is a harder sell. I'd say right

930
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:04,620
So it's so let's let grammar drive it. But besides that, I think that could be good. So celebrity to coming Wow

931
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,340
2025 and

932
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:13,140

00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,740
Which I I really was not avoiding Kingdom Keepers

938
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:40,220
I promise I promise the day that he was boy that he ended up the day of the water break

939
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:42,220
I listened to a fifth of it on

940
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:47,700
Audiobook I even had I also had a physical copy from the library, okay

941
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:54,140
So it was my intent. So I hope you will there will be no accusations of me

942
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:58,220
I don't know timing this cannot do Kingdom Keepers. Can you throw out a couple specific?

943
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,900
Do you remember some of the names of the characters?

944
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:07,300
I mean, I have Finn but it is very closely close to me saying Finn Wolfhard and I know that's not right

945
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:10,660
It's not right. No, that's an actor in our world at this point

946
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:14,500
I don't know if you'll have time to listen to the club three episode that we just put out

947
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:19,640
But the club I will say this the club three episode ended with a discovery of another

948
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:22,620
All-star rock and roll band made up of non

949
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,800
Musicians was this the rock bottom remainders?

950
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,780
The author of it Ridley Pearson

951
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:39,140
The fact I can say was was the architect together like they didn't we talk about a weird guy who was the guy who put together?

952
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:44,940
Ringo's all-star band once. Yes, we did Pearson, right is the catalyst of

953
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:47,620
Which had what like Amy Tan?

954
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:54,460
Mac Groening Mac Groening. Yeah, they played with Warren's Yvonne in 97

955
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:58,860
Wow, they were on Craig Ferguson is their final like TV appearance

956
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:02,500
But it but if again if you don't if if you want to go subscribe

957
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,780
Listeners if you want to hear about Kingdom Keepers

958
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:11,260
