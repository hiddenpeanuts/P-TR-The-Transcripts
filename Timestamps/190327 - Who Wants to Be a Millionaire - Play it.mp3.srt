1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,360
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,304 --> 00:00:24,664
All right, second gate, nobody asked for it,

3
00:00:24,664 --> 00:00:26,084
and you got it.

4
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:28,504
We're finally doing it.

5
00:00:28,784 --> 00:00:30,924
That could be most of the second gate, honestly.

6
00:00:30,984 --> 00:00:33,744
The podcast in general, that is correct.

7
00:00:34,064 --> 00:00:37,044
Today we are covering who wants to be a millionaire?

8
00:00:37,624 --> 00:00:38,184
Play it.

9
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,624
Play it, exclamation point.

10
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:43,444
Play it, beginning the trend of weird punctuation

11
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:44,524
in theme park attractions.

12
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:47,004
Seems like it was written, when you would write it out,

13
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,144
it was who wants to be a millionaire,

14
00:00:48,484 --> 00:00:50,324
dash play it, exclamation point.

15
00:00:50,324 --> 00:00:52,344
So two punctuations in there.

16
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:55,424
Is it that long dash like guardians has?

17
00:00:56,384 --> 00:00:59,124
It's like a longer, it's not just a minus sign,

18
00:00:59,264 --> 00:01:00,684
it's kind of a long dash.

19
00:01:00,804 --> 00:01:02,964
I always just kind of use those interchangeably

20
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:05,044
because I think a middle school English teacher

21
00:01:05,044 --> 00:01:09,044
at a certain point got fed up after colons and semicolons

22
00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:13,184
and went, you know what, we're moving on to Charles Dickens.

23
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:15,004
It was like, enough of this.

24
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:19,264
Hard, hard fight against colons.

25
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:21,584
You know what, let's just stick to literature.

26
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:22,624
Hmm, hmm.

27
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:25,804
And that affected the theme park naming structures

28
00:01:25,804 --> 00:01:26,984
as we know them today.

29
00:01:27,824 --> 00:01:29,144
And we're gonna get into all of that.

30
00:01:29,204 --> 00:01:30,904
I'm Scott Garner, joined by Jason Sheridan

31
00:01:30,904 --> 00:01:31,704
and Mike Carlson.

32
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,304
Hey, yeah.

33
00:01:33,284 --> 00:01:34,604
Yeah, who wants to be a millionaire?

34
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:35,084
Play it.

35
00:01:35,124 --> 00:01:38,164
Very possible that people don't know about this,

36
00:01:38,604 --> 00:01:43,964
but they're for a brief time, I believe from 2001 to 2004

37
00:01:43,964 --> 00:01:45,604
in Disney's California Adventure

38
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:49,204
and then in Disney's Hollywood Studios from 2001 to 2006.

39
00:01:49,204 --> 00:01:55,124
There was a live experience themed after the ABC

40
00:01:55,124 --> 00:01:59,584
game show mega hit, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

41
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:02,744
They perfectly recreated the set

42
00:02:02,744 --> 00:02:04,744
and you could sit and watch.

43
00:02:04,844 --> 00:02:07,864
Imagine that being on the set of a game show,

44
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:13,424
being in a theme park where you can go into magical forests

45
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,204
and the future and space and you get to sit

46
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:17,404
on a game show set.

47
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:21,204
This ride made, this attraction made it possible

48
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:22,424
and you got to play it.

49
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:26,924
This, for our younger listeners,

50
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,764
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire of its time

51
00:02:30,764 --> 00:02:34,724
was the most popular show on TV.

52
00:02:35,184 --> 00:02:39,604
Drawing something like 25 to 28 million viewings

53
00:02:39,604 --> 00:02:42,444
in the early days and episode, it was an event.

54
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:46,204
It was so big in the summer of 1999

55
00:02:46,204 --> 00:02:48,564
and I think it came out in nowhere.

56
00:02:48,604 --> 00:02:52,104
I think it was primed to be a decent little summer hit,

57
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:54,624
summer where you don't have the sitcom season

58
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:58,924
so they can't rely on new Sabrina the Teenage Witch

59
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:03,404
or what the hell else was on step by step.

60
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:03,884
Yeah.

61
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:05,324
I guess not by that point,

62
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:08,404
but two guys, a girl and a pizza place.

63
00:03:08,704 --> 00:03:11,084
So they have to invent some stuff for the summer

64
00:03:11,164 --> 00:03:15,344
and I remember how thoroughly this blew up

65
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:18,684
and I think it seemed to come out of nowhere.

66
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,844
Regis Philbin, he's on TV all the time.

67
00:03:20,844 --> 00:03:23,924
Why would a Regis Philbin thing be such a phenomenon?

68
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:27,364
But oh my God, it was, this format imported from England

69
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:30,464
and so much so that it started airing four nights a week

70
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:31,264
at its peak.

71
00:03:31,304 --> 00:03:33,344
It was on TV so much.

72
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:35,124
Yeah, and it was an event.

73
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:39,264
I remember being down the beach in summertime,

74
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:41,504
like, okay, we ate dinner,

75
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:44,244
time to gather around the TV to watch

76
00:03:44,244 --> 00:03:45,804
who wants to be a millionaire

77
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:49,484
and I remember seeing live the episode

78
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:52,464
because it went away and came back that November

79
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:55,184
and that's when the first guy won the million.

80
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:58,604
I just rewatched this, John Carpenter, was his name?

81
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:02,104
And he was so, he was cool as a cucumber.

82
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:05,644
That last question, he had not used a lifeline yet,

83
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:08,764
used a lifeline to call his dad to say,

84
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:10,324
dad, I'm just calling to tell you

85
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:11,604
I'm about to win the million dollars.

86
00:04:11,604 --> 00:04:12,884
I know the answer to the question.

87
00:04:13,384 --> 00:04:16,124
What a showboat, what a fuck you.

88
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:17,824
And he was right, he didn't know it.

89
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,324
Audience goes ape shit.

90
00:04:19,544 --> 00:04:19,984
Yeah.

91
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:24,904
Yeah, I recall from the time that he then,

92
00:04:24,984 --> 00:04:27,324
like two nights later, said live from New York,

93
00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:28,464
it's Saturday night.

94
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:30,044
On Saturday night live.

95
00:04:30,064 --> 00:04:31,064
100%.

96
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:32,884
There's this odd stray episode

97
00:04:32,884 --> 00:04:35,044
in the history of who got to say that.

98
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:36,524
And this was- John Carpenter,

99
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:37,484
game show winner.

100
00:04:40,224 --> 00:04:42,444
When like, start of 1999,

101
00:04:42,704 --> 00:04:45,544
I remember being a kid feeling on top of the world

102
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:47,084
because I was like, I'm in eighth grade,

103
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,704
we're the oldest kids in the school, doing the play,

104
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:51,764
Islands of Adventure opening.

105
00:04:52,184 --> 00:04:53,944
I was like a pig in shit.

106
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:57,484
And then fall 1999, I started high school

107
00:04:57,484 --> 00:05:00,384
and reality hit me like a cement truck.

108
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:03,764
And yeah, freshman year was not easy.

109
00:05:04,444 --> 00:05:06,324
Oh man, I can kind of relate to you

110
00:05:06,324 --> 00:05:08,364
except for the part where I was on top of the world.

111
00:05:09,444 --> 00:05:11,484
My middle school and high school were just the same,

112
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:13,764
there's just one continuity of like, ugh.

113
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:14,784
Oh, okay.

114
00:05:15,444 --> 00:05:18,564
But I don't know, I think I felt some optimism

115
00:05:18,564 --> 00:05:20,484
in the summer of, I know exactly what you're saying.

116
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:23,324
I think I was also going from middle school to high school

117
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:26,644
and Regis does make me think of like a summer vacation

118
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:30,064
where we all watched it and maybe I would achieve

119
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:33,504
some fortune with the reset that would come from high school

120
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:35,404
and this did not necessarily occur.

121
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:38,624
I also, this is a personal anecdote,

122
00:05:38,664 --> 00:05:41,444
I got an accolade on the way out of middle school.

123
00:05:41,784 --> 00:05:46,904
Like I, so there was like, you know, best whatever,

124
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:51,524
best chorus member, best yearbook editor, best all of this.

125
00:05:51,524 --> 00:05:54,564
And there was best actors for the middle school.

126
00:05:54,984 --> 00:05:57,684
And for one, it went to one guy and one girl

127
00:05:57,684 --> 00:05:59,364
and two girls had tied in the past,

128
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:00,904
but two guys had never tied.

129
00:06:02,464 --> 00:06:04,144
And me and another guy tied.

130
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:07,544
And I was like, yeah, we did it.

131
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:08,924
Look at us, we're good.

132
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:09,864
Huh.

133
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:11,124
Yeah.

134
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:13,024
And that was you and Mike Carlson.

135
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:15,104
And Mike Carlson, that's how we met.

136
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:17,424
We've known each other for 30 years.

137
00:06:18,484 --> 00:06:19,564
I don't think that's.

138
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:20,864
That doesn't work out?

139
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:23,184
No, you're not 43 years old, are you?

140
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:24,884
Sometimes it feels like it.

141
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:29,584
The memory of it, I feel like we did watch it.

142
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:31,384
I don't know that we all gathered around the TV

143
00:06:31,384 --> 00:06:33,624
to watch the show, but I do,

144
00:06:33,624 --> 00:06:35,024
I was fascinated by it.

145
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:36,824
There was something about it where it was Regis,

146
00:06:36,924 --> 00:06:38,864
it was a combination of Regis and like,

147
00:06:39,344 --> 00:06:41,404
it was the start of these big,

148
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:43,584
like not that this is that high concept,

149
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,844
but this is, what's it called?

150
00:06:46,424 --> 00:06:48,484
Deal or no deal doesn't happen without millionaire.

151
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:51,144
Like the back, the prime time game show is back.

152
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,344
And it's. Darkly lit.

153
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:54,604
They have more of a late night show vibe.

154
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:56,144
It's glowing floors.

155
00:06:56,644 --> 00:06:58,384
It's glass and pillars.

156
00:06:58,764 --> 00:07:02,124
And more quips. One versus 100 also.

157
00:07:02,484 --> 00:07:04,544
I liked one versus a hundred.

158
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:05,724
I liked Wicked Link.

159
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:07,484
I thought she was very funny.

160
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:09,964
Yeah, they got a good, mean host.

161
00:07:10,124 --> 00:07:13,244
Yeah, she was mean and Regis, you know, I like to read this,

162
00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:15,744
but she was mean and that was different for a game show.

163
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:17,164
Yeah, that was.

164
00:07:17,284 --> 00:07:19,264
You still got this trend today, essentially.

165
00:07:19,584 --> 00:07:22,404
Yes, it's like almost back in crazier than ever now.

166
00:07:22,684 --> 00:07:25,104
I'm excited for this Rob Lowe thing

167
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:28,164
where you're on an arm and it's swings you around.

168
00:07:28,524 --> 00:07:29,484
Oh, yeah.

169
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:32,764
What color is the Smurfs green?

170
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:33,684
I saw that.

171
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:35,104
Sorry, it's blue.

172
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:36,704
Whoa.

173
00:07:36,884 --> 00:07:38,904
That's a. Mechanical arm swings you around the room.

174
00:07:38,904 --> 00:07:40,104
Is that a Cucar?

175
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:43,044
Yeah, they had to recheck that Cucar technology.

176
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:43,804
Mental Samurai.

177
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,304
We're talking about the new show Mental Samurai.

178
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:47,764
Are you a mental samurai?

179
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:49,584
It's like a high. Excited for him.

180
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:51,584
High budget Nickelodeon show.

181
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:52,944
Yeah. Yeah.

182
00:07:52,964 --> 00:07:54,644
Because it does, it's like a crazy, like a,

183
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:56,204
you think of like Japanese game shows,

184
00:07:56,364 --> 00:07:58,284
like doing more like that, stuff like that.

185
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:00,044
But no, prime time, baby.

186
00:08:01,484 --> 00:08:03,704
Trivia cages in prime time.

187
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:05,684
And it wouldn't have happened without Regis.

188
00:08:06,164 --> 00:08:06,644
That's true.

189
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:08,544
And I was just gonna mention the Titan games,

190
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:10,564
which I brought up before, the Rock's crazy.

191
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:13,104
Like it is an insane budget

192
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:15,284
and these are big stars hosting these shows.

193
00:08:15,784 --> 00:08:16,904
And yeah, Regis did it.

194
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:17,664
It's Regis's fault.

195
00:08:18,224 --> 00:08:19,524
Millionaire's been on ever since.

196
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:20,264
It never went away.

197
00:08:20,344 --> 00:08:21,804
Right, it's just in syndication now.

198
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:22,544
Still in syndication?

199
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,624
I didn't even know, like, do you know Terry Crews

200
00:08:24,624 --> 00:08:25,724
was the host of Who Wants to Be?

201
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:26,544
I did not know that.

202
00:08:26,544 --> 00:08:28,724
I knew Meredith Vieira was the host.

203
00:08:28,864 --> 00:08:29,624
And then who is it now?

204
00:08:29,704 --> 00:08:31,844
If we worked in a hospital, we'd know this, but.

205
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,344
That's right.

206
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:33,424
Who is it now?

207
00:08:33,924 --> 00:08:36,444
I think it's Chris Harrison from The Bachelor.

208
00:08:36,804 --> 00:08:38,584
Oh yeah, that's right.

209
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:41,004
Yeah, but there's been more too.

210
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:42,664
I can't begin to name them all.

211
00:08:42,724 --> 00:08:46,584
If I told you Jason hosted from 2009 to 2011,

212
00:08:46,764 --> 00:08:47,624
would you believe it?

213
00:08:48,464 --> 00:08:49,244
Kill for that.

214
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:51,164
I liked Meredith Vieira.

215
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:52,204
Sure?

216
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:54,424
His old job used to have the Today show on.

217
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:56,464
And I was like, yeah, I like when Meredith is on.

218
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,704
I think she was shit canned at some point.

219
00:08:58,844 --> 00:08:59,424
Is that right?

220
00:08:59,684 --> 00:09:00,104
I think so.

221
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:01,284
Is that a lower request?

222
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:02,644
She was on The View.

223
00:09:02,644 --> 00:09:02,844
Maybe.

224
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:03,424
You're out.

225
00:09:04,684 --> 00:09:05,104
Yeah.

226
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:08,244
She always seemed like a confident voice of reason.

227
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:14,344
I'm not recalling anything extremely dark with her,

228
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:17,204
which is a rarity for an NBC news personality.

229
00:09:17,404 --> 00:09:18,724
I was thinking about that.

230
00:09:18,904 --> 00:09:19,824
Like, oh, does she have skeletons?

231
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:21,064
We all went silent for a second.

232
00:09:21,164 --> 00:09:23,624
I think we all went, is she scanning, scanning?

233
00:09:23,624 --> 00:09:25,144
Is there a problem with Meredith Vieira?

234
00:09:25,204 --> 00:09:26,624
We might discover there is one later.

235
00:09:26,744 --> 00:09:29,164
Yeah, we'll do a follow up episode.

236
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:33,744
Apologizing for saying that she was okay.

237
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:35,484
That she fired a gun in the air,

238
00:09:35,744 --> 00:09:37,244
like a state fair or something.

239
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:40,004
My favorite millionaire thing,

240
00:09:40,024 --> 00:09:42,164
and I wanna say I did watch it live,

241
00:09:42,184 --> 00:09:43,924
but I've seen the YouTube clip

242
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:46,004
as Norm MacDonald on Millionaire.

243
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:50,004
Where Norm breezes through the whole game

244
00:09:51,064 --> 00:09:54,544
and then Regis convinces him not to risk it at the end.

245
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:58,764
Cause he's gonna, he's like kinda not confident

246
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,644
about the last question, do we get the million dollars?

247
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,324
And Regis is like, don't do it if you don't know.

248
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:03,704
Just take the 500,000.

249
00:10:03,784 --> 00:10:05,004
And Norm's like, yeah, all right, fine.

250
00:10:05,664 --> 00:10:06,704
So I think he took it.

251
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:07,944
And I think he would have won it,

252
00:10:07,944 --> 00:10:09,484
but Regis talked him out of it.

253
00:10:10,104 --> 00:10:11,164
It's a pretty crazy clip. Was it for charity?

254
00:10:11,304 --> 00:10:12,384
Yeah. Oh, okay.

255
00:10:12,664 --> 00:10:13,684
What if it wasn't?

256
00:10:13,684 --> 00:10:17,284
In real life, whenever putting all your money on the line

257
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,344
was a possibility, Norm did it.

258
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:20,124
He took it. Yep.

259
00:10:20,124 --> 00:10:21,784
And that brings him where he is today.

260
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:22,324
Yep.

261
00:10:23,764 --> 00:10:24,764
But fake money.

262
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,704
At least he didn't risk charity money.

263
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:31,144
So this thing was a phenomenon in 1999.

264
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,544
Keep in mind what I said earlier.

265
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,444
This attraction opened in 2001.

266
00:10:36,604 --> 00:10:41,924
By 2001, they were feeling the effects

267
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:45,004
of putting something on TV four nights a week.

268
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:47,724
The effect being that you get sick of it

269
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:52,024
and nothing, no star can burn that bright for that long.

270
00:10:52,124 --> 00:10:53,364
And while Millionaire never went away,

271
00:10:53,504 --> 00:10:57,304
it certainly stopped being a 25 million viewer a week

272
00:10:57,304 --> 00:10:58,444
enterprise.

273
00:11:00,004 --> 00:11:02,564
And another struggling enterprise

274
00:11:02,564 --> 00:11:04,464
was Disney's California Adventure.

275
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:05,164
Yeah.

276
00:11:05,344 --> 00:11:08,924
This was like the first band-aid put on the wound, wasn't it?

277
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:11,444
Like the first, like we gotta get something in there.

278
00:11:11,724 --> 00:11:15,244
Yeah. That was, yeah, sort of the quickest possible,

279
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:18,944
you know, it went up in the Hollywood area

280
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:22,224
and building a fake soundstage building

281
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:24,444
is relatively easy.

282
00:11:24,624 --> 00:11:27,224
They could build a box easier than they can build

283
00:11:27,224 --> 00:11:30,244
a new roller coaster or tower of terror.

284
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:31,764
So in it went.

285
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,584
If you're in California Adventure today

286
00:11:34,584 --> 00:11:37,544
and you imagine that the Muppets are on the left

287
00:11:37,544 --> 00:11:40,044
and the Monsters Inc ride is straight ahead of you,

288
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:41,944
then kind of also straight ahead of you,

289
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:44,224
but also off to the left, kind of buried in a corner

290
00:11:44,464 --> 00:11:46,964
is the building where Millionaire was.

291
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:49,304
And that is used, I remember there was some weird

292
00:11:49,304 --> 00:11:51,224
like Frozen Village in there.

293
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:54,284
It's still sort of set up there

294
00:11:54,284 --> 00:11:57,044
because there was a Pixar Pier event a couple months ago

295
00:11:57,044 --> 00:11:58,784
that I signed up for on the blog

296
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,784
and the Frozen Village stuff's still in there.

297
00:12:01,064 --> 00:12:03,084
Oh, they just know you like saw an open door in it.

298
00:12:03,104 --> 00:12:04,264
It was just in there.

299
00:12:04,384 --> 00:12:05,624
It was just like some of the stuff,

300
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:08,584
like set, like place making stuff were still up.

301
00:12:08,964 --> 00:12:12,664
So this is still the area where the temporary crap goes.

302
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:14,224
California Adventure.

303
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:19,164
And so they, yeah, immediate problems.

304
00:12:19,404 --> 00:12:20,404
We're thinking about this timeline.

305
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:23,784
This is February 2001.

306
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:26,884
They have immediately determined things are not working out.

307
00:12:27,324 --> 00:12:29,424
What properties do we possibly have?

308
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,064
Let's jam this into the park.

309
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:34,364
They do it, they get it open, it is sparkling and ready

310
00:12:34,364 --> 00:12:38,584
and we're almost ready to open it in September 2001.

311
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:41,964
Then some things happen and the ride,

312
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:46,424
the attraction opens on September 14th, 2001.

313
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:51,844
What a day to work that, like to work that first day

314
00:12:51,844 --> 00:12:55,084
of operation, can you imagine?

315
00:12:56,404 --> 00:12:59,164
Everybody's in a mood for trivia.

316
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:03,984
Everybody's, you know, everybody's in a great mood

317
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:06,064
for the quips of a game show host.

318
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:09,224
And in it went.

319
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:12,504
So several curses here.

320
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,724
The property has been diminished

321
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:16,924
in an immediately diminished park,

322
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,284
immediately after a tragedy.

323
00:13:20,344 --> 00:13:21,924
But how do they counteract it?

324
00:13:21,944 --> 00:13:24,104
What is the show that,

325
00:13:24,384 --> 00:13:28,744
how is the show able to rise above all of these challenges?

326
00:13:29,824 --> 00:13:30,724
Do you know?

327
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:37,004
Well, I gotta say, the set does look like the TV show set.

328
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:38,404
I do have to get them that.

329
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:39,564
Accuracy.

330
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:42,964
And I believe the prizes

331
00:13:42,964 --> 00:13:48,644
can fetch a pretty penny on eBay, the pin sets and stuff.

332
00:13:49,124 --> 00:13:51,364
Okay, well, let's talk about that.

333
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:53,964
The game is called Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

334
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:57,824
The theme park attraction does not give you

335
00:13:57,824 --> 00:14:00,144
the possibility of being a millionaire.

336
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:02,064
Well, you can get a million points, right?

337
00:14:02,084 --> 00:14:03,404
You get a million points.

338
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:03,844
Yeah.

339
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,284
Could you wait, I'm getting confused now.

340
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:09,624
The one in Florida you could get on the real show, maybe.

341
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:10,204
Is that right?

342
00:14:10,504 --> 00:14:12,924
That was, so if you got to a million points

343
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:15,364
for a short period of time in the early run

344
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:18,284
of the Florida show, you may win a chance

345
00:14:18,284 --> 00:14:20,884
to go see a taping in New York

346
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:22,364
of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

347
00:14:22,544 --> 00:14:25,864
And then eventually you would win a Disney Cruise vacation.

348
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:27,204
Oh, cause I'm confused.

349
00:14:27,244 --> 00:14:29,584
Cause I was, I feel like they made it unclear

350
00:14:29,584 --> 00:14:31,264
cause I played this in Florida.

351
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,104
And I was under the impression that

352
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:35,664
I was gonna be able to get on the show

353
00:14:35,664 --> 00:14:37,104
if I won out of the whole room.

354
00:14:37,104 --> 00:14:38,224
Wait, now played it?

355
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:39,344
Were you in the hot seat?

356
00:14:39,604 --> 00:14:40,004
No.

357
00:14:40,104 --> 00:14:40,384
Oh.

358
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:41,824
You played it in the audience.

359
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:42,484
Yes.

360
00:14:42,484 --> 00:14:43,584
Oh, okay.

361
00:14:44,104 --> 00:14:47,944
Every audience member had a chance to buzz in,

362
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:51,344
which could get you down to the 10 rows of chairs

363
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:55,924
where you could get a chance to get to the hot seat.

364
00:14:55,924 --> 00:14:57,624
Yeah, you had to come to get a ticket

365
00:14:57,624 --> 00:15:00,604
to get a passport that would give you entry

366
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:01,824
to sit in a chair.

367
00:15:01,824 --> 00:15:03,424
Yeah, so if I had won that,

368
00:15:03,464 --> 00:15:05,264
then they would have invited me the next round

369
00:15:05,264 --> 00:15:07,184
to sit in the closer seats.

370
00:15:07,764 --> 00:15:08,344
Or is that right?

371
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:09,364
Something like that.

372
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:12,184
I think they did two or three rounds per each session.

373
00:15:12,184 --> 00:15:15,544
I remember being so confused cause for a couple rounds,

374
00:15:15,604 --> 00:15:17,424
much like when we did a lead of Battle Angel,

375
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,464
a couple rounds, I was doing very well.

376
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:21,964
So much so that in the big room,

377
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:24,164
I was up top five or 10 or something.

378
00:15:24,744 --> 00:15:25,324
And they kept showing,

379
00:15:25,344 --> 00:15:27,004
did they show stats and say like,

380
00:15:27,044 --> 00:15:27,904
here's who's well. They did.

381
00:15:27,964 --> 00:15:29,084
They did on the big leader board.

382
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:29,724
Oh, interesting.

383
00:15:29,944 --> 00:15:31,544
Now, did you guys both do this then?

384
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:32,284
Cause I never did it.

385
00:15:32,284 --> 00:15:32,744
No, never.

386
00:15:33,124 --> 00:15:34,664
I never remember watching it. I did it in Florida.

387
00:15:34,664 --> 00:15:35,244
You did.

388
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:36,284
But not out here.

389
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:37,704
Okay.

390
00:15:38,244 --> 00:15:39,624
So what, when am I?

391
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:41,684
How did I lose?

392
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:42,604
I'm not that smart.

393
00:15:42,884 --> 00:15:43,244
Oh.

394
00:15:43,524 --> 00:15:46,124
I mean, I'm not smart as some 10 people or whatever

395
00:15:46,124 --> 00:15:47,164
that were in the room at the time.

396
00:15:47,264 --> 00:15:51,124
I mean, the on deck chairs were a staple of the TV show

397
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:53,964
and they would have to put stuff in the correct order.

398
00:15:54,264 --> 00:15:56,064
And the one who did it fastest,

399
00:15:56,844 --> 00:15:59,364
like which of these battles in World War II came first?

400
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:00,944
That's probably a little too heady.

401
00:16:01,224 --> 00:16:04,764
But whoever did it fastest got into the hot seat

402
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,484
and got to play with the host.

403
00:16:06,984 --> 00:16:07,264
Okay.

404
00:16:07,524 --> 00:16:09,684
The host who is,

405
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:13,024
it was those ever emulating Regis in any way,

406
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:14,904
or was it like just to, you know,

407
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:16,604
bring your own personality to it?

408
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:18,384
I think you had to make it your own.

409
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:18,784
I think, yeah.

410
00:16:18,784 --> 00:16:20,404
As many casting directors will tell you.

411
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,924
I think some people early on were encouraged

412
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:25,464
to imitate Regis, but.

413
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:27,664
My memory was a generic host.

414
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:28,184
Yeah.

415
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:30,484
So yeah, I don't think there would like trying to,

416
00:16:30,484 --> 00:16:32,344
they weren't doing Dana Carvey's Regis.

417
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:33,684
Like they weren't.

418
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:34,624
Well, that would have been fun.

419
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:35,184
Now that I think about it,

420
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:36,984
they should have all tried to do their Regis.

421
00:16:37,224 --> 00:16:37,544
Yeah.

422
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:38,744
That would actually have been a better choice.

423
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:40,104
That's a lot of like women,

424
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:42,964
like Florida actresses doing.

425
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:43,484
Great.

426
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:44,264
Out of control.

427
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:49,104
I did say on Wikipedia that the various hosts

428
00:16:49,104 --> 00:16:53,624
tried to emulate the US prime time host Regis Philips.

429
00:16:53,624 --> 00:16:53,784
Really?

430
00:16:53,984 --> 00:16:56,204
Hosting style, including his mannerisms.

431
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:58,524
But I watched the very last taping

432
00:16:58,524 --> 00:17:02,184
and it was just a charismatic camera ready kind of guy.

433
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:03,584


434
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,584
So you are competing not to be a millionaire.

435
00:17:07,704 --> 00:17:09,264
You're competing to maybe go on a cruise

436
00:17:09,264 --> 00:17:10,944
or maybe go to a taping.

437
00:17:11,144 --> 00:17:16,524
Along the way, there's like pins, you said?

438
00:17:17,524 --> 00:17:17,524


439
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,484
So similar to millionaire, similar to the TV show,

440
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,244
like every five questions,

441
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:26,724
you would like lock in your winning level.

442
00:17:26,724 --> 00:17:29,444
So if you got to a thousand points,

443
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:30,524
that was question five.

444
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:31,704
You got five questions right.

445
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:33,744
You got to play at lanyard,

446
00:17:34,824 --> 00:17:38,664
100 through 1000 level pins, that's a pin set,

447
00:17:39,204 --> 00:17:41,804
and a 1000 point baseball cap.

448
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:46,744
If you got to 10 questions right, that was 32,000 points.

449
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:50,964
You got the lanyard, 100 through 32,000 point pins,

450
00:17:51,424 --> 00:17:52,724
a thousand level baseball cap,

451
00:17:52,964 --> 00:17:55,944
and a 32,000 point embroidered shirt.

452
00:17:56,724 --> 00:17:58,024
Getting pretty good.

453
00:17:58,324 --> 00:17:59,784
If you get to a million,

454
00:17:59,784 --> 00:18:01,844
that means you answered 15 questions right.

455
00:18:02,104 --> 00:18:05,684
You get the lanyard, 100 to 1 million point pins.

456
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:09,064
So 15 fucking pins with numbers on them.

457
00:18:09,684 --> 00:18:14,524
A 1000 point baseball cap, 32,000 point embroidered shirt,

458
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:17,564
1 million point leather jacket.

459
00:18:17,884 --> 00:18:18,404
Whoa.

460
00:18:19,604 --> 00:18:22,284
A 1 million point medallion.

461
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:24,664
You know how, you know we're all coin boys here.

462
00:18:25,064 --> 00:18:27,444
And a Disney Cruise Line vacation for four.

463
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,444
Damn, all right.

464
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:29,644
That's sizable.

465
00:18:29,864 --> 00:18:30,564
That is good.

466
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,564
Do we have any sense of how people did?

467
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:35,324
Were they giving these prizes away a lot?

468
00:18:35,544 --> 00:18:37,224
Or was Disney trying to be stingy?

469
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:40,944
It seemed like people did all right.

470
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:44,324
I know enough that if you won,

471
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:47,164
if you were in the hot seat and won

472
00:18:47,164 --> 00:18:50,804
like you had a six month ban from coming back,

473
00:18:50,824 --> 00:18:52,064
and I think if you got the million,

474
00:18:52,104 --> 00:18:53,944
you had a one year ban from coming back.

475
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:57,544
I think you'd still enjoy it, but you could not play it.

476
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:01,124
So that I said play it with a period at the end of that time.

477
00:19:01,344 --> 00:19:04,384
All right, I found a new, who wants to be,

478
00:19:04,464 --> 00:19:06,284
it says it's new, which it's Glatton new,

479
00:19:06,464 --> 00:19:07,724
but apparently maybe it's never worn.

480
00:19:07,804 --> 00:19:08,484
Maybe it's still in the bag.

481
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,124
Disney, who wants to be a millionaire

482
00:19:10,124 --> 00:19:12,044
souvenir embroidered cat hat?

483
00:19:13,004 --> 00:19:16,844
Cat, I got a weird dyslexic thing there.

484
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:19,864
Hat cap, I guess is what it is.

485
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:22,344
It's $11.

486
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:24,064
Okay.

487
00:19:24,324 --> 00:19:25,844
Should I buy it?

488
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:28,764
That's up to you.

489
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:29,504
That's your call.

490
00:19:29,764 --> 00:19:31,684
That feel, I mean, like it's,

491
00:19:31,924 --> 00:19:34,424
you know, everyone takes pictures of their fit, right?

492
00:19:34,444 --> 00:19:35,644
That's what the young people say.

493
00:19:35,684 --> 00:19:36,164
They're fit.

494
00:19:36,404 --> 00:19:37,344
You can be a hype beast.

495
00:19:37,364 --> 00:19:38,464
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

496
00:19:38,564 --> 00:19:39,524
New slang from Jason.

497
00:19:39,624 --> 00:19:40,604
Isn't that an outfit?

498
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:42,364
Like you're fit, you take fit pics.

499
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:43,764
Oh, I've never heard that.

500
00:19:44,104 --> 00:19:44,864
Do you know what that is?

501
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:45,184
No.

502
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:46,984
Isn't that, am I crazy on this one?

503
00:19:47,444 --> 00:19:49,104
You know, I'm sure you know what you're talking about.

504
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,324
I just never heard it before.

505
00:19:50,804 --> 00:19:51,184
Huh.

506
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:52,684
Well, I'm going to think about buying this hat

507
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:52,864
because I'm a hat guy.

508
00:19:52,864 --> 00:19:54,824
I mean, you are, as usual, when we record,

509
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,624
you're wearing mostly Supreme branded clothing.

510
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:01,364
As if you were waiting for a, you know,

511
00:20:01,504 --> 00:20:03,404
a new sneaker release down on Fairfax.

512
00:20:03,864 --> 00:20:05,984
And I think this, who wants to be a millionaire,

513
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:08,544
thousand point hat will go nicely with it.

514
00:20:08,664 --> 00:20:11,004
Is it flat, is it flat for him or is it bent a little?

515
00:20:11,064 --> 00:20:11,624
It's bent.

516
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:12,324
Okay.

517
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:14,564
All right, well, that'll be a cliffhanger.

518
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:15,424
Will I buy the hat?

519
00:20:15,884 --> 00:20:16,664
Will you buy this hat?

520
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:17,764
Does Mike buy the hat?

521
00:20:17,764 --> 00:20:19,724
Is that your birthday present to yourself?

522
00:20:19,744 --> 00:20:20,284
Maybe.

523
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:22,524
Oh, there's multiple hats.

524
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:25,304
There's multiple Disney who wants to be a millionaire.

525
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:26,044
Look for the pins.

526
00:20:26,264 --> 00:20:26,904
I think the pins.

527
00:20:26,904 --> 00:20:28,064
Oh, I found the pins, yeah.

528
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:28,444
Yeah.

529
00:20:28,984 --> 00:20:31,064
So these are all great ways to convince people

530
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,484
that you want on the show.

531
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:37,364
To, you know, pop up yourself in a catch me if you can way.

532
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:37,884
Yeah.

533
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:41,424
The logo, I mean, the logo for this attraction.

534
00:20:41,624 --> 00:20:43,184
I mean, it's the logo for the TV show,

535
00:20:43,264 --> 00:20:46,744
but to play it under, like this is a 2001 ass logo.

536
00:20:46,944 --> 00:20:47,464
Yeah. Right?

537
00:20:47,784 --> 00:20:48,584
Oh yeah. Very much so.

538
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:49,844
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

539
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:53,004
I had a problem, I think in general,

540
00:20:53,984 --> 00:20:57,624
with ABC being a big property in the parks.

541
00:20:58,044 --> 00:21:00,064
I just never sat well with me.

542
00:21:00,144 --> 00:21:01,584
And I feel like California Adventure opened

543
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:02,484
and there was a ton of it.

544
00:21:02,604 --> 00:21:04,304
The soap opera, Bistro.

545
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,144
I hated seeing those posters around.

546
00:21:07,504 --> 00:21:10,284
It's just not, I don't know, it's not right.

547
00:21:10,764 --> 00:21:12,164
I think if there was like a giant,

548
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:15,304
if there was like a Game of Thrones level immersive show

549
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:17,424
on ABC and you made a ride out of it

550
00:21:17,424 --> 00:21:19,084
or did something about it, fine.

551
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:25,604
But like, don't give me a private practice replica coffee

552
00:21:25,604 --> 00:21:26,944
shop, it's weird.

553
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:29,184
It's just, it just feels chintzy.

554
00:21:29,484 --> 00:21:32,524
Even though a TV show is a big expensive thing,

555
00:21:32,644 --> 00:21:34,244
it's just a TV show in a theme park,

556
00:21:34,404 --> 00:21:35,244
I think is really weird.

557
00:21:35,564 --> 00:21:37,944
Yeah, I wonder, I should ask my parents

558
00:21:37,944 --> 00:21:39,084
or my mom specifically.

559
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:40,824
I mean, she liked that soap opera.

560
00:21:40,964 --> 00:21:43,604
That was a better show, obviously, in Hollywood studios

561
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:45,304
because she was in it, that show where they,

562
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,064
or not just specifically so far.

563
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:47,604
Superstar television?

564
00:21:47,704 --> 00:21:48,704
Superstar television, yes.

565
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:49,944
Yeah.

566
00:21:50,324 --> 00:21:51,804
But still, I do know what you're talking about

567
00:21:51,804 --> 00:21:54,184
because like TV, even at the time,

568
00:21:54,224 --> 00:21:56,564
it would be like TV shows, I don't know.

569
00:21:56,664 --> 00:21:59,324
Are they cartoons or like, it doesn't really,

570
00:21:59,344 --> 00:22:01,144
doesn't seem to work for me.

571
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:01,364
Yeah.

572
00:22:01,364 --> 00:22:03,484
Like, yeah, it felt different, felt weird.

573
00:22:03,944 --> 00:22:07,204
I think this has come up where like,

574
00:22:07,364 --> 00:22:10,824
there's films after they come out kind of enter the canon

575
00:22:10,824 --> 00:22:14,644
or disappear, but like TV shows age a lot quicker.

576
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:15,604
Sure.

577
00:22:15,624 --> 00:22:17,784
Like how many TV shows from the last 10 years

578
00:22:17,784 --> 00:22:19,284
are we really gonna be watching?

579
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,244
You know, we, the collective we,

580
00:22:21,384 --> 00:22:24,564
of like, I guess Game of Thrones, Mad Men, Breaking Bad.

581
00:22:24,904 --> 00:22:25,524
Mm-hmm.

582
00:22:25,684 --> 00:22:28,584
Well, and you know, CSI is something

583
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:31,924
that'll never go away, which is why there is a CSI experience

584
00:22:31,924 --> 00:22:33,664
in the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

585
00:22:34,344 --> 00:22:37,684
But that's, but CSI has sort of stood the test of time.

586
00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:38,664
Yeah, that is like, yeah.

587
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,264
So that one, but you gotta be sure,

588
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:44,604
this is like, like minimum, it's gotta be a 15 season,

589
00:22:44,704 --> 00:22:47,684
or perhaps multi-series TV franchise,

590
00:22:47,684 --> 00:22:48,684
and that's the only way.

591
00:22:48,984 --> 00:22:50,024
Walking Dead, I guess.

592
00:22:50,484 --> 00:22:51,964
I don't, I feel like Walking Dead's

593
00:22:51,964 --> 00:22:55,464
in that sort of perma place at Universal Hollywood.

594
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,984
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure I have, actually, you know what?

595
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:01,404
I have not been there yet, even though I like haunts,

596
00:23:01,644 --> 00:23:03,464
but I saw, I should go into the Walking Dead.

597
00:23:03,504 --> 00:23:05,424
Yeah, a new thing for me.

598
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,184
I should go through there, but I wonder if you,

599
00:23:08,224 --> 00:23:10,084
I wonder if it's probably pretty easily,

600
00:23:10,084 --> 00:23:11,924
like if they need to change the theme.

601
00:23:12,084 --> 00:23:13,304
I bet it's not so crazy.

602
00:23:13,604 --> 00:23:14,524
Did I say the word perma?

603
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,504
Like, I meant, it feels very like temp.

604
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,344
Oh, that's what you meant.

605
00:23:17,344 --> 00:23:18,524
I see. Yeah, yeah, yes, yes.

606
00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:21,264
Like it's, you know, it's where the house of horrors,

607
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:22,984
like stuff that they've switched in and out.

608
00:23:23,164 --> 00:23:25,944
It feels like they could swap in if they,

609
00:23:26,044 --> 00:23:28,044
cause they've done those Blumhouse houses

610
00:23:28,044 --> 00:23:31,264
at two or three years now at Halloween Horror Nights.

611
00:23:31,624 --> 00:23:33,824
If they lost the license from Walking Dead

612
00:23:33,824 --> 00:23:35,504
or the show ended, they could easily,

613
00:23:36,304 --> 00:23:37,904
like Blumhouse is at Universal,

614
00:23:38,004 --> 00:23:40,944
so they could make it half Happy Death Day

615
00:23:40,944 --> 00:23:42,584
and half The Purge or something.

616
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:44,424
Yeah.

617
00:23:44,164 --> 00:23:47,444
The, they also had the weirdness where at some point

618
00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:48,544
they had to also advertise

619
00:23:48,544 --> 00:23:50,384
the Meredith Vieira syndicated version.

620
00:23:50,924 --> 00:23:54,144
So you've got just a poster for a syndicated TV show

621
00:23:54,144 --> 00:23:56,984
up really big in your theme park, which is already,

622
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,304
and Hollywood continues to be one of the chinsiest areas

623
00:24:00,304 --> 00:24:02,444
of California Adventure or of any theme park.

624
00:24:02,804 --> 00:24:03,704
It's just not good.

625
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:04,784
None of this is good.

626
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:05,484
No.

627
00:24:06,264 --> 00:24:10,924
But one thing I do kind of like about it is the lifelines.

628
00:24:11,124 --> 00:24:14,104
Couple of the lifelines could be the same.

629
00:24:14,464 --> 00:24:16,244
50-50 is the same.

630
00:24:17,584 --> 00:24:18,464
Ask the audience.

631
00:24:18,564 --> 00:24:19,804
There's a big audience there.

632
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:20,964
That can be the same.

633
00:24:21,244 --> 00:24:22,844
Phone a friend is a tough one

634
00:24:22,844 --> 00:24:24,204
cause you don't want to wait around

635
00:24:24,204 --> 00:24:26,364
in this uneditable live experience

636
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:27,864
for somebody to call a friend.

637
00:24:28,904 --> 00:24:33,544
So they had to set up a phone just out in the park

638
00:24:33,544 --> 00:24:36,204
and they labeled it phone a complete stranger.

639
00:24:36,424 --> 00:24:38,884
Phone a complete stranger is such a funny phrasing

640
00:24:38,884 --> 00:24:40,104
of what you would call that.

641
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,564
Yeah, I do like it.

642
00:24:41,704 --> 00:24:41,844
Yeah.

643
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,184
And I like that you could have,

644
00:24:44,184 --> 00:24:46,464
I wish I'd been there to pick up the phone.

645
00:24:46,704 --> 00:24:47,324
Oh yeah.

646
00:24:47,564 --> 00:24:50,384
And I wonder if they ever had a problem with somebody,

647
00:24:51,164 --> 00:24:54,304
saying a curse or saying ba-ba-booey and hanging up.

648
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,984
How could they, they must've had to keep an eye on that.

649
00:24:56,984 --> 00:24:58,184
Where was the phone?

650
00:24:58,684 --> 00:25:00,044
Was it by the queue though?

651
00:25:00,904 --> 00:25:01,644
Was it by like?

652
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:03,964
So like the people in line knew sort of already?

653
00:25:03,964 --> 00:25:05,004
In line maybe.

654
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:05,824
Oh, maybe.

655
00:25:05,924 --> 00:25:08,584
And cast members would be there around anyway.

656
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,284
Explaining, maybe ushering people to the phone

657
00:25:11,284 --> 00:25:12,864
is sort of under lock and key.

658
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:16,084
Could you imagine talking to a stranger

659
00:25:16,084 --> 00:25:18,004
and you ask them the question

660
00:25:18,004 --> 00:25:20,904
and when they say the answer is ba-ba-booey,

661
00:25:21,044 --> 00:25:23,804
ba-ba-booey Howard Stern's fetus?

662
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,804
Maybe that was the answer.

663
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:27,924
Oh, maybe it was.

664
00:25:28,224 --> 00:25:29,604
It could have been depending on the question.

665
00:25:29,784 --> 00:25:32,744
What have you been encouraged to yell into a church

666
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:34,384
by a national media figure?

667
00:25:35,444 --> 00:25:39,404
What is the current preferred prank phone call saying?

668
00:25:39,784 --> 00:25:40,764
Jerky boys.

669
00:25:42,904 --> 00:25:44,344
Stern rules.

670
00:25:44,784 --> 00:25:49,284
We need to get somebody who did this.

671
00:25:49,984 --> 00:25:51,144
We have to find the host.

672
00:25:51,304 --> 00:25:52,344
We have to find a host.

673
00:25:52,364 --> 00:25:55,104
Yeah, those people have to be floating around for sure.

674
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:58,064
Because there have to be funny stories

675
00:25:58,064 --> 00:26:02,144
where people didn't know or said something weird or cursed.

676
00:26:02,544 --> 00:26:04,144
I would think it would make the most sense

677
00:26:04,144 --> 00:26:04,904
to the people in line

678
00:26:04,904 --> 00:26:07,684
because they're in the millionaire mode already.

679
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:10,564
They know the show, they know the rules

680
00:26:10,564 --> 00:26:15,704
and they don't want to foul up the experience.

681
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:16,704
They have respect for it.

682
00:26:16,804 --> 00:26:19,624
It would be great if the phone was in the middle of the raft

683
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:21,484
on the Grizzly River Rapids ride

684
00:26:21,484 --> 00:26:22,984
and in the middle of getting soaked,

685
00:26:23,224 --> 00:26:25,184
your dad has to answer a trivia question.

686
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:27,944
It's like, oh, I don't think, ah, what the hell?

687
00:26:28,244 --> 00:26:28,684
Hang on.

688
00:26:29,624 --> 00:26:30,724
She got soaked.

689
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,384
Put my wife on, hang on.

690
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:35,904
Or they just took a raft ride and they're bone dry

691
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,324
and have to take a phone call,

692
00:26:37,324 --> 00:26:40,704
which occasionally you do come out of Grizzly River Rapids

693
00:26:40,704 --> 00:26:42,904
very dry, like not a good.

694
00:26:42,904 --> 00:26:43,644
If you're lucky.

695
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:44,104
Yeah.

696
00:26:44,284 --> 00:26:46,504
Yeah, that's true, but usually you're a little wet.

697
00:26:47,224 --> 00:26:50,844
Yeah, but it's not designed in the way that like the rapids,

698
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:54,304
Popeye and Pluto's bilge rat barges are designed.

699
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:57,344
Oh my God, I could not answer a trivia question on that thing.

700
00:26:57,504 --> 00:26:58,264
No, absolutely not.

701
00:26:58,824 --> 00:27:01,224
They soaked, you get buckets of water dumped on you.

702
00:27:01,224 --> 00:27:03,984
Almost knocked my glasses into the rapids.

703
00:27:04,104 --> 00:27:04,984
It's insane.

704
00:27:05,284 --> 00:27:08,824
It is a real test for how thrilling is a raft ride.

705
00:27:08,924 --> 00:27:10,964
Could you acceptably take a phone call on it?

706
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:12,404
Could you call it a trivia question?

707
00:27:12,524 --> 00:27:12,824
Uh-huh.

708
00:27:12,944 --> 00:27:15,284
Yeah, and so yeah, Popeye, no.

709
00:27:15,684 --> 00:27:18,484
Grizzly River Rapids, it depends, is the answer.

710
00:27:18,624 --> 00:27:21,024
That's very damning against Grizzly River Rapids.

711
00:27:21,484 --> 00:27:23,964
Which of these actors have played Spider-Man,

712
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:27,024
Tobey Maguire, Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield,

713
00:27:27,204 --> 00:27:28,444
or Robert Blake?

714
00:27:31,844 --> 00:27:32,724
What'd you say?

715
00:27:32,904 --> 00:27:33,524
I don't know, D.

716
00:27:33,784 --> 00:27:34,204
I'm pretty sure it's D.

717
00:27:34,224 --> 00:27:35,484
D. Robert Blake.

718
00:27:36,884 --> 00:27:37,964
Beretta himself.

719
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:46,944
Well, while we don't have anybody with us who was the host

720
00:27:46,944 --> 00:27:50,344
or who got into the hot seat, guess what?

721
00:27:50,404 --> 00:27:52,824
You guys are about to have an opportunity

722
00:27:52,824 --> 00:27:55,084
to go into the hot seat yourselves.

723
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,344
As we've established on the Sea Ticket episodes,

724
00:27:58,424 --> 00:27:59,424
there are games.

725
00:27:59,424 --> 00:27:59,904
Oh my God.

726
00:27:59,904 --> 00:28:03,544
And as this is a game show themed episode,

727
00:28:03,924 --> 00:28:04,904
we've got to do it now.

728
00:28:05,004 --> 00:28:07,704
And that's why I'd like to invite one of you

729
00:28:07,704 --> 00:28:12,384
to play Who Wants to Waste Time on a Second Gate episode.

730
00:28:13,384 --> 00:28:14,924
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

731
00:28:15,984 --> 00:28:17,044
How are we going to decide?

732
00:28:17,184 --> 00:28:17,864
How do we decide?

733
00:28:17,944 --> 00:28:19,824
We decide with the fastest finger question.

734
00:28:19,844 --> 00:28:20,464
Uh-oh.

735
00:28:20,604 --> 00:28:22,844
And I should make you aware that all of the,

736
00:28:23,104 --> 00:28:26,364
as I slip into this voice, that all of the trivia items

737
00:28:26,364 --> 00:28:28,344
in this game are Regis related.

738
00:28:29,464 --> 00:28:31,824
So start thinking through your Regis knowledge

739
00:28:31,824 --> 00:28:35,164
as I ask this fastest finger question to determine

740
00:28:35,164 --> 00:28:36,664
who will play.

741
00:28:36,944 --> 00:28:39,264
So do I say buzz or do I say buzz or something?

742
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,324
I think you should say buzz buzz.

743
00:28:42,464 --> 00:28:43,144
Buzz buzz.

744
00:28:43,164 --> 00:28:43,664
OK.

745
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:46,844
If you have it, say buzz buzz and then give me the answer.

746
00:28:46,884 --> 00:28:51,064
I like the past Sea Ticket games.

747
00:28:51,744 --> 00:28:54,904
Well, of course, now, as we know with comedy,

748
00:28:55,204 --> 00:28:56,864
first time something happens, it's a phenomenon.

749
00:28:56,864 --> 00:28:58,184
Second time, it's coincidence.

750
00:28:58,484 --> 00:28:59,724
Third time, it's pattern.

751
00:29:00,644 --> 00:29:02,664
And so now this establishes a pattern.

752
00:29:02,804 --> 00:29:06,104
But like the previous games, you seemed like you were

753
00:29:06,104 --> 00:29:07,624
doing this begrudgingly.

754
00:29:09,144 --> 00:29:11,064
That's been consistent the entire time.

755
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:12,044
But a great Regis impression.

756
00:29:12,204 --> 00:29:12,864
So I'm excited.

757
00:29:13,004 --> 00:29:13,144
Oh, thank you.

758
00:29:13,144 --> 00:29:14,864
I'm feeling pretty good about it.

759
00:29:14,864 --> 00:29:17,724
We'll see if it can maintain for the entire length of the game.

760
00:29:17,744 --> 00:29:18,884
Let's play it.

761
00:29:18,964 --> 00:29:20,704
Let's play it.

762
00:29:21,064 --> 00:29:21,544
OK.

763
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:23,364
Get your buzz buzzes ready.

764
00:29:24,084 --> 00:29:26,984
In the Disney Christmas parades, Regis Philbin

765
00:29:26,984 --> 00:29:28,844
wanted a kiss from what character?

766
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:34,864
I feel free to attempt a false one,

767
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:36,924
even I'll give you more than one chance.

768
00:29:37,184 --> 00:29:37,384
Okay.

769
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:38,784
Wait, this isn't multiple choice?

770
00:29:39,184 --> 00:29:40,144
No, not this, no,

771
00:29:40,164 --> 00:29:41,444
because I couldn't figure out how to do that

772
00:29:41,444 --> 00:29:42,564
because you don't have fingers.

773
00:29:42,724 --> 00:29:43,564
I don't have anything to hope yet.

774
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:44,144
Oh, we had a good point.

775
00:29:44,164 --> 00:29:46,144
One of you just has to win.

776
00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:47,544
Cinderella?

777
00:29:48,284 --> 00:29:50,144
Well, you didn't say Buzz Buzz, but okay.

778
00:29:51,104 --> 00:29:51,804
Was it Cinderella?

779
00:29:51,804 --> 00:29:52,704
I'll still count it.

780
00:29:52,704 --> 00:29:53,724
You said Cinderella.

781
00:29:54,184 --> 00:29:55,884
I could have gotten you on a technicality,

782
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,864
but I'm feeling generous today.

783
00:29:59,124 --> 00:29:59,464
All right.

784
00:30:00,224 --> 00:30:02,224
Mike Carlson from Schomburg, Illinois.

785
00:30:02,424 --> 00:30:02,924
Yes.

786
00:30:02,924 --> 00:30:03,964
You're in the hot seat.

787
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:04,784
Thank you Regis.

788
00:30:04,964 --> 00:30:08,324
We waited 45, Edwin, we waited 45 fucking minutes

789
00:30:08,324 --> 00:30:09,364
for this ride.

790
00:30:10,844 --> 00:30:11,924
Pipe down in the back.

791
00:30:12,084 --> 00:30:13,604
We need to focus on Mike Carlson.

792
00:30:13,904 --> 00:30:15,264
He's been a friend of 40 years.

793
00:30:15,484 --> 00:30:17,964
Any funny stories from growing up you'd like to share?

794
00:30:18,224 --> 00:30:19,544
Any of anything fun about yourself?

795
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,384
Oh, yeah.

796
00:30:22,024 --> 00:30:23,844
I, as a,

797
00:30:24,064 --> 00:30:25,504
I like Minnie Mouse.

798
00:30:25,604 --> 00:30:27,284
All right, well it's time to play it.

799
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:28,584
Okay, here we go.

800
00:30:29,004 --> 00:30:31,284
Well, I need to lay out the rules.

801
00:30:31,324 --> 00:30:33,144
I will be asking one question,

802
00:30:33,704 --> 00:30:36,524
and if you get the answer correct,

803
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:41,804
you stand to receive a prize that is a real prize

804
00:30:41,804 --> 00:30:44,404
that was given out in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

805
00:30:44,424 --> 00:30:44,784
Play it.

806
00:30:45,004 --> 00:30:45,224
Oh, wow.

807
00:30:45,224 --> 00:30:46,304
So the stakes are high.

808
00:30:46,404 --> 00:30:47,144
Oh my gosh.

809
00:30:47,244 --> 00:30:50,164
And in keeping with the game, you do have three lifelines.

810
00:30:50,544 --> 00:30:54,264
They are 50-50, I eliminate two of the incorrect choices.

811
00:30:55,384 --> 00:30:57,604
Ask someone else in the room,

812
00:30:57,844 --> 00:30:59,404
which brings your choices.

813
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:03,464
I'll take myself out of it, but that would be Jason.

814
00:31:03,804 --> 00:31:04,784
That would be Lindsay,

815
00:31:04,984 --> 00:31:07,204
who has been eating cereal in the corner.

816
00:31:07,484 --> 00:31:09,004
I'm dragging her into this,

817
00:31:09,144 --> 00:31:11,124
but it's her, she doesn't have to participate

818
00:31:11,124 --> 00:31:12,204
if she doesn't want to. Of course, yeah.

819
00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:14,264
And it's your choice who you pick, or Edwin the dog.

820
00:31:14,444 --> 00:31:14,764
Sure.

821
00:31:15,404 --> 00:31:20,064
Or phone a friend, and you can phone anyone that you like,

822
00:31:20,384 --> 00:31:22,984
but I should let you know that just in case

823
00:31:22,984 --> 00:31:25,264
our mutual friend Andrew Grissom

824
00:31:25,764 --> 00:31:30,004
is casually standing by and may slip into a corner

825
00:31:30,004 --> 00:31:31,484
at the place where he's working

826
00:31:31,484 --> 00:31:33,964
to try to answer this question.

827
00:31:34,024 --> 00:31:35,984
Of course, he's not qualified to do so.

828
00:31:35,984 --> 00:31:38,604
I just wanted there to be a friend element.

829
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:41,924
Okay, so, but you can only use one.

830
00:31:42,644 --> 00:31:43,944
But maybe you don't need it.

831
00:31:44,064 --> 00:31:44,704
Let's go.

832
00:31:45,184 --> 00:31:47,144
For the one prize,

833
00:31:48,684 --> 00:31:53,024
in April, 2009, Regis Philbin appeared on The Late Show

834
00:31:53,024 --> 00:31:55,604
with David Letterman dressed as who?

835
00:31:56,544 --> 00:31:57,664
A, Harry Potter.

836
00:31:58,444 --> 00:31:59,484
B, Shrek.

837
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:01,824
C, Dr. Phil.

838
00:32:02,364 --> 00:32:04,484
D, Jack Sparrow.

839
00:32:05,944 --> 00:32:09,384
The answer, Regis, is B, Shrek.

840
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:11,144
Final answer.

841
00:32:16,956 --> 00:32:17,356
Yes.

842
00:32:17,556 --> 00:32:20,956
All right, without a lifeline, a risky move.

843
00:32:22,656 --> 00:32:24,956
I guess it's a good point I should have just done the lifeline.

844
00:32:25,196 --> 00:32:27,856
I mean that's a look Grissom seemed to be busy.

845
00:32:27,856 --> 00:32:31,936
He'd slipped into a conference room 15 minutes ago and said, hey, I'm in here in case you

846
00:32:31,936 --> 00:32:32,256
need me.

847
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,656
But now he went back to his desk.

848
00:32:34,096 --> 00:32:35,976
So his availability is in question.

849
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:40,776
Feel free to throw it to anyone else in the room if you'd like to waste more time on a

850
00:32:40,776 --> 00:32:41,596
second gate episode.

851
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:43,256
I think it's Shrek.

852
00:32:43,316 --> 00:32:44,636
But let me throw it to Jason.

853
00:32:44,636 --> 00:32:46,076
Do you know? Do you think it's Shrek?

854
00:32:46,976 --> 00:32:52,776
Well, what do you think Regis Philman's threshold of looking foolish is?

855
00:32:52,976 --> 00:32:54,516
Oh, Regis would embarrass himself.

856
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:56,836
He didn't care. He was very much up for anything.

857
00:32:57,216 --> 00:32:59,976
I feel like Dr. Phil is the more grounded answer though.

858
00:32:59,976 --> 00:33:02,616
I'm pretty positive in my head that Regis is Shrek.

859
00:33:03,336 --> 00:33:05,136
But I maybe it's not.

860
00:33:05,456 --> 00:33:10,536
I don't think it's Dr. Phil, although it's possible he was Dr. Phil once and Shrek another

861
00:33:10,536 --> 00:33:11,096
time.

862
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,596
But keep in mind, it is a specific.

863
00:33:13,596 --> 00:33:14,956
I don't think he appeared more than once.

864
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,236
It is April 2009.

865
00:33:16,776 --> 00:33:20,956
Oh, I'm just saying there's a chance that he appeared as a different character once as

866
00:33:20,956 --> 00:33:21,396
well.

867
00:33:21,756 --> 00:33:22,116
Possibly.

868
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,736
That's possible.

869
00:33:22,736 --> 00:33:24,396
We have to think about April 2009.

870
00:33:25,176 --> 00:33:26,356
April 2009.

871
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:29,116
Is that when the Shrek musical was out?

872
00:33:29,696 --> 00:33:31,396
Jason, what do you think?

873
00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:36,476
Might have been running or in previews.

874
00:33:36,476 --> 00:33:43,576
I know at that live Human Giant, a 24 hour, 48 hour takeover on MTV, Tim and Eric

875
00:33:43,576 --> 00:33:44,876
kept showing up as Shrek.

876
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:47,016
That would have been 2007.

877
00:33:47,516 --> 00:33:50,036
So that would have been Shrek 2 likely.

878
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:58,536
So 2009 had digital animation progressed enough to turn around a Shrek in two years.

879
00:33:59,116 --> 00:34:04,396
Well, I think it was live show Shrek, the live musical maybe where he was farting.

880
00:34:04,596 --> 00:34:05,536
Oh, sure.

881
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:07,476
There was a song about farting in the live.

882
00:34:07,476 --> 00:34:10,056
We'll do a second episode about that one day, I'm sure.

883
00:34:10,756 --> 00:34:11,976
There's a farting episode.

884
00:34:11,976 --> 00:34:12,676
It was what?

885
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:15,076
Captain Jack, Dr. Phil, Shrek.

886
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:16,756
Harry Potter, Shrek, Dr. Phil, Dr. Shakespeare.

887
00:34:16,756 --> 00:34:17,216
Harry Potter.

888
00:34:18,316 --> 00:34:20,596
When did the last Harry Potter book come out?

889
00:34:21,316 --> 00:34:23,396
Oh, after 2007.

890
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:25,896
Well, this is 2009 we're talking about.

891
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:26,876
Oh, 2009.

892
00:34:27,996 --> 00:34:28,696
I'm losing my mind.

893
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:30,276
We're overthinking this so much.

894
00:34:30,836 --> 00:34:32,596
I think the answer is Shrek.

895
00:34:32,956 --> 00:34:34,116
That feels right to me.

896
00:34:34,216 --> 00:34:39,996
I have a thing in my head that is a picture of Regis sitting on the chair with Dave and

897
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:41,256
he's got the Shrek outfit on.

898
00:34:41,256 --> 00:34:44,536
I can't think of him dressed as any of those other characters.

899
00:34:44,536 --> 00:34:45,716
Well, there's no stakes.

900
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,836
So why don't you do your 50-50 too?

901
00:34:49,396 --> 00:34:49,556
Okay.

902
00:34:49,656 --> 00:34:50,436
No, I know one.

903
00:34:50,536 --> 00:34:51,296
We can only do one.

904
00:34:51,396 --> 00:34:52,256
You can only do one?

905
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,196
Yeah, that was it.

906
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,476
That discussion you guys had was the lifeline.

907
00:34:55,816 --> 00:34:55,956
Text.

908
00:34:56,236 --> 00:34:57,516
Can I text Grissom?

909
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:58,256
Nope.

910
00:34:58,356 --> 00:35:01,296
You can't make up a different type of lifeline.

911
00:35:01,496 --> 00:35:03,296
I mean, Shrek's the funniest answer to give.

912
00:35:03,676 --> 00:35:04,956
I think it's Shrek.

913
00:35:05,516 --> 00:35:06,056
Final answer.

914
00:35:06,156 --> 00:35:06,916
Final answer.

915
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:11,556
This is a video reveal which I will now play.

916
00:35:11,896 --> 00:35:12,476
I'm stressed out.

917
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,900
Can I help you?

918
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,060
Guess who I am.

919
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,160
Oh my god.

920
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,420
Guess who I am.

921
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,720
Of course, I've seen this.

922
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:24,180
It's Regis Philbin.

923
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,000
It's not Regis.

924
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,740
Dressed like a Shrek.

925
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,020
How you doing, buddy?

926
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,100
Yeah, that's right.

927
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:30,940
My memory's right.

928
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,580
You look like Buddy Hackett after a bad clam.

929
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,160
That's a solid joke.

930
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,780
That's a great joke.

931
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,660
Yep, I edited the video to fit.

932
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,960
I'll ease out of Regis.

933
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,840
I don't need to be doing it.

934
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,820
Although I, well, no, no, I hate to hang on because I do need to give you the prize.

935
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:53,280
Because you have successfully wasted time on a second gate episode and you have won the

936
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,640
prize, a real prize, that was given out during the live show, during Play It.

937
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,400
One sec.

938
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,140
Is it the hat I wanted to buy?

939
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,940
Oh, well, wouldn't that be a wonderful gift to the Magi, wouldn't it be?

940
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:14,040
No, no, no, what I have for you is a seedy rom of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Sports

941
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,720
Edition.

942
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,240
We had the regular one.

943
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:16,920
Wow.

944
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,800
Well, I'm glad I didn't get the sports one.

945
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,540
I'm glad I didn't get the regular one because now you have a second.

946
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,720
I have a second one.

947
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,600
I don't have anything to put it in.

948
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,080
This was also a prize in the early days.

949
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,340
No CDs, no computers don't have CD ports anymore.

950
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,440
Don't have a Windows PC lying around.

951
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:39,400
Well, yes, I should say you do need a four time speed CD-ROM drive and you are going

952
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,340
to need 32 megabytes of RAM.

953
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,360
So if you think that's the final test.

954
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:49,200
Well, it should come with a CD drive, an external CD drive that I could plug into the Mac.

955
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,760
You're going to have to buy that separately on eBay.

956
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:57,840
There's been a lot of Mike Carlson related eBaying going on in Scott Gardner's house.

957
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,800
I don't know when this one comes out as opposed to the other one.

958
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,640
I'll leave that a clue.

959
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,680
I'd also just like to say that separately on the back, this says a slam dunk gift for

960
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,680
millionaire and sports fan and then a grand slam for sports trivia fans.

961
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:21,860
So it's a slam dunk if you're a sports fan, but if you're a sports trivia fan, it is a

962
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,400
grand slam.

963
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,040
It is not a slam dunk gift for a sports trivia fan.

964
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:33,880
It's a home run for podcast transitions because this attraction sometimes had special event

965
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,460
versions.

966
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,080
Oh, oh, I know where you're going with this.

967
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:44,800
During ESPN, the weekend play, it consisted of sports trivia questions and you got to

968
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,820
team up with ESPN personalities and figures.

969
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:52,540
And the phone, a complete stranger lifeline was replaced with a chance to ask an ESPN

970
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:57,100
expert, which was either Howie Schwab or the Sklar brothers.

971
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,680
What?

972
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,720
Yeah, they just there for it's a weekend.

973
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:07,060
Yeah, I think they flew in like for events because the other special event weekend was

974
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,240
Star Wars weekends.

975
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:14,380
And this is I got to read the first two games of the day featured questions based on the

976
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:20,400
Star Wars films and universe and began with Greedo in the hot seat answering questions

977
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,980
in the alien language, Rodanese.

978
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:28,580
The lifelines worked exactly like the regular game, but were named 50 50.

979
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,640
Ask the Jedi Council and phone a stormtrooper.

980
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,300
So they were trying to keep it up, trying to keep it relevant.

981
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,520
Form a phone, a phone, a stormtrooper.

982
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,280
Did it actually just phone a friend?

983
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:43,720
Do we know?

984
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,880
Or was it actually like a preset like stormtrooper?

985
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:52,020
I guess there's a stormtrooper by the phone and they would answer in the stormtrooper

986
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,520
voice.

987
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,600
So somebody that was somebody's job basically all day is just to sit around.

988
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,940
Well, just the first two shows of the day.

989
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,440
Oh, right.

990
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:08,180
This was an interesting run, one to run operationally because it seemed like to be the first contestant

991
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,180
in the hot seat.

992
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:16,640
Sometimes you would just get it automatically at the fast pass distribution or sometimes

993
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,980
you could just ask towards the end and you could be in it.

994
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,140
Oh, so it's like any ride vehicle where if you asked to be in the front seat.

995
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,440
Kind of.

996
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,180
Maybe that would work.

997
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,980
It seems like it started to get less serious as time went on.

998
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,100
Or at least get to the first 10 people.

999
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,640
Huh, that's interesting.

1000
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,560
Yeah, I really was for a second there.

1001
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,760
I really thought I was going to be in that hot seat soon because I was doing so well.

1002
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,080
So it was disappointing because it did seem like it, but I would have cracked, I think.

1003
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,620
But you got to do it today.

1004
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,520
You know what, I got to do it today.

1005
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,460
I should hand this over, but congratulations.

1006
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,400
I'm very impressed you didn't even need one.

1007
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,460
Just like John Carpenter, you didn't need a lifeline.

1008
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,180
And in fact, I told Andrew Grissom that we didn't need him and he was sad.

1009
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,060
But I'm going to see if he gets the answer right.

1010
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,420
We'll try to get a risk.

1011
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:05,160
So let's see if he would have even been a bad choice as a Kona friend.

1012
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,420
Who wants to be a millionaire sports addition now in your position?

1013
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,720
CD-ROM, congrats.

1014
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,900
How much, could I ask how much this was?

1015
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:18,320
Well, a million points, which roughly translates to $3.33.

1016
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,980
Still in the wrapper though.

1017
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,120
Yes, yeah.

1018
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,560
So there's tremendous resale value.

1019
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,740
So that it was a stocking stuffer someone really was annoyed about.

1020
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,220
Unless you were a Grand Slam Dunk Sports Trivia master.

1021
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:38,360
Buena Vista Interactive, which I'm not sure what, like in the chronology of like games,

1022
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,280
Disney games, because Disney now very famously is like, they're not making video games anymore.

1023
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:48,800
You know, the job I have been working recently has a bunch of lamps that all on the bottom

1024
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,960
of them have, there's a label on the lamp that says property of Disney Interactive.

1025
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,900
I think I'm working in an office that inherited a bunch of the office furniture of Disney

1026
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,340
Interactive.

1027
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,020
When they dumped it.

1028
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,780
That's how dead they are.

1029
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,120
Famously, yeah, downsized a bunch, Disney Interactive.

1030
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,500
But they're not making like original games.

1031
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,640
They're just licensing it.

1032
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,100
I think something like that.

1033
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,280
Mostly for big video games.

1034
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,780
So you got to, this is a passport into a brighter time for Disney's CD-ROM enterprises.

1035
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,800
Yeah.

1036
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:27,100
So to clarify, yeah, sometimes to get into that row of 10 seats, pre-hot seat, you would

1037
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,840
get occasionally a Magic Moment coupon dispensed instead of a fast pass.

1038
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,340
There were several tickets, basically.

1039
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,920
There were several times where just asking before the show began would grant access to

1040
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,760
one of the seats.

1041
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,300
And there was still some open before the show.

1042
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,740
And I think it's interesting.

1043
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:51,860
Was there a timer on who wants to be a millionaire of how long people had questions to take?

1044
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,660
I feel like people would really milk it sometimes.

1045
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,000
Yeah, that's how they were able to spread it out into four nights.

1046
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,080
Deal or no deal, also a real time waster.

1047
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,240
A lot of reaction shots, a lot of milling around.

1048
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:03,900
Yeah.

1049
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,540
But there was a timer on this.

1050
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,860
First five questions, you had 30 seconds.

1051
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,300
First five questions, yeah, 30 seconds per question.

1052
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,980
Next five, 45.

1053
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,860
And the final four questions, 55 seconds.

1054
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,020
So you were on a clock.

1055
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:28,980
And the show was kind of dependent of like, the next show starts at this time or whenever

1056
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,340
the last show gets out.

1057
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,440
They wouldn't cut people off.

1058
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,740
They would let the games continue.

1059
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,520
It wouldn't be like, all right, get out of here.

1060
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,080
We got a two 30 to get ready for.

1061
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:42,060
I mean, I'm sure some people were knocked out within the first five questions and that

1062
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,980
was quick and they could squeeze more in.

1063
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,140
Yeah.

1064
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,500
So the game didn't have a it wasn't like a like the Little Mermaid show at Hollywood

1065
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,060
Studios where it would be every 45 minutes or something.

1066
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,740
I think it had a in theory set thing, but there was a little bit of wiggle room, which

1067
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,740
sounds like a nightmare for the operation.

1068
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,540
I was going to say like that's that is a no no.

1069
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,940
They want to know exactly when things are in and out and how many people and consistency

1070
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,380
of a robot show.

1071
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,520
Len Testa must have been losing his mind when they were he was counting people calling,

1072
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:18,040
calling out to try to figure out an algorithm for how many people this attraction could

1073
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,940
eat up all day.

1074
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,500
So and then the band.

1075
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:27,200
So if you won 100 to 500,000 points, you had a 30 day blackout.

1076
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:33,700
And if you won the million, you had a 30 day blackout and you were not permitted to win

1077
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:37,020
the million again for 365 days.

1078
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:41,280
Did anybody try to get it or did anybody successfully get it?

1079
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,000
I mean, sometimes did someone have a calendar where they would mark off each day and as

1080
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,180
soon as this calendar is over, I'm back.

1081
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,920
I can't wait to be back on the Disney dream.

1082
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,440
It's like Cape Fear.

1083
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,120
It's marking them on his back.

1084
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,240
It's how he marks.

1085
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,180
I guess somebody I mean, I wonder.

1086
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,620
Well, there is an interesting one that the GSC, the trivia about who got the hot seat.

1087
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,060
Oh, yeah.

1088
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,160
No, I didn't see this.

1089
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,440
The man who won five hundred thousand dollars on the syndicated version.

1090
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:16,100
He became an expert when they started doing something called Ask the Expert.

1091
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,300
And he bid on eBay for the seat.

1092
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,060
And he saw my God.

1093
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,640
Wait, what? Yeah, exactly.

1094
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,500
Yeah. How much did he bid on it for?

1095
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,700
How much did he get it for?

1096
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:27,920
Four hundred dollars.

1097
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,080
Four hundred dollars on this piece of theme park memorabilia.

1098
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,480
What? That's it.

1099
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,100
That seems low. This was put.

1100
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,600
Somebody took the time to put this into a Wikipedia.

1101
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,340
Yeah. Huh.

1102
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,140
It's very low.

1103
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:46,180
And and, you know, it's look, it's not Richard Kraft stats.

1104
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,220
No, no.

1105
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:52,280
The stuff going for a few hundred dollars was like paper products, brochures, press

1106
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,880
kits, like that sort of thing.

1107
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,480
I know, because I looked because I looked.

1108
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,140
How much is the cheapest thing available right now?

1109
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:03,340
Disneyland toilet knob would go for four hundred fifty.

1110
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:06,660
I don't know. Yeah, I'm surprised that's from Disneyland.

1111
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,960
Didn't have a section of just exclusively who wants to be a millionaire.

1112
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,180
Remember, Bill? Yeah.

1113
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:14,360
The exclamation point from the play it sign.

1114
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:20,240
Box of hats, box of old hats, alternate Regis jackets,

1115
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:27,420
like a like a XXXL Regis jacket like is is signature just like sure.

1116
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,040
Chrome black, but they never got a host of that size needed.

1117
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:38,000
I have to say, like, I don't think it's the wrong impulse of like this show is a phenomenon.

1118
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,360
What if we got in the parks?

1119
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,840
But I think they also should have copied like a limited run like that.

1120
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,420
It was like two weeks at a time.

1121
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,140
Like, I know you have to build a whole set that's complicated.

1122
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:57,680
But ironically, playing this version of the game is closer to what you would see on TV.

1123
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,760
Because we go to a real game show taping.

1124
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:06,060
They're always stopping and starting and reset it like TV show tapings are kind of miserable to go to.

1125
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,440
So you're saying that you would want it to be more you wouldn't want it to be a continuous attraction.

1126
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,040
Yeah, I mean, I guess that would be the thing to do it.

1127
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:19,900
Like, I think there is like a fun live element of like an interactive audience game show kind of thing.

1128
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:23,820
People do get invested in that competitive in that.

1129
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:28,700
But like, I don't know, five or six years is actually a pretty good run.

1130
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,480
It's like, wow, I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did.

1131
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,920
That's how long it made it in Florida.

1132
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,080
Yeah, nearly as long in California.

1133
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:40,960
No, no. You know, as I said, that space is now like temporary events in California Adventure.

1134
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,260
In Florida, it was replaced by Midway Mania.

1135
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,740
So a bit of a step up.

1136
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,100
Yeah, fair enough.

1137
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:57,080
The amount of plus up there is the did you see that Captain Marvel photo up they just started with like a big is it inflatable plane behind it?

1138
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,240
It's a weird looking plane behind her.

1139
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,520
I am impressed that they went out of their way to do it.

1140
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,700
But is it in this building?

1141
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,800
It it might be.

1142
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,360
It just started, I think.

1143
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:07,560
And that looks good.

1144
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,260
She looks the walk around.

1145
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,540
Cat Marvel looks pretty good.

1146
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,740
I was impressed with the photo.

1147
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,920
But it might be this building that they're using.

1148
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,880
Or it could be the old Finns Arcade, the other sound.

1149
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,360
Oh, yeah. Good point.

1150
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:26,200
There's a lot of ugly sound stages that I guess are good for backstage stuff and staging and everything.

1151
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,620
But that is a huge plot of land that like in the next 20 years, something's got to go over that.

1152
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,320
It's probably it's either this or it's that what you're talking about.

1153
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,620
It's one of those two, I would assume.

1154
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,540
Yeah, they made a big like air.

1155
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,320
Did you see it?

1156
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:44,920
No, there's a big like fighter jet sticking out of the like hangar, essentially, which is just one of these sound stages.

1157
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,500
That's cool.

1158
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,760
So they did something with one of these buildings.

1159
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,400
So maybe the where this thing was has something cool now.

1160
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,300
Maybe maybe maybe a happy ending.

1161
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:02,680
You know what? I think the idea of a game show, the live game show in a theme park is a little fun and it kind of hey,

1162
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:06,020
it harkens back to Nickelodeon studios at Universal Studios.

1163
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,200
It's not the worst idea.

1164
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:11,980
I think tying it to sort of a of its time, like they missed it by like a year.

1165
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,720
But but so this was a little off.

1166
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,960
But, you know, a game show in a theme park, not not so crazy.

1167
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:22,240
Right. You guys have favorite game shows that you'd like to see represented in a theme park in some way.

1168
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,360
They might be more successful.

1169
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:28,960
It's hard because you would these mega crazy shows like one versus a hundred would be great,

1170
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,520
which was not as popular as these other ones.

1171
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,780
But I liked it. It was one.

1172
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,080
It was a hundred people all answering the question.

1173
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:40,140
So it was not dissimilar to this situation because then you would have to like bet.

1174
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,920
I forget you bet like with the hundred or against the hundred.

1175
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:46,300
And then a hundred would get like eliminated.

1176
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,360
Apparently, this is too complicated, which is why people why people didn't watch it as much.

1177
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:56,320
But you would get all of a sudden, like 50 of the hundred would get the question wrong and then all their lights would go out.

1178
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:59,580
But it was it was kind of a cool visual.

1179
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:03,500
So it would make sense that you would load in a hundred people for a theme park.

1180
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,500
And then you're in it. Now you're in the show.

1181
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,020
You're in the actual show.

1182
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:13,220
But there's not a lot of these that lend themselves to a giant group other than if like you played.

1183
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,200
Jeopardy or something, then you have appeared in Ellen's energy.

1184
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,580
Right. I mean, you could.

1185
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,480
Then you'd have to type in your answer.

1186
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,900
It wouldn't be multiple choice.

1187
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,220
I mean, you could add multiple choice to it, but Jeopardy doesn't have multiple choice.

1188
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,420
I think Jeopardy works just fine sitting and watching it at home.

1189
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:33,420
I don't think I need to be part of the tremendous energy of Jeopardy Live.

1190
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:36,860
Fair enough. But one just occurred to me that I think would be fun.

1191
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:43,100
And you know what? You'll like this because this is, I guess, maybe an idea for a for a haunt.

1192
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:48,100
What if you were inside the game board of Press Your Luck?

1193
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,560
Oh, wow.

1194
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,560
And you're gathering money along the way.

1195
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,880
But around any corner, there could be a whammy.

1196
00:49:54,920 --> 00:50:01,220
And he jumps out at you, maybe spooks you, maybe you make him scarier than he is just in cartoon form.

1197
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:08,000
Or he just jumps out and like does La Cucaracha and, you know, like has like little like Carmen Miranda clam shells.

1198
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:08,280
Yeah.

1199
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,420
Like they bite your money up.

1200
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,060
Hey, I love that's a great idea.

1201
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:14,440
It's not going to be like the game show, but I think as a haunt, it's a pretty good idea.

1202
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:21,620
If you actually are, this is maybe a good haunt hybrid idea that you are getting money through the haunt

1203
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:27,420
and your ability to keep the money depends on your ability to not get scared or to jump or.

1204
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,260
That's great.

1205
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:34,320
I do like, yeah, haunted house based on a game show, like like a whole game show set.

1206
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,680
That's kind of spooky.

1207
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,160
Let's expand the idea.

1208
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:39,080
And it's just like Merv Griffin land.

1209
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:43,980
And it's just a theme park that a game show rides and experiences.

1210
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,280
Drunk pervert.

1211
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,280
Griff, just assume he was an old drunk pervert.

1212
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,860
I mean, you don't want to go spreading rumors about her.

1213
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:56,520
I think if you were just an old in front of like camera host that far back, right?

1214
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:57,280
Then he's got to be.

1215
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,960
He might have been the kind of pervert that didn't hurt anybody.

1216
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,800
It could be.

1217
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,020
Is this a regular everyday pervert?

1218
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,700
I think you're thinking of Richard Dawson.

1219
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,280
Oh, maybe.

1220
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:06,100
Who's a little more pervert.

1221
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:06,760
Although who knows?

1222
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,340
I don't know what Merv Griffin was up to.

1223
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,820
We should generally stay away from the family feud hosts in building this park.

1224
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:13,600
Fair enough.

1225
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,860
Except for Richard Karn.

1226
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:15,780
He's fine.

1227
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:16,620
He's fine.

1228
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:20,160
I have some information.

1229
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:24,160
I was trying to think of an Air Force way to say it.

1230
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,460
Captain Marvel is meeting in Hangar 12, recruits, cadets.

1231
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,880
Hangar 12.

1232
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,320
You've been working on the Captain Marvel joke the whole time?

1233
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:35,260
No, I was looking up which soundstage it was in.

1234
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,540
Oh, this was in soundstage 10?

1235
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,120
No, it was 12 Flynn's.

1236
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,040
I think 12 is the other one.

1237
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,940
So that's where the Flynn's arcade was.

1238
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,360
This one's weird and in the corner.

1239
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,120
It's a terrible location.

1240
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,080
Also keep in mind this was next door to Superstar Limo when it opened.

1241
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:50,920
Yeah, I know where it is.

1242
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:55,880
September 11th has just occurred and you are in the worst theme park in the world

1243
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,880
where you go one way and it's a fake Regis and you go another way

1244
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,800
and it's a horrifying mannequin portraying Melanie Griffith.

1245
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:11,540
Uh, it felt like it was manifested by the times that it was existing in.

1246
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:18,940
In some ways, this pocket of the park, it encapsulates 2001 in a horrible way.

1247
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,940
Yeah, so it makes sense that the photo op is over there,

1248
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,180
although they were doing other photo ops over in this soundstage.

1249
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,680
Yeah, it's the old Finn's.

1250
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,520
Yeah, which is also kind of out of the woods by the bathroom.

1251
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,600
Flynn? Flynn? Flynn? Flynn's.

1252
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,400
Tron? Tron is Flynn.

1253
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,820
Finn is Star Wars. Flynn is Tron.

1254
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,880
Finn is also Breaking Bad, what the sun started calling himself.

1255
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,520
Oh, yeah, his full nickname.

1256
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,700
Yes, that's right.

1257
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,640
And that's everything that Finn is.

1258
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,820
My pitch was going to be some sort of a supermarket sweep dark ride.

1259
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:50,660
Hell yeah.

1260
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,060
Oh, Aaron's been all about supermarket sweep.

1261
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:58,300
Do you guys, it's not 100 percent, but Guy's Grocery Games on the Food Network.

1262
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:00,120
I haven't seen it.

1263
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,040
It's not a bad...

1264
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,020
Is it like supermarket sweep?

1265
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:08,060
You have to run around and find ingredients to then make a delicious dish for the judges.

1266
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,460
I like that, but it almost seems more...

1267
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,760
And there's some requirements.

1268
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:15,220
It seems more sophisticated, though, than the dumbness of supermarket sweep that I liked.

1269
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:15,800
It is.

1270
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,720
Where were you going?

1271
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,220
You get nice sweaters.

1272
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,120
Are you given matching sweaters to get on this ride?

1273
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:21,600
Oh, yeah, of course.

1274
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,820
And I'm in, but what else were you?

1275
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:28,780
Well, it's the problem is they generally don't want you to touch stuff when you're on a dark

1276
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,320
ride because they want people to lose an arm or get caught on something.

1277
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,320
But this will have to go so slow.

1278
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,120
Well, that's the problem.

1279
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,360
OK, here's what it is.

1280
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,700
I figured it out.

1281
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:41,600
It'll be a ride vehicle and it'll shoot you into the aisle.

1282
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,580
It gets you in that aisle real fast.

1283
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:48,220
Then it slows down so slow and maybe like sort of the Star Wars rumors.

1284
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:52,860
You get out, you run up and down the aisle, you grab as much stuff, put it in the back

1285
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:57,000
of your vehicle, you get back in and then it shoots you back to the front.

1286
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,140
You're like in a big shopping cart, essentially.

1287
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,520
OK, that's good, too.

1288
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:05,100
Let's make the ride vehicle like a big shopping cart and there's a section for humans and

1289
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:05,780
then there's a section.

1290
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,880
It'll be like your babies and you'll be in like the front.

1291
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,280
It'll be like a baby seat.

1292
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,240
It's because it's that big.

1293
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,780
Yeah. So you'll have to get out.

1294
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,900
You'll you'll shop, you'll throw it in and then there'll be many hams as you can.

1295
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,460
Yeah, just many of all turkeys.

1296
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:24,860
It is weird that that's what everyone because I was also just now thinking I loved it when

1297
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,460
they would grab a butterball turkey.

1298
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,820
I don't know what's so satisfying about that.

1299
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:35,720
Really odd. It's odd with like that there is like music with a lot of momentum and a

1300
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,880
announcer like a sporting event.

1301
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:43,720
But you are watching a woman gather up giant turkeys from close to the floor.

1302
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,060
It's a really I think the mix is what makes it so funny.

1303
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:51,960
Yeah. And I think it feels like it's some sort of fantasy because I think in our human

1304
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,840
brains, there's all these like instinct like we've talked on the show before about like

1305
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,020
doing something bad.

1306
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:02,440
Like I would think during a band like band recital, I could just play the trumpet right

1307
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,600
now and ruin this whole thing.

1308
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,840
There's like we get bad thoughts.

1309
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:08,860
Yeah. So I think that like you see order and you see a store, there's always like a

1310
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,880
feeling of like you want to trash it maybe.

1311
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,020
And then this is the ultimate fantasy for people because what is about it?

1312
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,460
You're given permission.

1313
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:22,280
Stealing. I guess when we were kids, they had those those prize, those sweepstakes

1314
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,540
prizes where you'd run into KB Toys and just unload stuff into the cart.

1315
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:28,820
Do you remember that? Obviously, it's a dream to do.

1316
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,080
Yes. Obviously, that's toys.

1317
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,440
So that makes sense. But supermarkets, we've almost just as satisfying to watch.

1318
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,280
Were you a fan of Finders Keepers?

1319
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,220
Oh, yeah, I love finding the board game.

1320
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,160
Finders Keepers.

1321
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,260
I should get the board game.

1322
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:39,700
Yeah.

1323
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,820
I don't think I still have it.

1324
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,820
That's a you went on a room to room romp.

1325
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:49,600
And I don't want to sidetrack, but I love the host of Finders Keepers, Wesley Youre,

1326
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:54,020
who was like a man who is just generally uncomfortable around children and should not

1327
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:58,980
have been talking to them and and like would like sometimes get a little weird and like

1328
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:03,040
yell at him. And there's this one where he was not happy with the the level to which

1329
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,300
they were tearing the room apart.

1330
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,640
And he says, come on, you got to go for it.

1331
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,820
Spiders Keepers.

1332
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,760
He's mad that they didn't go for it.

1333
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:15,040
So then there the kids just stare like, why are you Nickelodeon?

1334
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,720
You're a grown up yelling at us.

1335
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,440
That's not how Nickelodeon works.

1336
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:25,200
Someone wrote an article as Toys R Us was closing, interviewing kids who had won

1337
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,560
the Toys R Us contest where you would go through and take all the Toys R Us stuff.

1338
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,660
And they said whoever hosted that was like the coolest dude.

1339
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:37,040
And he's like, hey, I'm going to walk you through so you know where everything is.

1340
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,900
Here's the thing. You're going to start at the bikes.

1341
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,220
Just grab all the bike tags, like just grab a ball.

1342
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,140
Oh, he gave him tips.

1343
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:49,820
He gave tips. And then they like toured the whole store together, made sure everyone

1344
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:53,260
was comfortable. Like, oh, is there some stuff you know you're going to go for?

1345
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:54,680
OK, you better hit this then.

1346
00:56:54,680 --> 00:57:00,020
And like and they just said they had a room filled with toys until they were like 18.

1347
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,820
There was still stuff they hadn't opened.

1348
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:04,300
That's a dream. I get so excited you telling that story.

1349
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,600
It is exciting.

1350
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,700
Visualizing even living vicariously.

1351
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,360
I have toys everywhere in here and I'm like, not enough.

1352
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:15,960
Mm hmm. I certainly wouldn't like run around and in 30 seconds take them all off the

1353
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,140
shelves. No, it'd be a nightmare for your toys.

1354
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:18,840
Yeah, a nightmare.

1355
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:23,180
It's funny. All these old game shows talk makes me think and even Millionaire 2, like,

1356
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:29,220
man, isn't it wild to think about like cultural commentary at the time, either in like

1357
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:35,560
editorial pages or like dystopian movies of like, can you imagine these game shows

1358
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,700
and stuff or like, can you?

1359
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,300
We're like it was like greed and commercialism.

1360
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,820
Yeah, I grew up just like this is where the culture is now.

1361
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:48,400
Like even Millionaire, like back when people didn't be we're reading newspapers a lot

1362
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:54,060
more in 2000 and 2001, it was just going like this is what passes for TV nowadays.

1363
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:59,620
These these cultural commentators could not even have predicted like Instagram

1364
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:06,160
influencers or Twitch streamers like, oh, it's actually the the future is even more

1365
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,420
dystopian.

1366
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,360
No, the problem it peaked.

1367
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,660
It got the worst with game shows and rap lyrics.

1368
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:17,580
Yeah. And things are actually things are better and actually we're getting a little more

1369
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:21,140
moral because we can put Santa on the Christmas Cup again.

1370
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,020
Yeah, we put Santa on the Christmas Cup.

1371
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,400
And does all the other stuff.

1372
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,000
May I interest you in SoundCloud dot com?

1373
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,000
What's wrong with SoundCloud?

1374
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,960
I don't know. SoundCloud, Raffer, I don't.

1375
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,420
They're mumbling too much.

1376
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,440
That's what it is.

1377
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,960
They just enunciated.

1378
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,500
I'm with you there. I like I like enunciation.

1379
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,160
Sure. That's why I like game shows and Regis.

1380
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,260
I like Regis.

1381
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,260
Yeah. Well, hey, that was a blast.

1382
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:49,920
I think we covered all there is to cover.

1383
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,440
Correct me if I'm wrong, except for one final cliffhanger.

1384
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:56,040
Had you used the lifeline?

1385
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:01,040
I did. I while we were talking, I texted the question to Andrew Grissom and he guessed

1386
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,780
Harry Potter. So he would have led you astray.

1387
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,080
Yeah. Good thing you didn't listen, Andrew Grissom.

1388
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:11,560
He also said, my friend is trying to pass off two tickets to Stomp in Thousand Oaks

1389
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,740
tonight. Any interest?

1390
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:18,780
So your lifeline is giving me the opportunity to drive many, many miles away to Stomp.

1391
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,560
I'm not taking it. He's a very generous.

1392
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:22,980
He's a very generous man.

1393
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:27,440
Did he send that second text from the year 2001?

1394
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:31,260
Two tickets. Hey, two tickets to Stomp.

1395
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,260
I can't use.

1396
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:35,740
2001 Millionaire and Stomp are both going strong.

1397
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:41,320
Yeah. Yeah. Hey, we still we still going to see Moulin Rouge this week.

1398
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,000
All right. We survived.

1399
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,500
But I guess the ride the second gate.

1400
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,840
Thanks for helping us and wasting some time with that game show.

1401
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:56,540
If you'd like to play Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Sports Edition CD-ROM, it's

1402
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:01,320
available for very reasonable prices on eBay or come to Mike's place.

1403
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:08,220
Come see the cover where Regis has a he's just putting his hands out, but he has a

1404
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,660
basketball and a football and they are not in his hands.

1405
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,420
They're just kind of hovering above his hands.

1406
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,920
And they look like CGI hands.

1407
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,300
They look like they were painted like that.

1408
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,080
It doesn't look like a human.

1409
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:20,660
No, that doesn't look like some Photoshop stuff.

1410
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:21,780
Yeah, there is.

1411
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:26,040
I tease the Twitch streamers, but there is some interesting articles started to come

1412
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:31,200
out about like video game archiving is just now they're starting to figure out how

1413
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,320
to play old video. Like, what do we do?

1414
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:37,180
Like you have to find the old system and does the old system still work?

1415
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:41,180
Like, how do you preserve it the way you preserve books or film and stuff?

1416
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,900
Oh, man. Well, in in music, you should be able to you have to you should have to

1417
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,980
like the old museum of TV and radio.

1418
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:52,640
Oh, like talk to a woman behind a counter and one kinescope, please.

1419
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,500
One one Sega Saturn, please.

1420
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,380
And you got to blow on it.

1421
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,680
Do you guys remember blowing on the video games?

1422
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,500
Does anyone remember that I was back in the eighties or nineties?

1423
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,620
If a kid saw that today, like what do you say?

1424
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,920
If you're a fancy writer's room?

1425
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:13,540
Yeah, we're working on a great job.

1426
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:17,020
Yeah, I'm writing a show all about blowing on video games.

1427
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:21,260
It's going to be and whether or not you remember it, it's just random.

1428
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:22,320
How you came up with that?

1429
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,920
It's pretty weird.

1430
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,600
Remember Pogs?

1431
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,480
All right. You survived by as a second game.

And a lot of fun awaits.

1436
