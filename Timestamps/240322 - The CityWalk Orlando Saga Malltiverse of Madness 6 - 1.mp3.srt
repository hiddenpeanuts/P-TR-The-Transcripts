1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Forever!

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:03,560
Dog!

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,980
When your town has made you frown

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,600
When your square has made you swear

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,080
When life gives you one more punch

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,140
You need a doughnut soaked in Captain Grunge

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,800
You need a place, a place to stroll

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,800
With alcohol, a place that features part of the Berlin Wall

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,780
Where seam-punk robots sell chocolate snacks

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,820
A place where you can tattoo your lower back

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,940
So let's go take a walk

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,100
Let's all go to City Walk Orlando

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,060
Tonight, tonight

14
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,540
A daily, extremely necessary series

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,280
Exploring the shops, restaurants, and cosmic wonder

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,800
That make up Universal City Walk Orlando

17
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,260
Buongiorno, and welcome to Podcast the Ride presents

18
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,920
The City Walk Saga Orlando Multiverse of Madness

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,860
My name is Mike Carlson, and I'm just feeling very festive and Italian today

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,100
Scott Gardner also here?

21
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,200
Yes, well, Italian is the nationality of one of the places in this, soâ€¦

22
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,020
Well, I assume it is, we haven't gotten our assignment yet

23
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,420
I'm just saying I'm feeling that

24
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,640
I think I know what it is, but I'm not totally sure

25
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,340
Right, Jason Sheridan also here?

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,680
I am also feeling festive and Italiano

27
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,020
Alright, great

28
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,760
I like the multiverse as if it feed into molto bene

29
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,920
Yeah, of course

30
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,100
Very purposeful

31
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:59,160
You did, listeners couldn't see, you did like pizza box chef hands

32
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,420
Like the kissing the fingers

33
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,500
What do you call that motion you do with your fingers?

34
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,880
Pizza box chef hands

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,240
Pizza box chef hands

36
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,600
Pizza box chef hands

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,240
It really should be a shorter thing, I think

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,480
Pizza box chef hands, but you know what it means when you hear it

39
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,120
P B C H

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,280
I'm doing P B C H

41
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,600
And if you weren't, for listeners Mike did a quick P B C H

42
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,100
Okay, well from now on, add that to our Wikipedia

43
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,580
That's a cool, you know, it's like LOL or ROTFL

44
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,520
So yeah, I am feeling very Italian, but I'm also feeling like

45
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,140
Oh, there's like a presence here, a multiple, I don't know

46
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,880
More than usual

47
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,720
I think for sure more than usual because we are, should we summon him?

48
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,500
Yeah, let's do it

49
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,700
Okay, please, Sector, how do we summon him?

50
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,080
I forgot

51
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,640
We've been doing it one way, right?

52
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,180
Not every time, I think it's been kind of different every time

53
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,340
And I think you could probably just summon him by saying

54
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,860
Let's do chef hands

55
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,020
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, right

56
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,920
Let's do pizza box chef hands

57
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,560
Hey, we're doing it

58
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,720
P B C H

59
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,900
The sector keeper is here, hey

60
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,140
Hey, Paisanos, Paisanos

61
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,440
Oh hey, how are ya?

62
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,740
Ah, buongiorno

63
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,760
I'm doing good, how are you?

64
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,540
Oh yeah, fine, yes

65
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,240
I'm speaking personally, I am happy that we are past the age of Buffett

66
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,880
I think mercifully we are, maybe, Mike probably feels different

67
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,040
Both of you probably feel different

68
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,000
I was more than ready for that Buffett phase to be over

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,800
And I feel like maybe there's better stuff coming for us finally, I hope

70
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,620
I think that's right, but I will say this, I was just a friend of the show

71
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,760
Ted sent me today Pitbull's new song, Thank God, and Jimmy Buffett

72
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,980
And there's so

73
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,980
And Jimmy Buffett?

74
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,880
Yeah, so I haven't listened to this yet, so we're not going to do it here

75
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,080
But I'm just saying, we may have to address Pitbull's new song at some point in this saga

76
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,980
That's all I'm saying

77
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,300
I just want to tease that for later

78
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,060
Pitbull just dropped a song?

79
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,280
I believe so, yeah, it's a new song

80
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:07,020
Thank, sorry, Thank God and Jimmy, is there a, does that imply it's thank both of them or is it two separate thoughts?

81
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,800
Thank God and, separately, Jimmy Buffett

82
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,100
No, I think it's, I think he's putting God and Jimmy Buffett on the same pedestal

83
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,360
The same, like, kind of importance

84
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,060
That's what I get from it, at least

85
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,660
Buffett does seat at the right hand of the Father

86
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,300
Oh, well, yeah, you would know

87
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,980
And heaven plus that it's

88
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,420
Well, he's new up there, so you want to give him a good seat, at least for a little while

89
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,840
And been born on Christmas, like God's son

90
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,020
Yeah, of course

91
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,140
So I'm glad that he's up there, I'm glad that he's doing good up there

92
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,320
Oh, hell yeah

93
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,160
Is he okay that there's just clouds and it's not water?

94
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,060
Well, you can just kind of like make the clouds, they're like Play-Doh

95
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,720
Okay, so he can mold, he can mold the clouds into water?

96
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,160
Into ships, into water

97
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,140
Into little cheeseburgers that imagine

98
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,100
Yeah, yeah, sure

99
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,220
Hammocks, hammocks

100
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,020
Yeah, mm-hmm

101
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,700
Oh yeah, hammocks

102
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,240
Money

103
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,240
Money

104
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,040
Yeah, I just want him to feel comfortable up there

105
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,900
Well, he's had a lot of money, I assume he had a lot of money lying around, he's very rich

106
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,180
He's comfy, he's comfy

107
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,600
He lied, he was sleeping in a hammock made of money, I assume

108
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,020
That's what he did every night

109
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,480
You don't want heaven to be a downgrade, you don't want it to be that he like

110
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,500
He had it better here

111
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,780
He had it better here, yeah, yeah

112
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,560
Yeah, exactly, so

113
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,780
Well, this is my mistake for, I caused an extension of the age of Buffett by referring to the glad age of Buffett

114
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,020
You screwed it up

115
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:35,180
But there is something in the air, like the spirit energy, it is a little crunchy, you know?

116
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,360
I feel a little crowded and crunched

117
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,620
Dude, dudes

118
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,680
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

119
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,440
That was different, what the hell was that?

120
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,380
No, no, no, no, get him out of here

121
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,040
Sucker keeper, who is this?

122
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,260
86, this crunchy asshole

123
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,180
Whoa

124
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,400
It's the VBB, you know me

125
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,240
The VBB, wait

126
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,940
It's the VBB, it's the Venice Boardwalk

127
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,400
Venice Beach Boardwalk

128
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600
You can't smell baked peach without beach, buddy

129
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,160
He's gonna do shit like this all day

130
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,320
Oh my God, oh wait, okay, geez, he showed up

131
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:25,600
Because, okay, we have been, we've learned of your vast network of cousins or family members or whatever, other keepers

132
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,700
This is one of my cousins, the Venice Beach Boardwalk

133
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,440
From the, this is the official, the Venice Beach Boardwalk

134
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,840
Yeah, we freed him and all these other keepers from the end of the Downtown Disney World deal

135
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,540
That's right, yeah, if you go listen to the end of the Downtown Disney World deal, we did, yeah, we heard from you real briefly

136
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,700
And wow, here you are in our presence

137
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,160
Great, gratsi for that, boys, thank you for that

138
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,300
Oh yeah, no problem, I'm glad we could help out

139
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,160
I can't believe we're in the same room

140
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,040
Hey, sorry, I'll just be real quick and then I'll just be out of your hair

141
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,620
Oh, okay

142
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,720
Can I get like, I need like 50 more grand

143
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,340
I can siz, you know I can't do this right now

144
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,120
Boys, boys, boys, boys

145
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,440
Sorry, should we edit that out or not?

146
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,000
Did you just ask him for, you just asked him for money?

147
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,280
He asked me for 50 more grand

148
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,900
Oh right, because you said you won the Powerball, but you said all the keepers were hitting you up

149
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,340
All the keepers keep coming at you out of the woodwork

150
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:28,220
I've got keepers coming, hitting me up, I'm answering, you know how many names in my phone say do not answer now

151
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,460
So you do have a phone, because I was calling and none of this wasn't working

152
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,120
I have a phone and

153
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,380
It goes booboo beep, sorry, this number's been disconnected

154
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,900
It doesn't sound like the normal voice, it sounds like your voice

155
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,800
It sounds like you changed your voicemail to say that

156
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,200
I'm answering and going booboo beep

157
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,160
That's your teller right there, you gotta just use the reel

158
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,340
Or get a recording of what the reel, there's no number sound is

159
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:59,740
It was an old tactic I picked up while working at Cricket Wireless, my manager would answer the phone there and say that

160
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,360
Wow, you picked that?

161
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,180
That's a good plan to avoid, but you gotta get a more realistic voice, your voice is really recognizable, it's iconic

162
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,620
I know, I know

163
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,120
So 50 grand for, you know, what for?

164
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,740
I'm trying to get a couple more Michael Ferraris

165
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,040
Michael Ferro?

166
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,300
What the hell's a Michael Ferrari?

167
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:27,940
Oh you mean those paintings, the paint, full disclosure just to like

168
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,580
We didn't want to bring this up

169
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,480
We were contacted by the Venice Beach Boardwalk Keeper

170
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,040
Basically, he heard the whole series was going on

171
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:45,620
He hit up Mike and I and asked if he could kind of like hang, just get a feel for us and the vibe of the show

172
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,620
And you, I thought you weren't gonna be there, so we could just go hang out

173
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,100
We were at City Walk and we were like, where is this guy?

174
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,640
And you weren't there and we couldn't pick up enough Michael Ferraris

175
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,920
I wasn't there because there's a lien on my house

176
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,540
And I've been trying, I've been doing paperwork all week

177
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:07,140
Oh wow, well, that's really, I'm so sorry, but he told us like, he just said you couldn't make it

178
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,500
And he said, but it's on, he just said, kept saying everything is on you

179
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,240
That's what you said

180
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,720
It's on me

181
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,580
Yeah, that's what you said

182
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,540
So last time I gave you $50,000, you already bought a Michael Ferrari

183
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,540
The last time before that I gave you $100,000

184
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,340
And you invested it in Royal Match, which we've talked about

185
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:26,580
Yeah

186
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,240
You gave it to the guys that created Royal Match, the game that traps a king

187
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,700
Oh yeah, and he's like trying to get out and you gotta make sure the water gets dumped in the right place

188
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,740
So it doesn't drown in the room

189
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,700
Right, because you said

190
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,360
Well I'm just trying to save a king out here, found boy, what are you doing with every day?

191
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,840
I'm trying to save my house, man

192
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:53,100
Oh man, this is really, guys, guys, I'm so like, look, we're trying to do, you know, we have a mission here

193
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,660
We have to rate and review things as well, so I, like, please, like, if we could just keep it for a while

194
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,040
Royal Match, five stars

195
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,660
Not those things, no, it's like the things that, that's why we went up to City Walk

196
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,020
Like we did like, specifically we're trying to do those restaurants, like the ones that we went to

197
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:09,860
Yeah

198
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,180
That's why we did that with you

199
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,100
And I get, you know, honestly, Sector Keeper, we had a pretty good time, I thought

200
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,100
Yeah

201
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,260
And I, at first I was like, wow, the generosity of Sector Keeper to like get all of this

202
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,160
Yeah, thanks so much

203
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,940
We racked up, honestly

204
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,220
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

205
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,720
Yeah, we had a healthy tab going there, it was a good party, we missed you though, buddy

206
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,800
Wait, wait, I paid for this trip?

207
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah

208
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,120
That's what he kept saying

209
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,160
Yeah, that's what he said

210
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,520
I meant to say thank you when we started, because we had a great time

211
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,280
I mean, here, maybe, just to like

212
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,420
Vivo Italian Kitchen where everyone knows your name, specifically your name, because there's a tab under your name

213
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,280
Oh, no, Sector Keepo

214
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,510
They just let you run up Sector Keepo's tab, that's me

215
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,020
Yeah, oh, we know it's you, yeah

216
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,720
Oh

217
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,180
We didn't know, I really feel bad now

218
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,020
No, don't feel bad, this is what he does, man

219
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:07,540
I am kind of curious about these Michael Ferraris though, it sounds like a good investment opportunity

220
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,620
Yeah, that's a painting at this like store where they have all of, that's a new thing in Hollywood

221
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,900
There's a store with all of these collectibles that are signed by celebrities

222
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,280
We can get into that, we're dealing with, actually maybe, and now I feel bad asking you for this

223
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,640
Sure

224
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,820
Just to like, can you just give us, as if none of this happened, can you give us our assignment?

225
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,240
Yeah, can you real quick give me just another $50,000?

226
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,660
Okay, I'm gonna sell you $50,000

227
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,740
Okay, yeah, thanks

228
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,280
Wait, don't, wait, I don't know, should you?

229
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,660
This is the last time, you promise?

230
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,560
What?

231
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,560
Do you promise?

232
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:39,920
Yeah, what?

233
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,420
Do you promise?

234
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,120
Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, no, yeah, no

235
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,100
Do you?

236
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,340
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no

237
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,520
Are you saying no?

238
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, yeah, no

239
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,260
Boys, boys, phase six, sector one, big fire

240
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:03,700
Antihedos Alpha, Antihedos Omega, Vivo Alpha, Vivo Omega

241
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,980
And Celebrity Authentics, good luck, paisanos

242
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,840
Okay, thank you

243
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,600
Thanks, appreciate it

244
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,560
That's what we have to talk about in this sector

245
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,020
Please finish this sector so we can finish it off and get this guy out of here

246
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:25,520
Okay, well, I mean, maybe a good place to start would be the meal that we went up and had, that we thought that you were in on

247
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:32,920
To catch you up, Venice Beach Boardwalk Keeper, with this thing, Alpha and Omega, Alpha means

248
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,900
The first, yes, and Omega always means second

249
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,220
Second

250
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah, yeah, no, we, all right, you know the rules just like we do

251
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,640
It's first and last, we, it's first and last

252
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,760
I thought we went through this, I'm not sure what the second is

253
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,340
Alpha, first, Omega, second, Gamma, third, Delta, fourth

254
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,300
Epsilon?

255
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,200
Fifth

256
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
Okay, we're on the same page now

257
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,800
Okay, okay, okay, everyone's got rules

258
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:06,240
Basically, Alpha is whichever establishment opened first, whether it was CityWalk Orlando or CityWalk Hollywood

259
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,560
And I guess CityWalk Hollywood is part of this too

260
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,180
So Vivo is an Italian restaurant

261
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:17,820
Just to be clear, in the event that something opened at CityWalk first, that would be called

262
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,540
CityWalk beer

263
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:24,380
If it opened at CityWalk Hollywood, whichever one opened first is always Alpha, regardless of which

264
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,780
Right, because that makes more sense than just calling it the one at Hollywood

265
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,180
Or the one in Florida

266
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,720
Yes, you're learning, you're learning

267
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,420
Yeah, I mean these are the rules that the, like, the gods have established

268
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,540
Yeah, SectorKeeper, look at him for that, I don't mean to create more tension, but like

269
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,640
So like the Chocolatorium would be like Beta, Alpha

270
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,800
Well, it opened first in Orlando

271
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,060
It opened first in Orlando, so it would be Alpha in Orlando

272
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,840
Okay, but if this Vivo opened first and the Vivo in Hollywood is the Alpha

273
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,580
Is Alpha

274
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,560
This is a bad system, dude

275
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,280
And with every beginning there's an end and every end there's a beginning

276
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,660
And with every end there's a beginning

277
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,720
You know what's weird about this is that almost

278
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,040
And there's also portals and jump points and wormholes

279
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,300
Well that's just true

280
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,500
You guys know about gate holes?

281
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,960
Yeah, yeah, no, he's filled us in about gate holes

282
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,800
You guys know about jump points?

283
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,640
Yeah, of course

284
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,500
Yeah, we've been learning

285
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,660
You up on, like, wormholes?

286
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:19,260
Yeah

287
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,100
I think we're pretty up on it

288
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,260
And you know about, like, ends?

289
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:22,860
Yeah

290
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,320
I think so

291
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,260
Okay, yeah

292
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,660
Well, you know about ends, right?

293
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,460
Yeah

294
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,240
With every end there's a beginning

295
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,680
Mm-hmm

296
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,520
Do you know or are you just nodding?

297
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,920
What's this guy been telling you?

298
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,080
We know, I mean, now it feels like you're trying to, like, co-opt all this stuff as your own ideas

299
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,040
We learned all this from the Sector Keeper

300
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,700
Yeah, I mean, it's his stuff, yeah

301
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,800
It's common knowledge

302
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,060
Yeah, everyone knows this stuff

303
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,020
Amongst keepers, so

304
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,520
He's on the level for the first time

305
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,740
He's on the level

306
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,680
Okay, you don't mind

307
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,240
Okay, all right, so

308
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,980
You know what's confusing about this?

309
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,880
And not by, like, when I say level I don't mean, like, sector

310
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,800
Oh, and the level keeper who's your different relatives

311
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,120
Yeah

312
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,580
Okay

313
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:07,200
What's weird to me is that we have this Alpha Omega system but in almost every case Alpha is Orlando

314
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,440
Orlando

315
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,580
And we even found one where it went the other way

316
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,180
I don't think so

317
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,180
You're learning, boys, you're learning

318
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,680
If Celebrity Authentics opens in Orlando it will be the other way

319
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,080
But they haven't announced anything

320
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,020
I have my own questions about why we're doing that exactly

321
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:30,640
Okay, so Vivo, it's an Italian chain that Universal made up so that they would have their own that they own

322
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:37,080
It replaced the previously existing one at CityWalk Orlando which was called Pasta More

323
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,120
That's a fallen brother, it's Pasta More

324
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,200
I don't know if you guys can see this logo from here

325
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:49,920
If you're, I mean, if you're judging an Italian restaurant on busyness of logo, Pasta More easily trounced Vivo

326
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,020
Which is just kind of a plain word

327
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,080
It just says Vivo

328
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,260
Neon pasta

329
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,260
When you see pasta you say More

330
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,220
Can I have More?

331
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:09,680
So they opened this chain which is of course, the chef was Milan native Nicola Bellazzi Canale

332
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,980
We all know that

333
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,340
Nicola Bellazzi Canale

334
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,180
We honor Canale

335
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,800
This was 2015 Orlando, came to Hollywood in 2018

336
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,880
And it's kind of like a pre-interview, get to know you

337
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,100
We went up to the, to Omega which is Hollywood with you the other night

338
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,060
Yeah, that was great

339
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,160
I thought it was great

340
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,400
I had a really good time, yeah

341
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,140
I had a great time, we got that, what was that old whiskey we found?

342
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,800
Oh yeah, I took some pictures of them because you insisted on like another round, another round

343
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,680
And I was like, are you sure we can't chip in on this?

344
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,340
You said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, horizontal

345
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,160
That's right

346
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,260
Is that what you ordered for us?

347
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,900
Which is like a famously, like this was the, and you went for the 23 year

348
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,200
And I should have just let you do it and not looked it up

349
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,100
But we got it, because we're journalists, we have to know

350
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,540
Every one of those glasses was $285

351
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,660
Yeah, we didn't

352
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,680
I assumed you were, you knew about this

353
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,940
Well god, we're 23

354
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,680
Top shelf, they got top shelf liquor

355
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,060
Top shelf liquor in CityWalk

356
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,840
There's a drink at CityWalk, that's $201

357
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,700
Just one

358
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:15,940
$285

359
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,780
Per drink

360
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,520
Per drink, because that's the top shelf

361
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,500
I mean it's 23

362
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:19,940
I love it

363
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,880
Jordan, baby, what are we talking about?

364
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,900
That's why you pick it

365
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,200
Yeah, you're right, we gotta do the Jordan to liquors, you said

366
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,740
Yeah

367
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,890
I mean it was fucking great

368
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,120
And then we had to follow it with a round of cucumber coolers, which are like 11 bucks

369
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,000
Yeah

370
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,180
That, was that's much more reasonable

371
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,260
Boys, boys

372
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:43,340
It was, but it gets a little less reasonable if somebody among us

373
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,960
Looking at you, Venice Beach, where I keep forgotten like seven of them

374
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,440
Yeah, you're looking at me when you say that

375
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,520
You said somebody, but then you're looking at me specifically

376
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,420
I did, I don't mean to cut, but you did, you were into those

377
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,660
You were pounding those down

378
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,680
Yeah, well

379
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,140
You can't get drunk, they just fall right to the ground, they hit the ground

380
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,080
It falls through the shatters, you can't

381
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,240
Keep trying though

382
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,840
You keep trying

383
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,140
You gotta keep trying

384
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,060
And you have to keep

385
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,020
I'm chasing that feeling of being drunk so, I haven't been drunk in so long

386
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,560
You can't get drunk when you're, once you, they don't tell you that

387
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,520
Once you die you can't get drunk anymore

388
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,940
God, that's horrible

389
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,580
You know what, you can get high though

390
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,220
Cause it's smoke and vapor and that's what you are too, so that adds up

391
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,820
That's one thing we're on the same page

392
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,560
Yeah, baby

393
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,280
You guys, you're on this, yeah, I'm watching you bond over that

394
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,500
Feel free to just like, if you like, blow some smoke at each other

395
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,060
I'm telling you, I'm telling you

396
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,340
We're not gonna be mad at all once we're gonna, look

397
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,500
We're gonna draw a share bowl, we're gonna lose ourselves in these Michael Ferraris

398
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,360
They're pretty good paintings, I well agree

399
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,420
I want you to picture like, Anne Hathaway

400
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:56,280
But she's Catwoman, but she's made of a million points of color

401
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,700
And that's a Michael Ferrari, baby

402
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,260
And I want you to picture

403
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,760
Harley Quinn

404
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,800
But she's Harley Quinn

405
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,720
But she's a million points

406
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,800
Light and color

407
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,540
That's a Michael Ferrari

408
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,940
And I want you to picture John Travolta

409
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,700
But he's John Travolta in that movie he's so famous for

410
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,280
The three?

411
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,200
The three's hairspray?

412
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:20,720
Which one?

413
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,160
No, no, no, he's got a gun

414
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,020
Gotti?

415
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:24,940
No, he's got a gun

416
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,820
Punisher 2?

417
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:26,520
Samuel L.

418
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:26,860
Jackson's gun

419
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,660
The one from Something With Love, it's by the Taken guys

420
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,880
No guys, he's so famous in this one

421
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,700
He's got a gun

422
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,160
Pup fiction?

423
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,080
John Travolta's got a gun

424
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,500
It's gotta be pulp fiction

425
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,540
Yeah, that's one

426
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,140
Okay

427
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,320
Jesus

428
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,380
It's like the second one we said

429
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,700
No, he's like Grease

430
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,920
You're too high, man

431
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,260
These conversations with him

432
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,600
He'll smoke himself, he's got like a little Casper tail

433
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,700
And he'll put it in his mouth and he'll smoke himself

434
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,920
Yeah, you gotta get high on your own supply, that's what they say

435
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,600
When you're a ghost and you smoke your own little tail

436
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,080
I hate to be vulgar, but is that like sucking your own dick?

437
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,120
No, not at all

438
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,340
What?

439
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,300
Like sucking your own dick?

440
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,240
Oh my god, you hang out with these guys?

441
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,920
Are they always like this?

442
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,540
Talking about sucking their own dicks?

443
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,440
I'm never like this

444
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,120
This is the thing with Mike, Mike makes the whole thing of being like the prude

445
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,440
And then he'll say the weirdest shit sexually all the time

446
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,340
Well, but you're sucking your tail

447
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,600
Seems like this guy's over here just waiting to talk about sucking his own dick

448
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,080
That's not what I'm talking about

449
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,780
Did I grow up on Kevin Smith movies?

450
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,020
Yeah, but that's not me

451
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,360
That's not what I talk about normally

452
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,600
No man, vaping on your own Casper tail is not the same as sucking your own dick

453
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,260
It sounds- It does sound a little ridiculous

454
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:35,740
Thank you, thank you, Joe

455
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,580
No, when you say it, it sounds ridiculous

456
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,660
When he says it, it sounds sensible

457
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,900
It sounds sensible to suck your own tail?

458
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,360
Well, he's made of gas, you know?

459
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,100
Let's get real, you're not always just sucking tail

460
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,720
Thank you

461
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,040
Puffing on that tail

462
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,580
Yeah

463
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,040
Ripping tail clouds

464
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can light up the-

465
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,600
You get some plumes going

466
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,940
Yeah, you slurp the nerp

467
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,960
Torch the briar

468
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,740
Slurp the nerp

469
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,700
So gross

470
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,940
Look, this is- you guys are being gross too

471
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,580
Why can't we acknowledge that we're all being gross at the same time?

472
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,220
Why am I?

473
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,500
Why are you bending over?

474
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,880
Because I'm trying to show you what it would be like

475
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,480
What the frick?

476
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
Don't stop, man

477
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,520
Okay, I can't believe I'm on the same page right now

478
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,460
Yeah, no, go on

479
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,160
But when you suck your own tail, you don't go forward

480
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,700
Thank you

481
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,340
You reach back and bring the tail over your shoulder

482
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,340
And around you like a camelback

483
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,740
As if you had like a big sheet under you

484
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,200
And he was pulling the sheet

485
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,260
This guy gets it

486
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,840
So it's like a hookah, it's almost like he has a big hookah

487
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,000
You got like a caterpillar in Alice in Wonderland

488
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,580
Yes, it's like a hookah

489
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,880
See, everyone's on the same page

490
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,260
Catch up, Michael

491
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,380
But there's gotta be a ghost that's sucking his own tail front ways

492
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,120
There has to be one- like, everybody does things differently

493
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,140
So like, that would be an easy thing to do, just bend over

494
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,340
Yeah, if you're a pervert, lowlife, degenerate, you could do it that way

495
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,180
Are we saying that-

496
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,000
I guess you could do it that way

497
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,760
If you do it front ways, like that would be like an erogenous zone

498
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,020
That would give you a sexual feeling

499
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,800
But if you do it up and around your back, that's more like drubbing

500
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,660
Up and around the back, you can do it on the red carpet, normal, bat, and eye

501
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,500
Red carpet?

502
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,440
At the front?

503
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,200
Yes

504
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,920
Get to jail

505
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,580
Go to prison

506
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,340
Yeah

507
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,600
Did you say red carpet?

508
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,660
Are you floating down a red carpet often?

509
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,180
I mean, I go to any red carpet

510
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,880
We went to premiere of Madame Webb

511
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,620
People feel strongly about that film

512
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,940
Yeah, I've heard, I haven't seen it yet

513
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,580
I only have one thought

514
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,060
We didn't go to the red carpet, we didn't see it

515
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,980
Yeah, yeah

516
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:46,040
Fucking- well, based on Flash as the precedent, Mike's probably gonna fucking love Madame Webb

517
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,020
There might be parts of Madame Webb

518
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,080
Actually, Madame Webb's good!

519
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,180
You know who said it's good?

520
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,720
Evan Susser, cut to Susser

521
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,060
No, I didn't say that, another round of lies

522
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:57,500
Look, if there's scenes I like, I will say it, I'm not too scared

523
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,180
I'm a guy who's willing to-

524
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,860
You will say that Susser also said it, even though it wasn't true

525
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,400
Look, I'll throw out- well, we debated that

526
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,420
I'll throw out a controversial opinion sometimes, and that's just who I am

527
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,920
And yeah, I will throw out the idea of sucking your own ghost tale

528
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,500
That's who I am, okay?

529
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,500
Look, you guys can be upset with me all you want, but that's just who I am

530
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,820
Sucking your own ghost tale is fine, it's just not the same as-

531
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,880
Alright, fine, I understand

532
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,760
Do it over the back of your shoulder

533
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,980
I wanna get back to these Mike Ferrari's, cause they sound like great investment opportunities

534
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,700
You are so correct, let's talk about Pennsylvania based artist Michael Ferrari

535
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:42,120
Celebrity Authentics is a store that's- by the way, only at City Walk Hollywood

536
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,860
How did this become part of-

537
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,260
No other place

538
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,840
Okay, I understand that we're covering things at Hollywood that are also in Orlando

539
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,480
That much we've done, but why is this on our plate?

540
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,160
This is only in Hollywood

541
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,260
Ultimately it's an Orlando series

542
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,900
Why did this get added?

543
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,540
Because I wanted to go there

544
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,420
To buy the Michael Ferrari pictures to complete the set

545
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,480
This is what happens, boys, he brought this into the sector

546
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,620
How did we allow a guest ghost to start putting things in the order?

547
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,420
There's so many things that we have to cover just in Orlando

548
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:24,180
And then some drifter shows up and we have to go do what he wants and make it an official part of the show

549
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,960
Excuse me, this is my home

550
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,320
What do you mean, this is?

551
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:34,000
We're doing this in my- how, do you mean what, the city, the world?

552
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,220
This aura

553
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,260
The vibe is your home?

554
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,540
The vibe is my home

555
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,700
So if I come at you with any conflicting information

556
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,200
Don't bring that into my home, this vibe is my home

557
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,320
Okay, here's the deal

558
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,980
If you do look at the paperwork of the aura

559
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,120
I did cosign and this is his home

560
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,160
What?

561
00:24:53,740 --> 00:25:00,140
This isn't my home anymore because of- I don't buy- this is some fucking floaty outer space shit

562
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,740
I don't agree with this one bit, I live here

563
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,800
This is what happens when you bring these other keepers into the mix, man

564
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,620
I'm figuring it out, I thought- look, I thought it was fun

565
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,780
We went out and had a good time and had a good dinner, but now I know that was a lie

566
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,800
And Celebrity Authentics was just-

567
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,920
Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean it was a lie?

568
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,940
It was a- you lied about-

569
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,240
Were the smiles a lie?

570
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:20,980
No

571
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,160
Was the very small chicken panini sandwich a lie?

572
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,140
That I would have assumed would have been, you know, long like a panini

573
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,560
But was in fact short and round like a Hawaiian roll?

574
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,240
Was that a lie?

575
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,020
There's no lying about that, I saw it with my own two eyes

576
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,860
You had the teeniest paninis

577
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,300
So this is your order at Vivo, just to be clear?

578
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,500
That's what he got, that's what Venice Beach Borough Keeper got

579
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:51,360
Pappy Van Winkle, Keep It Coming 23, try to get that, follow it up, Cucumber Coolers

580
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,260
Pappy Van Winkle produced in very small quantities

581
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:02,140
So that, a bunch of it ended up at the Italian restaurant at City Walk Hollywood is very interesting

582
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:08,200
That's why I feel like we gotta keep getting it, cause you never know when Pappy's off Tappy, they don't got no more no more

583
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,080
You do have to make sure

584
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:17,680
I'll go back to the Tappy if you can assure me that you are paying for it or let us pay for it too

585
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,460
It was abusive to the sector keeper to charge it to him

586
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:26,420
First of all, you can pee in the ocean for the same reason you can charge things to the sector keeper

587
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:31,220
He doesn't notice, he's got so much money he doesn't know what to do with it

588
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,220
Hold on, hold on, have you told them about rubber ducks?

589
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,080
Ask this guy how many rubber ducks he has

590
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,560
We're spending, we're looking for things to spend money on

591
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,860
Hey, sector keeper, how many rubber ducks do you have?

592
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,080
How many rubber ducks do, okay

593
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,260
In California?

594
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,300
There you go, see, it's got state specific duck collection

595
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,560
How many different states do you have a collection of rubber ducks in?

596
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,360
Continental?

597
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,700
Oh man, he's, god

598
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,880
Whoa, you have them in Alaska too or Hawaii?

599
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,040
This guy's pleading poverty, he's on the 1% of 1%, Powerball changed this guy

600
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,460
Really?

601
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:20,140
I didn't know, he seemed like he was the same, he seemed humble and he seemed like he's still the same ghostly male

602
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,500
No, no, no, he used to be, I called up him, he'd answer the phone no matter what

603
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:30,740
Now it's, boop, boop, beep, we're sorry, this call did not go through and leave a message and I'm not here, okay bye

604
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,900
Okay, he's really giving you the business sector keeper

605
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,420
One of the tells was me saying this call has not gone through but also leave a message

606
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:45,260
That's on me, okay, yes, I was looking for a way to dodge this guy because I haven't heard from him in 20 years

607
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:52,700
And then I win the Powerball, which yes, a billion dollars, one of the billion dollar Powerball jackpots I did

608
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:58,300
But after taxes and you take the lump sum, it's not a lot of rubber ducks

609
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:06,440
First of all, look, you gotta take the lump sum, what are we talking about, you gotta take the lump sum

610
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,180
The annuity we've already established that every three months is an eternity for me

611
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,740
For you it's three months

612
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:18,880
You're getting a lot of rubber ducks and you've got so many keepers coming at you

613
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,720
Yes, exactly

614
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:27,380
Every one of those guys that we heard from the Horton Plaza keepers, Bugganyard needs burrito money

615
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:33,240
I mean like if this is just one of the dozens of ghosts coming at you, I feel terrible

616
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,460
I feel terrible for you

617
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,140
I'm gonna be alright

618
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,340
You can get a Van Hathaway Michael Ferrari for like $2,499

619
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,180
Is that the real price?

620
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,220
Mike, can you explain Celebrity Authentics?

621
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,200
Celebrity Authentics was a website for many years apparently

622
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,840
Basically they're a warehouse somewhere

623
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,960
But they have all these different memorabilia signed by celebrities

624
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,420
And they have different pictures and stuff with signatures

625
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,340
And then they also have a wall dedicated to an artist named Michael Ferrari

626
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,880
Pennsylvania based artist Michael Ferrari and you can get it for $2,499.

627
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,440
99

628
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,880
What are we worried about?

629
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,460
$2,499.

630
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,380
99

631
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,960
$2,499.

632
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,460
99

633
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,520
Yeah, $500 bucks

634
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,560
And yeah, there's some high ticket stuff here in Celebrity Authentics

635
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,900
Well, I just want to confirm just because VBB

636
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,980
There was a news story going around

637
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:36,420
A woman wrote an article, she's like an advice columnist for The Cut, New York Magazine

638
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:36,960
Sounds real

639
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,500
And she was convinced to withdraw $50,000 from her bank account

640
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,800
And put it in a shoebox and give it to someone who pulled up in a van

641
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,180
Is that?

642
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,500
Are you asking if that was him?

643
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,800
Yeah, were you trying to use that to get Michael Ferraris?

644
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,220
The thing about Michael Ferraris is they're most beautiful as a set

645
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:07,880
You know how sometimes when you buy a painting from an artist you put it on a wall above a fireplace

646
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,780
Or you put it next to the Titanic Boutique

647
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,960
Or you put it next to like

648
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,980
You want a triptych of Michael Ferraris?

649
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,360
What's that?

650
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,780
A triptych is like a set of threes

651
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,420
No, that's not enough

652
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,940
You have to have a grid

653
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,500
Like an Instagram wall, but on your actual wall

654
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,060
You want a wall that's 100% painting penetration

655
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,260
There's not one bit of wall not used by Michael Ferraris

656
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,960
Of course there is because there's a grid, Scott, listen to me

657
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,780
The grid is the delineation between the paintings

658
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,240
Take a suck of the tail, you're coming in hot

659
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,480
I'm the host of this show

660
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,200
You're in my home

661
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,440
This vibe is where I live

662
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,940
If we're saying vibes then in some broad context maybe

663
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,400
But this is my garage

664
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,100
I am like, my wife had to park on the street

665
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,240
We had to move our whole process had to happen so you could be in my home

666
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,940
Wait, you kick your wife out of the garage so you can do this?

667
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,180
She just has to like step away from her child and go move the car

668
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,560
Which is a little bit of hassle for her

669
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,900
It's not a big deal, I'm just saying

670
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,420
It's one of the little things that lets us do this podcast

671
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,300
Do this, your wife has to move her car and stop being a mom for a bit

672
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,080
That's what you're telling me to happen

673
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,420
That is what the cost of doing podcast the ride is

674
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,060
I know it's not that crazy

675
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:28,740
I prepare the room for you guys to come over

676
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,740
We move the cars, I sweep some of the leaves out of the way

677
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,420
It's not hard to be ripped off by this guy

678
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,120
I'm just saying as someone who is famously labeled as a deadbeat

679
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,680
I think, you know, look in the mirror mon frere

680
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,780
Because like, I would never, if I had a wife, I would never tell her

681
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,940
You do have a wife

682
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:55,000
If I had a wife, if I had a wife, if Jenny calls me, if I had a wife

683
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,700
Listen, I would never be like, you need to stop being a mom

684
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,780
So I can talk about Vivo Italian Kitchen

685
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,720
Wait, so this is how I provide for my family

686
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,140
You're going to question the kind of man I am, the kind of husband I am, the kind of father I am

687
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,720
This is making, where are we?

688
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,440
Let's not talk about that, let's not get into specifics

689
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,140
Can I borrow like,

690
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,060
It's nowhere near powerball money, that'll tell you that

691
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:22,420
Well no, but you got like, you got like 1500 bucks?

692
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,200
Not for that, we will give you a small guest fee, but it's not going to be that much

693
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:34,400
You can get a Margot Robbie autographed Iron Studios Suicide Scott Harley Quinn 12 inch statue for like $14.

694
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:34,800
99.

695
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,320
99

696
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,880
That's far above what we've given the most famous guest ever to be on this show

697
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,420
We've never gone into that dirt

698
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,980
You keep formatting it

699
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,640
Bobby Moynihan probably

700
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,140
QVC type prices formatting

701
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,260
I don't write what's on the card, it says $14.

702
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:51,700
99.

703
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,200
99

704
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,060
That's how you save almost $1500

705
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:02,060
Well look, I'm kind of coming around, because if I'm getting the Anne Hathaway Catwoman

706
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,520
I'm going to need the Tom Hardy

707
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,720
Should we stop for a sec?

708
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,240
Yeah sure

709
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:09,740
I guess

710
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,940
Hi, how you doing?

711
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,260
Yeah

712
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,440
I don't know if, we might need to just do a hard edit there

713
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,340
If you just start a harder edit than we would usually do, here's what happened

714
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,700
We've been recording in my garage

715
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,120
For this kind of this whole series

716
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,860
And for the first time ever

717
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:33,340
You know cars go through the alley here and there

718
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,520
Poor paws here and there

719
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah

720
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,360
Well for a truck to go by or whatever

721
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,720
But for the first time ever there was a police car

722
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,440
There was a Burbank police car

723
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,500
At Burbank PD

724
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,020
And the car pulls up and says

725
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,460
Are you guys making a bunch of noise back here?

726
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,260
And we said, well we're podcasting

727
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,400
And then the police officer said

728
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,940
Are you doing a lot of yelling and swearing?

729
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,660
No, I believe that throwing a party, screaming and cursing

730
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,460
Screaming and cursing

731
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,860
Thank you for clarifying Venice Beach

732
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:11,020
Because you've got to be careful, you've got to like

733
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,520
You've got to, the details are important

734
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,460
You've got to remember everything, you've been through this

735
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,640
This has happened to you I'm sure

736
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,160
Yeah, you're being hassled constantly by the cops

737
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,380
This guy's been detained more than anyone I know

738
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,220
That's my home man, that's my vibe

739
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:29,060
One of his auras is the Venice police station

740
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,520
Basically that was, we got the police called on us

741
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,140
And when the call said that we were screaming

742
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,000
The podcast arrived first, the police were called on podcast

743
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,080
This is true, by the way, this is not K-Fame, this is real

744
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,400
You can all attest this actually just happened

745
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,220
This is absolutely real, this absolutely did happen

746
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:48,980
The aura

747
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:54,380
We suspect it is because Michael was talking too much about sucking his own dick

748
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,580
I told you, I told you to get it under control

749
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,260
You did, but yeah, you're right

750
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,840
I don't want to go blaming here

751
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:07,400
But yes, I'm a little agitated because this is by the way, Mr.

752
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,120
Keeper

753
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,820
My home

754
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,640
That's what I said

755
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,640
My home

756
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,860
Something tells me that if the police had come up and said

757
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:18,120
If they had asked you, you wouldn't have suddenly said, yeah, this is where I live because it's my vibe

758
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,920
I was about to, but you said it first

759
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,120
You didn't let me take that first

760
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,420
Sure, sure, you were going to tell the police something about vibe

761
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,140
That wouldn't have been suspicious whatsoever

762
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,620
I don't tell the police anything

763
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,600
That's actually smart, yeah, that is probably

764
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,000
I don't know how to handle the police, we're good boys

765
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,060
This is where I live

766
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,020
You show up for one episode and the police arrive

767
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,660
This is why Jason never wanted to record at City Walk

768
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,340
This is exactly what he thought would happen

769
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,380
That's right, he did call it

770
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,560
When he got really upset several times, one of which was counterpoint you were wrong

771
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,200
Yeah, right

772
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,880
Suddenly, now I understand

773
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,360
Now I understand what this was all about

774
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,300
Jason was right

775
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:59,700
I haven't even figured out what triptychs I need for my dark knight

776
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,980
You know, I know I need

777
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,560
Michael Ferrari triptych

778
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,680
Okay, let's walk through it

779
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,440
We're doing Catwoman obviously

780
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,940
Yeah, and Halfway Catwoman, Christian Bale, Batman I'm assuming

781
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:12,600
How about like, let's jump franchise, right?

782
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,660
Okay, yeah

783
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:18,200
Let's, maybe the third one is Margot Robbie Harley Quinn

784
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,420
It's right there, of course

785
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,200
Can I just say one more thing about Burbank PD?

786
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,460
What just happened, yeah

787
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,320
Just one observation

788
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,300
Because my back was to them and then I turned around

789
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,600
The look on their faces when they thought they were being called to a party

790
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,900
And they saw maybe the dorkiest fucking thing they've ever seen in their life

791
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,880
Was the five of us sitting recording a business

792
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,080
Little lawn chairs

793
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,740
This singular moment made them question their careers more than anything that has ever happened before

794
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,440
There was like a deflated like, oh, what is this?

795
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,280
They were looking for it, they wanted to shove some faces into the pavement

796
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,360
They were going to go hippie busting today

797
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,960
And they were like giving us the answers to the test

798
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,640
They said, was anybody screaming in person?

799
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,560
And we said, well, I don't know, it's just this, you're looking at it, it's a podcast

800
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:17,360
They're like, okay, so you did not, there is not a loud party happening here

801
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,140
And like, yes, that is correct

802
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,900
And they're kind of like winking and smiling

803
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,720
They filled in that sheet for us

804
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,860
It's like, if you want to come to the party, subscribe to the second gay man

805
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,780
The party's behind the paywall, mon frÃ¨re

806
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,020
That's where all the best parties are, you gotta pay to play

807
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,840
This has never happened, by the way, I just want to say the Venice Beach Port

808
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,380
This never happened before, you're the reason

809
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:48,680
This happened, it changed the vibe, we're all yelling about dick sucking

810
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:54,020
Don't read a view pointing at me, I did not bring up the dick sucking

811
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,780
You have this whole thing

812
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,620
I'm just saying you inspired me

813
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,420
Hold on, is this recorded?

814
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,220
Yeah, it is recorded

815
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,160
Then we're gonna run it back and check

816
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,840
I just admitted it, so I don't know what we need to do

817
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,820
We already had the stuff for the police, we're not gonna go back and check the tape

818
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,460
We can look at it later

819
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,820
What is this, a goddamn Geico commercial running it back?

820
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,560
You were talking, it wasn't sex, but you were talking about drugs

821
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,500
That added to the agitation, I think, about smoking

822
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:29,660
You cannot stress enough that marijuana is legal in the state of California, you fucking narc

823
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,960
Okay, that's true

824
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,620
I'm gonna pin you on legal substances

825
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:37,400
After we drank so many Pappy Van Winkles together and followed it up with cucumber coolers

826
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,920
and followed it up with teeny paninis

827
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,000
We should remember about it, having the drinks and the teeny paninis

828
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,220
But he lied about who was paying for it

829
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,880
That's true, but I had a good time

830
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,940
I did not lie, Sectorkeeper is and did pay for it

831
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,560
What is the issue here?

832
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,940
I think, honestly, the Pappy Van Winkle, that was expensive

833
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:02,120
But his teeny panini, as he calls it, I feel like it bounces out because it was a smaller sandwich

834
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,540
It was quite small

835
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:07,920
It's much smaller than you think it would be when you order a panini sandwich

836
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,620
Then we got so many rounds of that

837
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,480
Remember the Straccino Crescenza bread?

838
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,060
You kept saying, more Crescenza bread

839
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,360
More Straccino Crescenza bread

840
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,060
What is that?

841
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,160
It's like a bread

842
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,560
That's also a Viva?

843
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,640
It's bread and oil and it's nice

844
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,220
You could have had some of you answered your phone

845
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,220
Boo boo boo

846
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:32,360
I'm sorry, I'm lonely and spending all my money on rubber ducks

847
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,660
It's the most tense, I was feeling so tense before even the police presence

848
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,200
Even a nice police presence

849
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,700
Let's do a guided exercise where we all relax a little bit

850
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,920
That's a smart idea

851
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,560
This is Venice already

852
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,500
Let's get some Venice vibes going, let's get Titanic Boutique going out here

853
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,340
Everyone close your eyes

854
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,860
I want you to just picture a big blank space

855
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:04,100
A big white void, very heaven plus-ish if you know the way to go

856
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:09,300
I want you to start filling in that white void with little dots of colors

857
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,900
I want you to let those little dots of colors take the shape of a face

858
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,080
Take the shape of the face of Jaddy's little monster

859
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,900
There she is, it's a Michael Ferrari Margot Roe

860
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,500
It has only 20.

861
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,000
49

862
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,900
God damn it, all you think about, even your little exercises are just Michael Ferrari

863
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,460
But don't you feel good now?

864
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,280
I do feel better at least

865
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,660
You seem preoccupied

866
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,740
No one says prices like 24.

867
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,900
99, 99 to say $2500

868
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,880
I don't think these paintings are good

869
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,400
There was something I was supposed to keep my lips zipped about

870
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,460
But I'm going to say it

871
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:59,060
I watched this guy buy a Michael Ferrari of Ray Charles signed by Jamie Foxx

872
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:09,600
He bought it and took it home with him for only $1,999.

873
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:09,940
99

874
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,820
No I did not, I said I took it home for $10.

875
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,240
99.

876
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:13,940
99

877
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,900
My Michael Ferrari, my Michael Ferrari of Ray Charles

878
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,060
What am I supposed to do, get it signed by Ray Charles?

879
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,520
Well you could actually because you have access to heaven

880
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,880
Yeah but you can't use a pen up there

881
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,700
Oh is that true?

882
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,380
Can't get drunk, can't use a pen

883
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,480
Probably autograph something with your own tail I bet

884
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,200
Maybe, I don't know, I wouldn't know

885
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,020
Do you hang out with these guys all the time?

886
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,320
I mean

887
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,980
Because these two seem like pervs

888
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,480
This one seems okay

889
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,560
He was pointing to Jason when he said this one seems okay

890
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,440
Jason's the perviest of the three of us

891
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,820
Jason's the most perviest there is

892
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,360
There's a time and a place

893
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:01,020
Jason's tale was when you pointed at both of them and called him a perv his smile got bigger

894
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,920
His heart grew three sizes

895
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:07,100
He just did this in an episode, we recorded an episode recently

896
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:12,800
We were talking about what if we were in a tunnel of love with a mirrored ceiling and you could watch your friends making out

897
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,700
That's what he said, Jason

898
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,180
His tongue went out when he just thought of this idea

899
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,200
It's a cartoon wolf

900
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,020
Well it's there for a reason

901
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,740
But there isn't there, there wouldn't be a mirror

902
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,740
You put it there, now you're watching your friends make out

903
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:32,600
Tunnel of love has got to have the mirrored ceiling otherwise how can you see your friends make out and put out your tongue like a big wolf that just saw a cartoon hand?

904
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,300
Yeah, see how the other people live

905
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:39,880
There's barely tunnels of love, there certainly aren't any with mirrors on the ceiling, there doesn't gotta be any

906
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,460
Yeah, hall of tunnels of love of mirrors

907
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,980
It's like Tommy Lee's tunnel of love

908
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,140
Oh he's cool

909
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,140
Or Nicky Six

910
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:52,780
You don't like Tommy Lee, you're trying to impress the Venice Beach border, you're trying to get into his vibe

911
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,320
You've never said a positive word about Tommy Lee in your life

912
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,480
He likes two musical artists, the New Pornographers and Lawrence Welk

913
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,000
These are the only two he cares about

914
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,780
Well it's very theatrical, they both went on a hell of a show

915
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,380
I don't disagree with that

916
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:15,360
Jason what would you do if the New Pornographers played a set on Lawrence Welk while he blew bubbles?

917
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:22,360
Well you'd have to get him down from heaven, it's Lawrence Welk a keeper

918
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,700
Oh yeah yeah yeah

919
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,620
Did he die at a mall?

920
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:31,740
There are these things, there are Welk resorts, that is a place you can go, there's a golf course and little shops

921
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,320
So that is something that we could do

922
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:39,840
So that means therefore there would be, you'll probably get hit up by the Welk keeper in the next couple months

923
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,200
Trying to take you for more of that duck money

924
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,180
The new Lawrence Welk show, Roku channel exclusive

925
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,700
Wait you're saying the ghost is hosting?

926
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,820
Yeah the ghost is trying to get some startup money for production

927
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,000
The ghost is hosting is a good catch line

928
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,620
Yeah that is

929
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,000
Is that what it's called?

930
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,360
Yeah a catch line

931
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,920
A catch line?

932
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,600
I guess that's like what Mom would call it I think

933
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,140
A tag line that is a catch phrase

934
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,040
It's both of them

935
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:12,320
What I was trying to tell you is that he said Sgt.

936
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,860
Cooper would happily pay for this

937
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:18,140
You bought him a painting of Ray Charles signed by Jamie Foxx

938
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,560
And now that I know what actually happened I don't think that's right

939
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,140
This is my afterlife story right now

940
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,160
Thank you

941
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,240
I'm just, yeah I mean we'll figure it out

942
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,640
We're just two good friends figuring it out

943
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,660
Can I say that the people who worked in Celebrity Authentics were very nice

944
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:42,380
But they were really desperate to have somebody purchase something

945
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:46,280
Aggressive as if they all worked on commission which cannot be the case

946
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:51,520
Everybody was acting as if no one has bought anything yet in the first few months of operation

947
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,400
Someone walked up to me and I was, I just, for approximately two seconds

948
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,940
I had been looking at a BB-8 that was signed by all Star Wars participants except the people who voiced BB-8

949
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:03,300
Right

950
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,600
But it was like 17 other people

951
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,460
Nothing to do with BB-8

952
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,540
No actors, I think mostly we think crew right?

953
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,080
Yeah a lot of names I had never seen before in my life

954
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,160
But no there was like Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley

955
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,840
But I've been looking at it for two seconds and then somebody comes up like you must be a Star Wars fan

956
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:26,560
And I'm like sure and she says what's it gonna take for me to get you a

957
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,540
What's it gonna take?

958
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:34,120
Yeah she did like a car dealership line but about a $7000 signed BB-8

959
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,980
At CityWalk Hollywood?

960
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,080
Yes, it seems like you can haggle at CityWalk

961
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:46,160
It's ridiculous because for like less than half of that you can get any of the Michael Ferrari art for that

962
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,360
Well that's true yeah

963
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,780
I do, I don't love it but I like it more than this expensive ass BB-8

964
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,620
What's the most expensive thing there?

965
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,560
It might be that, $7000 BB-8

966
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,160
And then I was like does anyone buy this?

967
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,720
And she says oh mostly like the frames, see those frames?

968
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,540
Check out those frames

969
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:08,940
But then she said that somebody like, I don't know this guy did walk out here with a bunch of stuff

970
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,280
Including one of those BB-8s and he had to get a car to come here and pick it up

971
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,780
Because he had to take all that back to the Philippines with him

972
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:15,940
That was him

973
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,480
Oh that was him?

974
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:22,880
Yeah I mean like the guy that I got it from was from the Philippines but yeah

975
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,380
The Philippines keeper

976
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,460
Oh the whole country?

977
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,840
They just have one keeper

978
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,640
Oh wow okay

979
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,300
Well he picked it up for me, well I'm not gonna go get it

980
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,700
I don't have room in my van for a Michael Ferrari, it's full

981
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,360
What's it full of?

982
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,660
$50,000 that I got from this other lady

983
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,760
In cash?

984
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,240
Yeah in pennies

985
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,160
Pennies?

986
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,060
Yeah

987
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,600
I don't even know, could that have fit in a car?

988
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,980
Yeah how could that fit in a shoebox?

989
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,200
But it blows the tires

990
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,400
It's too heavy

991
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,080
It's riding low

992
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:56,600
So do you like, it's like it's over a float so like pennies are spilling out as you drive your van with no wheels down the street?

993
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,920
Yeah you're picturing it correctly

994
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:06,720
Okay so just the axles are grinding on the pavement and then pennies are spewing out of the car, the windows

995
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,400
Like someone's trying to move Scrooge McDuck's pool, yeah

996
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,600
The money bin is like being moved but by one single van

997
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,820
Okay it seems I don't know why you're doing it

998
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,860
Well what am I supposed to do, take it to a bank?

999
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,220
You can't trust banks, you gotta keep your money on you

1000
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,640
So you have a bank on wheels?

1001
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,060
Oh not wheels but

1002
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,660
I have cash on hand, yeah on rims at this point

1003
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,700
And he's not FDIC insured, he'll tell you he is

1004
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,720
Never, you can't make me get FDIC insured

1005
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,300
Yeah you hate the FDIC, I heard that, I didn't know that about you already

1006
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,660
He waged a Twitter war on the FDIC

1007
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,900
Yeah back when it was still Twitter

1008
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,740
At FDIC, you're talking to the guy doing the FDIC's Twitter account

1009
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:46,980
Does not like me

1010
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,300
Did you do this back when you were alive or when you were a ghost?

1011
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,380
No, ghost

1012
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:51,480
Okay

1013
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,540
The police are gonna be back here for one reason or another

1014
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:01,280
If it wasn't gonna be for the noise, for the screaming and the dick sucking

1015
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,140
It's gonna be on behalf of the FDIC

1016
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,700
How much longer can we keep this guy here?

1017
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,120
I don't know, FDIC is federal, the cops wouldn't show up

1018
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:16,360
You know what's crazy sector keeper is that this one is where after all this talk of horrible restaurants that made us sick

1019
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,200
This one is the one where there's a place called Big Fire

1020
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,980
It just is good, we went there, it's a really good restaurant

1021
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,580
I tell you it's a Pacific Northwest vibe

1022
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,600
This is in Orlando

1023
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,800
Big Fires

1024
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,040
Here we all are

1025
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,080
Look at us, yeah with the level keeper

1026
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,200
The level keeper's there

1027
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,320
How much do you miss the level keeper right now?

1028
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,040
Night and day compared to this dude

1029
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,780
He's a good boy, he's a good boy

1030
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:41,760
Why are you talking about me like this in my own home, in this vibe where I live?

1031
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,600
Because the police were here

1032
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,080
Not because of me, because of this degenerate over here

1033
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,360
We've done plenty of open door episodes where Mike said weird stuff

1034
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,040
I've said weird stuff a lot

1035
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,960
You know what always happens, it's always like, we'll talk about some rollercoaster, I went on Viper and I like the way Viper felts me up

1036
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,120
Viper really felt me up, Mike will say

1037
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:05,320
And then I'll say that's the weirdest phrasing I've ever heard and you'll act aghast

1038
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,680
Like that's an adorable thing to say and then we start screaming about that

1039
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,540
But the police have never caught me in one of those instances

1040
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:15,500
I get, my voice gets very loud when I start talking about Chase Meridian from Batman Forever

1041
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,580
And that, this has never happened before

1042
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:23,840
Yeah, I don't know, VPB, you're just doing something to this aura

1043
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:27,040
Like the air is just crackling with energy

1044
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,760
Look, I can't help it, I'm electric, that's just who I am

1045
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,200
Scott just seems really like irritated

1046
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,700
And I'm really irritated

1047
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:40,880
Finally, after all these, day after day, we've talked about these awful restaurants

1048
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,700
And then here's one finally that was like, this is great

1049
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,800
By the way, if you're ever going to City Park Orlando, this is a great restaurant

1050
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,180
Finally, we found one, we found a good one

1051
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,080
Here's what's funny, I like everything, I like Antejitos a lot

1052
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,020
I've gone to Antejitos multiple times

1053
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,780
That's, I don't want to be mean to my beloved Margaritaville

1054
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:02,040
But like, sometimes just going to that bar to have a drink before you go to the park or go to Horror Nights is just what you want

1055
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,400
I love Antejitos, it's maybe better

1056
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,860
Table side guac, at least the Orlando at Alpha is awesome

1057
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:11,080
Big fire, good, great, good to great

1058
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,300
And then we feel this energy, like we're rushing through it

1059
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:18,080
And then Vivo, I had a calzone, it was too big, I ate all of it though because it was delicious

1060
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:22,060
And I added mushrooms to it, and it was not, they allowed me to add mushrooms to it

1061
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,440
I thought it paired well with the Crescenza bread

1062
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,040
It absolutely did, I mean they were very

1063
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,080
The Strattino Crescenza bread

1064
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:32,880
Strattino Crescenza bread is very similar to the calzone as well, it's like a bread and almost the same thing

1065
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:38,840
The Strattino Crescenza bread is bread folded over in a crescent shape with cheese in the middle

1066
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,660
Yes, that's true, I'm just saying

1067
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:41,840
That sounds like a calzone

1068
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,440
That does sound like a calzone

1069
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,320
It's very similar

1070
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:51,260
This guy's mansplaining over here about Crescenza bread and Michael Ferrari

1071
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,660
You just know everything about everything, don't you?

1072
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,180
Food and you're so cultured

1073
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,940
I've never seen this side of Scott

1074
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,460
I've never gotten mad on this part

1075
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,300
Never once

1076
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:06,540
BPD got called on the dang garage

1077
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:10,220
They do call the BPD on VBB, that does happen

1078
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:14,760
Well we're talking BB8 and the BPD comes out because you're BBB

1079
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:21,260
You're being a D, you're being a BD, a big dick

1080
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,260
What is with this podcast and talking about Ds?

1081
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,340
It's not something we normally do

1082
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:28,280
We're not, we're so clean boys

1083
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,420
Sectorkeeper said this is a place with good boys

1084
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,180
We're squeaking clean

1085
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:32,040
They are good boys

1086
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,260
You said you're going to have a good time, go

1087
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,060
This isn't Dull Boys

1088
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:39,020
You said just go to Vivo Italian Kitchen, it's on me, it's fine

1089
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,360
Drink all the happy fan winkle you want

1090
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,440
Follow it up with some cucumber coolers

1091
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,000
All the sizes for the entrees are normal

1092
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,680
And it turned out that some of those things were lies, but the food was fine

1093
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,200
I never said that

1094
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,060
Here's what I'll say, it's celebrity authentic

1095
00:51:55,060 --> 00:52:01,920
You can buy Laura Dern picture of Ali Sadler from Jurassic Park or Admiral Holdo from Last Jedi

1096
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,840
But they're the same price, they're both $399

1097
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:09,300
Do you guys think that depending on

1098
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,280
Or as you would say, $399

1099
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,320
$399, $399, $399

1100
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,800
Do you guys think that somebody's maybe iconic role should be more

1101
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:22,700
I'm not saying Holdo isn't iconic to some, but I think Ali Sadler is probably more famous role

1102
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:27,720
Here's the thing though, what you don't know is that both of those people are played by the same actor

1103
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:33,020
It seemed like he'd set that up, it seemed like he did explain that

1104
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,080
But then there, but hold on though

1105
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:39,640
There are so many unsigned pictures of Justin Long you can also buy

1106
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:46,300
There are a lot of Justin Long pictures there that you can buy

1107
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,380
I had missed that, wow

1108
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,760
In the J section, in that part of your shelves you pull out

1109
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,800
There's a lot, okay, there's a lot of Julie Newmar

1110
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,960
Who's Catwoman on the 60s badminton show and there's a lot of Justin Longs

1111
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,660
I wish there was a Michael Ferrari, Julie Newmar

1112
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,040
I could put it next to Ian Hathaway

1113
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,980
He's still a lot, you could get him to commission one, I think it'd probably be pricier

1114
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,540
You won't return a single one of my calls or emails?

1115
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,820
Oh wow, is he, what is his also like a beep beep beep

1116
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,440
Yeah, what does it sound like

1117
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:17,500
This number formerly belonging to Michael Ferrari doesn't work anymore

1118
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,100
I just emailed at michaelferrari.

1119
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:20,820
com

1120
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:24,260
I don't have any reason to know what his email is

1121
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,800
Just an ad with no start?

1122
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,260
Yeah, you're not gonna get a hold of him if it's like an email

1123
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:29,780
What do you mean?

1124
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,940
It's probably like michael at michaelferrari.

1125
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:34,560
com

1126
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,520
Well his name's not Michael, Michael Ferrari

1127
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,600
Well that is a fair point

1128
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,320
Jason's middle name is Michael?

1129
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,980
That is true, my middle name is Michael

1130
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,140
Yes, and his name is Michael

1131
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,340
And my name is Michael too

1132
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,260
And his name is Michael's first name

1133
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,480
My middle name's Beach

1134
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,260
Oh is it really?

1135
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,680
It's not just a designation, you just are Venice Beach Boardwalk

1136
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,180
Well it's my whole identity, so you know, identity, name

1137
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,920
I guess it gets into what you think a name is

1138
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,940
Do you like live in a domicile there?

1139
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,980
Do you, to start using these cop terms

1140
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:13,100
Do you like have a roof over your head or do you just go sleep on the beach wherever you find?

1141
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:17,580
I mean, Van's got a roof but like my home is my vibe, so I'm home now

1142
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,040
This is Scott's garage

1143
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,420
That's right, that's right, okay

1144
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:28,880
But normally, like, yeah, I'll sleep under the stars, I'll sleep under the sand

1145
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,280
I'll sleep in the van

1146
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,880
It doesn't really matter

1147
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,020
I'll sleep on the roof of Celebrity Authentics

1148
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,000
Did you do that that night we were there?

1149
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:39,620
Well yeah, just to see if they were getting any new Michael Ferraris in from the shipment

1150
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:43,420
Because they don't reload that thing in the middle of the day, they wait for like after hours

1151
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:46,220
Because they know their prime heist location

1152
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:50,760
Well because they got a big Brinks truck with armed guards loading in the new Ferraris

1153
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:55,220
Loading in the Ferraris and the big sort of like half bust of Predator

1154
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,240
Just like the top half of Predator

1155
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:04,600
You don't want the whole Predator because you never know when that could come to life

1156
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,040
Yeah, if my Predator comes to life I want it to have no legs

1157
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,580
Because then at least I know

1158
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,160
You got a little bit more of a chance

1159
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,800
I got a radius where I'm safe

1160
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,620
He still has gauntlets on his wrists though that could shoot things

1161
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:19,440
Don't get me wrong, Predator even with no legs is going to be hard to put down

1162
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,080
But legs in his game over

1163
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:26,420
There is like probably more like a 30% chance that you could defeat the Predator if he had no legs

1164
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:30,500
This is all contingent upon of course the bust coming to life and attacking the Predator

1165
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,080
That hasn't been in a film as far as I know

1166
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,060
Although maybe one day

1167
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:39,400
If they made a film of that there would be ample Michael Ferraris paintings about that

1168
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,620
That's true, yeah

1169
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,460
Alien vs Predator vs another Predator with no legs

1170
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,620
I know who my bet's not on

1171
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,840
What about Adam Driver's

1172
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,580
Didn't he make a Ferrari movie?

1173
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,440
What if you combine that with Predator?

1174
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,080
Am I wrong?

1175
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,060
No, that's out now

1176
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,160
That's out right now

1177
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,200
For Ford vs Ferrari?

1178
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,480
Ford vs Ferrari vs Ferrari

1179
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,560
That was older

1180
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,500
As tributed in a painting by Michael Ferrari

1181
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,460
Yeah, Ford vs Ferrari

1182
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:09,800
A car racing against another car against a Pennsylvania based artist

1183
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,320
So he himself is in it

1184
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,980
And he's racing on foot?

1185
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,720
Yeah, he's running fast

1186
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,780
Is he painting while he's running?

1187
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,020
I don't know

1188
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:21,720
I don't like the questions your friends ask

1189
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,220
Could he have some sort of a rig?

1190
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,320
What the show is?

1191
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,300
It's an interview

1192
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,300
It's a discussion

1193
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,980
Everybody else is totally fine with the basics of what it is

1194
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:33,120
Boys, boys, boys, boys, boys

1195
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:34,880
Yeah

1196
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,160
What else was in the sector?

1197
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,340
I don't remember anymore

1198
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,980
Well, Big Part, Anahito's

1199
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,620
I think it was a good smoked old fashioned

1200
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:44,200
It was great

1201
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,440
I don't feel like there's any place

1202
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,880
We got a video of Scott's Kooky drink

1203
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,080
Yeah, you got a little presentation there

1204
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:50,700
Better days

1205
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,260
Big Fire feels like you're going to like it

1206
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,280
That's like a thing you would celebrate with a family

1207
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:57,380
That's a legit place

1208
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:58,600
In Orlando

1209
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,640
Fire Grilled Chicken on the Cob

1210
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,540
It was a little dry, I'll say that

1211
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:03,980
Chicken on the Cob?

1212
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:06,040
I had a Cob Salad

1213
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,980
I am on that

1214
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,240
I could go for some Chicken on the Cob right now

1215
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,940
Just a bunch of corn is wrapped in chicken

1216
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,320
You throw that into fire

1217
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,060
Maybe you got a little bonfire going

1218
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,980
Drizzle a bud light on there

1219
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,720
That's Sunday night, baby

1220
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,440
I like the idea that Jason when he has a drumstick

1221
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,700
He calls it Chicken on the Cob

1222
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,400
Any food that you gnaw off of a food is on the Cob

1223
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,880
He spins it around

1224
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,940
Everything should have Cob though

1225
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,660
I agree, yeah

1226
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,380
Popsicles on a Cob

1227
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,640
Pops on the Cob

1228
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,800
If you need a Popsicle like

1229
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,660
Corn on the Cob ever?

1230
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,580
Does anybody do that?

1231
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:43,060
Jason?

1232
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,560
You got a Bomb Pop and you just eat it sort of

1233
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,980
I feel like then my left hand gets sticky

1234
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,360
The right hand

1235
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,060
You need two sticks now

1236
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,860
Or you need to sort of like

1237
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,600
Proceed in the Popsicle eating to the point

1238
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,540
Where you've got the top stick popping out

1239
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,500
Bite off the top

1240
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,900
Or you can bite it off you little freak

1241
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,140
Yeah, you could do that too

1242
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,600
You were the one who suggested it

1243
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,300
No I didn't, I said eat it normal

1244
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,360
You can swirl your little ghost tail into a little

1245
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,500
Like a soft serve and eat it

1246
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,480
Oh now we're talking

1247
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,100
If everybody starts yelling about

1248
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,240
Bite off the top

1249
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,000
You start screaming about it, the cops are going to be

1250
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,640
Right back here

1251
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,480
Jason's getting his phone out

1252
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,960
Jason what are you dialing?

1253
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,060
He's just talking about using your tail

1254
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:28,680
As a soft serve

1255
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,420
There's going to be trouble if they call him again

1256
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,380
The one time they let it slide

1257
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,300
They helped us out, but if they're back here

1258
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,100
And they know that this guy is like

1259
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:37,880
I mean I have

1260
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,460
The fact that you have the Ferrari

1261
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:42,080
Delivery schedule memorized

1262
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,600
You know that they show it when they show up

1263
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,600
In the middle of the night

1264
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,640
What if the whole thing even going up there

1265
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,060
He was probably trying to get us to be part of his

1266
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:51,820
Ferrari heist

1267
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,300
You were scoping the joint guys

1268
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,420
I can't stress this enough

1269
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,580
I don't need to steal Ferraris

1270
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,480
If you give me another

1271
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,800
$50,000

1272
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,100
Did you zell him?

1273
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:05,160
Did you spend that $50,000

1274
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,380
He zelled you 30 minutes ago

1275
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:11,500
I zelled you $50,000

1276
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,880
What's the format of that?

1277
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:18,820
Maybe he wanted $49,999

1278
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,280
$99,999

1279
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,720
I'm going to re-zell

1280
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,100
$49,999

1281
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,080
$999.

1282
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:25,600
99

1283
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,100
I'm going to keep the first one

1284
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,760
Or you want me to send it back?

1285
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,020
No, you don't have to send it back

1286
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:31,760
What are you doing?

1287
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:32,940
Stand up for yourself

1288
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:33,780
Sector keeper?

1289
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,920
I'm a ghost, I'm invertebrate

1290
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,320
Sector keeper

1291
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,980
You look like

1292
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,340
Grey ET, white ET

1293
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,440
He's getting weak

1294
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,420
He's coming over here

1295
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:48,960
After the record I'm going to end up

1296
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,280
Getting a phone call from Jenny his wife

1297
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:53,160
So he's married

1298
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,100
Not my wife

1299
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,400
Is he married to a human woman who's alive?

1300
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,060
She won't call me back, she's not my wife

1301
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:00,040
That's legal

1302
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,720
Why don't you call her?

1303
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,540
You should call her then

1304
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:04,700
I did call her, that's what I'm saying

1305
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,920
She doesn't call me back, she's not my wife

1306
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:10,560
Were you married before you were a ghost or did you meet her when you were a ghost?

1307
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,300
You can't legally ask me that

1308
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,080
Oh, okay

1309
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,400
Alright

1310
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,820
I can answer though

1311
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:19,900
He was a ghost and they got married

1312
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,440
Thank you, he can tell you

1313
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,080
I'm not allowed to tell you

1314
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,800
I can be the conduit

1315
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,880
How old is the wife?

1316
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:29,500
The wife?

1317
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,780
In her 40

1318
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,220
Alright, well

1319
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,540
Wait, are you a boy?

1320
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,620
Are you like a boy?

1321
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,440
Cause he's a boy

1322
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,820
Do you think I have a boy's taste in art?

1323
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,300
Do you think a boy would love the art of Michael Ferrari?

1324
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,380
I could see it

1325
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:47,320
If I was a boy I might like the art of Michael Ferrari

1326
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,620
That's my vibe

1327
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,580
That's my age, that's my home

1328
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,500
So the answer to that is

1329
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,800
He's 52 but he tells people he's 39

1330
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,780
Okay, so he is like age appropriate

1331
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:00,920
But most of those years were since I've ghosted

1332
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:06,080
He's the only ghost I know that has a leathery suntan

1333
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,220
You look discut

1334
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:08,720
You barely even look like a ghost

1335
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,200
I'm the only ghost that works on it

1336
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,840
You gotta put in the work for tan

1337
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,120
It doesn't just happen

1338
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:19,140
You lay around and wait for some other guy to show up and pay for all your Ferraris

1339
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:24,120
He seemed to have a real problem with me for someone that drank a lot of Happy Van Winkle and cucumber coolers

1340
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:30,360
I do cause you misrepresented the permission of where it was coming from

1341
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,120
He's not mad at you, look at this guy

1342
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,540
He's got no beef with you

1343
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:34,340
No, with me?

1344
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:39,800
What he doesn't, VVB will never understand boys is that

1345
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:44,100
There are riffs currently in the multiverse

1346
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,120
And you start throwing back Pappy's

1347
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,400
Pappy might come for us

1348
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,900
Oh now we have to worry about Pappy?

1349
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:55,700
Yes, you may have summoned Pappy

1350
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:59,380
The actual Pappy Van Winkle if it's named after

1351
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:02,260
Who do you think Pappy Van Winkle?

1352
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,580
The tail of Van Winkle, time

1353
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,440
He is Rip Van Winkle

1354
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,160
Is he Rip Van Winkle's father?

1355
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:12,220
Yes, obviously

1356
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:13,680
Obviously my god

1357
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,680
I didn't know that

1358
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,380
I don't know

1359
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:19,360
I want to drink that sweet sweet time whiskey

1360
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,340
Now it all makes sense

1361
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:24,620
That's why Scott's getting worked up, you're feeling a shift

1362
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:27,120
Because the whole, look

1363
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:31,480
We've been doing these, some of this has nothing to do with you Venice Beach BoardWalkkeeper

1364
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:32,860
We've been doing this series

1365
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:34,860
I'm just coming in with like

1366
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:37,640
First I'm like, hey we're done with Buffett

1367
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,120
And a bunch more Buffett stuff

1368
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,060
And then like, and now I'm getting hit with all this

1369
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:45,360
And I find out that all that whiskey was like an abuse of the goodwill

1370
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:49,160
Of my, this is the keeper I have a relationship with

1371
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,500
You, I thought I knew it and you lied to me

1372
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,840
You know what I will, in comparison

1373
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,680
We're best friends

1374
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:59,620
In this moment that's how I feel

1375
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,240
He's my best friend

1376
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,160
And you are abusing this guy

1377
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:07,560
That's okay, but by the trend of property you are also my best friend

1378
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,360
Oh shit

1379
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,060
No what so, this is stupid math

1380
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:12,340
And the beginning is the end

1381
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,960
I don't agree with any of this

1382
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,400
And then just like, and then

1383
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,040
This is your home, this is your vibe

1384
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,580
And on top of all of it like

1385
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:25,580
We have never gotten an answer of how many of these sectors we're gonna do

1386
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:29,560
I'd be fine adding celebrity authentics in whatever we want

1387
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,180
As long as I knew there was a light at the end of the tunnel

1388
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,980
We the listeners, nobody knows how many

1389
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:37,520
How are we, is this gonna be 45 days?

1390
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,840
Is it gonna be 70 days?

1391
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:40,900
Scott, sector keeper actually told me before we were recording

1392
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,660
They just opened a universal monster tribute store at Hollywood

1393
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:45,640
Literally yesterday, so I was gonna, like

1394
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:46,900
He said we're gonna have to do that too

1395
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:49,580
No, no, we don't need to do that

1396
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:52,440
If the rift existed we can solve it without going there

1397
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,740
Best friend or no best friend

1398
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:56,660
I don't want it, how many of the, how much more can we possibly add

1399
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:59,420
I got, hey listen, I know what you need to do

1400
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,240
Here's your out, you want it out?

1401
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:03,060
Here's your out

1402
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:05,340
You turn around, you walk away

1403
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,500
You walk into the sea my man

1404
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,420
You know what

1405
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,960
You come with me, you walk into the sea

1406
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,860
No one can get you in the sea

1407
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:15,840
No, no, no

1408
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:16,560
He's in your mind

1409
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,900
Scott hates it when you dare him to do things

1410
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,520
You know what, for the first time you've said something sensible

1411
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:23,400
That's right best friend

1412
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,180
You know, I actually, I think, I mean I don't know where it'll end up

1413
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:28,740
I don't know if I want to walk permanently into the sea

1414
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,660
I'm not sure if I'm at that level

1415
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:31,020
Okay

1416
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:33,160
Maybe a little ocean drive would sound good

1417
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:38,360
Maybe going in like, just, I think staring at the god damn ocean for a little bit

1418
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,380
Sounds spec-fucking-tacular

1419
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:40,680
No, no, no

1420
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,340
On this day where the fucking, the police showed up

1421
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:46,300
And I got a drifter here who won't leave my home

1422
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,560
Let's say that officially and I don't have any idea how long this show

1423
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,940
And like, and I don't, it's not all about the keepers

1424
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:54,780
Guys, you got, you could stop, you could, Jason and Mike

1425
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,500
You could help organize this thing

1426
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:01,220
Am I the only one who feels like this, this series is never gonna end

1427
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:05,160
Like we need to put some confines on this or we're never getting out of it

1428
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:10,000
Well, I mean I got some, a little bit of closure recently

1429
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,260
Because I thought Anahito's meal I had not too long ago

1430
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:15,540
Gave me a bit of a tummy ache

1431
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:19,420
And then I think it was actually the big Topo Chico I drank with it

1432
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:23,480
I don't think that's true because I got sick the same day as you, remember?

1433
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:27,280
Yeah, but then I had a Topo Chico somewhere else

1434
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,340
And I also got a bloated stomach ache

1435
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:31,660
So I'm willing to give Anahito's another chance

1436
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:32,880
I think

1437
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:36,720
You're going back, it's been off my list actually

1438
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,220
It makes me, it makes me sick once I'm done

1439
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:43,640
This podcast is making me sick and maybe I'm fucking done with this too

1440
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:47,520
Guys, I don't, you know what, I, going and taking a look at the ocean

1441
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,320
Sounds fucking great to me right now

1442
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,680
Wait, Scott, there's so many curses

1443
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:52,860
He's leaving

1444
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,860
Let me know when there's a sensible amount of sectors

1445
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:56,600
He's leaving

1446
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,940
He's leaving his own

1447
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:59,560
The Beach Boardwalk guy is gone

1448
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,380
He's leaving the Venice Beach Boardwalks house

1449
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:03,500
I'm taking some fucking time, okay?

1450
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:06,900
He's leaving

1451
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:11,820
In my house, in my house, don't fucking go another hour

1452
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:14,680
My wife has to come park here, you're fucking out

1453
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:15,400
Oh my god

1454
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,860
And now that was a lot of yelling and cursing

1455
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:18,740
That was he, yeah

1456
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:21,880
That could see why, how we would maybe get another call

1457
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,320
Well, that's never

1458
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,380
There's no party yet

1459
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:26,600
I was going to say that's never happened

1460
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,680
But I think it's actually happened once before

1461
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:32,300
And I think it's when I first started talking about Randy Gerber on this podcast

1462
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,100
Who's that?

1463
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,140
Cindy Crawford's husband, Randy Gerber

1464
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:39,880
He's sort of business partners with George Clooney for Casa Migos Tequila

1465
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,740
Oh yeah, I love to Migos, that's my home

1466
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:42,760
What did you call it?

1467
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:43,380
What did you call it?

1468
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:43,780
Migos?

1469
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:44,980
Well, Casa Migos

1470
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:46,840
Yeah, yeah, House Migos, my home, my life

1471
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,900
Did you call it House Migos?

1472
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,320
Yeah, that's what I'm saying, that's what it means, that's what Casa means

1473
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,500
Oh, I see, I see, yeah

1474
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,200
I just thought you were, I couldn't

1475
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,480
I almost pictured it H-A-U-S

1476
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,940
I can't believe Scott left

1477
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:00,320
He was talking about going into the ocean

1478
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:07,640
And he could have just waded around in that little body of water outside the Billabong store

1479
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,260
Yeah, because that, yeah

1480
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:10,500
Yeah, that's pretty calming

1481
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,220
Yeah, I got bad news for you, bud, though

1482
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:15,200
That's not like the ocean

1483
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:17,600
Well, but it's water, it's got water

1484
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,040
Oh, man

1485
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:22,040
Well, I hate to leave the listeners on such a bong

1486
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:25,860
Like, Scott usually does the outro, so I guess I'll do the outro

1487
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:26,440
I'll do it

1488
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,100
Sectorkeeper, did we finish the saga?

1489
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,460
Yeah, I'll do it

1490
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:34,360
Beer cheese fondue was good at pig fire

1491
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,460
Yeah, that was, yeah, we had that

1492
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:38,980
We did technically finish the sector

1493
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:39,560
Okay

1494
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,940
The stone is forming

1495
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:42,680
Okay, well, what is this?

1496
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,460
Bourbon cheese

1497
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:44,060
You look closely

1498
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,460
Is this stone bourbon cheese?

1499
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,060
Is that what you said?

1500
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,080
I'm sorry, Jason, what?

1501
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:52,000
You just said bourbon cheese, but he might have fallen asleep and had a brief dream

1502
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,100
I read my note, I said beer cheese, it was bourbon cheese

1503
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:59,740
Oh, I thought you kind of had it blacked out and you were just saying bourbon cheese

1504
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:00,400
Oh, no

1505
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,140
Oh, bourbon cheese

1506
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:03,020
Is this episode releasable?

1507
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:08,220
I mean, I think it has to be as far as our recording schedule is concerned

1508
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:09,700
Do you see something appearing?

1509
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,160
As long as the stone comes out, yeah, I think this episode is releasable

1510
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:18,620
It is appearing, it's many little stones, points that create a larger stone

1511
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:19,360
Wow

1512
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,300
Wow

1513
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:28,420
And it has the formation of a sinister lady by the name of Harley Quinn

1514
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:29,520
Oh, wow

1515
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,000
That is a monster

1516
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,960
And below it there's a price tag and it says $49.

1517
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,140
99.

1518
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,580
99

1519
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:40,060
This is the most expensive one yet

1520
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,480
Okay

1521
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,960
So that's, okay, you got this stone

1522
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,400
And it's signed by Josh Gadd

1523
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,420
What?

1524
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,060
Wait, hold on

1525
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,400
Why did Josh Gadd sign it?

1526
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:52,500
Why not?

1527
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:55,940
I didn't see any Gadd sign things in this place

1528
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:58,180
Everyone from the movie Pixels signed it

1529
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,500
Oh, is Marco Robbins Pixels?

1530
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,480
No, I don't think so

1531
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,760
She didn't sign this one but Josh Gadd did

1532
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:05,800
But Josh Gadd did

1533
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:09,520
Oh, okay, well, look, if that's what the stone is, that's what the stone is

1534
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,360
And what's it going to take for you to take this stone home today?

1535
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,020
I'll take it now

1536
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:17,960
Well, this is a different stone because we have to actually purchase this stone

1537
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:19,360
Unlike the others

1538
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,280
No, I got you, I got this one

1539
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,360
Because you just need $49.

1540
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:22,780
99.

1541
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:23,580
99, right?

1542
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:24,060
Yeah

1543
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,560
That's the first thing that he sent me so I'm good
