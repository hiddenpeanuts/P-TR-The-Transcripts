1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
FOREVER!

2
00:00:06,296 --> 00:00:11,376
Warning, unlike most things in the nation of Japan, this episode is anything but efficient.

3
00:00:11,936 --> 00:00:16,976
Not even all the hosts are by till the end. Set aside some time as Mike and Lindsay Katai

4
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:19,936
travel to Tokyo Disney on Podcast the Ride.

5
00:00:40,392 --> 00:00:42,812
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the theme park podcast

6
00:00:42,812 --> 00:00:45,492
that will tell you definitively how many days

7
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:48,012
you must spend at the Tokyo Disney Resort.

8
00:00:48,092 --> 00:00:50,592
The answer will be revealed

9
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,312
when we get to that part of the story.

10
00:00:52,372 --> 00:00:53,632
My name is Mike Carlson.

11
00:00:53,692 --> 00:00:54,972
What a tease, you guys.

12
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:57,212
Always joining me, Jason Sheridan.

13
00:00:57,392 --> 00:01:00,152
Yeah, I set that up so nicely.

14
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:01,192
Did you think I was gonna say?

15
00:01:01,772 --> 00:01:03,392
No, I didn't think you were gonna say,

16
00:01:03,512 --> 00:01:05,412
but I don't think it dawned on me.

17
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,152
Did I getcha?

18
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:07,912
I don't think it dawned on me the significance

19
00:01:07,912 --> 00:01:10,052
that this is the episode where we finally.

20
00:01:10,052 --> 00:01:11,972
Yeah, this is where it will be revealed.

21
00:01:11,992 --> 00:01:16,932
But didn't we got the answer from our almighty Tony already?

22
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:17,692
That is true.

23
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:18,992
That's Scott Gairdner.

24
00:01:20,112 --> 00:01:21,712
Yes, Tony did, and obviously Tony

25
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:24,232
is a better authority than me.

26
00:01:24,612 --> 00:01:27,232
But for the purposes of this podcast

27
00:01:27,232 --> 00:01:29,392
and to pay off a narrative thread

28
00:01:29,392 --> 00:01:33,052
that we have been threading along for months now,

29
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:37,472
since March, this is like a finale of a season in a way,

30
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,652
like of TV, like where you blow off something,

31
00:01:40,372 --> 00:01:43,032
like Walt versus Gus Fring, like it ends here.

32
00:01:43,072 --> 00:01:45,392
It's that big of an event in entertainment.

33
00:01:45,632 --> 00:01:46,412
Well, and it's been a spoiler.

34
00:01:46,412 --> 00:01:47,492
Ross and Rachel Kiss.

35
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:48,632
Oh, that's a guy.

36
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:50,332
I know I haven't been introduced yet.

37
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:51,712
I just really needed to say that.

38
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:53,532
Okay, I'll give you your intro real quick

39
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:54,552
so you can join in on this.

40
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,932
Writer-performer, this is our special guest.

41
00:01:57,072 --> 00:01:59,492
She hosts the podcast Teen Creeps in Public Domain Theater.

42
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,452
She works on the upcoming cartoon network show

43
00:02:01,452 --> 00:02:04,252
Infinity Train, is also my love, my girlfriend,

44
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,412
Lindsay K. Tai.

45
00:02:05,912 --> 00:02:08,712
I say that, I always refer to her as my love

46
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,732
in common conversation.

47
00:02:10,872 --> 00:02:12,152
It's a natural phrase.

48
00:02:12,752 --> 00:02:14,372
Yeah, I'm definitely familiar with that

49
00:02:14,372 --> 00:02:16,172
and was not at all taken aback.

50
00:02:16,332 --> 00:02:17,532
No, I thought that was fun.

51
00:02:17,692 --> 00:02:18,892
I thought that was a fun way to say it.

52
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:19,332
Yeah, exactly.

53
00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:21,812
Everyone's here, mom, dad, Uncle Scott,

54
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:26,752
all of my West Coast guardians, all of my West Coast.

55
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:28,232
Never not disturbing.

56
00:02:28,472 --> 00:02:30,472
I love that definition of me.

57
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:31,732
That makes me very happy.

58
00:02:32,692 --> 00:02:32,872
Uncle Scott.

59
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:34,012
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

60
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:35,432
Shouldn't it be Uncle Scotty?

61
00:02:35,852 --> 00:02:37,592
I feel like it should be Uncle Scotty.

62
00:02:37,632 --> 00:02:38,032
Uncle Scotty?

63
00:02:38,152 --> 00:02:38,972
If you're gonna go that way.

64
00:02:39,412 --> 00:02:40,472
Let's know, hey, hey.

65
00:02:40,472 --> 00:02:40,872
That's up to Scott.

66
00:02:41,232 --> 00:02:42,572
That's the Scotty part of it.

67
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:43,132
No, that's up to the child.

68
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:44,152
Now I'm disturbed.

69
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:48,912
So yeah, Jason thinks of us as his family, not his friends.

70
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:49,272
Sure.

71
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:51,352
But like his authority.

72
00:02:51,352 --> 00:02:51,732
No, your friends.

73
00:02:51,852 --> 00:02:53,772
But like authority family, not like,

74
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,272
oh, you're all my, you're all my,

75
00:02:55,352 --> 00:02:56,992
like God, he would say you're my family or something.

76
00:02:56,992 --> 00:02:58,432
We're brothers, we're not, none of you,

77
00:02:58,532 --> 00:02:59,832
we're all above you.

78
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:01,792
No, he would say like, you're my family,

79
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:03,072
you take care of me. Like literal.

80
00:03:03,912 --> 00:03:05,752
I look to you for guidance.

81
00:03:06,432 --> 00:03:07,872
That's the family you're talking about.

82
00:03:07,892 --> 00:03:09,272
I got the feigning disease for mom.

83
00:03:09,372 --> 00:03:11,752
I got the feigning disease for Lindsay.

84
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:16,792
Well, this is what's exciting here among many other things

85
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:19,212
is that, well, like finally, Lindsay,

86
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:20,792
you're here on the podcast and you are like,

87
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:22,792
you're the only, you're the person who's been on,

88
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:25,692
the person, like, the person who's around us the most

89
00:03:25,692 --> 00:03:28,632
doing all of these things who have not been on yet.

90
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,412
And I'm so glad you're here.

91
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,132
Thank you.

92
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:33,032
The fans have been here.

93
00:03:33,032 --> 00:03:34,692
The fans have been calling for it.

94
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:38,492
Every episode, it's like footprints in the sand.

95
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:41,812
When you only saw one pair, I was holding you.

96
00:03:42,092 --> 00:03:44,312
And footsteps on the way out the door,

97
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,072
because often we are here in your living room,

98
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:49,192
taking up your space while you were trying to

99
00:03:49,192 --> 00:03:50,972
go about your day and do things.

100
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:53,212
So thanks for letting us invade your,

101
00:03:53,212 --> 00:03:56,232
not Mike, Mike is a permanent invader of your space,

102
00:03:56,712 --> 00:03:59,232
an allowed invader, but we're, yeah,

103
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:02,952
Uncle Scott's a guest, so thanks for giving us the studio.

104
00:04:02,972 --> 00:04:04,472
As Jason said, your family.

105
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:05,852
Hey, oh geez.

106
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,232
You make a lot of appearances,

107
00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:10,772
if like eagle-eared listeners,

108
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:13,252
like they can hear in the background often like,

109
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:15,892
and then like a lock on, like opens up.

110
00:04:15,892 --> 00:04:17,212
That's me taking the dog out.

111
00:04:17,212 --> 00:04:17,972
And that's you taking the dog out,

112
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:20,032
or you coming back, or like, who knows?

113
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:20,752
Or me moving with laundry.

114
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:23,772
The most you've been felt on the show,

115
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:26,832
just in addition to stories, is the City Walk episode

116
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:29,912
where we recorded drunk after Hall of the Moon,

117
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:32,252
and you texted me, you were being too loud.

118
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:34,012
And then all of a sudden we all were like,

119
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:36,272
very hushed about the whole thing.

120
00:04:36,332 --> 00:04:38,352
We got quiet for about four minutes.

121
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:39,192
Yeah, then we forgot.

122
00:04:39,632 --> 00:04:40,052
Then we got right back up.

123
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,732
It wasn't even, I guess it was because

124
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:44,132
I was trying to sleep, yeah.

125
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:44,692
Yeah, of course.

126
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:45,752
It was one in the morning.

127
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:46,232
It was late.

128
00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:48,792
And I think if we wanna like really attack somebody,

129
00:04:48,892 --> 00:04:50,752
I think I said Jason's being too loud.

130
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:52,452
No, I don't believe that.

131
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:54,692
I was trying to protect our son.

132
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:57,012
Yeah, I was trying to say we were all too loud,

133
00:04:57,012 --> 00:04:57,852
but now he knows.

134
00:04:58,092 --> 00:04:59,252
I'm a mean mother.

135
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,392
I'm one of those strict, like holding a martinis.

136
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:03,292
Yeah.

137
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:06,332
Like, oh, are we doing that today?

138
00:05:07,612 --> 00:05:08,352
That general tone.

139
00:05:08,372 --> 00:05:08,752
That's the only way to learn.

140
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:09,992
Sure.

141
00:05:10,692 --> 00:05:13,652
So yeah, so this is the, this is very,

142
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:15,332
well, let's like, real quick, we'll talk.

143
00:05:15,352 --> 00:05:17,852
There's gonna be other episodes where we get into more,

144
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:21,052
maybe history of our theme park journeys together.

145
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:23,752
Let's get real quick though,

146
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:28,072
just a little brief version of the anecdote about Duffy,

147
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:30,792
because Duffy relates very strongly to Tokyo Disney.

148
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:34,352
See, I promise everyone there will be a full Duffy episode.

149
00:05:34,832 --> 00:05:36,792
I have material I've been preparing

150
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:39,132
for a Duffy something for years,

151
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:39,792
and this is no joke.

152
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:40,392
Years and years.

153
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:43,292
On my desktop is a file that says Duffy,

154
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:44,972
and I've been going through message boards for years.

155
00:05:44,972 --> 00:05:47,252
And you've had to move that to multiple computers.

156
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:47,652
Yes.

157
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:48,412
It's been moved.

158
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,252
There have been multiple evenings

159
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:54,032
where you have read aloud posts

160
00:05:54,032 --> 00:05:57,052
from the Duffy message boards in bed late at night.

161
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,052
Yes, that's 100% true.

162
00:05:58,072 --> 00:06:01,872
And by the way, if you don't know, Duffy is a teddy bear.

163
00:06:01,932 --> 00:06:02,412
Fair enough.

164
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,072
This is a teddy bear character who mainly,

165
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:08,292
he came from Tokyo originally.

166
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:09,432
He didn't come from there originally.

167
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:11,272
He was originally in the States, I believe,

168
00:06:11,272 --> 00:06:14,792
and he was not popular, and then they moved him to Tokyo,

169
00:06:14,812 --> 00:06:18,172
and he was the second only to Mickey in popularity.

170
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:21,012
And there's a whole Tokyo, Cape Cod section

171
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:23,632
of Tokyo Disney Sea where Duffy and his friends now,

172
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:24,972
there's a whole Duffy universe.

173
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,192
They love Duffy.

174
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,352
You see Duffy on everyone's purse.

175
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:30,012
There'll be a big fluffy Duffy head

176
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:30,492
or Duffy's friend, Shelly May.

177
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:32,532
Yeah, everyone has those old Duffy head purses

178
00:06:32,532 --> 00:06:35,652
that they wear not on the side or even across their chest,

179
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:38,692
but hanging around their necks like a necklace.

180
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:40,032
Right, so yeah.

181
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:42,172
So when we first started going,

182
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:44,632
Lindsay and I started going to Disneyland together,

183
00:06:44,952 --> 00:06:45,592
we would make jokes.

184
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:46,592
Everyone has made,

185
00:06:46,592 --> 00:06:48,132
I'm not saying this makes us unique,

186
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:50,372
but everyone would make a joke about Duffy.

187
00:06:51,232 --> 00:06:52,732
I'm like, oh, who's like, who is Duffy?

188
00:06:52,732 --> 00:06:55,052
What is this, like the Disney bear?

189
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:57,352
Right, so we make Duffy jokes and blah, blah, blah.

190
00:06:57,532 --> 00:06:59,012
So. And it was a nice time.

191
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:01,992
And then Mike, of course, had to take it.

192
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:03,592
I took it. It was a nice time.

193
00:07:03,952 --> 00:07:04,092
I took it too far.

194
00:07:04,332 --> 00:07:05,112
I still don't think it was too.

195
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:07,272
I wouldn't say too far.

196
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,172
I wouldn't say too far. I'll give context.

197
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:12,592
You tell it, I'm not sure exactly how you're gonna put it.

198
00:07:12,592 --> 00:07:14,772
Well, I think it was your 30th birthday.

199
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:15,932
Yeah, that was the problem.

200
00:07:17,532 --> 00:07:18,872
But the thing here is the thing.

201
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,712
I had gotten you other gifts and we went out to dinner.

202
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:23,172
Yeah, now I remember.

203
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:24,272
We were going out to dinner.

204
00:07:24,332 --> 00:07:25,892
So it wasn't like this was the only thing,

205
00:07:25,892 --> 00:07:27,772
but I remember I was down there on a weekday.

206
00:07:27,832 --> 00:07:29,932
My mom was visiting and my sister and I were all down there

207
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:30,832
and I was like, it'd be funny.

208
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:32,252
Lindsay and I were always joking about Duffy.

209
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:33,452
I'll go, I'll get her a Duffy.

210
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:36,212
So I bought you a Duffy and I bought two outfits.

211
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:41,032
I bought his sombrero and poncho outfit

212
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:46,852
and then a full like pit crew cars outfit for him

213
00:07:46,852 --> 00:07:49,752
that had looked like Lightning McQueen's colors.

214
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:51,652
Like he was on Lightning McQueen's pit crew.

215
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:53,072
I was like, this is so funny.

216
00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:55,272
And like, my mom was even like, oh, it's a cute bear.

217
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:56,932
Like my mom wasn't like, what are you doing?

218
00:07:57,032 --> 00:07:57,872
Why would you do that?

219
00:07:58,092 --> 00:08:02,152
So I felt like I was feeling like I was getting, you know,

220
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:05,172
support from my family for doing it, which,

221
00:08:05,432 --> 00:08:07,712
so I got it for you and you were like,

222
00:08:08,652 --> 00:08:11,012
you were like, it was just not that you said it like that,

223
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:11,972
but it was definitely like.

224
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:14,492
I imagine it came out like, oh.

225
00:08:14,672 --> 00:08:15,632
Yeah, and I'm good.

226
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:18,612
I think I'm not even bragging when I'm usually

227
00:08:18,612 --> 00:08:19,872
pretty good at gifts.

228
00:08:20,312 --> 00:08:21,432
I usually do a decent job.

229
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:23,012
Yeah, our very first year dating,

230
00:08:23,512 --> 00:08:26,592
I was blown away by the Christmas present you got me,

231
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:28,172
which was also Disney related.

232
00:08:28,312 --> 00:08:29,692
But I've gotten other, there's other gifts

233
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:31,632
that have been very, I can't think of one off the top of my head

234
00:08:31,632 --> 00:08:32,412
but they're all pretty thoughtful.

235
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:33,932
I think you're far better at gifts than I am.

236
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:36,312
Yeah, so it's not like I'm a total heel,

237
00:08:36,652 --> 00:08:39,012
but for the 30th birthday,

238
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:43,672
you were not thrilled to get Duffy in a pit crew outfit.

239
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:46,792
It wasn't even, it was sort of like,

240
00:08:46,972 --> 00:08:49,092
that was like the big gift of the gifts.

241
00:08:49,092 --> 00:08:51,172
I mean, I was so excited about the Duffy.

242
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:55,872
And I felt terrible for giving a lukewarm reaction.

243
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:56,932
No, it was not a big deal.

244
00:08:56,932 --> 00:08:58,972
I wanted to be more excited about it.

245
00:08:59,092 --> 00:09:03,032
I think if it were now, where I'm like.

246
00:09:03,032 --> 00:09:04,272
Now that you've gotten more used to my garbage.

247
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:07,352
Yeah, where I've been like just broken down.

248
00:09:07,352 --> 00:09:08,052
Yeah.

249
00:09:08,392 --> 00:09:11,912
Taught to expect less for myself.

250
00:09:12,712 --> 00:09:17,712
Like just learned that I'm deserving of like less love

251
00:09:17,712 --> 00:09:19,672
than I originally thought.

252
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:22,612
Now I'd get that and be like, oh my God.

253
00:09:22,752 --> 00:09:23,552
Thank you so much.

254
00:09:23,572 --> 00:09:25,912
This is the best gift I've ever gotten.

255
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:26,792
That's good.

256
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:30,832
But at the time, at the time I still was like,

257
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:32,712
right, like pearl earrings, right?

258
00:09:32,732 --> 00:09:34,152
30th birthday is a big deal.

259
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:36,972
And also I think I was just like

260
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:38,912
to get maybe a little too personal.

261
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:41,392
I get very personal on my podcast.

262
00:09:41,472 --> 00:09:43,452
And I talk about you and I talk about us.

263
00:09:43,512 --> 00:09:44,352
So I don't know.

264
00:09:45,072 --> 00:09:47,132
Probably far less than happens here.

265
00:09:47,432 --> 00:09:49,172
Yeah, that's a plug for Teen Creeds.

266
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:51,792
Just go back and listen for Mike mentions.

267
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:53,892
Yeah, we certainly tell stories,

268
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:56,492
but I think you get into it a little deeper.

269
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:57,032
Yeah.

270
00:09:57,072 --> 00:10:01,212
But it was like a couple years into our relationship

271
00:10:01,212 --> 00:10:05,132
and it's possible.

272
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,072
I don't exactly remember the timeline.

273
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:08,932
Go ahead.

274
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:12,452
It's possible we had yet to say I love you to each other.

275
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:14,952
Yes, I think that might be right.

276
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:16,272
It took us two years.

277
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:17,592
So it could have happened.

278
00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:18,952
Whoa, whoa.

279
00:10:19,372 --> 00:10:19,732
Wow.

280
00:10:20,632 --> 00:10:21,952
We're both weird, what?

281
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:24,612
Do it like me and say it after a week

282
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:26,052
and not know the gravity.

283
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:27,492
Was that after a week?

284
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:32,052
I know you said it after like hearing Lionel Richie's hello

285
00:10:32,052 --> 00:10:32,512
or something.

286
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,912
Technically, our first time was during,

287
00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:36,472
yeah, we were doing karaoke

288
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:38,932
and the part in Lionel Richie's hello came up

289
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:41,812
where I'm saying I love you.

290
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,292
And we did look at each other and the guy like,

291
00:10:43,572 --> 00:10:44,532
I know this is fake,

292
00:10:44,672 --> 00:10:47,232
but is this kind of really the first time?

293
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:48,972
So that was kind of nice.

294
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:50,232
But I mean more the other.

295
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:52,132
I think I told on the podcast about a year ago

296
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:54,432
that the first time I ever said I love you to anyone

297
00:10:54,432 --> 00:11:00,032
was after a kiss in a hot tub at a San Antonio Hilton.

298
00:11:00,032 --> 00:11:01,532
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

299
00:11:01,832 --> 00:11:04,572
And that when I'm 15, like you're tossing out

300
00:11:04,572 --> 00:11:06,012
I love you willy nilly.

301
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:10,532
It's like waiting until you know it is a good thing.

302
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:12,652
Or waiting until Lionel Richie's playing.

303
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,252
Yeah, or waiting until you get Duffy.

304
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:17,492
He's a magical bear.

305
00:11:17,592 --> 00:11:19,092
It's because I hadn't said it before.

306
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:20,172
So I was just like.

307
00:11:20,272 --> 00:11:20,632
To anyone?

308
00:11:21,052 --> 00:11:21,272
Yeah.

309
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:22,272
Oh, I see.

310
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:22,892
It's a big deal.

311
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:24,592
So it was a big deal for me

312
00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:27,172
and that's why I was like holding out.

313
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:29,412
And I don't know, we've always phrased it

314
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:30,772
when we first started dating

315
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:33,892
we were like two nervous kittens circling each other.

316
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:34,512
That's fair, yeah.

317
00:11:34,532 --> 00:11:36,292
So that added to it.

318
00:11:36,332 --> 00:11:38,032
So I think that might have been part of it.

319
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:38,412
It's all.

320
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:40,852
What is this relationship?

321
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:43,072
For my 30th birthday I got a Duffy.

322
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:44,252
Right.

323
00:11:44,492 --> 00:11:47,372
Well, I kind of remember though

324
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:50,052
any negative feelings Mike would have felt

325
00:11:50,052 --> 00:11:53,512
about the Duffy thing were probably overcome pretty quickly

326
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,492
when me and some other friends were over

327
00:11:56,492 --> 00:11:59,172
and he's like, look at this, look what I did.

328
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:01,212
And he was showing off the Duffy.

329
00:12:01,912 --> 00:12:03,592
He was so pleased with himself.

330
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:06,452
Yeah, I mean, again, it wasn't like you were like so mad.

331
00:12:06,512 --> 00:12:08,872
It was just like a little bit of a deflated balloon.

332
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:09,252
So like.

333
00:12:09,272 --> 00:12:10,592
I think if it hadn't been like

334
00:12:10,592 --> 00:12:12,832
what's supposed to be like a landmark birthday.

335
00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:13,532
Yes, it was.

336
00:12:13,552 --> 00:12:14,512
That wouldn't have happened.

337
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:16,912
Yeah, you weren't like so furious at me or whatever.

338
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:19,212
And then like you felt bad that like, I just was like,

339
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,672
oh, this is a funny, silly thing that's an inside joke.

340
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:24,012
So it wasn't like some, so it wasn't like

341
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:27,552
it was some like horrible atom bomb in the relationship.

342
00:12:27,552 --> 00:12:28,992
And then Jason came over and I was like,

343
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:30,692
look what a little stinker I am.

344
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:33,032
That was not what the tone of it.

345
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:36,512
We did go look what a little stinker I am.

346
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:39,192
Yeah, but it wasn't like, it wasn't in the context of like.

347
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:42,592
But you did tell, it was very funny to hear you go like,

348
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:46,232
it was fine.

349
00:12:46,512 --> 00:12:48,372
Anything in a comedian's life, it's like,

350
00:12:48,992 --> 00:12:52,292
even if it doesn't, like it becomes funny

351
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:53,792
30 seconds after the fact.

352
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:54,492
Yeah, sure.

353
00:12:55,012 --> 00:12:57,852
It immediately is a funny story that you tell.

354
00:12:57,852 --> 00:13:02,032
So even if in the moment I was like, wow, thank you.

355
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:04,212
Was it the grand finale?

356
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:06,052
Was it presented as a now you're final gift?

357
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:06,692
It might have been.

358
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:07,872
It probably was.

359
00:13:08,212 --> 00:13:09,732
That is maybe the issue.

360
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:10,692
It was the biggest part.

361
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:13,512
It was the big, the bigger piece.

362
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:14,692
I was the most excited about it.

363
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:15,352
It was the centerpiece.

364
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:16,392
I thought it was maybe funny,

365
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:18,032
but also like he's a cute bear.

366
00:13:18,112 --> 00:13:19,152
It was funny, cute.

367
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:20,652
And like it's a fun piece of weird Disney.

368
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:24,572
I had an ex who I was at Disneyland,

369
00:13:24,712 --> 00:13:26,152
I knew she like Eeyore and I thought,

370
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:26,932
oh, you know what would be fun?

371
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,452
I found some Eeyore earrings.

372
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:30,492
This is fun.

373
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:31,732
I hadn't really been buying her jewelry.

374
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:32,492
I still am.

375
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:35,272
I'm afraid of jewelry gifts.

376
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:37,852
I will sound vouch for Mike and say, what a stressful.

377
00:13:38,872 --> 00:13:41,172
I don't know that I have done it for her.

378
00:13:41,272 --> 00:13:44,192
I think my gift to her is not buying her horrible jewelry.

379
00:13:44,372 --> 00:13:46,192
No, I feel like you need to,

380
00:13:46,312 --> 00:13:48,892
I feel like you need a link.

381
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:51,652
I feel like they must supply a link of like,

382
00:13:51,692 --> 00:13:54,092
this is something I like, or it's something you know.

383
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:57,572
I know they have this in X color stone.

384
00:13:57,652 --> 00:14:00,972
I will get them the complimentary like another color.

385
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:02,432
Some taste hints have to be given.

386
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,912
I'm just saying pearl earrings are classic.

387
00:14:04,192 --> 00:14:05,212
And I don't know why everybody is so resistant.

388
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,592
It's hard to mess up pearl.

389
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,052
If I gave you.

390
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:10,052
Did you ever get the fucking pearl earrings?

391
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:10,612
No.

392
00:14:10,712 --> 00:14:12,432
This wasn't something I'd said to him.

393
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:14,092
I'm saying this because one year

394
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:16,152
I did get pearl earrings for my birthday.

395
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:17,432
From who?

396
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:19,472
We don't need to talk about that.

397
00:14:20,032 --> 00:14:20,092
Hey.

398
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:21,132
Yeah.

399
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:24,532
If I had gotten you a Shelly May with pearl earrings,

400
00:14:25,092 --> 00:14:26,692
what about that?

401
00:14:26,692 --> 00:14:28,312
I don't think she existed yet.

402
00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:30,232
Oh yeah, maybe she was pretty new.

403
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:32,772
I called on our first Orlando trip

404
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,072
and our first trip to Orlando,

405
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:36,092
which is four or five years ago, I guess.

406
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:40,212
I called customer service and asked if there's any way

407
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,612
they could have a Shelly May waiting for us in the room.

408
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:43,672
Oh yeah.

409
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:46,012
But they only sold it in Japan.

410
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,712
I would like to say that on a birthday

411
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:53,132
or maybe Valentine's Day or something after that,

412
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,412
I shipped a Shelly May.

413
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:57,412
I got you Shelly May from Japan.

414
00:14:57,832 --> 00:14:59,972
Yeah, and then my sister got me gelatoni

415
00:14:59,972 --> 00:15:01,332
for the Italian painter Kat.

416
00:15:01,712 --> 00:15:03,792
And then Marissa Strickland.

417
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:05,372
Yes, got me Tippie Blue.

418
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:06,132
And me Tippie Blue as well.

419
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:07,032
And Jason Tippie Blue.

420
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:08,512
So Jason and I both have Tippie Blues.

421
00:15:08,952 --> 00:15:09,132
You have multiple.

422
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:09,812
The bird mailman.

423
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:11,652
Your primary gift.

424
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:12,592
I have four Duffy's.

425
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:13,352
I have not kept up.

426
00:15:13,432 --> 00:15:14,252
I don't have cookie.

427
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:16,432
I don't have, what's the turtle?

428
00:15:17,112 --> 00:15:17,992
Oh, I forget the turtle.

429
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:19,112
Alanu?

430
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,392
Yeah, but just Alani.

431
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,012
Alani, yeah.

432
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:22,852
We did not remember.

433
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:24,572
Oh, that's why I didn't remember there was a turtle.

434
00:15:24,572 --> 00:15:25,992
And Cookie is exclusive to Hong Kong.

435
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,772
And then the other character is Stella Lu the bunny.

436
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:30,072
But she's available to you.

437
00:15:30,252 --> 00:15:30,472
Anyway.

438
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:32,092
Oh, can I say really fast?

439
00:15:32,092 --> 00:15:33,492
Does Mike quiz me on these names?

440
00:15:33,712 --> 00:15:34,072
Yes.

441
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:35,232
Just now and then.

442
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:37,372
I am also annoying in the sense that I quiz.

443
00:15:37,472 --> 00:15:41,112
All of this also makes you tied

444
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:43,712
as our most patient guest.

445
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:45,952
Tied with one Aaron Gerda.

446
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:46,532
Yeah.

447
00:15:46,532 --> 00:15:47,712
Well, certainly, yeah, yeah.

448
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:53,632
I am bummed at how typically male, female.

449
00:15:53,632 --> 00:15:54,512
Yeah.

450
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:58,252
Binary idea of gender these relationships are

451
00:15:58,252 --> 00:16:01,072
where it's like, oh, our men talk about sports

452
00:16:01,072 --> 00:16:02,972
and we listen politely.

453
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,352
Yeah, it is.

454
00:16:04,812 --> 00:16:06,512
Except that Aaron and I do both

455
00:16:06,512 --> 00:16:08,492
really like the theme parks.

456
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:10,452
It's just obviously not to the depth.

457
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:11,752
No, that's exceedingly weird.

458
00:16:11,752 --> 00:16:12,972
That is what I try to tell people

459
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:14,852
because I'm like, you know, she doesn't like it as much.

460
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,452
And they're like, oh, okay, I know what you're saying.

461
00:16:16,532 --> 00:16:17,572
I'm like, no, no, I think, but like,

462
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:20,672
she's in the percentile of people that really like it.

463
00:16:20,732 --> 00:16:22,292
Like for the average person,

464
00:16:22,752 --> 00:16:25,292
just saying you go as much to Disneyland as you,

465
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:26,632
they'd be like, what's wrong with you?

466
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:27,612
Why would you do that?

467
00:16:27,632 --> 00:16:30,392
So like for a normal, again, a normal person,

468
00:16:31,112 --> 00:16:34,332
you're in a high level of fandom and interest.

469
00:16:34,612 --> 00:16:38,552
I think Lindsay and Aaron are in like, in the 90% zone.

470
00:16:38,552 --> 00:16:38,992
Yeah, that's.

471
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:40,932
We are like 140.

472
00:16:41,132 --> 00:16:42,032
That's the issue.

473
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:42,312
Yeah.

474
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:44,772
You're at like the highest tier.

475
00:16:44,832 --> 00:16:48,832
We're at like an untenable, not sustainable height.

476
00:16:49,052 --> 00:16:53,432
If after 90, it started increasing exponentially.

477
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:55,132
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

478
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:57,652
It's a half life, the reverse half life maybe.

479
00:16:57,852 --> 00:16:58,832
Is that what it has a half life?

480
00:16:58,832 --> 00:16:59,652
That's exponential.

481
00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:01,832
Can I finish something really fast?

482
00:17:02,752 --> 00:17:02,812
Oh yeah, sorry.

483
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:03,772
It's not a straight detail.

484
00:17:05,632 --> 00:17:07,392
The girl, your earrings.

485
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:07,912
Oh right.

486
00:17:07,912 --> 00:17:08,352
Oh right, I'm sorry.

487
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:09,472
This is cute.

488
00:17:09,872 --> 00:17:11,912
You know, it's just a fun little thing.

489
00:17:11,912 --> 00:17:13,352
Who cares if they're cheap and whatever.

490
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,112
And I gave her your earrings and her response was,

491
00:17:16,372 --> 00:17:17,432
do you really think I would wear these?

492
00:17:18,012 --> 00:17:18,592
Wow.

493
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:19,092
Ouch.

494
00:17:19,132 --> 00:17:19,892
Heartbreaking.

495
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:20,932
Oh crazy.

496
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:21,972
Was that hot tub girl?

497
00:17:22,612 --> 00:17:23,632
No, no, no, different.

498
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:24,572
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

499
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:26,572
She might've been nice about earrings.

500
00:17:27,432 --> 00:17:30,332
But it certainly was an Aaron who is so nice,

501
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:31,632
who I appreciate so much.

502
00:17:31,632 --> 00:17:33,992
Who you buy her poo earrings all the time

503
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:35,312
and she wears them proudly.

504
00:17:35,692 --> 00:17:36,832
She's in her room.

505
00:17:37,052 --> 00:17:37,852
Everywhere she goes.

506
00:17:38,052 --> 00:17:40,312
It's like those pig cuff links

507
00:17:40,312 --> 00:17:42,832
in that episode of The Simpsons, Lisa's wedding.

508
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:43,752
Uh huh.

509
00:17:43,912 --> 00:17:45,992
We did, you know, our wedding cake topper was,

510
00:17:46,012 --> 00:17:46,852
I think I said this on the show,

511
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:50,672
was there was an R2-D2 and a Ernie who was this robot

512
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:53,272
who was the mascot for the 1982 World's Fair.

513
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:53,792
Right.

514
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,832
So we did have, what's that?

515
00:17:56,012 --> 00:17:58,092
Which I would never have heard of myself.

516
00:17:58,272 --> 00:18:00,972
Uh huh, if we were not carrying the torch for Ernie.

517
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:01,832
Big Ernie fans.

518
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:03,252
And the most important day of our lives.

519
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:08,992
So anyway, look, Disney oriented gift giving can be tough

520
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:11,072
and there's pitfalls.

521
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:11,672
Yeah.

522
00:18:11,672 --> 00:18:13,712
But look, you survived, you made it.

523
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:14,212
Yes.

524
00:18:14,212 --> 00:18:14,832
I think you're great now.

525
00:18:15,192 --> 00:18:16,972
You just have to do it responsibly.

526
00:18:17,212 --> 00:18:19,692
Right, and I've done it more responsibly buying gifts.

527
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:22,152
That Disney soundtrack, is that the gift you were talking

528
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:22,212
about?

529
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:22,692
That was their big Christmas gift.

530
00:18:22,692 --> 00:18:24,672
The Disneyland soundtrack thing I got you very,

531
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:25,732
and it was very, it's very cool.

532
00:18:25,892 --> 00:18:27,572
You also, can I just say, you were talking about

533
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:30,132
like things falling in a traditional gender binary

534
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:33,132
right after your boyfriend went on and on

535
00:18:33,132 --> 00:18:35,532
about how many teddy bears he has.

536
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:38,772
I just meant that dynamic.

537
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:39,692
The dynamic, yeah.

538
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:39,892
Sure, sure.

539
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:42,892
Like traditionally, like women in the kitchen talking

540
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:45,392
about their things, men in the living room talking

541
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:47,852
about their things, kind of a, kind of a feel.

542
00:18:47,872 --> 00:18:50,452
Except your things are also the Disney parks.

543
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:50,712
Yeah.

544
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,572
It's just separate.

545
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:56,352
But I think also it's like, part of that dynamic

546
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:59,952
is that it tends not to be a two way street.

547
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:05,372
Well, I think a lot of it, and I try to pick my battles

548
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:10,412
is that I think for years I'm too dumb or oblivious

549
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:13,012
to realize that you didn't care about,

550
00:19:13,512 --> 00:19:16,132
hey, did you know, here's what the speculation is

551
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:18,232
on the Tomorrowland redo.

552
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:20,952
So I think a lot of the, it's not a two way street

553
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:23,692
in that way specifically, because you at a certain point

554
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:25,992
would be like, I don't really care about this.

555
00:19:26,192 --> 00:19:27,292
I don't necessarily care.

556
00:19:27,312 --> 00:19:29,672
So I think at a certain point I was sending you

557
00:19:29,672 --> 00:19:31,772
every single website I read.

558
00:19:31,952 --> 00:19:34,212
And I was telling you every single rumor.

559
00:19:34,212 --> 00:19:35,152
And at a certain point you're like,

560
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:36,412
I don't need this much.

561
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:39,052
You just redirected, he built the dam

562
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,472
and redirected that stream to me and Scott.

563
00:19:41,992 --> 00:19:42,292
Yeah, sure.

564
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:43,412
And now here we are.

565
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:46,532
Yeah, Scott is me replacement for that.

566
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:47,092
Okay, great.

567
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:48,312
But Jason was already in the picture.

568
00:19:48,332 --> 00:19:51,032
But I'm too much for Scott with the information I think too.

569
00:19:51,252 --> 00:19:52,772
I think there's, I think I, like.

570
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:53,672
Only a little.

571
00:19:53,832 --> 00:19:55,952
There's a couple, there's a couple levels of,

572
00:19:55,952 --> 00:19:57,752
not level, but like a couple areas too.

573
00:19:57,752 --> 00:20:00,192
You and I love the horse race kind of gossip.

574
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:03,552
Jason and I think bond over the fact that we will,

575
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:07,612
we can do any version of, he'll listen to me talk

576
00:20:07,612 --> 00:20:08,972
about the FastPass program.

577
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:10,652
Whether he's that interested or not,

578
00:20:10,652 --> 00:20:15,112
he is happy to hear 30 minutes on different ways

579
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:18,712
to get FastPass and MaxPass and the benefits of it and why.

580
00:20:19,232 --> 00:20:20,532
That's the difference I think.

581
00:20:20,672 --> 00:20:23,632
Which does make you and I more mentally ill

582
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:24,872
than everyone I think.

583
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:25,612
Yes.

584
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:27,912
Correct.

585
00:20:28,172 --> 00:20:30,412
I just need to think, if something could be framed

586
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:32,532
as a story, maybe that sort of,

587
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:37,412
you need to distill instead of reporting every little thing.

588
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:38,172
It's like how do we frame it?

589
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:40,412
Yeah, there's not like a beginning, middle and end.

590
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:41,652
It's an interesting thing

591
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:43,092
because I think everyone has different,

592
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:44,572
I think we've talked about it,

593
00:20:44,572 --> 00:20:46,132
everyone has different friends for different parts

594
00:20:46,132 --> 00:20:47,672
of their lives and different interests.

595
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:49,632
And I'm a very, I text a lot,

596
00:20:49,632 --> 00:20:53,212
I like to share stuff daily with different people.

597
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,772
But I'm trying to think now, I'm looking at all three of you,

598
00:20:55,832 --> 00:20:56,992
it's like all three of you are looking at me.

599
00:20:57,052 --> 00:20:58,932
It's a weird configuration now that I'm feeling it.

600
00:20:58,932 --> 00:21:00,392
Yeah, yeah, we are hanging up on you.

601
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,652
Because usually that chair is moved over a little more,

602
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:03,572
so it's more of a square.

603
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:04,432
Turned entirely to see Scott.

604
00:21:04,432 --> 00:21:05,352
But right now it feels like I'm on trial.

605
00:21:05,392 --> 00:21:07,512
And all our Mike stands are pointed right at you.

606
00:21:07,692 --> 00:21:10,812
Like the part in Captain EO where they're all like,

607
00:21:11,152 --> 00:21:12,592
just shoving those sticks in your face.

608
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:14,232
This is a scary experience for you.

609
00:21:14,252 --> 00:21:15,872
Your guys are pointed at Mike

610
00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:18,192
and Mike and mine are pointed parallel.

611
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:22,312
You're both pointed at Donald.

612
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:23,132
It is true.

613
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:24,172
We're on the same course off the cliff.

614
00:21:24,192 --> 00:21:26,432
I am realizing now we should have definitely

615
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:28,312
moved Scott's chair over there.

616
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:29,512
Well it's usually fine.

617
00:21:30,652 --> 00:21:31,152
Yeah, it's fine.

618
00:21:31,452 --> 00:21:33,552
I'm usually like right here and the green chair

619
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:35,572
I think historically is actually more like there.

620
00:21:35,672 --> 00:21:37,032
So then it ends up being kind of more of a circle.

621
00:21:37,052 --> 00:21:38,412
Well you know what else is going on?

622
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:41,272
Not to jump too far ahead,

623
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:44,072
but since we are talking today about your guys' trip

624
00:21:44,072 --> 00:21:46,292
to Tokyo Disney, and I think part of the reason

625
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:48,752
maybe that I am further out than typical.

626
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:49,132
Oh right.

627
00:21:50,312 --> 00:21:52,032
Is that at some point in this episode,

628
00:21:52,132 --> 00:21:54,032
I mean I'm excited to hear everything

629
00:21:54,032 --> 00:21:54,732
that happened to you guys,

630
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:56,792
but at some point I wanna give you guys the freedom

631
00:21:56,992 --> 00:21:59,472
to talk about rides that I have not been on

632
00:21:59,472 --> 00:22:01,832
and then I wanna go on and I will be going in April.

633
00:22:02,152 --> 00:22:04,352
And it's such as I was saying before we started recording,

634
00:22:04,672 --> 00:22:06,992
it's a rare experience to get to go on rides

635
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,952
that I know absolutely zero about.

636
00:22:09,432 --> 00:22:12,492
So there will be a spoiler divide

637
00:22:12,492 --> 00:22:13,932
at some point in this episode.

638
00:22:13,972 --> 00:22:15,492
And when the spoiler divide begins,

639
00:22:15,892 --> 00:22:18,012
I'm going to literally get up and leave.

640
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:20,352
So you will hear for that.

641
00:22:20,652 --> 00:22:22,352
So listeners, that will also be a point

642
00:22:22,352 --> 00:22:25,432
for you to shut it off if you wanna experience rides fresh,

643
00:22:25,432 --> 00:22:28,572
but there are especially this Sindbad ride

644
00:22:28,572 --> 00:22:30,292
I don't know a single thing about.

645
00:22:30,412 --> 00:22:31,552
I don't know what kind of ride it is.

646
00:22:31,612 --> 00:22:34,732
I have no clue about it and I wanna keep that intact

647
00:22:34,732 --> 00:22:36,192
and other rides there too.

648
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:36,652
So.

649
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:39,352
And we're doing like 40 minutes on Sindbad alone.

650
00:22:39,472 --> 00:22:40,752
Oh okay, well then I'll wait.

651
00:22:40,772 --> 00:22:41,332
You sure you don't?

652
00:22:41,572 --> 00:22:42,392
Cause I brought a map.

653
00:22:42,472 --> 00:22:45,092
I brought paper reference material.

654
00:22:45,212 --> 00:22:47,952
I brought maps of these parks that I've never been to

655
00:22:47,952 --> 00:22:51,332
that Marissa and Justin brought back for me

656
00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:53,012
a couple of years ago with the Tippie Blue.

657
00:22:53,192 --> 00:22:54,392
I think, here's what I think is gonna happen.

658
00:22:54,392 --> 00:22:56,492
I'm gonna leave about an hour and a half in

659
00:22:56,492 --> 00:22:59,192
and the podcast will continue for about

660
00:22:59,192 --> 00:23:01,152
three and a half hours beyond that.

661
00:23:01,152 --> 00:23:01,812
We have to.

662
00:23:01,932 --> 00:23:03,512
And then I will be the Scott.

663
00:23:04,512 --> 00:23:05,492
We'll be the Scott.

664
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:07,892
We're all just replacing each other.

665
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:10,152
We're all trying to fill each other's roles.

666
00:23:11,252 --> 00:23:14,272
Slowly but surely my shirt I'm wearing now

667
00:23:14,272 --> 00:23:16,492
will turn into a short sleeve button up.

668
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:18,412
It'll sprout a collar.

669
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,372
And then we're just going into,

670
00:23:21,752 --> 00:23:23,772
because we have the right number for this production,

671
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:26,272
a production of David Mamet's Speed the Plow.

672
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:27,252
Speed the Plow.

673
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:30,092
He was play two men, one women.

674
00:23:30,432 --> 00:23:33,912
Really is only Jason and me type reference.

675
00:23:34,092 --> 00:23:34,652
Yeah.

676
00:23:34,772 --> 00:23:35,772
I mean I know of it.

677
00:23:35,852 --> 00:23:38,772
The spheres of people's, yeah.

678
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:40,652
Topic scenarios of interest.

679
00:23:41,032 --> 00:23:42,492
Mine doesn't cross into David Mamet.

680
00:23:42,512 --> 00:23:42,852
I would bet.

681
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:43,992
Various Venn diagrams.

682
00:23:44,252 --> 00:23:46,312
I think it's a safe bet there's some Broadway people

683
00:23:46,312 --> 00:23:47,112
in our audience.

684
00:23:47,312 --> 00:23:48,592
I know there's some in your audience.

685
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:48,972
Sure.

686
00:23:49,312 --> 00:23:50,032
On your podcast.

687
00:23:50,092 --> 00:23:50,532
Some what?

688
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:51,392
Some theater people?

689
00:23:51,392 --> 00:23:52,672
Broadway people he's saying.

690
00:23:52,712 --> 00:23:53,852
People that like Broadway.

691
00:23:54,412 --> 00:23:54,912
For sure.

692
00:23:56,052 --> 00:23:58,132
Yeah this is, we're gonna try to do,

693
00:23:58,192 --> 00:24:00,232
I mean we went to Pearl Land which is like

694
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:00,852
should be an episode.

695
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:01,812
Maybe we'll do Pearl Land.

696
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:03,292
Are you guys going in April?

697
00:24:03,352 --> 00:24:03,872
Yeah yeah.

698
00:24:03,972 --> 00:24:05,632
So maybe we'll do Pearl Land then.

699
00:24:05,692 --> 00:24:07,472
We all get together when we're back.

700
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,212
When we're all back.

701
00:24:08,332 --> 00:24:09,152
We'll do it again.

702
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:09,792
Yep yep.

703
00:24:09,932 --> 00:24:10,192
With Aaron.

704
00:24:10,272 --> 00:24:12,272
So we won't, yeah right.

705
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,312
With Aaron we'll come on.

706
00:24:13,392 --> 00:24:13,892
We'll do five.

707
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:14,492
Sure who cares.

708
00:24:14,492 --> 00:24:15,492
We've done five before.

709
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,732
It's yeah Pearl Land's great.

710
00:24:19,152 --> 00:24:20,592
So we went to Japan.

711
00:24:20,612 --> 00:24:21,512
We should start now.

712
00:24:21,632 --> 00:24:22,052
Yeah.

713
00:24:22,052 --> 00:24:22,932
We went to Japan.

714
00:24:22,932 --> 00:24:25,652
We'll talk a little bit about the trip.

715
00:24:25,772 --> 00:24:28,392
The trip started out a little rocky

716
00:24:28,392 --> 00:24:29,992
for a couple, like three reasons.

717
00:24:30,032 --> 00:24:31,992
First of all there was a massive hurricane.

718
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:32,552
Intensely struck.

719
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:34,012
No no no no.

720
00:24:34,012 --> 00:24:34,312
Typhoon.

721
00:24:34,312 --> 00:24:35,512
Typhoon you're right sorry.

722
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:37,912
Massive typhoon the day before.

723
00:24:38,012 --> 00:24:40,092
Flights getting canceled constantly.

724
00:24:40,552 --> 00:24:42,292
Which my dad texted me about.

725
00:24:42,692 --> 00:24:44,952
He's like hey isn't Mike going to Japan this week?

726
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:47,372
Does he know there's a massive typhoon?

727
00:24:47,372 --> 00:24:48,152
Massive typhoon.

728
00:24:48,172 --> 00:24:50,652
The day before Lindsey's mom would come up

729
00:24:50,652 --> 00:24:53,652
to watch the dog and it was like,

730
00:24:53,912 --> 00:24:55,372
we were like what are we gonna do

731
00:24:55,372 --> 00:24:56,492
if the flight is just canceled?

732
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:58,632
Because like at International it's a little bit more

733
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:00,932
of a to do than just a regular.

734
00:25:01,212 --> 00:25:03,152
And I was like can we get on a trip,

735
00:25:03,492 --> 00:25:04,912
can we get on a plane to Orlando?

736
00:25:05,232 --> 00:25:06,592
But there was also a hurricane.

737
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:09,132
But there was also a hurricane happening in Florida.

738
00:25:10,872 --> 00:25:11,872
So we were like okay.

739
00:25:11,872 --> 00:25:14,872
And it was truly like the typhoon was the likes

740
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:18,532
of which Japan hadn't seen in 25 years.

741
00:25:18,532 --> 00:25:19,092
Oh come on.

742
00:25:19,092 --> 00:25:20,752
It was a bad typhoon.

743
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,452
So I just hit the dog.

744
00:25:23,012 --> 00:25:24,412
I just punched the dog in the head accidentally.

745
00:25:24,432 --> 00:25:26,112
He's fine.

746
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,432
Is that evidence that he should give it to you?

747
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:32,592
I brushed up against his tail with my foot earlier

748
00:25:32,592 --> 00:25:34,612
and everyone was like hey watch the foot.

749
00:25:34,772 --> 00:25:38,872
And even the dog like nudged me a little at the end.

750
00:25:38,892 --> 00:25:40,672
Well the dog liked me punching him in the head.

751
00:25:40,892 --> 00:25:42,352
So that was the difference there.

752
00:25:42,532 --> 00:25:45,332
The dog has also been taught not to expect as much love.

753
00:25:45,992 --> 00:25:46,772
Oh okay.

754
00:25:47,452 --> 00:25:50,012
You only give the dog Duffy presents.

755
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:51,692
Look I am withholding, that's true.

756
00:25:51,712 --> 00:25:53,432
That's why sometimes when I come over.

757
00:25:53,432 --> 00:25:54,452
Nick Mundy called me withholding years ago

758
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,132
and that's true so I come to that.

759
00:25:56,152 --> 00:25:58,052
Yeah he says you aren't supportive with your laughs.

760
00:25:58,212 --> 00:25:58,932
That's what Nick Mundy said.

761
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:00,712
That is what he said yes I am not supportive.

762
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:01,892
And Lindsay agrees with him.

763
00:26:01,932 --> 00:26:04,672
I've always thought you were very supportive of,

764
00:26:05,412 --> 00:26:06,612
at least of my bullshit.

765
00:26:07,272 --> 00:26:09,412
Oh that's because you're a goofy little character.

766
00:26:09,832 --> 00:26:10,872
I am, I'm a real pad.

767
00:26:10,932 --> 00:26:13,252
He laughs at goofy characters

768
00:26:13,252 --> 00:26:17,912
not so much as hilarious comments that I make.

769
00:26:19,112 --> 00:26:19,992
I laugh.

770
00:26:20,492 --> 00:26:22,012
This kind of explains why sometimes

771
00:26:22,012 --> 00:26:23,052
when I come over and sit down

772
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:25,972
the dog pretty much throws himself into my lap.

773
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,652
Like just plops down and it's adorable.

774
00:26:28,892 --> 00:26:31,932
Michael pets Edwin all day long.

775
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:34,652
whereas I can really only do about 30 seconds.

776
00:26:34,732 --> 00:26:36,312
Why are you staring at me speaking of?

777
00:26:36,332 --> 00:26:38,392
She's talking to the dog not me.

778
00:26:38,832 --> 00:26:40,352
Or any of us.

779
00:26:41,552 --> 00:26:43,072
Edwin wandered over here.

780
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:44,492
Typhoon.

781
00:26:44,752 --> 00:26:45,372
Yes anyway the typhoon.

782
00:26:45,652 --> 00:26:47,912
So we're like well we'll just play it by ear.

783
00:26:48,172 --> 00:26:48,932
Obviously there's nothing else we can do.

784
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,592
So everything seemed fine.

785
00:26:50,592 --> 00:26:51,752
We went to the airport.

786
00:26:51,892 --> 00:26:53,312
We made okay time.

787
00:26:53,532 --> 00:26:54,792
We got into the lounge

788
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:56,232
because I've talked about the chase point,

789
00:26:56,312 --> 00:26:58,272
the chase credit card I have that gets access to the lounge.

790
00:26:58,292 --> 00:26:59,172
I guess I leave now.

791
00:26:59,252 --> 00:27:02,672
Actually we didn't even make okay time

792
00:27:02,672 --> 00:27:04,552
because we barely missed that bus.

793
00:27:04,572 --> 00:27:06,192
Yes but I'm saying we barely made,

794
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:08,572
we made at least for 35 minutes in the lounge

795
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:11,492
which Jason would love because there's free food there

796
00:27:11,492 --> 00:27:12,792
and as much as you want.

797
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:13,652
Wait, wait, hold on.

798
00:27:13,672 --> 00:27:15,072
What bus did you take the flyway?

799
00:27:15,252 --> 00:27:16,092
Yeah but we were like

800
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,512
we should have been five minutes earlier.

801
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:20,252
You're going to the greatest theme park on the planet

802
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:23,252
and we're talking about the bus to the croissant place.

803
00:27:24,112 --> 00:27:26,632
Well because the flyway is much more reliable

804
00:27:26,632 --> 00:27:27,572
than the hot water.

805
00:27:28,332 --> 00:27:31,012
I'm also setting up a big thing.

806
00:27:31,552 --> 00:27:32,832
So we're in the lounge.

807
00:27:32,892 --> 00:27:35,332
We're having a nice little relaxing food.

808
00:27:35,512 --> 00:27:36,872
I'm like now I'm like yeah this is great.

809
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:39,052
It seems like the trip's gonna be great or whatever.

810
00:27:39,312 --> 00:27:42,692
In the middle of eating you say something to me

811
00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:45,292
that just shoots my blood pressure through the roof.

812
00:27:45,572 --> 00:27:47,832
This is after mine is already shot through the roof.

813
00:27:47,852 --> 00:27:49,032
Of course because you realized it,

814
00:27:49,132 --> 00:27:50,712
of course because it was happening to you.

815
00:27:50,992 --> 00:27:53,032
So all of a sudden and I'm not sure

816
00:27:53,032 --> 00:27:54,552
what triggered the realization

817
00:27:54,552 --> 00:28:01,092
but I realized that I have left all of my psych meds at home.

818
00:28:01,452 --> 00:28:03,832
I am on two mood stabilizers

819
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:06,972
and I have left all of them at home.

820
00:28:07,092 --> 00:28:09,332
It was crazy.

821
00:28:09,372 --> 00:28:14,252
I had to hold onto the table as I realized it.

822
00:28:14,312 --> 00:28:16,752
I was like no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

823
00:28:16,752 --> 00:28:17,252
No!

824
00:28:17,852 --> 00:28:19,972
And you're in this dreamed about Michael.

825
00:28:20,252 --> 00:28:21,412
It's crazy.

826
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:23,692
Well I'm just saying it was a crazy intense.

827
00:28:23,712 --> 00:28:26,172
I'm not crazy as fine.

828
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,552
The Chase lounge is a dream to be in.

829
00:28:29,052 --> 00:28:30,492
That's my word and I say it's okay.

830
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:32,752
Well it wasn't a Chase specific lounge.

831
00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:33,412
It was a different airline.

832
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:34,792
They don't have their own lounges Scott.

833
00:28:34,872 --> 00:28:37,792
I've explained this to you via text several times.

834
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:39,652
Here is your favorite subject.

835
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,852
It's called the priority pass.

836
00:28:42,212 --> 00:28:45,632
Anyway, so at that point, yeah I'm getting on the phone

837
00:28:45,632 --> 00:28:46,972
seeing if we can delay the trip,

838
00:28:46,972 --> 00:28:48,412
seeing if there's any like situation,

839
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:50,312
like what are the options here?

840
00:28:50,432 --> 00:28:53,492
I'm calling to see if Kaiser can mail me my medication.

841
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:54,612
The answer is no.

842
00:28:54,972 --> 00:28:57,632
Is there a post mates for psych meds?

843
00:28:57,752 --> 00:29:00,272
My sister was like how much time do you have?

844
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:01,332
I'll drive down there.

845
00:29:01,592 --> 00:29:04,072
And if we had made that fly away,

846
00:29:04,312 --> 00:29:07,052
she might have been able to make it there with my meds

847
00:29:07,052 --> 00:29:10,232
but as it was, there wasn't enough time.

848
00:29:10,392 --> 00:29:12,592
So we're like walking and like,

849
00:29:12,672 --> 00:29:14,172
we're walking toward the terminal

850
00:29:14,172 --> 00:29:15,852
because like the flight is about to leave.

851
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:20,032
Like everyone had boarded like the commotion

852
00:29:20,032 --> 00:29:21,912
and the calamity of like getting on the phone

853
00:29:21,912 --> 00:29:23,412
and you trying to figure everything out.

854
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:25,212
I looked and I was like, we have to,

855
00:29:25,312 --> 00:29:26,412
if we're getting on a plane,

856
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,292
we need to go to the plane now.

857
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:29,712
So we're walking and like,

858
00:29:29,732 --> 00:29:31,432
I'm saying I don't think we should go.

859
00:29:31,512 --> 00:29:34,612
I think we should stop because like you need those meds.

860
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:36,152
Those meds are important.

861
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:38,412
And it's also not just that I need them

862
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:41,332
but if I go off of them, you go into withdrawal.

863
00:29:41,332 --> 00:29:42,032
Yes.

864
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:46,332
And then I would have had to slowly get back onto them

865
00:29:46,332 --> 00:29:47,452
when we got back.

866
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:49,552
So I'm like in a blind panic.

867
00:29:49,592 --> 00:29:52,812
It seems to me like my mom is gonna be able to ship them

868
00:29:52,812 --> 00:29:55,372
next day by UPS but I'm not positive.

869
00:29:55,672 --> 00:29:56,412
And so.

870
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:58,512
So we're at the counter.

871
00:29:58,652 --> 00:30:00,832
Everyone has boarded the plane.

872
00:30:01,152 --> 00:30:02,192
There's no one else.

873
00:30:02,372 --> 00:30:04,292
We're there waiting for us to get on the plane

874
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:05,852
and we're at the desk and like,

875
00:30:05,932 --> 00:30:08,792
we're like not thinking completely straight.

876
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:11,032
And then we're like, can we get on another flight?

877
00:30:11,192 --> 00:30:11,852
Is there like something like,

878
00:30:11,932 --> 00:30:14,252
this is the only flight today you'd have to call,

879
00:30:14,432 --> 00:30:15,352
you booked it through American.

880
00:30:15,472 --> 00:30:16,712
We were on a Japan Airlines flight.

881
00:30:16,912 --> 00:30:17,952
You have to call American.

882
00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:20,752
They can maybe see what you can do.

883
00:30:21,072 --> 00:30:23,652
And then you were, and you started going, I will be fine.

884
00:30:23,932 --> 00:30:25,032
I'm gonna be fine.

885
00:30:25,152 --> 00:30:27,392
Well, that's because I had made the mistake

886
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:30,592
of telling her in hopes that like,

887
00:30:30,812 --> 00:30:35,232
it might help us get a different flight.

888
00:30:35,272 --> 00:30:35,452
Yeah.

889
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,072
Kind of.

890
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,252
I go up and I say, a medical emergency has come up.

891
00:30:39,252 --> 00:30:42,852
I realized that I didn't bring my medication with me

892
00:30:42,852 --> 00:30:46,752
and they now think I'm gonna have a fucking seizure

893
00:30:46,752 --> 00:30:47,932
on the plane or something.

894
00:30:47,952 --> 00:30:50,032
And so then I have to keep reassuring them like,

895
00:30:50,232 --> 00:30:51,492
no, no, no, I'm gonna be fine.

896
00:30:51,512 --> 00:30:52,192
I'm fine.

897
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:52,832
I'm fine.

898
00:30:53,512 --> 00:30:56,632
That you should not use the term medical emergency

899
00:30:56,632 --> 00:31:00,232
if there's not a true medical emergency happening

900
00:31:00,832 --> 00:31:01,792
in front of an airplane.

901
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:04,692
So then you were like, we need to,

902
00:31:04,692 --> 00:31:06,372
after it was clear that like there's not,

903
00:31:06,452 --> 00:31:08,032
cause we were hoping, oh, maybe there's a flight

904
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,352
that leaves in three hours we can get on or something.

905
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,852
Cause then everything won't be affected,

906
00:31:12,112 --> 00:31:12,912
which of course there's not.

907
00:31:13,232 --> 00:31:15,332
Yeah, one of those international flights.

908
00:31:15,652 --> 00:31:16,512
Yeah, they fly in Japan.

909
00:31:16,872 --> 00:31:17,752
It's a popular country.

910
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,572
It's LAX Tokyo, you don't know, whatever.

911
00:31:20,532 --> 00:31:21,772
So once it was clear that like,

912
00:31:22,152 --> 00:31:23,172
cause then at that point I was like,

913
00:31:23,232 --> 00:31:26,512
if it's a day or two delayed, like we should probably cancel.

914
00:31:26,772 --> 00:31:28,692
Like I don't like, we have a certain, whatever.

915
00:31:29,112 --> 00:31:30,852
So then you were like, no, well, I'll be fine.

916
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:31,712
We'll figure it out.

917
00:31:31,712 --> 00:31:32,912
I was like, are you sure?

918
00:31:33,872 --> 00:31:35,652
And then the two women are like,

919
00:31:36,232 --> 00:31:37,672
are medical emergency,

920
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:40,352
are you gonna be okay on this flight?

921
00:31:40,392 --> 00:31:41,772
And then we would be like, no, no, it's fine.

922
00:31:41,852 --> 00:31:42,812
It's gonna be great.

923
00:31:42,952 --> 00:31:45,372
I was like, no, I just meant, I just meant,

924
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:47,312
I need it, but like I'm not gonna have a fit.

925
00:31:47,332 --> 00:31:48,372
She does this all the time.

926
00:31:48,372 --> 00:31:49,792
You are embarrassing me.

927
00:31:51,592 --> 00:31:53,072
So we get on the, again,

928
00:31:53,152 --> 00:31:55,152
I think for sure the last two people.

929
00:31:55,272 --> 00:31:55,812
Yeah, I think so.

930
00:31:55,812 --> 00:31:58,172
And they closed the door behind us.

931
00:31:58,172 --> 00:32:00,912
When we're like on the plane, I'm just like, oh my God.

932
00:32:01,312 --> 00:32:02,852
Like what's gonna, cause we don't know.

933
00:32:03,152 --> 00:32:03,612
Like they're like.

934
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:06,132
This is sort of the behavior they expect

935
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,912
from two Wile Guy Jinn coming to their country.

936
00:32:10,372 --> 00:32:10,632
What?

937
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:12,492
Blanking on your.

938
00:32:12,492 --> 00:32:13,212
Well that's a.

939
00:32:13,552 --> 00:32:14,292
Guy Jinn or what they call,

940
00:32:14,352 --> 00:32:16,472
that's what they call white people.

941
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:17,912
That's what they're called in Japan.

942
00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:20,872
I was convinced you were making a Star Wars reference.

943
00:32:21,292 --> 00:32:21,892
Yeah, it's just.

944
00:32:22,412 --> 00:32:23,172
Wile Guy Jinn.

945
00:32:23,972 --> 00:32:24,632
Wile Guy Jinn.

946
00:32:24,632 --> 00:32:25,212
Famous character.

947
00:32:26,092 --> 00:32:26,592
It's a.

948
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:27,472
He'll be on Batu.

949
00:32:28,492 --> 00:32:31,252
Yeah, non-Japanese and foreign people is what they call them.

950
00:32:31,252 --> 00:32:34,412
I know the term because they use it in wrestling over there.

951
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,212
Which is a brief thing we'll touch on.

952
00:32:36,492 --> 00:32:37,412
So we get on the plane

953
00:32:37,412 --> 00:32:40,492
and the Japan Airlines flight I enjoyed.

954
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:41,512
I kind of enjoyed myself.

955
00:32:41,512 --> 00:32:41,892
It was great.

956
00:32:41,972 --> 00:32:42,972
It was fun, we were in economy,

957
00:32:43,032 --> 00:32:44,552
but like there was a decent amount of leg room.

958
00:32:44,572 --> 00:32:45,772
I kind of took a nap.

959
00:32:46,212 --> 00:32:47,512
There was that weird Mickey game.

960
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:48,872
If anyone follows me on Twitter,

961
00:32:49,172 --> 00:32:51,352
where you have to like fix Mickey's pipes

962
00:32:51,352 --> 00:32:52,772
before he's having a party.

963
00:32:53,452 --> 00:32:56,772
And I finished half of Les Miserables.

964
00:32:56,912 --> 00:32:58,732
Yeah, and then I was taking a nap

965
00:32:58,732 --> 00:33:02,172
and I realized that, man, my nose is really running.

966
00:33:02,692 --> 00:33:04,532
And by the end of the flight, I was sick.

967
00:33:04,592 --> 00:33:07,452
I had a cold, not a bad cold, but a minor cold.

968
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:10,132
But I was like, we got off in Tokyo.

969
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:10,712
It's a long flight.

970
00:33:10,712 --> 00:33:12,732
There's no such thing as a minor cold with you.

971
00:33:12,812 --> 00:33:13,352
I understand.

972
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:16,312
I'm also a pain in the ass when I'm sick of any kind.

973
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,472
Like any type of sick.

974
00:33:17,572 --> 00:33:18,552
You get so upset.

975
00:33:19,192 --> 00:33:20,332
I really, yeah, I hate it.

976
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:23,932
I think I was always very scared as a kid of being sick.

977
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:27,672
So I blame it on my mom, I guess,

978
00:33:27,832 --> 00:33:30,172
for really being like, you shouldn't go to school

979
00:33:30,172 --> 00:33:31,312
if you're even sick at all.

980
00:33:31,772 --> 00:33:32,652
It's a big deal.

981
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,612
You stay here and you sleep and you get better.

982
00:33:36,072 --> 00:33:37,252
See, I got the opposite.

983
00:33:37,492 --> 00:33:39,532
I was like, I think you're fine.

984
00:33:39,832 --> 00:33:42,372
Because sometimes it would make myself sick with worry.

985
00:33:42,552 --> 00:33:43,832
Well, that would do that too, sure.

986
00:33:43,852 --> 00:33:46,932
If we get you a little breakfast and get you on the bus

987
00:33:46,932 --> 00:33:49,452
and get you set, get you in sick school,

988
00:33:49,532 --> 00:33:50,492
you will feel better.

989
00:33:50,752 --> 00:33:51,892
Usually, right.

990
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:52,672
Sure.

991
00:33:52,712 --> 00:33:56,352
So your medication, treats, was established at an early age.

992
00:33:57,552 --> 00:33:58,812
A big plate of waffles.

993
00:33:59,952 --> 00:34:00,272
Yes.

994
00:34:00,632 --> 00:34:03,532
Yeah, I mean, basically, what you ate as a child

995
00:34:03,532 --> 00:34:06,032
in the 90s for breakfast before school

996
00:34:06,032 --> 00:34:08,932
was sugary cereal or waffles covered in syrup

997
00:34:08,932 --> 00:34:13,772
or, in my case, a lot of Jimmy Dean-based sausage.

998
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:16,492
Sausage on a stick wrapped in pancake.

999
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:17,092
Sounds right.

1000
00:34:17,132 --> 00:34:19,532
Oh, did you have the pancake, the rat,

1001
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:21,752
like the pig in a blanket on a stick that Jimmy Dean made?

1002
00:34:21,752 --> 00:34:23,852
Yeah, that was also, that wasn't,

1003
00:34:23,892 --> 00:34:24,992
they had been around for years.

1004
00:34:25,072 --> 00:34:25,452
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1005
00:34:25,452 --> 00:34:27,532
The Daily Show did a whole bit about this.

1006
00:34:27,652 --> 00:34:28,032
Yeah.

1007
00:34:28,552 --> 00:34:30,232
But I was eating pancakes.

1008
00:34:30,712 --> 00:34:34,352
It was like a breakfast sausage link on a stick.

1009
00:34:34,652 --> 00:34:35,252
Yeah, like a corn dog.

1010
00:34:35,272 --> 00:34:36,172
It was a breakfast corn dog.

1011
00:34:36,172 --> 00:34:37,392
And then pancake wrapped around it

1012
00:34:37,392 --> 00:34:38,812
and you would dip it in syrup.

1013
00:34:39,252 --> 00:34:42,312
Reminder, this episode is about the greatest theme park

1014
00:34:42,312 --> 00:34:43,032
on the planet.

1015
00:34:43,752 --> 00:34:45,152
Just want to remind you.

1016
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:46,872
And we are talking about Jimmy Dean.

1017
00:34:46,872 --> 00:34:49,032
John Stewart got ahold of this.

1018
00:34:49,112 --> 00:34:50,412
We're painting a picture, Scott.

1019
00:34:50,972 --> 00:34:53,532
Four years ago and was like, isn't this insane?

1020
00:34:53,752 --> 00:34:56,472
And it's like, that has been around since 1992.

1021
00:34:56,912 --> 00:34:58,072
Like it's like not a new.

1022
00:34:58,312 --> 00:35:00,892
Anyway, that was, you ate that every day, got it.

1023
00:35:01,152 --> 00:35:02,112
So we're on the line.

1024
00:35:02,112 --> 00:35:02,752
We're lined up.

1025
00:35:03,272 --> 00:35:03,792
We get big boy.

1026
00:35:03,992 --> 00:35:04,912
So we're in,

1027
00:35:04,912 --> 00:35:08,392
we're in Tokyo, we're in the airport.

1028
00:35:08,832 --> 00:35:11,572
And like people gave us so much good stuff to like recommend

1029
00:35:11,572 --> 00:35:14,172
but there's still, there could have been a better paragraph

1030
00:35:14,172 --> 00:35:17,452
about navigating where to go out of the airport

1031
00:35:17,452 --> 00:35:19,612
because it's an hour away from Tokyo itself.

1032
00:35:19,832 --> 00:35:21,512
So like I'm in a haze.

1033
00:35:21,512 --> 00:35:23,352
I'm very cranky now because I'm worried.

1034
00:35:23,352 --> 00:35:24,052
I'm sick.

1035
00:35:24,392 --> 00:35:26,472
You're meds who knows what's going to happen.

1036
00:35:26,472 --> 00:35:29,932
Yeah, both of our brains are just taken up by other things.

1037
00:35:29,932 --> 00:35:33,272
And then we're like just staring around at everything.

1038
00:35:33,672 --> 00:35:35,792
And so many things are in English and it's,

1039
00:35:35,992 --> 00:35:37,332
it was amazing to me.

1040
00:35:37,372 --> 00:35:39,232
I was like, wow, we are being catered to

1041
00:35:39,232 --> 00:35:40,572
in a way that we do not deserve.

1042
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:43,112
It's so much easier than it feels right when you get there.

1043
00:35:43,132 --> 00:35:46,412
Yeah, but there's just so much going on

1044
00:35:46,412 --> 00:35:48,812
and we're like barely able to think.

1045
00:35:48,912 --> 00:35:50,472
Yes, so we got there.

1046
00:35:50,652 --> 00:35:51,832
We do figure it out.

1047
00:35:51,832 --> 00:35:54,772
We get yen, we exchange or whatever, get to the hotel.

1048
00:35:54,772 --> 00:35:59,192
We stayed in a very tiny room hotel.

1049
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:03,832
And it's insanely, like two sides of the bed

1050
00:36:03,832 --> 00:36:05,092
were not accessible.

1051
00:36:05,692 --> 00:36:06,792
Only one side of the bed.

1052
00:36:06,872 --> 00:36:07,992
There was only one side of the bed.

1053
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:09,912
Three sides of the bed weren't, there was only one side.

1054
00:36:09,912 --> 00:36:11,212
Oh yes, yes, you're right.

1055
00:36:11,232 --> 00:36:13,452
I mean, I'm thinking the headboard part is never accessible.

1056
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:16,132
But you did make sure you didn't sleep in the entryway.

1057
00:36:16,272 --> 00:36:18,552
Oh, I always climb over a headboard to get into bed.

1058
00:36:19,372 --> 00:36:21,012
But you don't notice that.

1059
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,152
I guess I didn't.

1060
00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:25,752
You didn't sleep just in the hallway like the Hills did

1061
00:36:25,752 --> 00:36:27,952
on that great two parking the Hill episode

1062
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:28,872
or where they go to Japan.

1063
00:36:29,012 --> 00:36:31,232
We saw those different hotels where you're in a pod

1064
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:32,772
or something, but we did not do that.

1065
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:35,232
But that would have been almost the same.

1066
00:36:35,232 --> 00:36:37,852
Yeah, I was gonna say it felt like.

1067
00:36:37,992 --> 00:36:39,072
It wouldn't have been much different.

1068
00:36:40,892 --> 00:36:41,632
And you're tall.

1069
00:36:41,872 --> 00:36:42,932
It was just like too much.

1070
00:36:42,972 --> 00:36:43,672
It was too small.

1071
00:36:43,732 --> 00:36:44,972
And especially like sick, whatever.

1072
00:36:44,972 --> 00:36:46,072
Excuse me, not enough, not too much.

1073
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:47,212
So we figured, yes.

1074
00:36:47,492 --> 00:36:48,572
So we figured, thank you.

1075
00:36:49,052 --> 00:36:50,452
We figured out the next day,

1076
00:36:50,712 --> 00:36:52,352
like we were looking at websites online

1077
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,952
and there are two websites that specialize

1078
00:36:53,952 --> 00:36:57,452
in getting drugs to you if you've lost your drugs

1079
00:36:57,452 --> 00:37:00,032
or forgotten them and you're in a foreign country.

1080
00:37:00,112 --> 00:37:00,452
Whoa.

1081
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,752
So we found a thing and you called

1082
00:37:02,752 --> 00:37:04,592
and it was like go to this doctor.

1083
00:37:04,812 --> 00:37:06,492
It wasn't shady at all either.

1084
00:37:06,732 --> 00:37:06,892
No, no.

1085
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,192
I was worried it was gonna be some weird.

1086
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,652
Well, you found the site.

1087
00:37:09,712 --> 00:37:11,132
Like we both found stuff,

1088
00:37:11,192 --> 00:37:13,472
but I liked the one that you found more.

1089
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:14,972
And I call and there's a clinic

1090
00:37:14,972 --> 00:37:17,292
and we were able to go in two hours.

1091
00:37:17,772 --> 00:37:20,492
And I saw a doctor.

1092
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:25,372
I paid like 30 American dollars to see the doctor.

1093
00:37:25,372 --> 00:37:26,832
It was like a copay.

1094
00:37:27,032 --> 00:37:30,652
All he did was I showed him my prescription off my phone

1095
00:37:30,652 --> 00:37:35,312
and he wrote up a new prescription with the,

1096
00:37:35,312 --> 00:37:37,352
you know, formulaic equivalent

1097
00:37:37,352 --> 00:37:40,172
and I paid like a hundred bucks

1098
00:37:40,172 --> 00:37:42,232
for seven days worth of my two medications.

1099
00:37:42,672 --> 00:37:42,852
Yeah.

1100
00:37:43,392 --> 00:37:44,432
So thank God.

1101
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:48,752
But also the harm was already done.

1102
00:37:49,192 --> 00:37:49,772
Yeah.

1103
00:37:50,532 --> 00:37:51,052
What do you mean?

1104
00:37:51,332 --> 00:37:54,492
Well, I mean in like missing a day or so

1105
00:37:54,492 --> 00:37:57,072
and in the medications being slightly different.

1106
00:37:57,232 --> 00:37:58,372
So even if it's equivalent,

1107
00:37:58,412 --> 00:38:00,472
I don't know how much you guys know about medication,

1108
00:38:00,492 --> 00:38:03,472
but even if it's equivalent when it comes to psych meds,

1109
00:38:03,472 --> 00:38:05,712
you might not respond to it exactly the same.

1110
00:38:06,152 --> 00:38:09,332
So I spent the trip still being like kind of like

1111
00:38:09,332 --> 00:38:11,872
with racing thoughts and paranoia

1112
00:38:12,052 --> 00:38:14,012
and not being able to get to sleep at night.

1113
00:38:14,032 --> 00:38:15,852
It was better than nothing.

1114
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:16,432
Yes.

1115
00:38:16,512 --> 00:38:17,132
For sure.

1116
00:38:17,552 --> 00:38:18,752
So, but still, yeah.

1117
00:38:18,832 --> 00:38:19,832
So you were so mixed up.

1118
00:38:19,832 --> 00:38:22,092
You thought Gelatoni was the best bear.

1119
00:38:22,352 --> 00:38:22,892
Yeah.

1120
00:38:22,892 --> 00:38:24,312
And Gelatoni, he's a cat.

1121
00:38:24,472 --> 00:38:24,852
Is he not?

1122
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:25,492
Oh, far right.

1123
00:38:26,252 --> 00:38:26,792
I have no idea.

1124
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:28,152
Oh, I thought that was part of the joke.

1125
00:38:28,232 --> 00:38:30,572
I was like, yeah, I thought a cat was a bear.

1126
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,072
I don't, I haven't far from,

1127
00:38:33,172 --> 00:38:35,012
I haven't been quizzed about the Duffy.

1128
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:36,892
Yeah, I don't, I haven't quizzed you about that.

1129
00:38:37,172 --> 00:38:39,312
This all plays into my theory that as Mike gets older,

1130
00:38:39,312 --> 00:38:44,692
he gets more caught up in hijinks than when we were younger.

1131
00:38:44,832 --> 00:38:47,012
And he like, Mike, cause we have friends who deal,

1132
00:38:47,332 --> 00:38:50,092
feel like they have a lot of hijinks going on

1133
00:38:50,092 --> 00:38:52,132
in like anytime they have planning stuff.

1134
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,852
And Mike seems to like.

1135
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:54,412
Oh.

1136
00:38:54,412 --> 00:38:55,012
Yeah, me too.

1137
00:38:55,112 --> 00:38:56,612
I was gonna say it depends.

1138
00:38:56,892 --> 00:38:57,072
I think.

1139
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,432
Well, this was my hijink.

1140
00:38:58,432 --> 00:38:59,812
If you want to refer to

1141
00:38:59,812 --> 00:39:05,252
forgetting my necessary psych meds as a hijink, Jason.

1142
00:39:05,992 --> 00:39:08,612
What a fun little like, wow.

1143
00:39:08,912 --> 00:39:10,832
Boy, I'm really up to something now.

1144
00:39:11,012 --> 00:39:12,752
Like, cause I like move my arm.

1145
00:39:13,092 --> 00:39:16,932
I'm saying you got caught in the orbits of his hijinks.

1146
00:39:17,352 --> 00:39:18,572
No, this was my hijink.

1147
00:39:18,592 --> 00:39:21,892
There's people we know that seem very chaotic.

1148
00:39:22,592 --> 00:39:25,452
And I think that, I don't know.

1149
00:39:25,812 --> 00:39:28,072
I'm not, I know, I kind of know what you're saying,

1150
00:39:28,092 --> 00:39:31,112
but I don't think that chaos surrounds me.

1151
00:39:31,272 --> 00:39:32,072
Like some people we know.

1152
00:39:32,072 --> 00:39:33,852
No, I don't think it, I don't think it is,

1153
00:39:33,952 --> 00:39:37,472
but then I feel, I feel awful when I hear when you,

1154
00:39:37,812 --> 00:39:39,532
these sorts of things happen.

1155
00:39:39,772 --> 00:39:42,372
Cause I'm like, well, Mike's dealing with a hijink.

1156
00:39:42,532 --> 00:39:44,672
I'm so upset about Mike's hijink.

1157
00:39:44,752 --> 00:39:45,792
Mike's gotten himself a hijinks again.

1158
00:39:46,112 --> 00:39:48,272
I think of you, you are very responsible.

1159
00:39:48,272 --> 00:39:50,792
And you do plan well.

1160
00:39:51,052 --> 00:39:53,072
Yeah, I think sometimes maybe like,

1161
00:39:53,372 --> 00:39:56,772
my hijinks are like the city walk where I order a drink

1162
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:57,952
that's gross and too big,

1163
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,252
and I don't know how to throw it away.

1164
00:39:59,392 --> 00:40:01,152
I think I have like very low stakes hijinks.

1165
00:40:01,212 --> 00:40:03,052
Yeah, low stakes hijinks.

1166
00:40:03,352 --> 00:40:03,932
Like that.

1167
00:40:03,972 --> 00:40:05,992
I think that's maybe what you're talking about more.

1168
00:40:06,032 --> 00:40:06,512
Yeah, I think.

1169
00:40:06,512 --> 00:40:07,012
Yeah, okay.

1170
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:08,652
Cause I, cause yeah, I, oh no,

1171
00:40:09,232 --> 00:40:11,492
I ordered too big of a banana from,

1172
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:13,732
from the popcornopolis.

1173
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:15,192
How am I going to eat this big banana?

1174
00:40:15,732 --> 00:40:17,652
Oh no, I forgot my psych meds.

1175
00:40:17,772 --> 00:40:18,352
Whoa!

1176
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,312
Mike and Lindsay's Tokyo hijinks.

1177
00:40:22,512 --> 00:40:24,512
The Benny Hill theme plays as we're in and out

1178
00:40:24,512 --> 00:40:26,212
of Tokyo doctor's offices.

1179
00:40:26,912 --> 00:40:30,092
I mean, that is a game show over there.

1180
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:30,752
Like,

1181
00:40:31,692 --> 00:40:32,072
find your psych meds.

1182
00:40:32,072 --> 00:40:33,332
Depriving people of their psych meds.

1183
00:40:38,808 --> 00:40:39,808
Folks, it's Michael.

1184
00:40:40,108 --> 00:40:42,448
I'm back to interrupt all this wonderful theme park talk

1185
00:40:42,448 --> 00:40:45,568
to tell you just a little bit about a product called Eero Plus.

1186
00:40:45,808 --> 00:40:47,108
Now you're asking, what is Eero Plus?

1187
00:40:47,348 --> 00:40:49,348
Well, it is a home Wi-Fi system

1188
00:40:49,348 --> 00:40:51,928
and it's designed to provide simple, reliable security

1189
00:40:51,928 --> 00:40:53,548
that defends all your home's devices

1190
00:40:53,548 --> 00:40:55,068
against a growing number of threats,

1191
00:40:55,268 --> 00:40:57,908
such as malware, spyware, phishing attacks,

1192
00:40:58,028 --> 00:41:00,088
as well as unsuitable content.

1193
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:02,008
The combination of Eero with Eero Plus

1194
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:04,028
provides complete protection for your network

1195
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:06,448
and all the devices and those who use them

1196
00:41:06,448 --> 00:41:08,568
as they connect to the internet, all right?

1197
00:41:08,568 --> 00:41:10,608
Now you're asking, Mike, what is included?

1198
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:13,348
I will tell you, total network protection.

1199
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:15,608
Eero Plus offers the ability to block malicious

1200
00:41:15,608 --> 00:41:17,808
and unwanted content across your entire network.

1201
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:19,288
It's got advanced security.

1202
00:41:19,568 --> 00:41:20,668
It checks the sites you visit

1203
00:41:20,668 --> 00:41:22,768
against a database of millions of known threats.

1204
00:41:23,168 --> 00:41:25,208
Eero Plus prevents you from accidentally visiting

1205
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:27,908
malicious sites without slowing anything down.

1206
00:41:28,248 --> 00:41:29,628
It's got content blocking.

1207
00:41:29,968 --> 00:41:31,688
Eero Plus automatically tags sites

1208
00:41:31,688 --> 00:41:33,908
that contain violent, illegal, or adult content

1209
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:37,228
so you can choose what your kids can and cannot visit

1210
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,528
right in the Eero app.

1211
00:41:38,868 --> 00:41:42,108
It has also ad blocking, which gets rid of annoying ads

1212
00:41:42,108 --> 00:41:44,048
and pop-ups on all your devices.

1213
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:47,308
Ad blocking also improves load times for ad-heavy sites

1214
00:41:47,308 --> 00:41:50,888
so you can browse and stream faster than ever before.

1215
00:41:51,348 --> 00:41:52,968
It's got third-party security apps,

1216
00:41:53,248 --> 00:41:54,928
VPN protection from encrypt.me.

1217
00:41:55,108 --> 00:41:57,248
It's got password management from OnePassword

1218
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,748
and antivirus software for Malware Bytes.

1219
00:42:00,008 --> 00:42:01,108
All right, so you're saying, Mike,

1220
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:03,868
I have one single router in my living room.

1221
00:42:03,908 --> 00:42:05,008
That's how I've always done it.

1222
00:42:05,008 --> 00:42:07,608
And I say, no, that is archaic.

1223
00:42:07,728 --> 00:42:09,228
That is outdated, okay?

1224
00:42:09,468 --> 00:42:12,048
You need a whole distributed system like Eero Plus.

1225
00:42:12,308 --> 00:42:13,608
That's basically what people have been doing

1226
00:42:13,608 --> 00:42:15,008
in offices for years.

1227
00:42:15,348 --> 00:42:17,748
So now you have to get with the program is what I'm saying.

1228
00:42:18,228 --> 00:42:19,888
Here's another thing that's great about Eero.

1229
00:42:20,048 --> 00:42:21,468
It's got incredible customer support.

1230
00:42:21,668 --> 00:42:24,228
You can get somebody on the phone within like 30 seconds.

1231
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:26,648
I just tried to get on the phone with a ticket place.

1232
00:42:26,868 --> 00:42:29,668
It took me 30 minutes, not Eero Plus.

1233
00:42:30,168 --> 00:42:32,328
All right, so let me tell you about my personal experience.

1234
00:42:32,648 --> 00:42:33,648
I got the box.

1235
00:42:34,548 --> 00:42:36,068
First of all, the box is awesome.

1236
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:37,148
The box is very sleek.

1237
00:42:37,308 --> 00:42:38,988
It's very satisfying opening it up.

1238
00:42:39,288 --> 00:42:41,168
And it's like a very nice design,

1239
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:43,528
which also the product's very nicely designed.

1240
00:42:43,548 --> 00:42:44,208
It looks good.

1241
00:42:44,448 --> 00:42:46,608
So I take it, I start installing it.

1242
00:42:46,768 --> 00:42:48,788
15 minutes, that's crazy.

1243
00:42:48,868 --> 00:42:50,348
I thought it was gonna take me like three hours

1244
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:51,708
because I usually screw everything up.

1245
00:42:51,828 --> 00:42:55,608
I did not screw this up, and it's mostly because it was easy,

1246
00:42:55,748 --> 00:42:57,048
not because I'm skilled or anything.

1247
00:42:57,368 --> 00:42:58,608
So here's the thing.

1248
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,428
I had a dead spot as far as Wi-Fi was concerned

1249
00:43:01,428 --> 00:43:03,348
in this room where I keep most of my toys.

1250
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:08,088
So now after Eero Plus, I can get Wi-Fi

1251
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:09,728
in the room where all my toys are.

1252
00:43:09,968 --> 00:43:11,208
So it's very good.

1253
00:43:11,668 --> 00:43:13,028
I highly recommend this thing.

1254
00:43:13,428 --> 00:43:15,388
And let me just tell you right now

1255
00:43:15,388 --> 00:43:18,508
about this special offer for podcast to ride listeners.

1256
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:21,008
You can get $100 off the Eero Base Unit

1257
00:43:21,008 --> 00:43:23,828
in two beacons packages and one year of Eero

1258
00:43:23,828 --> 00:43:27,308
if you visit Eero.com slash theme park

1259
00:43:27,308 --> 00:43:29,448
and at checkout, enter theme park.

1260
00:43:29,468 --> 00:43:31,928
I think you're gonna be very glad you did.

1261
00:43:31,928 --> 00:43:35,708
Make sure your figure room has full Wi-Fi coverage.

1262
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:42,708
So yeah, so we, luckily again, the cold was not so bad.

1263
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:45,728
Luckily you were working at like what, 70% capacity.

1264
00:43:45,868 --> 00:43:47,408
Yeah, sure. Something like that.

1265
00:43:47,568 --> 00:43:51,148
And then right across the street from the medical clinic

1266
00:43:51,148 --> 00:43:53,548
was the Tokyo Tower.

1267
00:43:53,728 --> 00:43:56,008
Yeah, so the Tokyo Tower, which is a landmark in Tokyo,

1268
00:43:56,048 --> 00:43:56,808
we had no idea.

1269
00:43:56,888 --> 00:43:58,008
It's actually not that famous,

1270
00:43:58,008 --> 00:43:59,708
but it looks exactly like the Eiffel Tower,

1271
00:43:59,828 --> 00:44:01,708
only it's orange. Except black and orange.

1272
00:44:02,008 --> 00:44:03,708
It was so weird. It's orange.

1273
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:08,448
So we'll try, this is very touristy themed experience.

1274
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,048
You go up to the top,

1275
00:44:10,068 --> 00:44:11,808
but we paid to go to the very top of it.

1276
00:44:12,168 --> 00:44:14,828
And before you go, there's a themed little show

1277
00:44:14,828 --> 00:44:17,588
where the creator of the Tokyo Tower

1278
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:20,448
talks to a different painting of another man.

1279
00:44:20,528 --> 00:44:22,108
It was actually very Disney.

1280
00:44:22,348 --> 00:44:24,248
It was fascinating. Yeah, very, very cool.

1281
00:44:24,248 --> 00:44:27,388
We got there and we're like, this is great.

1282
00:44:27,388 --> 00:44:30,648
You can feel when your Imagineering pre-show is happening

1283
00:44:30,648 --> 00:44:32,448
and that's definitely happened there.

1284
00:44:32,988 --> 00:44:35,428
And then you're wearing- Except all of the walls

1285
00:44:35,428 --> 00:44:37,288
of the little room we went in for,

1286
00:44:37,428 --> 00:44:41,248
the little Tokyo Tower creator guy

1287
00:44:41,248 --> 00:44:43,248
talking to you from a moving portrait.

1288
00:44:43,608 --> 00:44:46,688
There were these just 2D walls,

1289
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:49,568
just flat walls made to look like it was a library.

1290
00:44:50,008 --> 00:44:53,228
And then one of the books was Harry Potter.

1291
00:44:53,888 --> 00:44:54,948
Oh yeah. Not Harry Potter,

1292
00:44:55,188 --> 00:44:56,708
Harry Potter. Harry Potter.

1293
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:57,728
And you don't know what that,

1294
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:59,208
that wasn't a pun that was clear?

1295
00:44:59,388 --> 00:45:00,028
You didn't- Not clear.

1296
00:45:00,268 --> 00:45:00,828
No, I don't know.

1297
00:45:00,888 --> 00:45:04,848
I think it was, and not all the books had the titles clear,

1298
00:45:05,488 --> 00:45:07,768
but one jumped out at me and it was Harry Potter.

1299
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,748
So we have like headphones in

1300
00:45:10,748 --> 00:45:12,308
that had English translation of everything.

1301
00:45:12,308 --> 00:45:14,228
And you go up to this, the very top,

1302
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:16,188
which is scary a little bit.

1303
00:45:16,188 --> 00:45:18,168
You love it. You love those heights.

1304
00:45:18,368 --> 00:45:20,368
Yeah, I didn't- The elevator was scary.

1305
00:45:20,448 --> 00:45:21,828
The elevator is the scary part

1306
00:45:21,828 --> 00:45:23,228
because you're just like going in the middle

1307
00:45:23,228 --> 00:45:25,348
of the giant Tokyo Tower,

1308
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:26,428
which feels like the Eiffel Tower.

1309
00:45:27,148 --> 00:45:28,148
And then that was fun.

1310
00:45:28,568 --> 00:45:29,788
And there was, we should have,

1311
00:45:29,868 --> 00:45:33,748
there was a theme park in the Tokyo Tower we didn't go to

1312
00:45:33,748 --> 00:45:35,928
because we were trying to get to some other place

1313
00:45:35,928 --> 00:45:36,628
by six o'clock.

1314
00:45:36,648 --> 00:45:38,028
And this whole thing was just a-

1315
00:45:38,028 --> 00:45:39,288
Yeah, we were trying to get to Harajuku.

1316
00:45:39,308 --> 00:45:40,448
We were flying by the seat of our pants

1317
00:45:40,448 --> 00:45:42,488
because of the prescriptions and whatever.

1318
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,608
But there was a full like weird, not like,

1319
00:45:45,608 --> 00:45:46,668
it was like a- Not rides,

1320
00:45:46,988 --> 00:45:49,268
but like pirate themed theme park

1321
00:45:49,268 --> 00:45:50,948
that we almost went into, but we didn't have time.

1322
00:45:51,088 --> 00:45:52,308
There's a lot of that in Tokyo

1323
00:45:52,308 --> 00:45:54,468
where you all of a sudden just happen upon a theme park.

1324
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:57,308
And you're like, we don't have time for this theme park.

1325
00:45:57,508 --> 00:46:00,308
We can't, we're going to another theme park in two hours.

1326
00:46:00,368 --> 00:46:03,228
And that is a thing I think we should contextualize.

1327
00:46:03,388 --> 00:46:05,888
Like when Disney opened in Tokyo,

1328
00:46:06,908 --> 00:46:08,548
like everyone was on board.

1329
00:46:08,788 --> 00:46:11,028
Like immediately the culture was on board for it.

1330
00:46:11,508 --> 00:46:12,488
The people were on board.

1331
00:46:12,608 --> 00:46:14,028
They loved it.

1332
00:46:14,228 --> 00:46:15,088
Unlike Paris.

1333
00:46:15,608 --> 00:46:16,768
Unlike, yeah, unlike Paris

1334
00:46:16,768 --> 00:46:18,708
where it was like treated with disdain

1335
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:20,008
and suspicion and stuff.

1336
00:46:20,368 --> 00:46:23,668
And yeah, there's all of these theme parks in Japan.

1337
00:46:24,268 --> 00:46:26,328
So the next day we went and again,

1338
00:46:26,468 --> 00:46:28,288
we tried to get to Tokyo Disney as quickly as possible.

1339
00:46:28,448 --> 00:46:30,548
We were going to go see Japanese wrestling,

1340
00:46:30,728 --> 00:46:31,648
New Japan wrestling,

1341
00:46:32,068 --> 00:46:34,868
to see the greatest professional wrestlers in the world

1342
00:46:34,868 --> 00:46:38,268
in the main event, Kenny Omega, Tamiro Ishigae,

1343
00:46:38,448 --> 00:46:42,208
Kazuchika Okada, and Koto Bushi.

1344
00:46:42,628 --> 00:46:43,368
And Geletoni.

1345
00:46:44,488 --> 00:46:45,548
The Italian wrestler.

1346
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:46,808
And they were wrestling.

1347
00:46:47,628 --> 00:46:49,268
The Italian Japanese wrestler.

1348
00:46:49,448 --> 00:46:51,108
They were wrestling at a place called Kuriken Hall,

1349
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:52,468
which is right by Tokyo Dome,

1350
00:46:52,468 --> 00:46:54,188
which is where they play a lot of baseball games.

1351
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:56,848
And honestly, we were just going to get tickets

1352
00:46:56,848 --> 00:46:58,008
and then go do something else.

1353
00:46:58,308 --> 00:47:01,288
And we were walking toward the area on the Google map

1354
00:47:01,288 --> 00:47:04,228
and we look up and we see the Ferris wheel

1355
00:47:04,228 --> 00:47:05,308
and a roller coaster.

1356
00:47:05,308 --> 00:47:07,068
Yeah, it was a goddamn amusement park out of nowhere.

1357
00:47:07,528 --> 00:47:09,568
And we go, is that like a amusement park here?

1358
00:47:09,748 --> 00:47:12,408
And so we walk in and it's just like,

1359
00:47:12,508 --> 00:47:14,588
we couldn't tell if everything was running or not.

1360
00:47:14,728 --> 00:47:15,648
It was very strange.

1361
00:47:15,668 --> 00:47:17,748
It almost felt almost in parts of it abandoned.

1362
00:47:18,248 --> 00:47:21,368
But then we see like Power Rangers show tomorrow.

1363
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:23,008
And we're like, oh, we can't go to that.

1364
00:47:23,108 --> 00:47:25,108
We're going to another theme park tomorrow.

1365
00:47:25,808 --> 00:47:26,928
And like, there's just too much,

1366
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:28,128
there's too many rides here.

1367
00:47:28,128 --> 00:47:30,388
And we're like, holy shit, what is this place?

1368
00:47:30,388 --> 00:47:33,868
And it's a very touristy place called Tokyo Dome City.

1369
00:47:34,348 --> 00:47:38,528
And it's by far, I think, my favorite day in Tokyo itself.

1370
00:47:38,748 --> 00:47:40,948
We only had four days, three or four days,

1371
00:47:40,948 --> 00:47:42,008
I forget, in Tokyo itself.

1372
00:47:42,008 --> 00:47:44,568
Like all the areas of Tokyo we went to were very cool.

1373
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:44,808
Oh, great.

1374
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:46,928
But we just didn't have enough time with them.

1375
00:47:47,028 --> 00:47:48,368
But we spent. Tokyo Dome,

1376
00:47:48,368 --> 00:47:51,088
we ended up spending a lot of time with.

1377
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,268
Wow. Tokyo Dome, basically city.

1378
00:47:53,548 --> 00:47:55,528
Which was not, people have sent me lists of like,

1379
00:47:55,628 --> 00:47:56,948
here's what you should do when you go in April.

1380
00:47:57,048 --> 00:47:58,288
And this has not been on lists.

1381
00:47:58,388 --> 00:47:59,028
No, I have not.

1382
00:47:59,148 --> 00:48:01,028
No one has ever talked about this that we know.

1383
00:48:01,148 --> 00:48:03,508
This is just because of the magic of professional wrestling.

1384
00:48:04,928 --> 00:48:06,308
It touches our lives once again.

1385
00:48:06,488 --> 00:48:06,808
Of course.

1386
00:48:07,308 --> 00:48:10,888
So there was a Taco Bell there that I ate at

1387
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,548
and it was fascinating because you could order

1388
00:48:12,548 --> 00:48:15,128
your heat level on the menu there.

1389
00:48:15,328 --> 00:48:17,268
So you could pick your meat or whatever.

1390
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:19,128
And then you could say medium

1391
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:21,448
or mild medium or spy.

1392
00:48:21,528 --> 00:48:22,428
I was like, this is amazing.

1393
00:48:22,468 --> 00:48:23,228
This is the greatest.

1394
00:48:23,348 --> 00:48:24,308
Greatest theme park in the world.

1395
00:48:24,308 --> 00:48:24,908
Greatest theme park in the world.

1396
00:48:25,048 --> 00:48:26,568
We went to a space museum.

1397
00:48:26,848 --> 00:48:27,588
We went to a space.

1398
00:48:27,588 --> 00:48:29,608
So then there's another building that's like,

1399
00:48:29,648 --> 00:48:31,888
has five levels and there's a roller skating rink

1400
00:48:31,888 --> 00:48:33,908
that you skated on for like 45 minutes.

1401
00:48:34,048 --> 00:48:35,608
And it looks like it's straight from the 80s.

1402
00:48:35,608 --> 00:48:36,988
Cause all this stuff is built in the 80s

1403
00:48:36,988 --> 00:48:39,788
and it's barely touched, but everything is very clean,

1404
00:48:39,968 --> 00:48:40,768
but it's not touched.

1405
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:42,088
Cause everything's clean.

1406
00:48:42,148 --> 00:48:43,248
Everything is clean in Japan.

1407
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:45,228
It's great. Bathrooms are immaculate.

1408
00:48:45,488 --> 00:48:46,668
I miss the bathrooms.

1409
00:48:46,888 --> 00:48:48,128
Yeah, bathrooms are amazing.

1410
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:51,368
Every time I go into a bathroom now, I'm just disgusted.

1411
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:53,208
People have so much respect there.

1412
00:48:54,308 --> 00:48:57,708
And then we went to the space themed like tourist trappy

1413
00:48:57,708 --> 00:48:59,948
thing where it was like two different experiences

1414
00:48:59,948 --> 00:49:02,828
where you're in a room and the wall kind of looks like,

1415
00:49:02,988 --> 00:49:04,428
kind of three, it's three dimensional.

1416
00:49:04,568 --> 00:49:07,128
It's like boxy cubes, but then all of a sudden,

1417
00:49:07,268 --> 00:49:09,848
like the cubes all turn into stuff and it's.

1418
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:11,968
They're actually screens.

1419
00:49:12,348 --> 00:49:13,648
They're all, yeah, they're all screens.

1420
00:49:13,808 --> 00:49:16,648
And then there might be some projections as well.

1421
00:49:16,768 --> 00:49:18,688
And they're just, we didn't,

1422
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:20,808
we made the mistake of not getting like the headphone

1423
00:49:20,808 --> 00:49:22,808
that told us what was happening in English.

1424
00:49:23,008 --> 00:49:23,828
Yeah, it was.

1425
00:49:23,828 --> 00:49:25,028
So there's no way to know what it was.

1426
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:25,908
There was a fascinating aspect.

1427
00:49:25,908 --> 00:49:27,168
But it was cool looking.

1428
00:49:27,408 --> 00:49:27,708
Yeah.

1429
00:49:27,928 --> 00:49:30,608
And then we went into a room that was supposed to like

1430
00:49:30,608 --> 00:49:32,108
simulate you're flying through the galaxy.

1431
00:49:32,148 --> 00:49:33,768
So it was just a big screen in the,

1432
00:49:33,768 --> 00:49:37,008
like the bottom of the floor and you like lean over.

1433
00:49:37,048 --> 00:49:41,508
It was like looking down into a circular IMAX screen.

1434
00:49:41,508 --> 00:49:44,408
Right. And that was not as cool as the other one,

1435
00:49:44,408 --> 00:49:45,328
but it was fine.

1436
00:49:45,328 --> 00:49:48,288
And then there's a whole, like there's like photo ops

1437
00:49:48,288 --> 00:49:49,588
where like I took, I made a,

1438
00:49:49,628 --> 00:49:50,968
I think I made the video on Twitter

1439
00:49:50,968 --> 00:49:52,288
where I was talking to the little prince.

1440
00:49:52,768 --> 00:49:53,888
Yes, you did.

1441
00:49:54,448 --> 00:49:54,468
Yes.

1442
00:49:54,468 --> 00:49:54,988
And there.

1443
00:49:55,128 --> 00:49:57,368
I think it was like, hey, it's your boy, Michael,

1444
00:49:57,468 --> 00:49:59,028
here with the little prince in Tokyo.

1445
00:49:59,028 --> 00:50:00,268
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1446
00:50:01,228 --> 00:50:02,208
And then there's like picture,

1447
00:50:02,288 --> 00:50:03,968
like we have pictures with aliens and we're like,

1448
00:50:03,988 --> 00:50:05,328
everything's a theme park here.

1449
00:50:05,368 --> 00:50:05,628
This is the greatest.

1450
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:10,608
Also there was like a little lab or like work room

1451
00:50:12,688 --> 00:50:15,828
in the space museum or whatever it would be called

1452
00:50:15,828 --> 00:50:19,708
that was actually like University of Tokyo, like.

1453
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:20,848
Oh yeah, yeah.

1454
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:21,888
Physicists.

1455
00:50:22,168 --> 00:50:22,408
Right.

1456
00:50:22,888 --> 00:50:26,208
There were like calculations on a whiteboard

1457
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:27,508
and people at desks.

1458
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:28,588
And I was like, what the hell?

1459
00:50:28,808 --> 00:50:30,788
It was a science labs or theme parks as well.

1460
00:50:30,888 --> 00:50:31,788
Yeah. Everything's a theme park.

1461
00:50:31,888 --> 00:50:33,288
Yeah, it was like in the old days when you could see.

1462
00:50:33,288 --> 00:50:34,368
I guess surrounded by a theme park.

1463
00:50:34,628 --> 00:50:35,728
Yeah, like when you could see animators

1464
00:50:35,728 --> 00:50:37,588
at MGM studios basically.

1465
00:50:38,308 --> 00:50:38,988
Chained to their desk.

1466
00:50:39,008 --> 00:50:39,588
Yeah, it kind of was.

1467
00:50:41,028 --> 00:50:43,688
So we, so then yeah, and then there's basically,

1468
00:50:43,728 --> 00:50:44,848
it's a weird configuration.

1469
00:50:44,888 --> 00:50:47,868
It all feels like it was built up like piecemeal.

1470
00:50:48,008 --> 00:50:49,428
It was not, there's not a grand design.

1471
00:50:49,648 --> 00:50:51,468
So like there'll be store, store,

1472
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:54,148
bubblegum shrimp restaurant, then a ride,

1473
00:50:54,268 --> 00:50:56,848
just in a section that looks like it should be

1474
00:50:56,848 --> 00:50:57,828
just another store.

1475
00:50:57,948 --> 00:51:00,008
Yeah, there's a log flume ride.

1476
00:51:00,108 --> 00:51:02,228
There's a log flume ride that just like goes

1477
00:51:02,228 --> 00:51:03,668
right by stores.

1478
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:04,488
And it's.

1479
00:51:04,488 --> 00:51:05,408
Where people work or whatever.

1480
00:51:05,928 --> 00:51:08,108
By people work and like it's not themed at all.

1481
00:51:08,108 --> 00:51:11,928
It's just the track and a log or not even a log theme.

1482
00:51:11,928 --> 00:51:15,348
It's like just a piece of plastic that you're surfing down.

1483
00:51:15,348 --> 00:51:19,348
And we went into this weird like kind of buzzed

1484
00:51:19,348 --> 00:51:20,188
lightyear ride.

1485
00:51:21,408 --> 00:51:23,288
And it's, let me bring up the picture of it.

1486
00:51:23,308 --> 00:51:23,988
What is it called?

1487
00:51:24,588 --> 00:51:24,768
The.

1488
00:51:24,828 --> 00:51:25,668
Oh yeah.

1489
00:51:25,788 --> 00:51:26,408
It's not the depths.

1490
00:51:26,688 --> 00:51:29,068
That's the maze I love, the haunted maze.

1491
00:51:30,008 --> 00:51:30,588
You love haunts.

1492
00:51:30,728 --> 00:51:31,848
I love haunts now.

1493
00:51:31,928 --> 00:51:33,808
Oh please don't encourage this, Rosie.

1494
00:51:34,188 --> 00:51:34,908
It was called.

1495
00:51:35,128 --> 00:51:35,548
He loves haunts now.

1496
00:51:35,588 --> 00:51:36,368
He's told me.

1497
00:51:36,368 --> 00:51:37,328
Did he tell you about that?

1498
00:51:37,488 --> 00:51:39,708
It's one of the funniest things.

1499
00:51:39,708 --> 00:51:43,508
I don't know what it was, but he just like

1500
00:51:43,508 --> 00:51:48,768
sort of apropos of nothing went, I love haunts now.

1501
00:51:48,768 --> 00:51:50,648
It was just silence and then.

1502
00:51:51,368 --> 00:51:53,008
We had been talking about something,

1503
00:51:53,088 --> 00:51:54,028
it was like, oh do you wanna.

1504
00:51:54,488 --> 00:51:56,408
We were like maybe scrolling through Netflix

1505
00:51:56,408 --> 00:51:58,048
looking for a horror movie to watch.

1506
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:01,508
And maybe that's when you said, yeah I love haunts now.

1507
00:52:01,988 --> 00:52:02,768
I was serious.

1508
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:04,828
Scott is this okay if I give you some spoilers

1509
00:52:04,828 --> 00:52:07,608
from the ride the dive at Tokyo Dome City.

1510
00:52:07,628 --> 00:52:08,448
You're fine with this.

1511
00:52:08,688 --> 00:52:11,588
Okay so like the dive is like kind of like

1512
00:52:11,588 --> 00:52:13,328
a steampunky thing and you're in a vehicle

1513
00:52:13,328 --> 00:52:14,528
that looks like this.

1514
00:52:15,028 --> 00:52:15,848
What does that look like?

1515
00:52:15,868 --> 00:52:18,008
It's a big tall, I should have a picture.

1516
00:52:18,028 --> 00:52:20,868
Kinda looks rocket shipy.

1517
00:52:21,168 --> 00:52:21,548
You see that?

1518
00:52:21,608 --> 00:52:24,528
It's like a big tall like.

1519
00:52:25,248 --> 00:52:27,248
Warm or kind of misshapen.

1520
00:52:27,308 --> 00:52:29,308
It's like an underwater type thing.

1521
00:52:29,308 --> 00:52:31,208
Some undersea exploring vessel or something.

1522
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:34,988
And you stand in it when you hold guns out the window.

1523
00:52:35,028 --> 00:52:35,468
Whoa yeah.

1524
00:52:35,468 --> 00:52:38,088
And you're shooting sea creature aliens?

1525
00:52:38,128 --> 00:52:38,768
Shoot what yeah.

1526
00:52:38,888 --> 00:52:41,128
Well there's like, this is the skull captain.

1527
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:43,328
He's a character, it's hard to see it probably.

1528
00:52:43,908 --> 00:52:46,088
But like there's kind of very cool designed

1529
00:52:46,088 --> 00:52:50,748
like steampunky like evil like underwater characters.

1530
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:52,008
Damn.

1531
00:52:52,408 --> 00:52:54,368
So like it was very, it's too short.

1532
00:52:54,648 --> 00:52:56,708
It's very very short but it was cool.

1533
00:52:59,588 --> 00:53:00,708
Not dissimilar from.

1534
00:53:01,308 --> 00:53:02,228
Don't, spoiler?

1535
00:53:02,908 --> 00:53:04,308
From a dream I had.

1536
00:53:04,828 --> 00:53:05,448
Yeah great.

1537
00:53:05,908 --> 00:53:06,628
Very good.

1538
00:53:07,468 --> 00:53:10,008
So the dot, this is what the outside of it looks like.

1539
00:53:10,528 --> 00:53:12,948
It's like just a weird, like this is themed

1540
00:53:12,948 --> 00:53:15,668
but this is just the top of another mall.

1541
00:53:15,668 --> 00:53:17,128
It's just a weird like office park or something

1542
00:53:17,128 --> 00:53:18,868
and you're next to like a Papa John's.

1543
00:53:19,068 --> 00:53:19,248
Yeah exactly.

1544
00:53:19,568 --> 00:53:21,628
That's actually the training mechanism

1545
00:53:21,628 --> 00:53:23,948
for the Japan Self Defense Force

1546
00:53:23,948 --> 00:53:26,168
because they can't, they don't have a standing army.

1547
00:53:26,648 --> 00:53:27,808
The dive?

1548
00:53:28,108 --> 00:53:31,768
Yeah the dive is, it's like that America's army

1549
00:53:31,768 --> 00:53:33,308
video game or stuff.

1550
00:53:34,068 --> 00:53:34,268
Sure.

1551
00:53:34,428 --> 00:53:35,968
You have to go through it 500 times.

1552
00:53:36,448 --> 00:53:38,348
Now you are an official member of the Japanese army.

1553
00:53:38,988 --> 00:53:41,188
Now the thing with my love of haunts

1554
00:53:41,188 --> 00:53:44,748
is that now I'm regretting because we walked by

1555
00:53:44,748 --> 00:53:49,108
a terrifying looking haunted house.

1556
00:53:50,048 --> 00:53:51,648
And Lindsay wanted to go in it more than I did

1557
00:53:51,648 --> 00:53:53,348
but she couldn't bring herself to go in.

1558
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:56,628
But it was one in which you would be given rope

1559
00:53:56,628 --> 00:54:00,588
and you would have to bind a ghost's feet to get out.

1560
00:54:00,588 --> 00:54:02,188
And also she was like under you

1561
00:54:02,188 --> 00:54:03,708
and could grab at your feet.

1562
00:54:03,748 --> 00:54:04,308
Yeah.

1563
00:54:04,588 --> 00:54:07,148
And it was, the story was this.

1564
00:54:07,148 --> 00:54:08,408
You would take your shoes off right?

1565
00:54:09,008 --> 00:54:10,308
Yeah you had to take your shoes off.

1566
00:54:10,328 --> 00:54:11,888
You had to take your shoes off in this maze.

1567
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:15,508
So the story of the haunted house was

1568
00:54:15,508 --> 00:54:18,428
that this woman accidentally destroyed

1569
00:54:18,428 --> 00:54:21,608
a moth specimen of her husband's

1570
00:54:21,608 --> 00:54:25,568
and to punish her he put like moth powder

1571
00:54:25,568 --> 00:54:28,788
or ground up moths in her face powder

1572
00:54:28,788 --> 00:54:31,868
and she used the powder and it disfigured her.

1573
00:54:32,388 --> 00:54:36,668
And then he, and it turned out no she hadn't destroyed

1574
00:54:36,668 --> 00:54:37,608
the moth specimen.

1575
00:54:37,828 --> 00:54:40,708
He and his lover just wanted to get her out of the picture.

1576
00:54:41,068 --> 00:54:42,968
And so she dies and then they,

1577
00:54:43,248 --> 00:54:45,548
but then she haunts the house and you have to bind

1578
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:48,328
her feet to free her spirit ironically.

1579
00:54:48,628 --> 00:54:50,808
So you would bind like an actor's feet.

1580
00:54:50,808 --> 00:54:51,288
Yeah.

1581
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:51,728
Whoa.

1582
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:53,008
To get out of there.

1583
00:54:53,008 --> 00:54:56,248
You don't rub moth powder into an actor's face.

1584
00:54:56,428 --> 00:54:59,028
No she already got hurt by the moth powder stuff.

1585
00:54:59,128 --> 00:55:00,728
There's not some new components.

1586
00:55:00,748 --> 00:55:01,208
No no.

1587
00:55:01,408 --> 00:55:02,988
Or we're giving you moth powder.

1588
00:55:03,288 --> 00:55:04,568
So we didn't do it.

1589
00:55:04,608 --> 00:55:06,328
I think I would have done it now.

1590
00:55:06,808 --> 00:55:08,248
I do think I would have done it even though it sounds.

1591
00:55:08,408 --> 00:55:09,528
Post not scary farm.

1592
00:55:09,528 --> 00:55:10,808
Post not scary farm events.

1593
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:11,788
I love feet binding now.

1594
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:12,828
I love it.

1595
00:55:13,628 --> 00:55:17,168
Oh no bad reference in relation to Japan.

1596
00:55:18,688 --> 00:55:20,148
They have the thing there.

1597
00:55:20,148 --> 00:55:22,268
They're the ones with the psychosexual madness

1598
00:55:22,268 --> 00:55:25,148
of like let's make the feet binding a haunted house.

1599
00:55:25,148 --> 00:55:27,828
Might be a Chinese thing now that I think about it.

1600
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:28,988
We'll cut it out if we look it up.

1601
00:55:28,988 --> 00:55:30,208
I feel like.

1602
00:55:30,288 --> 00:55:30,828
It's in the good or.

1603
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,168
If it's racist we'll cut it out.

1604
00:55:33,048 --> 00:55:37,528
So yeah so we were like just running around that place

1605
00:55:37,528 --> 00:55:39,748
like children like whoa look over here.

1606
00:55:39,788 --> 00:55:40,488
Look what this is.

1607
00:55:40,488 --> 00:55:41,148
This is weird.

1608
00:55:41,788 --> 00:55:42,888
And then you went roller skating

1609
00:55:42,888 --> 00:55:44,348
while I waited in line for tickets.

1610
00:55:44,408 --> 00:55:46,548
They only have cash for the wrestling show.

1611
00:55:46,748 --> 00:55:48,388
And then while I was waiting for you to be done

1612
00:55:48,388 --> 00:55:51,168
I went and had a drink and cheese sticks

1613
00:55:51,168 --> 00:55:53,448
at the TGI Fridays next to the Currican Hall.

1614
00:55:54,248 --> 00:55:58,168
And I was like this is the greatest day of my life.

1615
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:01,328
Going to Japan and going to a TGI Friday.

1616
00:56:01,588 --> 00:56:04,568
You remind me of home.

1617
00:56:04,588 --> 00:56:07,388
And to Taco Bell.

1618
00:56:07,908 --> 00:56:08,488
Yes I did.

1619
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:09,768
It was a very American day.

1620
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,028
And then we went and saw Japanese wrestling

1621
00:56:12,028 --> 00:56:15,408
in this just old ass like gym-ish type place.

1622
00:56:15,408 --> 00:56:17,488
And we had just the worst beer and popcorn.

1623
00:56:17,488 --> 00:56:18,328
It was great.

1624
00:56:18,568 --> 00:56:19,888
We stood in the back.

1625
00:56:20,048 --> 00:56:21,608
The main event was incredible.

1626
00:56:21,948 --> 00:56:23,288
Maybe five star match.

1627
00:56:23,328 --> 00:56:24,068
Oh my goodness.

1628
00:56:24,408 --> 00:56:26,508
So then we went to Tokyo Dome City Hotel

1629
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,588
or Tokyo Dome Hotel.

1630
00:56:27,888 --> 00:56:29,948
And they have an amazing view of the theme park.

1631
00:56:30,128 --> 00:56:30,628
It's the colors.

1632
00:56:30,768 --> 00:56:31,568
They sent a picture to Scott.

1633
00:56:31,728 --> 00:56:32,268
I've shown it to him.

1634
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:33,308
I'm like you gotta go here.

1635
00:56:33,408 --> 00:56:35,328
As soon as we went in there we were like oh my God

1636
00:56:35,328 --> 00:56:37,088
Scott and Aaron would love this place.

1637
00:56:37,108 --> 00:56:39,048
It was like very my taste.

1638
00:56:39,068 --> 00:56:40,628
Weston Bond adventure but.

1639
00:56:40,648 --> 00:56:42,388
Yeah it was like mid 80s.

1640
00:56:42,388 --> 00:56:42,688
Yes.

1641
00:56:43,168 --> 00:56:43,888
Like luxury.

1642
00:56:44,148 --> 00:56:44,928
Yeah that hotel looked great.

1643
00:56:45,308 --> 00:56:46,748
And it's not like been.

1644
00:56:46,888 --> 00:56:49,448
It's like this exact same in the 80s.

1645
00:56:49,608 --> 00:56:51,248
It's like the nice version of what it looks like

1646
00:56:51,248 --> 00:56:51,708
in the 80s.

1647
00:56:51,848 --> 00:56:53,268
And there's a sizzler in the lobby.

1648
00:56:54,068 --> 00:56:56,188
And we went up to this lounge and it's like

1649
00:56:56,188 --> 00:56:58,028
there's too many people working there.

1650
00:56:58,128 --> 00:57:00,508
And there's only like it was like club 33

1651
00:57:00,508 --> 00:57:03,108
and there's like six people maybe 12 people.

1652
00:57:03,148 --> 00:57:05,128
And they pull the chairs out for you.

1653
00:57:05,128 --> 00:57:06,048
And you're just sitting at the bar

1654
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:08,188
looking at this crazy weird theme park.

1655
00:57:08,308 --> 00:57:09,628
And we're like this is the best.

1656
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:13,228
How many days do you spend in the Tokyo Dome?

1657
00:57:14,268 --> 00:57:15,348
That's my answer.

1658
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:15,968
That's the answer for me.

1659
00:57:16,188 --> 00:57:16,628
Yeah I thought so.

1660
00:57:16,688 --> 00:57:17,448
Maybe we stay there.

1661
00:57:18,308 --> 00:57:19,808
We were talking about staying there

1662
00:57:19,808 --> 00:57:20,648
the next time we go.

1663
00:57:20,768 --> 00:57:21,108
Oh maybe.

1664
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:23,388
I think that is probably what will happen.

1665
00:57:23,468 --> 00:57:24,388
I'll keep in mind.

1666
00:57:24,968 --> 00:57:27,028
And maybe during like New Japan's G1

1667
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:29,748
when there's like a lot of shows, wrestling shows.

1668
00:57:31,088 --> 00:57:33,068
So yeah we did that.

1669
00:57:33,468 --> 00:57:35,148
You're just scrolling through your phone right now Justin.

1670
00:57:35,748 --> 00:57:39,028
I was checking the show Twitter account.

1671
00:57:40,028 --> 00:57:41,988
Don't do that during the show.

1672
00:57:41,988 --> 00:57:44,068
I do it during the show all the time

1673
00:57:44,068 --> 00:57:45,988
and you don't say anything.

1674
00:57:46,548 --> 00:57:47,188
I had notes.

1675
00:57:47,188 --> 00:57:48,408
I feel comfortable in those.

1676
00:57:49,028 --> 00:57:50,748
Lindsay came in here to razz and roast.

1677
00:57:51,928 --> 00:57:52,508
That's something a mom's allowed to do.

1678
00:57:52,508 --> 00:57:54,648
I mean I wonder where she got that from.

1679
00:57:55,248 --> 00:57:56,628
She did it before me.

1680
00:57:56,628 --> 00:57:57,508
Yeah she did it before me.

1681
00:57:57,748 --> 00:57:59,228
So we went to Pearl Land.

1682
00:57:59,388 --> 00:58:01,288
We'll talk about Pearl Land on the episode.

1683
00:58:01,508 --> 00:58:03,908
We'll probably do a full Tokyo Dome city episode

1684
00:58:03,908 --> 00:58:05,808
and a full Pearl Land episode when you get back.

1685
00:58:06,228 --> 00:58:06,808
Yeah for sure.

1686
00:58:07,268 --> 00:58:08,128
But Pearl Land is great.

1687
00:58:08,228 --> 00:58:11,028
We were running around the Gudetama, the lazy ag area.

1688
00:58:11,548 --> 00:58:12,748
Oh it's delightful.

1689
00:58:12,748 --> 00:58:12,848
Like children.

1690
00:58:13,628 --> 00:58:13,688
My love.

1691
00:58:13,688 --> 00:58:14,508
Oh my goodness.

1692
00:58:15,768 --> 00:58:16,688
My beloved.

1693
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:18,288
Jason's favorite character in fiction.

1694
00:58:18,468 --> 00:58:20,808
The listless, lazy ag.

1695
00:58:22,568 --> 00:58:24,148
Your role model.

1696
00:58:24,288 --> 00:58:27,508
Gudetama shows his, there are so many different versions

1697
00:58:27,508 --> 00:58:29,048
of Gudetama showing his butt.

1698
00:58:29,268 --> 00:58:30,108
His little egg butt.

1699
00:58:30,468 --> 00:58:30,988
His little butt.

1700
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:34,528
Like there's 20 plus different ways he shows you his butt

1701
00:58:34,528 --> 00:58:35,428
over the whole thing.

1702
00:58:35,588 --> 00:58:38,748
And his human friend in the ag costume.

1703
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:41,088
Oh yeah what is that character's name?

1704
00:58:41,148 --> 00:58:41,728
The weird perverts.

1705
00:58:41,848 --> 00:58:42,468
I don't know.

1706
00:58:42,488 --> 00:58:43,208
I don't know.

1707
00:58:43,808 --> 00:58:45,448
The weird gimp looking egg man.

1708
00:58:45,808 --> 00:58:48,208
Well we'll figure that out for the Pearl Land episode.

1709
00:58:48,228 --> 00:58:48,488
Is that an appropriate word?

1710
00:58:48,908 --> 00:58:49,248
Gimp?

1711
00:58:49,368 --> 00:58:49,748
Gimp?

1712
00:58:50,228 --> 00:58:51,588
I think gimp is fine I think right?

1713
00:58:52,608 --> 00:58:52,708
Yeah.

1714
00:58:52,728 --> 00:58:53,568
We'll look that up too.

1715
00:58:54,048 --> 00:58:54,708
Research to do.

1716
00:58:55,148 --> 00:58:57,548
But I mean in like the pulp fiction sense.

1717
00:58:57,548 --> 00:58:58,728
Yeah yeah the sex gimp.

1718
00:58:59,188 --> 00:59:00,068
The sex gimp.

1719
00:59:00,288 --> 00:59:02,168
I don't know what you're thinking gimp is.

1720
00:59:02,348 --> 00:59:03,268
Yeah no I don't know.

1721
00:59:03,288 --> 00:59:03,908
We'll look it up.

1722
00:59:03,988 --> 00:59:04,448
All right.

1723
00:59:04,788 --> 00:59:06,468
So yeah so then we did Pearl Land.

1724
00:59:06,688 --> 00:59:07,748
And then we went to, we did amazing.

1725
00:59:08,168 --> 00:59:11,568
Mario Kart virtual reality incredible themed experience.

1726
00:59:11,568 --> 00:59:13,328
Like if that's like the Wreck it Ralph thing

1727
00:59:13,328 --> 00:59:15,208
they're built like amazing.

1728
00:59:15,808 --> 00:59:15,928
Really?

1729
00:59:15,988 --> 00:59:17,888
Like I think people will go nuts for it.

1730
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:20,488
Cause it's truly, of all the VR stuff we did there too.

1731
00:59:20,768 --> 00:59:22,608
Like head and shoulders above the others.

1732
00:59:22,608 --> 00:59:23,408
Yeah it was really fun.

1733
00:59:23,628 --> 00:59:24,608
People screaming.

1734
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:26,188
Me screaming.

1735
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:26,768
You screaming in every race.

1736
00:59:26,788 --> 00:59:27,668
Screaming as soon as I got on it.

1737
00:59:27,728 --> 00:59:27,868
Yeah.

1738
00:59:28,008 --> 00:59:30,888
Like I mean Scott's gonna be maybe a little uncomfortable

1739
00:59:30,888 --> 00:59:32,688
because there's giant bullets.

1740
00:59:32,928 --> 00:59:33,468
Uh oh.

1741
00:59:33,628 --> 00:59:34,608
I'm scared of the big.

1742
00:59:34,728 --> 00:59:35,528
But that was one.

1743
00:59:35,608 --> 00:59:36,588
Oh we didn't talk about that.

1744
00:59:36,588 --> 00:59:38,388
I hate when the big bullet goes by.

1745
00:59:38,528 --> 00:59:40,748
So like you're immersed in the land.

1746
00:59:41,768 --> 00:59:42,508
And the VR.

1747
00:59:42,528 --> 00:59:43,368
I'll just forget how to duck.

1748
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:45,548
So yeah or take a Xanax before.

1749
00:59:45,828 --> 00:59:46,148
I can't.

1750
00:59:46,148 --> 00:59:46,728
Yeah.

1751
00:59:46,728 --> 00:59:46,828
Get sleepy.

1752
00:59:46,828 --> 00:59:47,528
So that was awesome.

1753
00:59:47,948 --> 00:59:49,108
Another themed thing.

1754
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:50,608
We got too late to Robot Restaurant

1755
00:59:50,608 --> 00:59:51,728
as far as another themed.

1756
00:59:52,068 --> 00:59:52,908
Again everything's a theme park.

1757
00:59:52,928 --> 00:59:57,528
We did get, we were too late to many things I feel like.

1758
00:59:57,568 --> 00:59:58,428
Yes that's true.

1759
00:59:59,068 --> 01:00:00,748
So all right let's, we'll get there.

1760
01:00:00,748 --> 01:00:02,768
So we take the subway.

1761
01:00:02,768 --> 01:00:06,668
The subway takes us like into Tokyo Disney.

1762
01:00:07,108 --> 01:00:09,988
And the difference with the Monorail Tokyo Disney

1763
01:00:09,988 --> 01:00:11,268
is that you have to pay for it

1764
01:00:11,268 --> 01:00:13,228
because it has to be a real line of transit.

1765
01:00:13,488 --> 01:00:13,948
Yes.

1766
01:00:13,988 --> 01:00:15,928
It is included in the transit.

1767
01:00:16,348 --> 01:00:16,768
State owned.

1768
01:00:16,928 --> 01:00:20,328
Right so we had to buy a pass for days.

1769
01:00:21,128 --> 01:00:22,968
And I guess look I'll say it now.

1770
01:00:23,128 --> 01:00:24,148
How many days.

1771
01:00:24,328 --> 01:00:24,728
Yeah.

1772
01:00:24,928 --> 01:00:25,988
We spent at Tokyo Disney.

1773
01:00:25,988 --> 01:00:26,888
Cause we haven't, also you guys went to,

1774
01:00:26,988 --> 01:00:28,968
as we record this you guys went months ago.

1775
01:00:29,468 --> 01:00:31,868
We've not, I haven't heard anything about.

1776
01:00:32,388 --> 01:00:33,088
A month and a half.

1777
01:00:33,108 --> 01:00:33,628
A month and a half ago.

1778
01:00:33,848 --> 01:00:35,088
We've been out a bunch of times.

1779
01:00:35,128 --> 01:00:36,908
I haven't heard anything about any of this.

1780
01:00:36,988 --> 01:00:38,128
Right we've kept it for the air.

1781
01:00:38,128 --> 01:00:38,968
Because you've been saving it for the episode.

1782
01:00:39,488 --> 01:00:41,368
But also you don't want to hear half of it.

1783
01:00:41,728 --> 01:00:42,748
Yeah no it's true.

1784
01:00:43,008 --> 01:00:44,108
Although I will literally leave forever.

1785
01:00:44,528 --> 01:00:45,868
But this is, yeah.

1786
01:00:45,988 --> 01:00:47,568
Let's, do we get to the.

1787
01:00:47,748 --> 01:00:51,328
So we ended up spending at the Tokyo Disney Resort

1788
01:00:51,328 --> 01:00:53,328
three and a half days.

1789
01:00:53,668 --> 01:00:54,188
Okay.

1790
01:00:54,508 --> 01:00:55,268
I'll take it.

1791
01:00:55,548 --> 01:00:56,088
And you know what?

1792
01:00:56,088 --> 01:00:57,028
Are you saying that is the definitive?

1793
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:57,588
I wanted five.

1794
01:00:57,588 --> 01:01:00,588
And I will say at least four.

1795
01:01:00,628 --> 01:01:01,508
At least four.

1796
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,848
I would have loved five.

1797
01:01:03,968 --> 01:01:05,628
Five would have been really great.

1798
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:06,028
Wow.

1799
01:01:06,388 --> 01:01:09,048
But I do think, I think there's a version

1800
01:01:09,048 --> 01:01:10,628
of Tokyo Disney you can do.

1801
01:01:10,948 --> 01:01:13,068
And another thing we screwed up is I think we,

1802
01:01:13,828 --> 01:01:15,508
this trip was a sleepy one.

1803
01:01:16,008 --> 01:01:18,108
Because of all the hiccups at the rough start.

1804
01:01:18,548 --> 01:01:20,428
So we never quite got up as early

1805
01:01:20,428 --> 01:01:21,988
as everyone says to get up.

1806
01:01:22,268 --> 01:01:24,768
For sure you can hit all the big rides

1807
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:27,048
that you want to do in two days.

1808
01:01:27,228 --> 01:01:29,928
And I'm sure if you were being real on top of it

1809
01:01:29,928 --> 01:01:32,948
you could do just the big heavy hitters in a day.

1810
01:01:34,088 --> 01:01:37,288
But I think three, to really absorb the atmosphere

1811
01:01:37,288 --> 01:01:41,068
three days, like, because there's still stuff we didn't do.

1812
01:01:41,408 --> 01:01:42,708
We want to see all the shows.

1813
01:01:42,928 --> 01:01:43,868
We missed certain shows.

1814
01:01:43,888 --> 01:01:45,868
We didn't get to go to the downtown Disney type area.

1815
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,188
We didn't even touch it.

1816
01:01:47,188 --> 01:01:48,448
Not even close.

1817
01:01:48,648 --> 01:01:51,188
And then somebody was, somebody messaged me

1818
01:01:51,188 --> 01:01:54,468
and said there was a theme park close, very close to it.

1819
01:01:54,508 --> 01:01:55,068
Another one?

1820
01:01:55,088 --> 01:01:56,208
I don't even know what it's called.

1821
01:01:56,568 --> 01:01:57,588
So I was like, oh, that's unlikely.

1822
01:01:57,748 --> 01:01:59,288
But I'm great to explore that area.

1823
01:01:59,448 --> 01:02:01,268
And also it's right by the ocean.

1824
01:02:01,268 --> 01:02:03,748
And we were so happy to just be in a hotel room

1825
01:02:03,748 --> 01:02:06,228
where we slept in separate beds a couple nights.

1826
01:02:06,228 --> 01:02:08,008
We were so excited to have space.

1827
01:02:08,228 --> 01:02:09,788
It was like, no, get me out of bed.

1828
01:02:09,788 --> 01:02:10,908
Stretching out.

1829
01:02:11,088 --> 01:02:12,308
Like Lucy and Desi.

1830
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:13,268
No, I'm serious.

1831
01:02:13,268 --> 01:02:14,788
Yeah, but we weren't fighting or anything.

1832
01:02:14,808 --> 01:02:16,128
It was just like, nope, it's nice to not be in it.

1833
01:02:16,128 --> 01:02:20,188
But it was also good because then I could not fall asleep.

1834
01:02:20,368 --> 01:02:21,328
Oh yeah, that's true.

1835
01:02:21,448 --> 01:02:22,308
So I would have kept you up.

1836
01:02:22,548 --> 01:02:24,148
So yeah, so we did three and a half days

1837
01:02:24,148 --> 01:02:25,548
because the trip was ending.

1838
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:26,768
And at first I was like, well,

1839
01:02:26,768 --> 01:02:28,028
we'll do something for a half day.

1840
01:02:28,028 --> 01:02:30,868
But then it was like the way the park hopper adds up,

1841
01:02:31,108 --> 01:02:34,588
it's like 30 more dollars for the fourth day.

1842
01:02:34,588 --> 01:02:36,528
And it's like, well, you may as well.

1843
01:02:36,528 --> 01:02:37,168
Why wouldn't you, yeah.

1844
01:02:37,408 --> 01:02:38,568
Because it's not a full ticket.

1845
01:02:38,728 --> 01:02:41,028
If maybe it was a full day of like the same amount.

1846
01:02:41,308 --> 01:02:43,268
Because also tickets are not as expensive there.

1847
01:02:43,708 --> 01:02:45,408
They're like 70 bucks, I think.

1848
01:02:45,408 --> 01:02:46,668
I forget, 60 bucks.

1849
01:02:46,828 --> 01:02:51,608
Which that used to be the price for like 10, 11 years ago.

1850
01:02:51,628 --> 01:02:53,988
That was the price for a single day Disney,

1851
01:02:54,028 --> 01:02:55,228
a single day, single park.

1852
01:02:55,268 --> 01:02:55,568
Sure.

1853
01:02:56,108 --> 01:02:57,188
Can I say one thing?

1854
01:02:57,188 --> 01:02:59,428
When I talk about days and plans,

1855
01:02:59,588 --> 01:03:04,028
I don't mean to be some virtuous, valorous hero

1856
01:03:04,028 --> 01:03:06,708
for the people, for the less fortunate.

1857
01:03:06,988 --> 01:03:10,868
But some of my thing with the days is spending.

1858
01:03:11,228 --> 01:03:14,088
It's a relief to hear that Tokyo Disney is cheaper.

1859
01:03:14,388 --> 01:03:16,908
But I do, I would like to voice that when we talk,

1860
01:03:16,908 --> 01:03:18,668
when we talk about what's an ideal Disney world trip.

1861
01:03:18,848 --> 01:03:21,928
Well, it's 14 days and you spend $5,000.

1862
01:03:22,348 --> 01:03:24,188
Like there are some people listening

1863
01:03:24,188 --> 01:03:26,208
who do have to think about.

1864
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:28,328
But we are saying ideal.

1865
01:03:28,668 --> 01:03:29,648
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1866
01:03:29,808 --> 01:03:33,528
I'm just saying some of my arguments in all of this

1867
01:03:33,528 --> 01:03:37,428
is a little bit like what if you don't want to spend

1868
01:03:37,428 --> 01:03:39,108
whole fees or you can't spend OBS.

1869
01:03:39,288 --> 01:03:41,928
Man of the people, Scott, does make the point.

1870
01:03:42,968 --> 01:03:44,968
It's nice to hear that it's cheap.

1871
01:03:44,968 --> 01:03:46,388
Scott, just cut your line.

1872
01:03:47,388 --> 01:03:50,648
Cut your line consumption in like half for once.

1873
01:03:53,128 --> 01:03:58,108
This new bit, this new bit about Scott and his wine.

1874
01:03:58,568 --> 01:03:59,528
That I, yes.

1875
01:03:59,768 --> 01:04:00,928
Old Ronnie Garner.

1876
01:04:01,248 --> 01:04:03,308
Unhelpable wino.

1877
01:04:03,608 --> 01:04:06,348
The weekly wine budget of two grand.

1878
01:04:06,548 --> 01:04:10,708
Yeah, certainly it's not like the budget trip,

1879
01:04:11,208 --> 01:04:11,468
but an ideal.

1880
01:04:11,468 --> 01:04:13,088
Yeah, I mean we didn't do, also,

1881
01:04:13,268 --> 01:04:15,188
I will, to speak to budget,

1882
01:04:15,388 --> 01:04:17,568
obviously if you only have a certain amount,

1883
01:04:17,888 --> 01:04:20,228
you're, I mean any of us have a certain amount.

1884
01:04:20,228 --> 01:04:22,608
But if you have a budget and a limit,

1885
01:04:22,988 --> 01:04:24,388
obviously do what you can do.

1886
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:26,408
But like, this also isn't.

1887
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:29,668
Like you can do a hotel room for a hundred something bucks

1888
01:04:29,668 --> 01:04:32,668
and then it's 60 extra dollars for two people to go.

1889
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:35,228
So I'm saying it's not like you're spending extra grand.

1890
01:04:35,488 --> 01:04:36,708
That's all my point.

1891
01:04:36,808 --> 01:04:39,148
No, no, no, I'm saying it's nice to know that it is.

1892
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:39,528
Yeah.

1893
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:41,648
I just like, you know, I've had the thought

1894
01:04:41,648 --> 01:04:42,768
when we've talked about what is,

1895
01:04:43,268 --> 01:04:45,948
that a Disney World trip has to involve

1896
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:49,588
like just a mind boggling amount of money.

1897
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:50,808
It doesn't always work.

1898
01:04:50,808 --> 01:04:51,928
But we're always talking about,

1899
01:04:52,868 --> 01:04:55,048
I think we usually were talking about in like the-

1900
01:04:55,048 --> 01:04:56,188
We're both unemployed right now.

1901
01:04:56,288 --> 01:04:57,248
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

1902
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,248
You made this work, it's all good, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1903
01:04:59,408 --> 01:05:02,188
It was mostly, it was a trip based on points and like-

1904
01:05:02,188 --> 01:05:04,508
A lot of which we got because I froze my eggs.

1905
01:05:05,028 --> 01:05:05,788
That is true.

1906
01:05:05,888 --> 01:05:09,228
We put Lindsay's egg freezing on credit cards.

1907
01:05:09,228 --> 01:05:12,228
Although I did not, if I'm gonna be very specific,

1908
01:05:12,648 --> 01:05:15,748
those are the SPG points that we haven't used yet,

1909
01:05:16,228 --> 01:05:17,148
is your egg card.

1910
01:05:17,468 --> 01:05:18,288
Edwin is having a bad dream.

1911
01:05:19,848 --> 01:05:20,608
So yeah-

1912
01:05:20,608 --> 01:05:24,128
Having to deal with a future child in the house.

1913
01:05:24,188 --> 01:05:25,908
Besides Jason.

1914
01:05:26,508 --> 01:05:28,008
Yeah, besides me.

1915
01:05:29,748 --> 01:05:32,708
Edwin and I keep the same sleep schedule.

1916
01:05:32,768 --> 01:05:33,428
Fighting over scraps.

1917
01:05:33,428 --> 01:05:34,268
Which is a lot.

1918
01:05:34,948 --> 01:05:35,288
Yeah, fighting over.

1919
01:05:35,668 --> 01:05:38,648
So yeah, ideally yes, where you get to see it,

1920
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:40,588
especially with Japan where it's like,

1921
01:05:40,748 --> 01:05:43,368
it's not as easy to go to Japan as it is to go to Florida.

1922
01:05:44,028 --> 01:05:47,548
So like, and Tokyo Disney Sea, I will say,

1923
01:05:47,548 --> 01:05:50,848
theme wise, the best theme park.

1924
01:05:51,428 --> 01:05:52,088
Theme wise.

1925
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:55,228
Straight up theme wise, immersiveness.

1926
01:05:55,808 --> 01:05:56,468
Are you disagreeing?

1927
01:05:56,908 --> 01:05:59,548
I'm just, I'm trying to figure it out

1928
01:05:59,548 --> 01:06:03,228
and I realized this is something I should have decided on

1929
01:06:03,228 --> 01:06:04,628
before the episode.

1930
01:06:04,668 --> 01:06:05,688
Keep going.

1931
01:06:05,968 --> 01:06:06,688
I was gonna say like,

1932
01:06:06,768 --> 01:06:09,768
Daigon Alley might be my favorite themed area ever.

1933
01:06:10,068 --> 01:06:10,328
That's it.

1934
01:06:10,728 --> 01:06:15,668
That's the one that I think is the absolute best themed area.

1935
01:06:15,908 --> 01:06:17,388
Even though there's not much space

1936
01:06:17,388 --> 01:06:20,588
and there's really only like two, one ride.

1937
01:06:20,968 --> 01:06:21,448
Yeah.

1938
01:06:21,708 --> 01:06:23,708
Yeah, in Daigon Alley specifically.

1939
01:06:24,108 --> 01:06:25,128
But I think that that.

1940
01:06:25,268 --> 01:06:26,768
But I'm saying theme park overall,

1941
01:06:26,888 --> 01:06:30,388
just everything added up the most like, oh wow,

1942
01:06:30,508 --> 01:06:31,748
like, oh, there's this awesome thing.

1943
01:06:31,828 --> 01:06:35,588
And the most amazing amount of like, views and care.

1944
01:06:35,808 --> 01:06:36,488
Oh, care for sure.

1945
01:06:36,648 --> 01:06:38,748
But like views too, where you would be in like

1946
01:06:38,748 --> 01:06:40,128
the Cape Cod section and be like,

1947
01:06:40,248 --> 01:06:42,008
holy shit, look at the view of the Tower of Terror

1948
01:06:42,008 --> 01:06:44,128
from here and look at the boat from here.

1949
01:06:44,328 --> 01:06:47,068
Like it felt such, like such, I guess,

1950
01:06:47,248 --> 01:06:49,408
care as the word had been taken to make sure

1951
01:06:49,408 --> 01:06:51,148
that everything was so scenic.

1952
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:52,928
Cause like when you go in Cars Land,

1953
01:06:52,948 --> 01:06:55,028
there's that the one view when you're coming out of

1954
01:06:55,028 --> 01:06:57,668
like that food area, the book, like whatever the pier.

1955
01:06:57,908 --> 01:07:00,328
And that's like such an amazing cool view

1956
01:07:00,328 --> 01:07:02,528
of that, of the Radiator Springs racer ride.

1957
01:07:02,728 --> 01:07:03,308
Yeah, yeah.

1958
01:07:03,308 --> 01:07:05,008
It seems like such a wide epic vista.

1959
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,868
And like it's, Tokyo Disney Sea is full of it

1960
01:07:07,868 --> 01:07:08,828
and stuff like that.

1961
01:07:08,988 --> 01:07:10,428
Where you all of a sudden turn around and you go,

1962
01:07:10,488 --> 01:07:12,808
whoa, that's clearly, they did this on purpose.

1963
01:07:12,808 --> 01:07:16,048
This was clearly built to be an amazing picture.

1964
01:07:16,228 --> 01:07:18,528
And like a reveal, it's all very cinematic.

1965
01:07:18,708 --> 01:07:19,548
It's very cinematic.

1966
01:07:19,548 --> 01:07:22,188
And there's so much transportation.

1967
01:07:22,648 --> 01:07:23,028
Yeah.

1968
01:07:23,308 --> 01:07:25,768
Just so, like so much, like so great.

1969
01:07:26,088 --> 01:07:29,068
I was looking at the maps today and just seeing like

1970
01:07:29,068 --> 01:07:33,108
there is a boat that does the whole like,

1971
01:07:33,228 --> 01:07:35,108
laps the whole Tokyo Disney Sea.

1972
01:07:35,388 --> 01:07:35,588
Yes.

1973
01:07:35,868 --> 01:07:36,468
Oh yeah, we took that.

1974
01:07:36,688 --> 01:07:39,028
I mean, we took, well, we took half, like we would take.

1975
01:07:39,068 --> 01:07:40,508
It like goes through the middle.

1976
01:07:40,628 --> 01:07:41,488
It goes through the middle.

1977
01:07:41,488 --> 01:07:42,828
Yeah, it doesn't go around it.

1978
01:07:43,008 --> 01:07:44,748
Yeah, it's not like the Disneyland train.

1979
01:07:44,848 --> 01:07:47,448
Yeah, and the rail, I mean, I got a lot of questions

1980
01:07:47,448 --> 01:07:48,148
about the train.

1981
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:49,428
It's gotta work for you to leave.

1982
01:07:49,608 --> 01:07:51,548
Honestly, you got a lot of questions about the rail stuff.

1983
01:07:51,548 --> 01:07:52,248
If you don't want the train spoiled.

1984
01:07:52,248 --> 01:07:53,968
You're gonna be disappointed

1985
01:07:53,968 --> 01:07:57,008
because we didn't go on that train.

1986
01:07:57,068 --> 01:07:57,388
No.

1987
01:07:57,528 --> 01:07:58,808
Which, in what park?

1988
01:07:58,948 --> 01:07:59,868
Either of them.

1989
01:08:00,468 --> 01:08:00,808
Michael, sorry.

1990
01:08:00,808 --> 01:08:02,168
There were rides we, I'm saying,

1991
01:08:02,568 --> 01:08:03,888
there were rides we did not get to.

1992
01:08:03,888 --> 01:08:05,208
We needed five days.

1993
01:08:05,328 --> 01:08:07,808
I love when Jason says the full Michael.

1994
01:08:08,088 --> 01:08:08,968
That's one of my favorite moments.

1995
01:08:08,968 --> 01:08:11,128
I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.

1996
01:08:11,348 --> 01:08:12,988
I am disappointed too.

1997
01:08:13,088 --> 01:08:14,988
Michael, I do wanna ask, so what hotel?

1998
01:08:15,608 --> 01:08:16,868
Hold on, let me just say this,

1999
01:08:17,008 --> 01:08:17,948
just so we get it out of the way.

2000
01:08:18,228 --> 01:08:19,388
Didn't go on Big Thunder.

2001
01:08:19,848 --> 01:08:21,228
Didn't go on Splash Mountain.

2002
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:21,628
Wow.

2003
01:08:22,268 --> 01:08:24,048
The lines are so long.

2004
01:08:24,188 --> 01:08:26,968
But also, there is a complication,

2005
01:08:27,048 --> 01:08:29,688
which is that I had injured myself.

2006
01:08:29,948 --> 01:08:30,948
Oh my God, guys.

2007
01:08:30,948 --> 01:08:31,868
Oh yeah, so well that happens,

2008
01:08:31,888 --> 01:08:32,428
hold on, that happens on D.

2009
01:08:32,428 --> 01:08:33,908
It struck my lightning too.

2010
01:08:34,148 --> 01:08:35,228
I guess this is, you know, this is a.

2011
01:08:35,228 --> 01:08:37,588
I don't have the best health luck or.

2012
01:08:37,928 --> 01:08:38,608
Accident luck.

2013
01:08:38,608 --> 01:08:40,788
Because you injured yourself in Florida too

2014
01:08:40,788 --> 01:08:41,748
when we were in Florida

2015
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:43,188
and we had to go to the Disney doctor.

2016
01:08:43,188 --> 01:08:44,488
I kicked a suitcase by accident

2017
01:08:44,488 --> 01:08:46,088
and then my toe was just fucked up

2018
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:47,208
the whole rest of the trip.

2019
01:08:47,888 --> 01:08:50,708
But this is maybe, it was a very rainy day

2020
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:54,088
and you slipped down the stairs of the do-

2021
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:57,608
I slipped on a step and then landed hard.

2022
01:08:57,688 --> 01:08:58,448
So hard.

2023
01:08:58,448 --> 01:08:59,548
On my butt, on a step.

2024
01:08:59,648 --> 01:09:01,328
We were in the middle of a giant crowd.

2025
01:09:01,588 --> 01:09:04,628
You slipped and fell and it made such a loud noise

2026
01:09:04,628 --> 01:09:09,168
and impact, everyone in the station stopped.

2027
01:09:09,168 --> 01:09:10,788
Yeah, they froze.

2028
01:09:10,788 --> 01:09:13,228
Froze and turned in horror.

2029
01:09:13,448 --> 01:09:16,608
And not just turned, they gasped.

2030
01:09:16,608 --> 01:09:16,888
Yes.

2031
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:20,968
In unison for the same duration of time.

2032
01:09:21,108 --> 01:09:21,748
It was like.

2033
01:09:22,968 --> 01:09:23,428
Yes.

2034
01:09:23,748 --> 01:09:26,108
The behavior of a graceless guy, Jin.

2035
01:09:26,568 --> 01:09:27,048
What?

2036
01:09:27,248 --> 01:09:28,768
Will display for all of the trans.

2037
01:09:28,768 --> 01:09:29,268
The behavior.

2038
01:09:29,268 --> 01:09:30,488
I'm not gonna mess with you calling

2039
01:09:30,488 --> 01:09:35,508
my legitimate health scares, hygiene.

2040
01:09:37,368 --> 01:09:39,148
No traits for you after.

2041
01:09:40,128 --> 01:09:42,328
My financial situation would change drastically

2042
01:09:42,328 --> 01:09:44,448
if I cut back on wine.

2043
01:09:44,448 --> 01:09:46,568
Jason is out of control.

2044
01:09:47,068 --> 01:09:49,128
He's a real guy, Jin heel today.

2045
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:52,188
Yeah, this is a good phrase.

2046
01:09:52,308 --> 01:09:53,888
You'll put it back on you.

2047
01:09:54,188 --> 01:09:54,308
Sure.

2048
01:09:54,908 --> 01:09:55,628
Well, I am the-

2049
01:09:55,628 --> 01:09:56,268
Guy, Jin, Jason.

2050
01:09:56,528 --> 01:09:59,368
I am the most, yeah, I am the guy, Jin of this episode.

2051
01:10:00,688 --> 01:10:03,508
Well, let me, so what, when you, well-

2052
01:10:03,508 --> 01:10:05,468
You have a chart out and a pen notes.

2053
01:10:05,648 --> 01:10:06,288
Okay, so-

2054
01:10:06,288 --> 01:10:07,488
Oh, but just to finish up.

2055
01:10:07,488 --> 01:10:09,108
So it hurt to even walk,

2056
01:10:09,308 --> 01:10:10,468
so I didn't wanna go on Big Thunder.

2057
01:10:10,468 --> 01:10:12,388
You hit the stair.

2058
01:10:13,288 --> 01:10:13,608
So hard.

2059
01:10:13,868 --> 01:10:16,168
I was, I remember, I froze too,

2060
01:10:16,308 --> 01:10:17,668
because of the way much had happened.

2061
01:10:17,728 --> 01:10:20,348
And the noise and everything,

2062
01:10:21,428 --> 01:10:23,088
and you said that you had the same thought,

2063
01:10:23,228 --> 01:10:25,328
I go, what's broken?

2064
01:10:26,228 --> 01:10:29,548
And we're hospital, like everything flashed of like,

2065
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:30,868
okay, can she even walk?

2066
01:10:30,988 --> 01:10:33,768
There was a moment where I couldn't feel my body

2067
01:10:33,768 --> 01:10:35,928
and I thought I might not be able to walk again.

2068
01:10:35,948 --> 01:10:36,508
Jesus.

2069
01:10:36,508 --> 01:10:38,368
It was so intense.

2070
01:10:38,548 --> 01:10:42,288
And I've taken a spill before, in a puddle.

2071
01:10:43,028 --> 01:10:44,568
The clearest one I remember is,

2072
01:10:44,768 --> 01:10:47,148
I slipped in a puddle in front of a target

2073
01:10:47,148 --> 01:10:49,328
and then stood up and just laughed it off.

2074
01:10:49,608 --> 01:10:52,308
So any time I have slipped before,

2075
01:10:52,628 --> 01:10:54,668
I've immediately stood up and just laughed it off.

2076
01:10:55,328 --> 01:10:59,968
This time I was like, no, I can't move for a second.

2077
01:11:00,268 --> 01:11:01,928
It was terrifying.

2078
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:02,948
Yes, it was terrifying.

2079
01:11:02,948 --> 01:11:06,468
It was the most terrified I've been of you falling,

2080
01:11:06,468 --> 01:11:08,108
I guess, I don't know.

2081
01:11:08,108 --> 01:11:09,548
You weren't worried about that one.

2082
01:11:09,628 --> 01:11:10,428
Of my wellbeing?

2083
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:12,368
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

2084
01:11:12,588 --> 01:11:14,508
You were worried it would be your last hijink.

2085
01:11:15,068 --> 01:11:18,148
Yeah, the final hijink to end all hijinks.

2086
01:11:18,348 --> 01:11:19,688
At least it didn't go out with a bang.

2087
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:21,848
Oh, like I said, like whoa.

2088
01:11:22,788 --> 01:11:24,748
It was that, but literally.

2089
01:11:25,248 --> 01:11:26,708
Jason, yes, you have a question.

2090
01:11:26,708 --> 01:11:28,048
Yes, I pulled out my paperwork.

2091
01:11:29,928 --> 01:11:34,648
So when you moved to the Tokyo Disney area,

2092
01:11:34,788 --> 01:11:36,348
what hotel did you stay at?

2093
01:11:36,628 --> 01:11:36,648
The Sheraton.

2094
01:11:36,648 --> 01:11:37,928
We're never gonna talk about rides.

2095
01:11:37,928 --> 01:11:38,688
The Sheraton.

2096
01:11:38,688 --> 01:11:39,088
Oh my God.

2097
01:11:39,148 --> 01:11:40,728
The Sheraton Tokyo Bay.

2098
01:11:40,868 --> 01:11:43,188
We just wanna keep you here as long as possible.

2099
01:11:43,188 --> 01:11:43,868
Yeah, that is true.

2100
01:11:43,968 --> 01:11:46,148
I have a dinner, I literally have to leave at some point.

2101
01:11:46,348 --> 01:11:47,368
How deep are we?

2102
01:11:48,228 --> 01:11:50,468
We were like first, oh, time-wise?

2103
01:11:51,008 --> 01:11:52,008
It's 4.51.

2104
01:11:52,248 --> 01:11:53,448
Hour and eight minutes.

2105
01:11:54,948 --> 01:11:55,268
So.

2106
01:11:55,268 --> 01:11:56,568
The Sheraton Grand.

2107
01:11:56,648 --> 01:11:57,688
Sheraton Grand, yes, Tokyo Bay.

2108
01:11:57,688 --> 01:11:59,648
The Sheraton Hotel, which is a Tokyo Disney Resort

2109
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:00,508
official hotel.

2110
01:12:00,668 --> 01:12:00,928
That's correct.

2111
01:12:00,928 --> 01:12:01,808
But not a Disney hotel.

2112
01:12:02,688 --> 01:12:02,688


2113
01:12:02,908 --> 01:12:04,028
Tell me about a ride.

2114
01:12:04,428 --> 01:12:06,108
Tell me about one ride.

2115
01:12:06,408 --> 01:12:08,408
What is the ride you wanna hear about?

2116
01:12:08,888 --> 01:12:09,628
Let me see.

2117
01:12:09,828 --> 01:12:09,988
Hold on.

2118
01:12:09,988 --> 01:12:11,708
Let me give you guys your souvenirs.

2119
01:12:12,128 --> 01:12:12,648
Yay.

2120
01:12:13,048 --> 01:12:14,628
They're just, they're tiny.

2121
01:12:14,988 --> 01:12:17,848
Honestly, I was looking for something.

2122
01:12:17,848 --> 01:12:18,868
I'm losing energy like a little kid.

2123
01:12:18,868 --> 01:12:19,848
We have two children here.

2124
01:12:19,888 --> 01:12:20,768
Don't take me to a ride.

2125
01:12:20,788 --> 01:12:21,048
What in the rain?

2126
01:12:21,068 --> 01:12:25,228
I don't even remember what's in these.

2127
01:12:25,408 --> 01:12:27,508
I was looking for something very specific,

2128
01:12:27,508 --> 01:12:28,648
but they don't have,

2129
01:12:29,008 --> 01:12:31,408
everything's very general in a different way there.

2130
01:12:31,428 --> 01:12:32,868
So I was looking for something like really cool

2131
01:12:32,868 --> 01:12:33,688
and specific to rides,

2132
01:12:33,868 --> 01:12:36,228
but they don't, it's lacking in that department.

2133
01:12:36,548 --> 01:12:38,048
But I got something that I thought was a,

2134
01:12:38,288 --> 01:12:40,848
you pointed this out when we were in the gift shop,

2135
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:41,088
the candy shop.

2136
01:12:41,088 --> 01:12:41,668
I don't even remember.

2137
01:12:42,828 --> 01:12:44,748
That there was a funny phrase on this.

2138
01:12:45,068 --> 01:12:46,328
And then I guess got two of them.

2139
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:47,748
I was like, oh, this is a funny little thing.

2140
01:12:48,488 --> 01:12:49,488
Oh, I do remember.

2141
01:12:49,608 --> 01:12:49,988
Hand it to Scott.

2142
01:12:50,228 --> 01:12:52,208
I don't even know what's in here, if it's good or not.

2143
01:12:52,608 --> 01:12:52,848
All right.

2144
01:12:54,128 --> 01:12:54,788
And look at what we got.

2145
01:12:54,968 --> 01:12:56,828
I'm gonna read the phrase that's on this

2146
01:12:56,828 --> 01:12:58,368
and why we enjoyed it.

2147
01:12:58,748 --> 01:13:01,448
It all started in 1983.

2148
01:13:02,208 --> 01:13:03,748
Thank you guys.

2149
01:13:04,628 --> 01:13:05,088
So much.

2150
01:13:05,448 --> 01:13:07,668
Tokyo did and everything I love did.

2151
01:13:07,908 --> 01:13:09,248
There's extra bags.

2152
01:13:09,408 --> 01:13:11,588
If you want a bag here, you can have a bag.

2153
01:13:11,788 --> 01:13:12,788
They give you extra bags.

2154
01:13:12,948 --> 01:13:15,188
If you like, they censor buying it for souvenirs.

2155
01:13:15,188 --> 01:13:16,248
What's in this tin?

2156
01:13:16,248 --> 01:13:17,168
I have no idea.

2157
01:13:17,188 --> 01:13:17,828
Open it.

2158
01:13:18,008 --> 01:13:18,968
Bags are beautiful.

2159
01:13:19,088 --> 01:13:21,748
We bought it because of the phrase.

2160
01:13:22,548 --> 01:13:23,608
Oh, you know me well.

2161
01:13:23,728 --> 01:13:24,128
I'm sorry.

2162
01:13:24,228 --> 01:13:25,968
What is the, I don't,

2163
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:27,988
I'm really feeling dense.

2164
01:13:27,988 --> 01:13:29,348
The park started in 1983,

2165
01:13:30,048 --> 01:13:31,388
but it's like a funny thing is the phrase.

2166
01:13:31,388 --> 01:13:33,628
But that's not when it all started.

2167
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:34,608
The Disney phrase always,

2168
01:13:34,648 --> 01:13:36,328
it's all started with a mouse or something.

2169
01:13:36,448 --> 01:13:37,308
Yes, okay, yeah.

2170
01:13:37,308 --> 01:13:38,188
And then we're like, what?

2171
01:13:38,408 --> 01:13:39,688
It didn't all start in 1983.

2172
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:39,888
What do you mean it all?

2173
01:13:39,968 --> 01:13:41,028
It's a weird swerve of that.

2174
01:13:41,048 --> 01:13:42,888
But it's similar to my favorite phrase

2175
01:13:42,888 --> 01:13:47,888
that Epcot, the 21st century begins October 1st, 1982.

2176
01:13:48,488 --> 01:13:49,888
This is like a cousin of that.

2177
01:13:49,888 --> 01:13:50,408
Yes, yes.

2178
01:13:50,428 --> 01:13:50,908
It makes me very happy.

2179
01:13:51,128 --> 01:13:52,328
Okay, tell me this.

2180
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:52,888
All right.

2181
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:53,568
What's the ride?

2182
01:13:53,568 --> 01:13:54,388
What's the ride?

2183
01:13:55,168 --> 01:13:57,888
I'm so excited to go because it seems like Tomorrowland

2184
01:13:57,888 --> 01:14:00,248
is locked in 1983 perfection.

2185
01:14:00,548 --> 01:14:01,908
How is there Tomorrowland?

2186
01:14:02,568 --> 01:14:03,868
It's better.

2187
01:14:04,068 --> 01:14:05,488
It's better than Disneyland.

2188
01:14:05,968 --> 01:14:06,308
Okay.

2189
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:07,908
Well, I don't know though,

2190
01:14:07,908 --> 01:14:09,808
because the layout of it I don't love.

2191
01:14:10,268 --> 01:14:11,088
There's awesome.

2192
01:14:11,088 --> 01:14:12,128
There's just not much to it.

2193
01:14:12,168 --> 01:14:13,888
There's not much to it.

2194
01:14:14,268 --> 01:14:14,428
And.

2195
01:14:14,828 --> 01:14:17,448
But if there's big old spires and fountains,

2196
01:14:17,508 --> 01:14:18,328
then I'm set.

2197
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:19,548
I think that.

2198
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:20,828
And weird tubes and shit.

2199
01:14:22,148 --> 01:14:24,488
Don't put your expectations too high

2200
01:14:24,488 --> 01:14:26,168
for Tomorrowland and Tokyo Disneyland.

2201
01:14:26,188 --> 01:14:27,868
I've seen photos there.

2202
01:14:28,008 --> 01:14:29,248
I think they're right where they need to be.

2203
01:14:29,248 --> 01:14:30,868
All right, maybe you're gonna love it.

2204
01:14:31,068 --> 01:14:31,868
The blue and white look beautiful.

2205
01:14:31,888 --> 01:14:34,788
All right, so I guess you asking the question

2206
01:14:34,788 --> 01:14:36,988
and us giving you an answer was unnecessary.

2207
01:14:37,288 --> 01:14:38,268
I'm not satisfied with your answer.

2208
01:14:39,288 --> 01:14:40,148
How's their Star Tours?

2209
01:14:40,748 --> 01:14:44,708
Star Tours, oh, it's, well, there's a,

2210
01:14:44,708 --> 01:14:45,488
you don't want any spoilers.

2211
01:14:45,488 --> 01:14:46,948
We can't say that.

2212
01:14:47,048 --> 01:14:48,108
We shouldn't tell you.

2213
01:14:48,108 --> 01:14:48,928
We can't tell you that.

2214
01:14:49,148 --> 01:14:50,808
All right.

2215
01:14:51,108 --> 01:14:51,668
It's the same.

2216
01:14:51,668 --> 01:14:51,948
It's the same.

2217
01:14:52,368 --> 01:14:54,568
There's an area that's fun

2218
01:14:54,568 --> 01:14:56,208
and we shouldn't tell you about.

2219
01:14:56,708 --> 01:14:56,808
Okay.

2220
01:14:56,808 --> 01:14:58,328
There's an area, okay, we'll say this.

2221
01:14:58,528 --> 01:15:01,508
There's an area that's like an extra area in the queue

2222
01:15:01,508 --> 01:15:04,548
and there's an amazing line thing

2223
01:15:04,548 --> 01:15:07,188
that we didn't realize was there.

2224
01:15:07,188 --> 01:15:07,568
Oh boy.

2225
01:15:07,568 --> 01:15:09,288
And we turned the corner and went, whoa!

2226
01:15:09,628 --> 01:15:09,728
Yeah.

2227
01:15:09,828 --> 01:15:12,768
It's like very visually arresting.

2228
01:15:12,828 --> 01:15:14,248
Jason, do you wanna write this down

2229
01:15:14,248 --> 01:15:15,508
and as soon as Scott's gone,

2230
01:15:15,588 --> 01:15:17,188
we'll reveal all the things we're saying?

2231
01:15:17,308 --> 01:15:18,208
Oh yeah, good.

2232
01:15:18,588 --> 01:15:18,748
Good, good.

2233
01:15:19,088 --> 01:15:19,448
Let me hear.

2234
01:15:19,768 --> 01:15:21,888
Oh, that's actually a really good idea.

2235
01:15:22,008 --> 01:15:22,908
Yeah, go for it.

2236
01:15:23,128 --> 01:15:25,108
Do you wanna make a note on your phone

2237
01:15:25,108 --> 01:15:27,668
and then when you're scrolling through Twitter,

2238
01:15:27,788 --> 01:15:29,668
you can pretend you're writing it down?

2239
01:15:31,488 --> 01:15:32,148
Jason just pouted.

2240
01:15:32,148 --> 01:15:33,528
Jason just frowned at me.

2241
01:15:33,548 --> 01:15:34,488
This is gonna be a hard time.

2242
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:36,428
We all have our processes.

2243
01:15:37,348 --> 01:15:41,628
We're all professional, we're all professional podcasters.

2244
01:15:41,908 --> 01:15:44,488
What by the way, what is in there?

2245
01:15:44,568 --> 01:15:46,148
Oh, the tin contains,

2246
01:15:46,908 --> 01:15:49,908
they look like odd little like espresso bean kind of thing.

2247
01:15:49,908 --> 01:15:50,828
Oh, that's mine.

2248
01:15:51,148 --> 01:15:52,188
Individually wrapped, beautifully wrapped.

2249
01:15:52,488 --> 01:15:55,168
Like everything there is individually wrapped.

2250
01:15:55,768 --> 01:15:58,048
Okay, this wouldn't be a spoiler,

2251
01:15:58,128 --> 01:16:01,608
but I hear that that aquatopia is a very pleasant thing,

2252
01:16:01,608 --> 01:16:03,248
the water-autopia.

2253
01:16:03,908 --> 01:16:05,128
Oh, in DisneySea.

2254
01:16:05,168 --> 01:16:06,368
Yeah, yeah, we went on that.

2255
01:16:06,488 --> 01:16:08,688
It's over by the Nemo and Friends Searider.

2256
01:16:08,948 --> 01:16:09,448
It's the outdoor thing.

2257
01:16:09,468 --> 01:16:10,588
I have such a bad memory.

2258
01:16:10,668 --> 01:16:11,868
He's reminding me right now.

2259
01:16:11,868 --> 01:16:14,548
It's the WiFi, it's WiFi basically controlled,

2260
01:16:14,548 --> 01:16:15,808
but it's on the water.

2261
01:16:15,808 --> 01:16:19,048
It's in the back towards like Discovery Bay.

2262
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:20,688
Hold on, I gotta show you a picture of this.

2263
01:16:20,968 --> 01:16:22,308
This candy is delicious by the way.

2264
01:16:22,368 --> 01:16:24,248
I'm not even sure the flavor, it's wonderful.

2265
01:16:24,308 --> 01:16:25,428
It's a wonderful tin thing.

2266
01:16:25,768 --> 01:16:26,968
Oh, while we're talking about that

2267
01:16:26,968 --> 01:16:28,568
and Michael is looking up the thing

2268
01:16:28,568 --> 01:16:29,988
to jog my terrible memory,

2269
01:16:30,348 --> 01:16:36,048
I bought what is I guess a very Tokyo Disneyland item,

2270
01:16:36,128 --> 01:16:38,328
which is their chocolate rice candies

2271
01:16:38,328 --> 01:16:41,008
or chocolate crunch they call it, chocolate crunch candies.

2272
01:16:41,348 --> 01:16:43,048
And they all came individually wrapped.

2273
01:16:43,048 --> 01:16:47,608
I bought it in a little 35th anniversary bag,

2274
01:16:47,828 --> 01:16:51,088
zip it open and there are all these individually wrapped

2275
01:16:51,088 --> 01:16:54,368
chocolate crunch things and they were fine.

2276
01:16:55,328 --> 01:16:56,148
Okay. Disappointing.

2277
01:16:56,368 --> 01:16:58,308
All the lists were like, get these.

2278
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:00,548
Oh, I loved that thing.

2279
01:17:00,548 --> 01:17:01,128
Yeah, really fun.

2280
01:17:01,448 --> 01:17:01,828
Little boats.

2281
01:17:02,948 --> 01:17:03,108
Yeah, yeah.

2282
01:17:03,108 --> 01:17:04,708
Yeah, that thing was great.

2283
01:17:04,948 --> 01:17:07,328
High tech looking bumper boats, essentially.

2284
01:17:07,408 --> 01:17:08,708
Yeah, they don't bump into anything.

2285
01:17:08,768 --> 01:17:11,088
They just sort of do a WiFi controlled little dance

2286
01:17:11,088 --> 01:17:12,228
in the water. And they spin you around.

2287
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:13,648
It's very fun.

2288
01:17:13,648 --> 01:17:15,608
I would do it at night if you can.

2289
01:17:15,688 --> 01:17:16,328
Ooh, neat, okay.

2290
01:17:16,508 --> 01:17:17,328
That's when we did it.

2291
01:17:17,708 --> 01:17:18,568
Candy is amazing.

2292
01:17:18,828 --> 01:17:19,428
It's really good.

2293
01:17:19,448 --> 01:17:20,068
What is it?

2294
01:17:20,288 --> 01:17:23,708
It's like kind of coffee and kind of butter.

2295
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:26,088
Is it like a melts in your mouth thing or is it crunchy?

2296
01:17:26,088 --> 01:17:28,888
It's more like a Werther's kind of texture.

2297
01:17:28,948 --> 01:17:29,248
Oh, okay.

2298
01:17:29,348 --> 01:17:30,088
It is, yeah.

2299
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:31,508
It's like a higher quality Werther's.

2300
01:17:31,508 --> 01:17:32,208
That's excellent.

2301
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:35,688
Yeah, these chocolate crunch things are like a Nestle bar

2302
01:17:35,688 --> 01:17:37,228
but like lighter and fluffier.

2303
01:17:38,568 --> 01:17:41,408
This is not particularly, I think from what I can tell,

2304
01:17:41,408 --> 01:17:42,748
it's a very similar ride.

2305
01:17:43,168 --> 01:17:44,528
What do you think about Indiana Jones?

2306
01:17:45,048 --> 01:17:46,308
Oh my God.

2307
01:17:47,068 --> 01:17:47,068


2308
01:17:47,568 --> 01:17:51,368
The tiny, it's basically the same but the tiny touches

2309
01:17:51,368 --> 01:17:52,068
that dress it up more.

2310
01:17:52,068 --> 01:17:53,928
You don't want to know the tiny touches though, right?

2311
01:17:54,008 --> 01:17:54,848
I've watched the video.

2312
01:17:54,848 --> 01:17:55,028
I'll just tell you.

2313
01:17:55,068 --> 01:17:55,688
Oh, you have?

2314
01:17:56,268 --> 01:17:58,708
So the temple is incredible.

2315
01:17:58,728 --> 01:17:59,548
Much better because of them.

2316
01:17:59,728 --> 01:18:03,868
I like the intimacy of our queue, how small it is.

2317
01:18:04,248 --> 01:18:05,888
But the temple, we did it by the way.

2318
01:18:05,908 --> 01:18:07,548
And the queue is very cool though.

2319
01:18:07,548 --> 01:18:08,028
Oh, it's great.

2320
01:18:08,668 --> 01:18:10,568
It's like a big cavern with skulls

2321
01:18:10,568 --> 01:18:11,808
and skeletons everywhere.

2322
01:18:11,908 --> 01:18:14,328
Yeah, we did single rider in Tokyo each time.

2323
01:18:14,328 --> 01:18:15,308
So that's a good tip.

2324
01:18:15,648 --> 01:18:16,888
It's just, you may as well just do that

2325
01:18:16,888 --> 01:18:17,988
because it's very fast.

2326
01:18:18,048 --> 01:18:19,088
Barely anybody does it.

2327
01:18:19,088 --> 01:18:22,828
And we kept getting put on cars at the same time anyway.

2328
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:24,148
Different cars but.

2329
01:18:24,348 --> 01:18:25,888
Yeah, I mean, it was very simple

2330
01:18:25,888 --> 01:18:27,628
and that line is always very long.

2331
01:18:27,768 --> 01:18:29,008
So we did it three times.

2332
01:18:29,048 --> 01:18:29,408
Okay.

2333
01:18:29,628 --> 01:18:30,928
And immediately you're like,

2334
01:18:31,068 --> 01:18:32,608
oh, it feels like the ride is new.

2335
01:18:33,168 --> 01:18:35,788
It feels like the track is brand new.

2336
01:18:35,888 --> 01:18:38,208
And you're like, well, why isn't ours feel like

2337
01:18:38,208 --> 01:18:39,588
this track is brand new?

2338
01:18:39,588 --> 01:18:40,168
Yeah.

2339
01:18:40,888 --> 01:18:42,228
Everything is smooth.

2340
01:18:42,448 --> 01:18:45,228
Everything was smoother but like threw you around

2341
01:18:45,228 --> 01:18:46,488
a little more I felt like.

2342
01:18:46,748 --> 01:18:48,428
I think that's just the other smoothness of the ride.

2343
01:18:48,468 --> 01:18:48,828
Who knows?

2344
01:18:49,328 --> 01:18:50,208
Maybe there's some difference.

2345
01:18:51,308 --> 01:18:52,388
Somebody was talking online.

2346
01:18:52,568 --> 01:18:54,368
I read about the fact that like they light

2347
01:18:54,368 --> 01:18:56,588
the one in Disneyland with more black lights.

2348
01:18:57,588 --> 01:19:00,928
And I don't know what the other lights they use in Tokyo

2349
01:19:00,928 --> 01:19:05,508
are but it's kind of a cooler creepier lighting in Tokyo.

2350
01:19:06,128 --> 01:19:09,128
Honestly, the only thing that I like more here

2351
01:19:09,128 --> 01:19:10,948
about Indiana Jones is Mara.

2352
01:19:11,268 --> 01:19:11,408
Yeah.

2353
01:19:11,788 --> 01:19:15,308
There's a cool crystal skull in that spot where Mara is

2354
01:19:15,308 --> 01:19:16,548
but other than that.

2355
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:18,608
I like Mara much more but.

2356
01:19:18,868 --> 01:19:19,548
But that's it.

2357
01:19:19,648 --> 01:19:24,968
But in terms of like the balance on the scales.

2358
01:19:26,348 --> 01:19:26,808
For Florida.

2359
01:19:26,808 --> 01:19:27,668
So in Indiana Jones.

2360
01:19:27,668 --> 01:19:28,348
Tokyo is definitely better.

2361
01:19:28,688 --> 01:19:31,628
Indiana Jones crystal skull thing is inferior in some way.

2362
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:33,208
To other Indiana Jones.

2363
01:19:33,208 --> 01:19:34,248
It's just the skull itself.

2364
01:19:34,288 --> 01:19:36,168
When you come in and where Mara usually is,

2365
01:19:36,348 --> 01:19:36,728
it's a tinier.

2366
01:19:36,728 --> 01:19:37,728
Oh, I see you're making a joke.

2367
01:19:38,068 --> 01:19:38,608
Oh, I get it.

2368
01:19:38,608 --> 01:19:40,048
I see, I see.

2369
01:19:40,548 --> 01:19:41,288
I'm being serious.

2370
01:19:41,608 --> 01:19:41,908
I'm sorry.

2371
01:19:42,428 --> 01:19:44,788
But that crystal skull predates the movie.

2372
01:19:44,928 --> 01:19:45,368
It does.

2373
01:19:46,288 --> 01:19:47,148
It is no much.

2374
01:19:47,928 --> 01:19:48,448
There's no much.

2375
01:19:48,568 --> 01:19:50,588
But then the big thing and I guess we're getting

2376
01:19:50,588 --> 01:19:52,808
the spoilers already so if anyone turn this off

2377
01:19:52,808 --> 01:19:56,008
is the fact that and the thing we said on the Indiana Jones

2378
01:19:56,008 --> 01:19:59,328
episode is that that last room or the second to last room

2379
01:19:59,328 --> 01:20:01,848
really or third to last room whatever where the darts

2380
01:20:01,848 --> 01:20:03,108
are happening is lacking.

2381
01:20:03,948 --> 01:20:04,928
Not as much here.

2382
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:05,908
Yeah, skip that.

2383
01:20:05,988 --> 01:20:07,368
I do know this from a video.

2384
01:20:07,368 --> 01:20:09,728
The thing that happens in there rules.

2385
01:20:09,728 --> 01:20:11,828
You guys know more than me because you went in person

2386
01:20:11,828 --> 01:20:13,348
but I'm so excited to experience it.

2387
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:14,428
And you don't want us to like watch it.

2388
01:20:14,428 --> 01:20:14,888
I didn't know.

2389
01:20:14,888 --> 01:20:15,188
Just describe it.

2390
01:20:15,908 --> 01:20:16,488
I didn't know either.

2391
01:20:16,588 --> 01:20:16,908
I didn't watch it.

2392
01:20:16,908 --> 01:20:17,768
Skip ahead if you don't.

2393
01:20:17,888 --> 01:20:19,448
The bigger spoiler section will come soon

2394
01:20:19,448 --> 01:20:21,168
because I have to leave for dinner.

2395
01:20:21,188 --> 01:20:21,488
Sure.

2396
01:20:21,828 --> 01:20:24,008
So the and wine.

2397
01:20:26,268 --> 01:20:27,628
Look at his lips again.

2398
01:20:28,348 --> 01:20:30,108
The new joke is that Scott's a wino.

2399
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:34,948
This will stick to my infinite torment.

2400
01:20:37,068 --> 01:20:38,848
So instead of the dart room.

2401
01:20:39,348 --> 01:20:39,648
What do we got?

2402
01:20:39,648 --> 01:20:40,228
No, there's a dart.

2403
01:20:40,228 --> 01:20:41,008
There is a dart room.

2404
01:20:41,428 --> 01:20:42,688
But at the end of the dart room.

2405
01:20:43,548 --> 01:20:44,848
Start of the dart room.

2406
01:20:45,068 --> 01:20:45,568
It is?

2407
01:20:45,868 --> 01:20:46,568
On the way to the dart room.

2408
01:20:46,568 --> 01:20:47,348
On the way to the dart room.

2409
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:49,728
Your vehicle stops.

2410
01:20:49,728 --> 01:20:50,448
I'm all turned around.

2411
01:20:50,448 --> 01:20:52,068
Your vehicle stops before the dart room

2412
01:20:52,068 --> 01:20:56,308
which is in our Indiana Jones just blank, nothing.

2413
01:20:56,608 --> 01:20:57,608
You just zoom through.

2414
01:20:57,928 --> 01:21:01,528
You stop and there's a smallish Mara,

2415
01:21:01,528 --> 01:21:04,208
a kind of head with a giant mouth

2416
01:21:04,208 --> 01:21:06,108
that threatens you in Japanese.

2417
01:21:06,888 --> 01:21:08,208
And then much like the effect.

2418
01:21:08,508 --> 01:21:09,568
The crazy bellow.

2419
01:21:09,668 --> 01:21:10,888
I wouldn't begin to know the words.

2420
01:21:11,028 --> 01:21:11,988
I won't do my typical,

2421
01:21:12,688 --> 01:21:14,248
take my opportunity to do a bellow.

2422
01:21:14,388 --> 01:21:17,928
But then voice is like this insane high energy scream.

2423
01:21:18,008 --> 01:21:19,268
And we didn't know.

2424
01:21:19,948 --> 01:21:23,388
So to be going through a thing that you know so well

2425
01:21:23,388 --> 01:21:26,268
and then having a whole new section or character

2426
01:21:26,268 --> 01:21:28,088
or something appear was so cool.

2427
01:21:28,208 --> 01:21:29,068
And it stops.

2428
01:21:29,068 --> 01:21:31,388
And then it's the same effect as I think

2429
01:21:31,388 --> 01:21:33,648
on the end of the big thunder refurb

2430
01:21:33,648 --> 01:21:36,648
where it's like it shoots fire at you.

2431
01:21:36,648 --> 01:21:38,748
It shoots a fireball at you.

2432
01:21:38,748 --> 01:21:39,268
Yeah.

2433
01:21:39,408 --> 01:21:42,108
And I was genuinely frightened for a moment.

2434
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:43,048
I was like, ah.

2435
01:21:43,628 --> 01:21:45,108
And then you go into the dart room

2436
01:21:45,108 --> 01:21:46,688
and the dart room is the same setup

2437
01:21:46,688 --> 01:21:49,448
except there's some dimension to it.

2438
01:21:49,788 --> 01:21:50,928
There's like heads.

2439
01:21:51,508 --> 01:21:52,568
There's three dimensional heads.

2440
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:54,948
It feels more like they're coming out of the wall

2441
01:21:54,948 --> 01:21:58,248
instead of just these 2D skeletons.

2442
01:21:58,248 --> 01:22:02,128
And then all three times we went on

2443
01:22:02,128 --> 01:22:05,188
the ball effect immediately works.

2444
01:22:05,188 --> 01:22:06,008
It was seamless.

2445
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:09,348
The last time I went into Indiana Jones a week ago,

2446
01:22:09,708 --> 01:22:11,828
we waited there under Indy for a while.

2447
01:22:11,828 --> 01:22:13,428
We were waiting for something to happen.

2448
01:22:13,748 --> 01:22:15,248
Then all of a sudden, oh, then the lighting starts

2449
01:22:15,248 --> 01:22:16,168
and the ball comes in.

2450
01:22:16,248 --> 01:22:16,528
It's cool.

2451
01:22:17,068 --> 01:22:19,608
But for whatever reason, the ride worked perfectly.

2452
01:22:19,828 --> 01:22:21,588
Each time you get off,

2453
01:22:21,928 --> 01:22:24,688
Indiana Jones' animatronic is fucked up more.

2454
01:22:24,848 --> 01:22:27,768
His clothes are really ripped and he looks beat up.

2455
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:30,208
In a way that the one out here doesn't

2456
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:31,048
because I was just looking.

2457
01:22:31,308 --> 01:22:32,888
I made a point to look at him and I'm like,

2458
01:22:32,968 --> 01:22:35,848
he looks fine in the California Indiana Jones.

2459
01:22:36,508 --> 01:22:36,808
So like.

2460
01:22:36,808 --> 01:22:37,788
Yeah, he looks real messed up.

2461
01:22:37,948 --> 01:22:39,888
Indiana Jones is so good.

2462
01:22:39,948 --> 01:22:40,448
Great.

2463
01:22:40,688 --> 01:22:41,868
In Tokyo Disney Sea.

2464
01:22:42,008 --> 01:22:43,048
That's very exciting.

2465
01:22:43,928 --> 01:22:46,888
Here, let's do one more thing before I hit the road.

2466
01:22:48,248 --> 01:22:50,348
Tell me about this boat, the ship.

2467
01:22:51,488 --> 01:22:52,288
Oh, the Roosevelt?

2468
01:22:52,448 --> 01:22:52,788
Yeah.

2469
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:53,188
Yeah.

2470
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:54,768
Okay, well, the only,

2471
01:22:55,068 --> 01:22:58,028
I'll start by saying the only bit of weirdness

2472
01:22:58,028 --> 01:23:00,288
we've had with anyone in Japan

2473
01:23:00,288 --> 01:23:03,668
was in the Teddy Roosevelt Lounge.

2474
01:23:03,768 --> 01:23:04,888
He's a real bummer.

2475
01:23:05,428 --> 01:23:07,988
So yeah, there's the big steam ship that's parked

2476
01:23:07,988 --> 01:23:09,748
and it's not really like a ship

2477
01:23:09,748 --> 01:23:11,568
but it's made to look like it's a real ship

2478
01:23:11,568 --> 01:23:13,868
but it's in like the harbor of like old New York

2479
01:23:13,868 --> 01:23:16,568
and it's giant and they do like a Mickey review

2480
01:23:16,568 --> 01:23:18,528
New York show out in front.

2481
01:23:19,188 --> 01:23:20,328
And I was very excited

2482
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:21,988
because they have the Teddy Roosevelt Lounge

2483
01:23:21,988 --> 01:23:24,208
which is what we always saw a theme bar.

2484
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:25,288
We all are looking for.

2485
01:23:25,288 --> 01:23:26,808
Yeah, you were so excited about it.

2486
01:23:26,808 --> 01:23:27,768
So excited about it.

2487
01:23:27,768 --> 01:23:28,848
And I liked it.

2488
01:23:29,708 --> 01:23:30,848
I think I was very tired.

2489
01:23:30,868 --> 01:23:32,608
I was extra tired that day too.

2490
01:23:32,608 --> 01:23:35,568
And I think I was trying to get some energy back up.

2491
01:23:36,188 --> 01:23:37,448
We weren't seated in the,

2492
01:23:37,608 --> 01:23:39,008
That's the bigger thing too.

2493
01:23:39,028 --> 01:23:39,268
In a very cool part.

2494
01:23:39,428 --> 01:23:40,868
We were like right in front of the bar

2495
01:23:40,868 --> 01:23:42,908
and there wasn't a lot going on around us.

2496
01:23:43,108 --> 01:23:45,068
Yeah, but the lounge itself,

2497
01:23:45,148 --> 01:23:46,748
there's really, I think much,

2498
01:23:46,868 --> 01:23:48,568
like we could see the better part.

2499
01:23:48,768 --> 01:23:49,908
We were like, oh, we only were there.

2500
01:23:49,928 --> 01:23:50,528
Yeah, we should have gone back.

2501
01:23:50,828 --> 01:23:52,048
We should have gone back again.

2502
01:23:52,568 --> 01:23:54,508
Five days, we would have been back

2503
01:23:54,508 --> 01:23:55,928
to the Teddy Roosevelt Lounge.

2504
01:23:55,928 --> 01:23:58,648
Look, just everybody, you know,

2505
01:23:58,708 --> 01:24:01,688
like you all make millions of dollars

2506
01:24:01,688 --> 01:24:04,548
if you're in the middle class.

2507
01:24:04,808 --> 01:24:05,788
If you're in the lower class,

2508
01:24:05,808 --> 01:24:08,708
I just can't speak to you about it.

2509
01:24:08,748 --> 01:24:09,348
The Moorlocks?

2510
01:24:09,868 --> 01:24:10,248
Yeah.

2511
01:24:10,548 --> 01:24:12,108
The Moorlocks and the Eloy?

2512
01:24:12,508 --> 01:24:12,928
What?

2513
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,388
The what?

2514
01:24:13,668 --> 01:24:14,628
The what and the what?

2515
01:24:15,188 --> 01:24:17,428
The time machine, the H.G. Wells?

2516
01:24:17,468 --> 01:24:18,348
What's the second one?

2517
01:24:18,348 --> 01:24:19,088
Oh my God, geez.

2518
01:24:19,148 --> 01:24:19,548
All right.

2519
01:24:19,548 --> 01:24:21,268
I haven't read it, I'm sorry.

2520
01:24:21,328 --> 01:24:23,448
Okay, I thought that was one everyone read in school.

2521
01:24:23,448 --> 01:24:23,928
Nevermind.

2522
01:24:23,948 --> 01:24:25,368
I know Moorlocks from H.G. Wells,

2523
01:24:25,528 --> 01:24:26,648
I know Moorlocks from X-Men,

2524
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:28,288
but what did you mean by saying Moorlocks?

2525
01:24:28,308 --> 01:24:32,848
The Moorlocks, it's a metaphor for fear

2526
01:24:32,848 --> 01:24:34,648
of the working class and the Eloy.

2527
01:24:34,648 --> 01:24:35,508
What are we at?

2528
01:24:35,508 --> 01:24:37,448
I can't speak to the proletariat, but.

2529
01:24:37,648 --> 01:24:38,888
120, we're doing fine.

2530
01:24:39,608 --> 01:24:43,288
So we did like two drinks each

2531
01:24:43,288 --> 01:24:47,828
and they have such delicious, sugary fruit drinks.

2532
01:24:48,508 --> 01:24:51,028
And the drink menu was so intense.

2533
01:24:51,028 --> 01:24:52,648
There were so many cocktails.

2534
01:24:52,648 --> 01:24:54,248
And what did you get, that cool purple one?

2535
01:24:54,448 --> 01:24:54,848
Yeah.

2536
01:24:54,848 --> 01:24:55,808
Oh fuck, what was it called?

2537
01:24:56,048 --> 01:24:56,908
The violet. I don't know what it was called.

2538
01:24:57,028 --> 01:24:58,068
Do you have a picture of it somewhere?

2539
01:24:58,528 --> 01:24:58,808
Yes, I do.

2540
01:24:58,808 --> 01:25:00,048
We'll post a picture of it.

2541
01:25:00,508 --> 01:25:03,288
But like special like purple sugar

2542
01:25:03,288 --> 01:25:04,988
or something like around the rim?

2543
01:25:05,128 --> 01:25:06,288
It was just amazing.

2544
01:25:06,468 --> 01:25:11,808
Yeah, it was maybe like some kind of lavender syrup maybe?

2545
01:25:12,048 --> 01:25:14,308
There was something purple and special

2546
01:25:14,308 --> 01:25:15,348
and great about it.

2547
01:25:15,528 --> 01:25:18,468
But they also, I felt like they don't put a lot of alcohol

2548
01:25:18,468 --> 01:25:20,928
in the drinks that Toby Disney.

2549
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:24,048
Well, I mean, you would have been real bummed

2550
01:25:24,048 --> 01:25:26,528
and I'm sure you've experienced this before

2551
01:25:26,528 --> 01:25:29,388
but we're really being judged for how much we were drinking.

2552
01:25:29,608 --> 01:25:31,008
That's what we think happened.

2553
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,328
I experienced it every podcast.

2554
01:25:32,328 --> 01:25:33,148
You know how it is.

2555
01:25:33,908 --> 01:25:36,128
We had two, so basically what happened

2556
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:37,048
was there's some confusion

2557
01:25:37,048 --> 01:25:39,228
and they brought the check after one round

2558
01:25:39,228 --> 01:25:40,508
and we just wanted another,

2559
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:41,908
we're gonna have two other drinks.

2560
01:25:42,388 --> 01:25:44,248
And then we tried to flag someone

2561
01:25:44,248 --> 01:25:47,408
and like we had an app to write down in English

2562
01:25:47,408 --> 01:25:48,968
what we wanted and show it in Japanese

2563
01:25:48,968 --> 01:25:50,948
because not everybody speaks English.

2564
01:25:50,988 --> 01:25:51,288
Okay.

2565
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:52,968
But a lot of people do.

2566
01:25:53,108 --> 01:25:54,668
And most of the time when you're ordering food,

2567
01:25:55,028 --> 01:25:56,748
if they don't, you just point to the menu.

2568
01:25:56,908 --> 01:25:59,148
But since it's like, we got a check already,

2569
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,308
it was sort of hard to convey.

2570
01:26:00,568 --> 01:26:02,148
No, we want more.

2571
01:26:03,368 --> 01:26:06,728
So we found somebody, like there was a whole confusion

2572
01:26:06,728 --> 01:26:09,368
and like another waitress we told we wanted another drink

2573
01:26:09,368 --> 01:26:10,868
and then she ran to tell somebody else

2574
01:26:10,868 --> 01:26:14,068
and then the other waitress came back and took it away.

2575
01:26:14,128 --> 01:26:17,388
And then there was like an,

2576
01:26:17,388 --> 01:26:19,708
the guy who was in charge when he came back

2577
01:26:19,708 --> 01:26:24,608
that seemed weird and angry or like, okay, like here you go.

2578
01:26:24,868 --> 01:26:26,668
And then we were like, did we do something?

2579
01:26:26,768 --> 01:26:29,088
Are we not supposed to have more than one drink in here?

2580
01:26:29,088 --> 01:26:30,388
It was so confusing.

2581
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:33,128
Cause we hadn't had any weirdness with anyone.

2582
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:35,468
Everyone is so nice and polite and helpful

2583
01:26:35,468 --> 01:26:37,048
like if you're not from the country.

2584
01:26:37,228 --> 01:26:39,628
And for whatever reason, that was the one place

2585
01:26:39,628 --> 01:26:42,308
where we were like, what did we do wrong?

2586
01:26:42,408 --> 01:26:45,068
So we drank the drink and we're like,

2587
01:26:45,088 --> 01:26:47,208
quietly tiptoed out of there.

2588
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:50,188
I guess we did something wrong.

2589
01:26:50,188 --> 01:26:53,648
Channeling the gruff mannerisms of Teddy Roosevelt himself.

2590
01:26:55,028 --> 01:26:57,128
So we'll post the photos of the drinks

2591
01:26:57,128 --> 01:26:59,068
and all the photos from the trip.

2592
01:27:00,228 --> 01:27:02,648
So I like, if we sat in the other cooler area,

2593
01:27:02,668 --> 01:27:03,568
I think it would have been better

2594
01:27:03,568 --> 01:27:05,148
and just there was some confusion

2595
01:27:05,148 --> 01:27:06,488
and we have to look up online

2596
01:27:06,488 --> 01:27:08,788
if we like made some faux pas or something.

2597
01:27:09,168 --> 01:27:10,348
Yeah, I don't know what we did.

2598
01:27:10,368 --> 01:27:11,128
Maybe we did something.

2599
01:27:11,148 --> 01:27:12,488
They were really irritated.

2600
01:27:12,908 --> 01:27:15,508
So like in their quiet, respectful way.

2601
01:27:15,868 --> 01:27:16,708
Right, now it wasn't a-

2602
01:27:16,708 --> 01:27:19,428
It was just like this energy of we had done something.

2603
01:27:19,648 --> 01:27:25,028
I messed up in asking for another drink and they...

2604
01:27:25,028 --> 01:27:27,068
I don't even know.

2605
01:27:27,248 --> 01:27:27,908
I have no clue.

2606
01:27:28,008 --> 01:27:29,228
I have no idea about the Qui-Gon gins.

2607
01:27:29,848 --> 01:27:31,908
I'm just choosing to think that was the word

2608
01:27:31,908 --> 01:27:33,288
because I'm not obtaining it.

2609
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:36,708
That is interesting because I think of Japan,

2610
01:27:37,088 --> 01:27:39,808
of Japanese culture as a drinking culture of like,

2611
01:27:39,848 --> 01:27:41,208
I mean, you can buy beer on the vending machine,

2612
01:27:41,468 --> 01:27:42,708
the Japanese whiskies are very good.

2613
01:27:42,708 --> 01:27:44,068
Maybe it was a Disney thing.

2614
01:27:44,068 --> 01:27:44,868
I don't know, yeah.

2615
01:27:44,988 --> 01:27:46,348
Maybe there was just a rule like,

2616
01:27:47,348 --> 01:27:47,788
who knows?

2617
01:27:48,148 --> 01:27:48,968
I'm not exactly sure.

2618
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:51,768
Yeah, I mean, yeah, there's people drink.

2619
01:27:51,968 --> 01:27:53,068
It's not a big deal.

2620
01:27:53,068 --> 01:27:54,308
So yeah, I'm not sure.

2621
01:27:54,728 --> 01:27:58,948
I had other cocktails around the resort,

2622
01:27:59,108 --> 01:28:02,908
but no one was upset ever other than this one time.

2623
01:28:03,008 --> 01:28:03,788
You already learned it otherwise.

2624
01:28:03,968 --> 01:28:06,008
But Tokyo, for sure, Teddy Roosevelt Lounge is like,

2625
01:28:06,108 --> 01:28:07,248
if we had Teddy Roosevelt,

2626
01:28:07,268 --> 01:28:09,528
we would be there as much as we were at Carthay, I think.

2627
01:28:09,568 --> 01:28:10,308
Really, really?

2628
01:28:10,508 --> 01:28:11,088
Hey, that's nice.

2629
01:28:11,148 --> 01:28:12,468
It's in league with that, okay.

2630
01:28:12,508 --> 01:28:14,948
Yeah, you gotta do it theming-wise and you gotta do it.

2631
01:28:15,348 --> 01:28:17,648
I didn't see the full Mickey New York show.

2632
01:28:17,648 --> 01:28:20,908
At this point, I mean, what do we even,

2633
01:28:21,268 --> 01:28:23,348
I'm just gonna say some highlights of things

2634
01:28:23,348 --> 01:28:24,868
because there's too much to even talk about.

2635
01:28:25,588 --> 01:28:25,888
There is a-

2636
01:28:25,888 --> 01:28:28,488
I think I need to get out of here.

2637
01:28:28,728 --> 01:28:29,508
Oh, you wanna do it now?

2638
01:28:30,168 --> 01:28:30,508
Okay.

2639
01:28:30,708 --> 01:28:35,388
So, well, in that case, I survived by chance the rest.

2640
01:28:36,448 --> 01:28:36,948
Easily.

2641
01:28:37,648 --> 01:28:39,648
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got off a little easier

2642
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:40,188
than the rest of y'all.

2643
01:28:40,508 --> 01:28:43,248
So, hey, this is great.

2644
01:28:43,888 --> 01:28:46,668
Spoil away, listeners, beyond this threshold,

2645
01:28:47,188 --> 01:28:49,568
there may be things that you don't want to spoil

2646
01:28:49,568 --> 01:28:51,188
for your trip. Yeah, we're going in depth on rides now.

2647
01:28:51,688 --> 01:28:55,248
Then, yeah, you guys have at it.

2648
01:28:56,108 --> 01:28:57,388
I won't hold you back, spoil away.

2649
01:28:58,148 --> 01:28:59,808
You better run, when you get to the little run,

2650
01:28:59,868 --> 01:29:01,768
because I'm gonna immediately yell the Star Tour stuff.

2651
01:29:01,788 --> 01:29:03,448
Oh, God, okay, okay, I have 30 seconds

2652
01:29:03,448 --> 01:29:05,948
to clear out of the room or, well, guys-

2653
01:29:05,948 --> 01:29:07,668
Here's what's great about Saintepad.

2654
01:29:07,968 --> 01:29:09,208
Oh, wait, no, okay.

2655
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:09,948
Here's what we'll do.

2656
01:29:09,948 --> 01:29:13,228
We'll have a 30 second Jimmy Dean sausage discussion

2657
01:29:13,228 --> 01:29:14,428
with Jason as a buffer.

2658
01:29:14,608 --> 01:29:15,648
Okay, and that will be the buffer

2659
01:29:15,648 --> 01:29:17,628
and a buffer for the listeners as well.

2660
01:29:18,168 --> 01:29:19,768
Guys, this is great, I'm glad you had a good trip.

2661
01:29:19,868 --> 01:29:23,008
I'm glad all of the issues got solved.

2662
01:29:23,808 --> 01:29:26,448
And remember to end the episode at some point.

2663
01:29:27,228 --> 01:29:28,708
I'm gonna sneak out of here.

2664
01:29:28,728 --> 01:29:30,908
Without you here- We all live here, so.

2665
01:29:31,288 --> 01:29:33,248
Without you here- Listeners, I have nothing to,

2666
01:29:33,328 --> 01:29:34,868
you can't blame me at this point.

2667
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:36,828
Here, I'll put the mic towards the ground

2668
01:29:36,828 --> 01:29:37,868
so you can hear me walk away.

2669
01:29:37,988 --> 01:29:38,908
Okay, bye, guys.

2670
01:29:43,028 --> 01:29:44,088
All right, so Jason.

2671
01:29:44,228 --> 01:29:45,208
All right, what questions you got?

2672
01:29:45,468 --> 01:29:50,128
All right, so do you think that you ate those sausage

2673
01:29:50,128 --> 01:29:53,548
like once a week or like five a week?

2674
01:29:53,628 --> 01:29:55,748
Like how often were you eating the Jimmy Dean sausage?

2675
01:29:56,088 --> 01:29:57,228
Yes, excellent question.

2676
01:29:57,868 --> 01:30:01,048
I think because they were microwavable and quick to make,

2677
01:30:01,268 --> 01:30:03,588
I would eat them a lot of weekdays.

2678
01:30:04,068 --> 01:30:07,308
So I don't think five, but maybe three or four.

2679
01:30:07,548 --> 01:30:09,088
Wow, that's a lot.

2680
01:30:09,088 --> 01:30:09,908
That's too many.

2681
01:30:09,908 --> 01:30:11,048
It's too many.

2682
01:30:11,048 --> 01:30:12,548
You got the candy in your mouth right now,

2683
01:30:12,548 --> 01:30:13,308
which is funny too.

2684
01:30:13,548 --> 01:30:16,608
This is the longest lasting hard candy I've ever had.

2685
01:30:17,148 --> 01:30:18,848
It is shrunk so little.

2686
01:30:18,888 --> 01:30:20,288
Five stars. It is so delightful.

2687
01:30:20,528 --> 01:30:22,628
Yeah, five stars on this candy.

2688
01:30:24,188 --> 01:30:26,988
Okay, I know I haven't talked about this,

2689
01:30:27,628 --> 01:30:29,728
but the other thing, lunch,

2690
01:30:29,928 --> 01:30:33,008
I was a very weird lunch kid in elementary school.

2691
01:30:33,068 --> 01:30:34,688
Like I didn't buy lunch at school until like middle school.

2692
01:30:34,688 --> 01:30:35,888
I think 30 seconds is up though.

2693
01:30:36,628 --> 01:30:37,128
Okay.

2694
01:30:37,288 --> 01:30:41,728
There was one year I took an egg salad every day for a year.

2695
01:30:41,748 --> 01:30:43,188
Wow.

2696
01:30:43,748 --> 01:30:44,828
And I got choked.

2697
01:30:44,828 --> 01:30:45,608
We'll get to that later.

2698
01:30:45,648 --> 01:30:47,328
We'll get to that at a different one.

2699
01:30:48,008 --> 01:30:49,508
It's not as weird as the Jimmy Dean.

2700
01:30:49,948 --> 01:30:51,628
All right, Star Tours line, spoiler time.

2701
01:30:52,148 --> 01:30:54,208
There's an extra room when you wait in the queue,

2702
01:30:54,268 --> 01:30:55,768
which is themed and very cool.

2703
01:30:55,928 --> 01:30:58,228
But the big thing is we walk around the corner

2704
01:30:58,228 --> 01:30:59,368
in the Star Tours queue,

2705
01:30:59,748 --> 01:31:01,868
and there are three hitchhiking robots,

2706
01:31:02,048 --> 01:31:03,368
three hitchhiking droids.

2707
01:31:03,388 --> 01:31:05,808
And we were like, whoa, wow.

2708
01:31:06,728 --> 01:31:07,908
We were blown away.

2709
01:31:07,928 --> 01:31:09,288
That was so cool.

2710
01:31:09,848 --> 01:31:11,448
As in Haunted Mansion.

2711
01:31:11,448 --> 01:31:12,028
Haunted Mansion.

2712
01:31:12,288 --> 01:31:12,608
Hitchhiking.

2713
01:31:12,608 --> 01:31:13,188
Oh yeah, sorry.

2714
01:31:13,408 --> 01:31:14,888
I think it's nerds that listen to this show.

2715
01:31:15,068 --> 01:31:15,188
They know.

2716
01:31:15,188 --> 01:31:16,288
What if it's the first time?

2717
01:31:16,288 --> 01:31:16,668
Fair enough.

2718
01:31:16,908 --> 01:31:18,168
Did know about, I forgot about that,

2719
01:31:18,168 --> 01:31:19,548
but I had seen that picture.

2720
01:31:19,548 --> 01:31:20,708
I'll hit some highlights here.

2721
01:31:20,888 --> 01:31:23,228
Country Bears Vacation Jamboree.

2722
01:31:23,488 --> 01:31:24,288
Holy shit.

2723
01:31:24,828 --> 01:31:25,588
So fucking funny.

2724
01:31:25,668 --> 01:31:27,468
I understand that it's the same show,

2725
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:28,648
just some of it's in Japanese,

2726
01:31:28,728 --> 01:31:30,208
as they used to do in Disneyland.

2727
01:31:30,388 --> 01:31:31,368
They used to do the shows,

2728
01:31:31,448 --> 01:31:33,068
three different shows in Disneyland,

2729
01:31:33,508 --> 01:31:34,828
which they don't do in Florida.

2730
01:31:35,368 --> 01:31:37,368
But it's the Vacation Jamboree.

2731
01:31:37,428 --> 01:31:39,188
They sing like Garth Brooks,

2732
01:31:39,688 --> 01:31:41,548
and they sing like On the Road Again,

2733
01:31:41,888 --> 01:31:43,508
and they're all in little fun outfits,

2734
01:31:44,568 --> 01:31:46,668
and like scuba gear, and bathing suits.

2735
01:31:47,048 --> 01:31:48,248
And it is, we saw it twice.

2736
01:31:48,288 --> 01:31:49,188
We should have seen it more.

2737
01:31:49,208 --> 01:31:50,208
If we did the five days,

2738
01:31:50,208 --> 01:31:51,468
we would have seen it two more times.

2739
01:31:51,488 --> 01:31:52,628
I think the highlight for me is,

2740
01:31:52,728 --> 01:31:55,168
I wish they all could be California Bears,

2741
01:31:55,668 --> 01:31:56,948
instead of girls.

2742
01:31:57,468 --> 01:31:58,208
It was great.

2743
01:31:58,208 --> 01:32:00,948
The Sunbonnet Trio is singing California Bears.

2744
01:32:01,928 --> 01:32:03,068
So good.

2745
01:32:03,428 --> 01:32:05,688
Oh, although there's the song with,

2746
01:32:05,868 --> 01:32:07,368
and I don't remember all the bears names,

2747
01:32:07,428 --> 01:32:08,848
cause you haven't quizzed me as often.

2748
01:32:09,668 --> 01:32:14,088
But he's like having an affair with like a squid.

2749
01:32:15,008 --> 01:32:15,588
Oh, I've seen that.

2750
01:32:15,588 --> 01:32:18,948
He had a summer fling with like a squid, I think.

2751
01:32:19,108 --> 01:32:21,228
Yeah, that is sort of what the idea is,

2752
01:32:21,288 --> 01:32:23,068
is that this bear is having a romance with a squid.

2753
01:32:23,088 --> 01:32:23,968
Which bear was that?

2754
01:32:23,988 --> 01:32:24,748
It's not Henry.

2755
01:32:25,528 --> 01:32:26,148
It's a-

2756
01:32:26,148 --> 01:32:26,428
Is it Wendell?

2757
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:27,748
I think it's Wendell.

2758
01:32:28,068 --> 01:32:28,288
It's the second one.

2759
01:32:28,748 --> 01:32:29,368
The second-

2760
01:32:29,368 --> 01:32:30,748
Pretty sure Jason's right, it's Wendell.

2761
01:32:31,348 --> 01:32:32,688
Box over from the end.

2762
01:32:33,868 --> 01:32:34,968
Whoever usually is there.

2763
01:32:34,988 --> 01:32:36,608
Wendell is the one you thought you were.

2764
01:32:37,148 --> 01:32:37,388
Yeah.

2765
01:32:37,608 --> 01:32:37,928
Really?

2766
01:32:38,608 --> 01:32:40,308
I don't see you as a that bear.

2767
01:32:40,308 --> 01:32:41,128
I'm liver lips?

2768
01:32:42,768 --> 01:32:43,768
No.

2769
01:32:44,248 --> 01:32:44,508
Okay.

2770
01:32:44,508 --> 01:32:45,328
All right, let's keep moving.

2771
01:32:45,808 --> 01:32:46,788
It's not Wendell.

2772
01:32:46,848 --> 01:32:47,508
I'll look it up.

2773
01:32:47,668 --> 01:32:48,048
I'll look it up.

2774
01:32:48,788 --> 01:32:50,668
So, well, I guess tell me highlights.

2775
01:32:50,748 --> 01:32:52,628
Let's go park by park.

2776
01:32:52,708 --> 01:32:54,268
So let's start with Tokyo Disneyland,

2777
01:32:54,528 --> 01:32:56,048
cause I know DisneySea is something.

2778
01:32:56,048 --> 01:32:57,688
So we get to Tokyo Disneyland

2779
01:32:57,688 --> 01:32:59,388
and their main street has like kind of a roof

2780
01:32:59,388 --> 01:33:00,328
over the top of it.

2781
01:33:00,448 --> 01:33:02,368
And it's interesting and different.

2782
01:33:02,628 --> 01:33:05,428
And as we're walking down main street,

2783
01:33:05,948 --> 01:33:10,488
all of a sudden streamers shoot out of this big-

2784
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:13,168
Pop out of this kind of place setting thing

2785
01:33:13,168 --> 01:33:14,808
in the center of main street.

2786
01:33:15,888 --> 01:33:20,248
And children and adults run towards the streamers.

2787
01:33:21,188 --> 01:33:22,568
Towards this big center piece.

2788
01:33:22,828 --> 01:33:24,848
And the theme of Tokyo Disneyland starts,

2789
01:33:25,088 --> 01:33:26,228
like the 35th anniversary.

2790
01:33:26,668 --> 01:33:27,268
Dun, dun, dun.

2791
01:33:27,348 --> 01:33:28,648
Like that big over-

2792
01:33:28,648 --> 01:33:30,148
I love that song.

2793
01:33:30,148 --> 01:33:31,928
Like overarching song theme that they play a lot now

2794
01:33:31,928 --> 01:33:34,468
cause of this 35th anniversary starts playing.

2795
01:33:34,828 --> 01:33:37,148
And it truly felt like we walked into magic.

2796
01:33:37,348 --> 01:33:40,068
Like it really felt as we walked into some amazing place.

2797
01:33:40,288 --> 01:33:41,208
Do you have that song up?

2798
01:33:41,328 --> 01:33:42,368
You should play a bit of that song.

2799
01:33:42,388 --> 01:33:45,388
This is your world, come play inside.

2800
01:33:45,828 --> 01:33:48,888
This is the story that we'll write.

2801
01:33:49,488 --> 01:33:52,368
These are your friends, they light the way.

2802
01:33:52,668 --> 01:33:55,348
A different adventure, brand new day.

2803
01:33:55,628 --> 01:33:58,288
They call that entrance to the park World Bazaar.

2804
01:33:58,368 --> 01:33:59,228
It's not a main street.

2805
01:33:59,508 --> 01:34:00,648
Oh yes, yeah, World Bazaar.

2806
01:34:00,948 --> 01:34:02,488
And it's covered too.

2807
01:34:02,488 --> 01:34:04,548
Yeah, it's a big awning.

2808
01:34:04,668 --> 01:34:07,268
Yeah, a big iron awning.

2809
01:34:07,788 --> 01:34:09,168
So yeah, so that was immediately,

2810
01:34:09,188 --> 01:34:13,028
that was such a cool way to enter.

2811
01:34:14,508 --> 01:34:15,568
I'm trying to think others.

2812
01:34:15,648 --> 01:34:17,068
Do you have questions or do you want me to-

2813
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:18,948
Well, I think it, I mean-

2814
01:34:18,948 --> 01:34:19,668
You got the man-

2815
01:34:19,668 --> 01:34:22,568
I'm realizing how funny it is now that Scott is like,

2816
01:34:22,608 --> 01:34:25,988
I can't believe we haven't gotten to Tokyo Disney stuff yet,

2817
01:34:26,008 --> 01:34:28,008
but like he doesn't want to hear any of this.

2818
01:34:28,188 --> 01:34:28,708
I know.

2819
01:34:28,708 --> 01:34:29,888
Drew. It's okay.

2820
01:34:30,968 --> 01:34:33,148
Interesting to me, I mean, you didn't write it,

2821
01:34:33,148 --> 01:34:36,588
but the train in Tokyo Disneyland only goes through-

2822
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:37,848
Right, because it can't be a full loop.

2823
01:34:38,068 --> 01:34:40,328
It can't be a full loop, another transit,

2824
01:34:41,168 --> 01:34:43,748
Japanese transit thing, the way I understand it.

2825
01:34:43,748 --> 01:34:44,308
Yes, yeah, it's weird.

2826
01:34:44,308 --> 01:34:45,808
If it's a full loop, then it's legit transit.

2827
01:34:45,808 --> 01:34:47,068
If it's a full loop, I think it would have to charge.

2828
01:34:47,068 --> 01:34:48,468
Right, they would have had to pay, yeah.

2829
01:34:48,688 --> 01:34:49,148
Yeah, it's weird.

2830
01:34:50,088 --> 01:34:52,428
So it hits up Adventureland, Westernland,

2831
01:34:52,548 --> 01:34:53,988
which they call frontier land,

2832
01:34:54,468 --> 01:34:55,808
and a little bit of crater country.

2833
01:34:55,948 --> 01:34:57,568
I'm just gonna go off stuff that I noticed

2834
01:34:57,568 --> 01:34:59,008
that I find interesting or cool.

2835
01:34:59,468 --> 01:35:00,988
I find it interesting that certain rides

2836
01:35:00,988 --> 01:35:01,888
are the Disneyland version,

2837
01:35:01,988 --> 01:35:03,488
certain rides are the Disney World version.

2838
01:35:04,568 --> 01:35:06,388
So Pirates is the Disneyland version,

2839
01:35:06,388 --> 01:35:08,008
but it's like a minute cut.

2840
01:35:08,488 --> 01:35:10,788
So it's actually kind of, I don't know, kind of cool.

2841
01:35:11,228 --> 01:35:13,088
Yeah, I didn't have a problem with that minute.

2842
01:35:13,248 --> 01:35:14,308
You zoom a little through it,

2843
01:35:14,308 --> 01:35:15,868
there's a blue by which I didn't realize.

2844
01:35:16,048 --> 01:35:19,788
So like it's the same sort of intro vibe, which is cool,

2845
01:35:19,788 --> 01:35:20,908
and then you do the drops,

2846
01:35:21,268 --> 01:35:22,568
and I was like, oh, that's cool.

2847
01:35:23,628 --> 01:35:25,588
Disneyland version of Space Mountain.

2848
01:35:26,008 --> 01:35:27,048
Great, the best.

2849
01:35:27,048 --> 01:35:28,268
And that's the best one too.

2850
01:35:28,848 --> 01:35:30,688
I hate that Florida Space Mountain.

2851
01:35:31,008 --> 01:35:32,288
I refuse to go on right now.

2852
01:35:32,748 --> 01:35:33,708
I'll go on it anytime.

2853
01:35:33,708 --> 01:35:34,448
It hurts my back.

2854
01:35:35,448 --> 01:35:37,548
But Haunted Mansion, Florida version.

2855
01:35:37,928 --> 01:35:38,488
Interesting.

2856
01:35:38,588 --> 01:35:42,608
But we went on with the Nightmare Before Christmas overlay.

2857
01:35:43,128 --> 01:35:43,728
Oh.

2858
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:45,028
They do that there.

2859
01:35:45,128 --> 01:35:46,768
Because they'd already started Halloween stuff.

2860
01:35:46,828 --> 01:35:48,968
So it was interesting seeing, and there were more,

2861
01:35:49,028 --> 01:35:51,308
there was like an extra couple Sally animatronics,

2862
01:35:51,788 --> 01:35:52,548
or at least one.

2863
01:35:52,788 --> 01:35:55,348
Which we were both like, as there should be.

2864
01:35:55,468 --> 01:35:57,908
Yeah, Sally is hardly in.

2865
01:35:57,908 --> 01:36:04,328
She's a huge part of the plot of Nightmare Before Christmas.

2866
01:36:04,568 --> 01:36:07,388
They added like a static one to the graveyard out here.

2867
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:08,648
But there's like a moving Sally,

2868
01:36:08,748 --> 01:36:10,308
big Sally at the start of this one.

2869
01:36:10,408 --> 01:36:13,048
So it was interesting seeing the Nightmare Before Christmas

2870
01:36:13,048 --> 01:36:14,528
overlay on the Florida version,

2871
01:36:14,648 --> 01:36:15,768
because you never see that.

2872
01:36:15,888 --> 01:36:17,128
That's a nerdy thing to say,

2873
01:36:17,228 --> 01:36:18,868
but that's what I found that interesting.

2874
01:36:18,888 --> 01:36:19,728
That is very interesting.

2875
01:36:20,308 --> 01:36:22,428
But it's very similar to the one in Disneyland.

2876
01:36:22,428 --> 01:36:23,488
Looking at the map,

2877
01:36:23,488 --> 01:36:27,468
I'm amazed how much of Toontown they replicated.

2878
01:36:27,488 --> 01:36:30,848
Yeah, and we barely spent any time there.

2879
01:36:31,148 --> 01:36:32,248
We walked around a bit.

2880
01:36:32,248 --> 01:36:33,168
Yeah, we did a quick walk through.

2881
01:36:33,168 --> 01:36:33,908
But yes, a lot of it's similar.

2882
01:36:33,908 --> 01:36:35,668
Toontown is never our priority though.

2883
01:36:35,668 --> 01:36:36,028
Sure.

2884
01:36:36,368 --> 01:36:37,008
Right, yeah.

2885
01:36:37,868 --> 01:36:39,448
So a lot of Toontown.

2886
01:36:40,528 --> 01:36:41,568
One of the highlights.

2887
01:36:41,928 --> 01:36:42,628
Oh, that restaurant next to,

2888
01:36:42,648 --> 01:36:43,428
was that what you were gonna say?

2889
01:36:43,508 --> 01:36:45,548
We barely talked about food at all.

2890
01:36:45,548 --> 01:36:46,788
Yeah, for one thing,

2891
01:36:46,968 --> 01:36:51,408
the quality of all food in Japan is so much better.

2892
01:36:51,608 --> 01:36:56,408
And I don't know if it's because it's more farm to table,

2893
01:36:56,448 --> 01:36:58,708
because there's just not as much ground to cover.

2894
01:36:59,248 --> 01:37:02,348
They probably have stricter standards

2895
01:37:02,348 --> 01:37:03,768
about preservatives.

2896
01:37:04,348 --> 01:37:06,728
And I don't know, but everything was better.

2897
01:37:07,248 --> 01:37:10,128
And I have a big problem with seafood.

2898
01:37:10,248 --> 01:37:11,128
I don't like it.

2899
01:37:11,128 --> 01:37:13,968
I'm a big baby about trying new things.

2900
01:37:14,628 --> 01:37:17,968
And still, but everything I would eat was so much better.

2901
01:37:18,568 --> 01:37:21,168
Yeah, and this is just tangential.

2902
01:37:21,248 --> 01:37:22,728
Now we're talking food.

2903
01:37:23,188 --> 01:37:24,948
All the packaging at Tokyo Disney,

2904
01:37:25,728 --> 01:37:29,148
specific restaurant packaging for the food.

2905
01:37:29,368 --> 01:37:31,948
So we went in the Camp Woodchuck area

2906
01:37:31,948 --> 01:37:33,128
to eat in Disneyland.

2907
01:37:34,088 --> 01:37:35,848
And whatever, the burger as a wrapper,

2908
01:37:35,928 --> 01:37:37,328
and it's got the Junior Woodchucks,

2909
01:37:37,488 --> 01:37:39,248
Huey, Doomy, and Louie, and it's cute little art.

2910
01:37:39,268 --> 01:37:39,728
Wonderful.

2911
01:37:40,188 --> 01:37:42,968
And Duffy area in Tokyo Disney Sea is Duffy specific.

2912
01:37:43,088 --> 01:37:44,288
And the trays, right?

2913
01:37:44,548 --> 01:37:46,348
The trays too, yeah.

2914
01:37:46,628 --> 01:37:46,928
So stuff like detail.

2915
01:37:46,928 --> 01:37:49,888
Yeah, it wasn't all 35th anniversary stuff.

2916
01:37:49,988 --> 01:37:52,888
It'll be like blanket here in the States.

2917
01:37:52,988 --> 01:37:53,888
Now here's a knock.

2918
01:37:54,388 --> 01:37:57,168
All of the drink sizes are smaller.

2919
01:37:57,688 --> 01:37:58,608
Which I fully support.

2920
01:37:58,648 --> 01:37:59,628
Which you were totally fine.

2921
01:37:59,768 --> 01:38:03,668
But I was like a true disgusting American

2922
01:38:03,668 --> 01:38:04,928
Wanted your big old soda drinks.

2923
01:38:04,948 --> 01:38:07,388
Griping about the fact that I couldn't get

2924
01:38:07,388 --> 01:38:09,928
a big large iced tea or a big large soda.

2925
01:38:10,688 --> 01:38:12,048
And it was everywhere in Japan.

2926
01:38:12,348 --> 01:38:13,008
Like a large was not.

2927
01:38:13,008 --> 01:38:14,788
Because you want that caffeine kick.

2928
01:38:15,248 --> 01:38:18,048
No, Michael is not a caffeine person at all.

2929
01:38:18,268 --> 01:38:19,008
I like idols true.

2930
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:21,428
He just likes a big drink and he likes to chew the ice.

2931
01:38:21,608 --> 01:38:24,628
I like to chew the ice and I like business.

2932
01:38:25,108 --> 01:38:26,708
I like keeping myself occupied.

2933
01:38:26,868 --> 01:38:27,768
Instead of smoking.

2934
01:38:28,208 --> 01:38:28,688
Yes it is.

2935
01:38:28,688 --> 01:38:29,488
You have a big drink.

2936
01:38:29,708 --> 01:38:31,268
Absolutely, it's the same thing.

2937
01:38:31,288 --> 01:38:31,968
You're right.

2938
01:38:32,208 --> 01:38:33,168
I like having a big drink.

2939
01:38:33,288 --> 01:38:34,708
I like it just to do something.

2940
01:38:34,908 --> 01:38:36,288
Especially if you're anxious or nervous.

2941
01:38:36,648 --> 01:38:38,448
Having a lot of it means it lasts longer.

2942
01:38:38,748 --> 01:38:41,188
And then having more of it means there's more ice to chew.

2943
01:38:41,468 --> 01:38:42,808
Yeah, whereas I'm just constantly

2944
01:38:42,808 --> 01:38:44,168
chewing the skin off my lips.

2945
01:38:44,548 --> 01:38:45,088
For sure.

2946
01:38:45,708 --> 01:38:46,488
Oh yeah, I do that.

2947
01:38:46,648 --> 01:38:47,168
That's what I do.

2948
01:38:47,308 --> 01:38:48,488
So yeah, we could not get.

2949
01:38:48,488 --> 01:38:51,668
So basically a medium was a large there as far as a drink.

2950
01:38:51,788 --> 01:38:53,508
So that's one of the only things I was complaining about.

2951
01:38:53,508 --> 01:38:55,588
But I was like damn right, they should be smaller.

2952
01:38:55,688 --> 01:38:56,548
Well sure, of course.

2953
01:38:56,668 --> 01:38:57,248
Too much sugar.

2954
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:59,548
I could have gotten used to it with a few more weeks.

2955
01:38:59,788 --> 01:39:04,188
Did you have any of the sugary kind of boba drinks there?

2956
01:39:04,268 --> 01:39:05,108
Or the popcorn?

2957
01:39:05,368 --> 01:39:07,988
I know there's popcorn keys on the map.

2958
01:39:08,688 --> 01:39:12,788
I was not blown away by the strength of the flavors.

2959
01:39:12,928 --> 01:39:16,588
Because I got a chocolate popcorn.

2960
01:39:17,448 --> 01:39:20,208
And it smelled so good.

2961
01:39:20,428 --> 01:39:23,988
It smelled like buttery chocolate through the air.

2962
01:39:24,188 --> 01:39:26,388
Pulled me to the little cart.

2963
01:39:26,728 --> 01:39:29,608
And then I got it and it barely tasted like anything.

2964
01:39:29,848 --> 01:39:30,968
It was a real shame.

2965
01:39:31,748 --> 01:39:32,748
Yeah, I had some of it.

2966
01:39:32,748 --> 01:39:33,728
It was not bad though.

2967
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:36,028
It was just I think the smell probably built it up.

2968
01:39:36,268 --> 01:39:39,168
Yes, very high expectations because of that smell

2969
01:39:39,168 --> 01:39:40,108
wafting through the air.

2970
01:39:40,108 --> 01:39:43,408
I found a picture of the purple drink from the.

2971
01:39:43,408 --> 01:39:44,408
I don't think I took one.

2972
01:39:44,408 --> 01:39:44,728
Roosevelt.

2973
01:39:44,748 --> 01:39:45,448
I think you took it.

2974
01:39:45,448 --> 01:39:47,648
Look, it was so delicious.

2975
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:49,688
That is like made for you.

2976
01:39:49,808 --> 01:39:50,548
Well, Lindsay got it.

2977
01:39:50,548 --> 01:39:51,248
It was in the wine.

2978
01:39:51,248 --> 01:39:54,888
I got it twice because I think.

2979
01:39:55,228 --> 01:39:55,768
No, maybe I took it.

2980
01:39:55,768 --> 01:40:00,588
I had a nice little scoop of ice cream and a little cone.

2981
01:40:01,288 --> 01:40:02,728
Perfectly cylindrical.

2982
01:40:02,868 --> 01:40:06,988
Everything is perfect in a creepy way.

2983
01:40:06,988 --> 01:40:09,348
It's in my Google history, violet fizz.

2984
01:40:09,668 --> 01:40:11,048
Oh, violet fizz, there you go.

2985
01:40:11,328 --> 01:40:12,148
It was so good.

2986
01:40:13,428 --> 01:40:15,688
Everything there, food shape wise,

2987
01:40:16,008 --> 01:40:18,608
I almost found it to a creepy degree is perfect.

2988
01:40:19,728 --> 01:40:21,408
Like ice cream, but even like we got.

2989
01:40:21,608 --> 01:40:23,468
First of all, they have a lot of curry there, which is cool.

2990
01:40:23,628 --> 01:40:25,548
We ate curry in Agrabah in Tokyo Disney Sea.

2991
01:40:25,668 --> 01:40:27,188
We ate curry in Frontierland.

2992
01:40:27,228 --> 01:40:28,968
That was always my favorite meal.

2993
01:40:29,188 --> 01:40:30,188
And like the curry was good,

2994
01:40:30,208 --> 01:40:31,648
but like everything looks perfect.

2995
01:40:31,708 --> 01:40:34,688
Like it's like there's a uniform look to the meal itself

2996
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:37,308
and it must look exactly the same.

2997
01:40:38,108 --> 01:40:39,808
So they like even like everything is just.

2998
01:40:39,848 --> 01:40:41,588
I'm into that like curry and rice.

2999
01:40:41,868 --> 01:40:44,088
I wish that was a staple in America.

3000
01:40:44,128 --> 01:40:45,208
Oh my gosh, so great.

3001
01:40:45,568 --> 01:40:48,128
Yeah, we were eating watching the parade in Frontierland.

3002
01:40:48,228 --> 01:40:51,868
Yeah, so there was just better food in the park.

3003
01:40:52,208 --> 01:40:54,828
Did you get the buns or the mochi

3004
01:40:54,828 --> 01:40:57,668
that looks like the little green aliens from Toy Story?

3005
01:40:57,668 --> 01:40:58,048
No.

3006
01:40:58,308 --> 01:40:59,768
That's adorable and no.

3007
01:40:59,788 --> 01:41:01,948
I got a Gudetama mochi though.

3008
01:41:01,968 --> 01:41:02,648
Oh, wonderful.

3009
01:41:02,648 --> 01:41:03,868
And it was pretty good.

3010
01:41:04,448 --> 01:41:06,468
So the restaurant Lindsay was referring to

3011
01:41:06,468 --> 01:41:08,688
is a big highlight of the first day we were there.

3012
01:41:08,948 --> 01:41:14,368
Next to Splash Mountain is Grandma Sarah's Kitchen.

3013
01:41:14,408 --> 01:41:15,368
Oh yeah.

3014
01:41:15,868 --> 01:41:16,748
And that's.

3015
01:41:17,048 --> 01:41:18,088
It was so good.

3016
01:41:18,308 --> 01:41:19,928
I mean the restaurant, the food was good,

3017
01:41:20,008 --> 01:41:21,348
but the restaurant was good.

3018
01:41:21,388 --> 01:41:23,548
And it's like Grandma Sarah, which is like, what is she?

3019
01:41:23,628 --> 01:41:24,488
She's the possum?

3020
01:41:24,528 --> 01:41:27,128
She's an old possum that's like an animatronic

3021
01:41:27,128 --> 01:41:27,968
on Splash Mountain.

3022
01:41:28,748 --> 01:41:32,008
And it's a fully themed Splash Mountain restaurant.

3023
01:41:32,088 --> 01:41:33,408
I did not know it existed.

3024
01:41:33,988 --> 01:41:34,988
We were running around in there.

3025
01:41:35,148 --> 01:41:38,128
It's two floors and it's fully,

3026
01:41:38,128 --> 01:41:39,368
it looks like Splash Mountain.

3027
01:41:39,528 --> 01:41:41,028
The walls look like Splash Mountain

3028
01:41:41,028 --> 01:41:43,868
and it looks like Grandma Sarah lives there.

3029
01:41:44,448 --> 01:41:47,508
And her husband, her old husband who's a farmer

3030
01:41:47,508 --> 01:41:50,128
is on the wall here on the bathroom.

3031
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:51,968
That's good because she's just standing

3032
01:41:51,968 --> 01:41:53,908
with little possums in the ride.

3033
01:41:54,128 --> 01:41:56,128
And I was always concerned she was a widow.

3034
01:41:56,848 --> 01:41:57,348
No, no.

3035
01:41:57,448 --> 01:41:59,268
Here's me and her husband.

3036
01:41:59,768 --> 01:42:00,948
Question finally answered.

3037
01:42:01,408 --> 01:42:02,328
Oh, he's a working man.

3038
01:42:02,348 --> 01:42:03,328
They've got a little statue there.

3039
01:42:03,548 --> 01:42:03,988
He's sleeping.

3040
01:42:04,708 --> 01:42:06,148
Oh, not working too hard.

3041
01:42:06,228 --> 01:42:07,008
Not too hard.

3042
01:42:07,048 --> 01:42:08,688
But we were running around there like,

3043
01:42:08,888 --> 01:42:10,168
oh my God, this is the greatest.

3044
01:42:10,168 --> 01:42:11,608
There's so many levels and details.

3045
01:42:12,148 --> 01:42:13,788
Yes, and it's just fantastic.

3046
01:42:14,108 --> 01:42:16,208
Also just like a slight side note,

3047
01:42:16,208 --> 01:42:17,668
I think on the culture at large,

3048
01:42:18,048 --> 01:42:20,208
but everything was so much quieter

3049
01:42:20,208 --> 01:42:21,968
in the food service area

3050
01:42:21,968 --> 01:42:25,108
because people weren't tossing things around

3051
01:42:25,108 --> 01:42:27,088
and doing things as quickly as possible.

3052
01:42:27,188 --> 01:42:28,968
Everything is just done with so much more care.

3053
01:42:29,128 --> 01:42:30,208
So it's like a plate,

3054
01:42:30,268 --> 01:42:32,808
everything is lifted and moved with two hands

3055
01:42:32,808 --> 01:42:35,028
and set on the plate and then carefully lifted

3056
01:42:35,028 --> 01:42:35,968
and handed over.

3057
01:42:36,508 --> 01:42:38,748
Everything is done with two hands.

3058
01:42:38,748 --> 01:42:41,088
You hand over your card, they take it with two hands.

3059
01:42:41,308 --> 01:42:43,548
They hand back your receipt and the card with two hands.

3060
01:42:43,648 --> 01:42:45,968
Everything is just so deliberately done.

3061
01:42:46,808 --> 01:42:47,448
I miss it.

3062
01:42:47,548 --> 01:42:49,588
I'm sure we did,

3063
01:42:49,748 --> 01:42:52,108
we handed people things and it was offensive.

3064
01:42:52,448 --> 01:42:53,688
Yeah, and they have little trays

3065
01:42:53,688 --> 01:42:56,168
and I think that's where you're supposed to set your card.

3066
01:42:56,368 --> 01:42:58,148
Like you're not supposed to hand it off or something.

3067
01:42:58,148 --> 01:42:59,328
I'm sure I just was like.

3068
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:00,428
I think I did it every time.

3069
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:02,228
Like Randy Quaid from Vacation.

3070
01:43:02,828 --> 01:43:04,088
Did you find,

3071
01:43:04,088 --> 01:43:07,388
it doesn't sound like you experienced much culture shock

3072
01:43:07,388 --> 01:43:08,608
or friction or anything.

3073
01:43:08,608 --> 01:43:09,568
No, I was very,

3074
01:43:09,688 --> 01:43:12,068
I really expected a culture shock.

3075
01:43:12,188 --> 01:43:14,088
There was one restaurant we went,

3076
01:43:14,308 --> 01:43:14,908
but when not in,

3077
01:43:15,028 --> 01:43:16,248
first of all, if you're in Disney,

3078
01:43:16,548 --> 01:43:19,168
everything is idiot English person food.

3079
01:43:19,168 --> 01:43:21,188
All these maps are English.

3080
01:43:21,348 --> 01:43:24,528
Yeah, so like one restaurant we went to,

3081
01:43:24,848 --> 01:43:26,148
we thought there was no English

3082
01:43:26,148 --> 01:43:28,268
and we just had to point to a picture on the menu

3083
01:43:28,268 --> 01:43:29,388
because no one spoke English.

3084
01:43:29,528 --> 01:43:31,368
Then we realized there was an English part of the menu

3085
01:43:31,368 --> 01:43:32,848
that we hadn't seen until we ordered.

3086
01:43:32,948 --> 01:43:34,988
But that was literally the only restaurant.

3087
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:36,648
I can't even remember which.

3088
01:43:36,748 --> 01:43:38,948
This was the one where we were walking down

3089
01:43:38,948 --> 01:43:40,308
the like kind of narrow area,

3090
01:43:40,328 --> 01:43:44,908
excuse me, area ways or pathways, alleyways,

3091
01:43:45,008 --> 01:43:45,508
really what I was looking to say.

3092
01:43:45,508 --> 01:43:46,228
Yeah, there we go.

3093
01:43:46,568 --> 01:43:47,368
And I'm an idiot.

3094
01:43:48,488 --> 01:43:50,348
And we went into that place with the ramen

3095
01:43:50,348 --> 01:43:51,488
with the tomato soup.

3096
01:43:52,168 --> 01:43:53,408
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3097
01:43:53,408 --> 01:43:54,808
We couldn't figure out how to order

3098
01:43:54,808 --> 01:43:56,068
because there was no English.

3099
01:43:56,388 --> 01:43:56,808
It felt so dumb.

3100
01:43:56,828 --> 01:43:58,808
And then we were just like pointed at one thing

3101
01:43:58,808 --> 01:43:59,568
that had a picture.

3102
01:43:59,648 --> 01:44:01,548
But it was like the thing everyone was getting anyway.

3103
01:44:01,548 --> 01:44:02,648
Right, not a big deal.

3104
01:44:02,648 --> 01:44:03,728
But then we realized there was English

3105
01:44:03,728 --> 01:44:04,868
on another part of the menu.

3106
01:44:05,088 --> 01:44:06,748
So most, even the smaller places,

3107
01:44:06,828 --> 01:44:08,608
obviously I think if you go outside of the city,

3108
01:44:08,888 --> 01:44:09,948
it's probably a little harder.

3109
01:44:10,048 --> 01:44:13,108
But like everything is so geared to America.

3110
01:44:13,808 --> 01:44:16,208
And so many people at least speak a little English.

3111
01:44:16,268 --> 01:44:19,288
Did you have any allergy issues?

3112
01:44:19,588 --> 01:44:20,048
I know you.

3113
01:44:20,368 --> 01:44:23,928
I did avoid the baked goods

3114
01:44:23,928 --> 01:44:26,068
because I am allergic to treat nuts.

3115
01:44:26,108 --> 01:44:29,748
So yeah, I just didn't wanna deal with it

3116
01:44:29,748 --> 01:44:32,628
on top of all the other things I was dealing with.

3117
01:44:33,528 --> 01:44:35,808
Yeah, I feel like there's no way

3118
01:44:35,808 --> 01:44:37,908
we actually can get into everything here.

3119
01:44:37,948 --> 01:44:38,988
But like we're just trying to go.

3120
01:44:38,988 --> 01:44:40,608
Yeah, so what, so Disney Sea.

3121
01:44:40,888 --> 01:44:41,868
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3122
01:44:41,908 --> 01:44:42,468
We're not there yet.

3123
01:44:42,728 --> 01:44:43,328
Pooh's Honey Hut.

3124
01:44:43,388 --> 01:44:45,168
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, it's so good.

3125
01:44:45,608 --> 01:44:47,428
That's what the word was always that Pooh,

3126
01:44:47,428 --> 01:44:49,988
the Pooh ride there was so much better than the one here.

3127
01:44:50,108 --> 01:44:51,188
Trackless ride system.

3128
01:44:51,548 --> 01:44:53,848
And boy is it better.

3129
01:44:54,908 --> 01:44:57,868
Far exceeded my expectations.

3130
01:44:58,408 --> 01:44:59,968
Yeah, not that I knew a lot going in,

3131
01:44:59,968 --> 01:45:06,148
but my expectations just of like Disney dark ride type thing

3132
01:45:06,148 --> 01:45:10,728
in general, just what I would expect to be in the park

3133
01:45:10,728 --> 01:45:12,728
that is like that same type of ride.

3134
01:45:12,948 --> 01:45:15,048
Yeah, it felt like a game changer-y kind of ride.

3135
01:45:15,048 --> 01:45:17,328
Not that it's like so big or long,

3136
01:45:17,468 --> 01:45:18,968
but it's just the system itself.

3137
01:45:19,208 --> 01:45:22,548
Because you're on a wifi and you're not on a track

3138
01:45:22,548 --> 01:45:25,068
and you basically come in in a row of three cars

3139
01:45:25,068 --> 01:45:27,248
and it feels like all the cars are connected

3140
01:45:27,248 --> 01:45:28,368
because the way they move.

3141
01:45:28,368 --> 01:45:31,088
So you load in and so it feels like any other ride where-

3142
01:45:31,088 --> 01:45:31,688
It's just gliding around.

3143
01:45:31,948 --> 01:45:34,128
It feels, yeah, but it feels like I think my initial thought

3144
01:45:34,128 --> 01:45:35,928
was like, oh, okay, you're in these three line,

3145
01:45:35,928 --> 01:45:39,348
like these cars and they just kind of move in this formation.

3146
01:45:40,128 --> 01:45:42,408
But as soon as you're out of the loading area,

3147
01:45:42,848 --> 01:45:45,928
all three cars split apart in a very exciting way.

3148
01:45:46,668 --> 01:45:49,208
So like immediately you go, whoa, what is this?

3149
01:45:49,228 --> 01:45:51,768
Yeah, so instead of like following in a usual line,

3150
01:45:51,928 --> 01:45:53,908
you split up and all of them turn

3151
01:45:53,908 --> 01:45:56,548
and are next to each other now facing the same screen.

3152
01:45:57,288 --> 01:45:57,528
Great.

3153
01:45:58,228 --> 01:45:59,288
There's like a cool screen.

3154
01:45:59,548 --> 01:46:00,928
Everything also, the line is so much,

3155
01:46:00,968 --> 01:46:03,368
there's no queue out here at all for the Poo ride.

3156
01:46:03,448 --> 01:46:04,168
It's just outdoors.

3157
01:46:04,608 --> 01:46:05,928
But also no one goes on it ever,

3158
01:46:05,928 --> 01:46:07,048
so it doesn't really need one.

3159
01:46:07,288 --> 01:46:09,068
Well, but that's because it's not as good.

3160
01:46:09,168 --> 01:46:09,568
No, I know.

3161
01:46:09,908 --> 01:46:11,988
I go on it a lot because there usually is not a line.

3162
01:46:12,168 --> 01:46:14,168
You go on the, but yeah, you go on,

3163
01:46:14,348 --> 01:46:15,908
like there's a cool storybook outside

3164
01:46:15,908 --> 01:46:17,488
where it looks like the people walking through the line

3165
01:46:17,488 --> 01:46:19,228
are in the story if you're looking outside.

3166
01:46:19,228 --> 01:46:20,308
Yeah, we're like inside the pages.

3167
01:46:20,448 --> 01:46:22,908
And then inside it's like Christopher Robin's room

3168
01:46:22,908 --> 01:46:26,048
and like you walk into the store, like the line is so cool.

3169
01:46:26,048 --> 01:46:28,368
And then the ride itself is just,

3170
01:46:28,968 --> 01:46:30,868
it feels so free. So fun.

3171
01:46:30,868 --> 01:46:32,868
It feels like there's different paths you can go on.

3172
01:46:32,868 --> 01:46:36,288
Yeah, you're just like whirling around and yeah, it does.

3173
01:46:36,368 --> 01:46:39,648
It feels just like so open and smooth and.

3174
01:46:40,068 --> 01:46:41,848
It does feel like you're living in it

3175
01:46:41,848 --> 01:46:43,748
more than a normal ride on a track

3176
01:46:43,748 --> 01:46:47,008
because it's like, it doesn't feel so linear.

3177
01:46:47,008 --> 01:46:49,488
Yeah, you're exploring all through it

3178
01:46:49,488 --> 01:46:54,748
instead of just moving at a steady pace through the room.

3179
01:46:54,748 --> 01:46:57,048
And then you're getting into the Heffalump and Woozle room.

3180
01:46:57,488 --> 01:46:58,688
And I guess this is the last thing I'll say

3181
01:46:58,688 --> 01:47:00,168
because we could talk about this forever

3182
01:47:00,168 --> 01:47:02,348
is that the Heffalump and Woozle room

3183
01:47:02,348 --> 01:47:05,068
is a big fun zooming in and out party

3184
01:47:05,068 --> 01:47:07,428
between like four or five cars

3185
01:47:07,428 --> 01:47:11,208
and then a car full of Heffalump and Woozles.

3186
01:47:11,208 --> 01:47:12,708
Full of the Heffalumps and Woozles.

3187
01:47:12,828 --> 01:47:13,168
Yes.

3188
01:47:13,308 --> 01:47:15,268
That is all of a sudden spinning around

3189
01:47:15,268 --> 01:47:16,968
with you and the other two cars.

3190
01:47:16,968 --> 01:47:17,728
In the same ride, Vicar.

3191
01:47:17,728 --> 01:47:19,668
As well it's on the ride too.

3192
01:47:19,968 --> 01:47:21,288
It pops in and out.

3193
01:47:21,568 --> 01:47:21,788
What?

3194
01:47:21,788 --> 01:47:22,788
Jason's making googly eyes.

3195
01:47:22,888 --> 01:47:23,548
Yes, I agree.

3196
01:47:23,548 --> 01:47:24,948
We went, oh look, there's a car

3197
01:47:24,948 --> 01:47:26,588
of just the Heffalumps and Woozles.

3198
01:47:26,588 --> 01:47:27,348
That's so great.

3199
01:47:27,368 --> 01:47:29,548
Yeah, as if they were riding with us.

3200
01:47:30,008 --> 01:47:33,148
Yeah, so like that one really, we did it twice

3201
01:47:33,148 --> 01:47:34,548
and that one blew us away.

3202
01:47:34,608 --> 01:47:36,808
Yeah, that was one where there was just like,

3203
01:47:36,848 --> 01:47:38,848
my eyes lit up and there was a smile

3204
01:47:38,848 --> 01:47:40,448
on my face the whole time.

3205
01:47:40,628 --> 01:47:41,848
That one was really awesome.

3206
01:47:42,408 --> 01:47:43,688
All the rides they take better,

3207
01:47:43,788 --> 01:47:44,948
like we went in Peter Pan

3208
01:47:44,948 --> 01:47:47,988
and I had been in Peter Pan six months ago or something.

3209
01:47:48,308 --> 01:47:50,168
And the track feels like there's a part in the track

3210
01:47:50,168 --> 01:47:52,008
when you come down and like.

3211
01:47:52,008 --> 01:47:52,768
It's a little jerky.

3212
01:47:52,768 --> 01:47:54,168
It's jerky and you go, oh, and I go,

3213
01:47:54,168 --> 01:47:55,468
hopefully this is not gonna fall apart.

3214
01:47:55,688 --> 01:47:56,548
Not any of that.

3215
01:47:56,608 --> 01:47:57,668
The track was perfect.

3216
01:47:58,168 --> 01:47:58,528
Yeah.

3217
01:47:58,808 --> 01:48:00,868
Yeah, everything is just really kept up.

3218
01:48:01,168 --> 01:48:05,208
So it feels newer, even though it's not that new.

3219
01:48:06,028 --> 01:48:06,908
I knew what Jason was saying.

3220
01:48:07,008 --> 01:48:09,148
Oh, I was gonna say, I showed you this earlier,

3221
01:48:09,148 --> 01:48:10,488
but on the map I have,

3222
01:48:10,788 --> 01:48:12,928
the Monsters Inc Ride and Go Seek ride,

3223
01:48:13,308 --> 01:48:16,148
the description delighted me and it just says,

3224
01:48:16,808 --> 01:48:19,188
board a train and search for the funny monsters.

3225
01:48:19,848 --> 01:48:21,168
That's it, wonderful.

3226
01:48:21,208 --> 01:48:21,428
Funny monsters.

3227
01:48:21,668 --> 01:48:22,088
Yes, it's fair.

3228
01:48:22,088 --> 01:48:23,908
This ride was a little underwhelming.

3229
01:48:24,368 --> 01:48:26,308
Yeah, I heard people talked it up,

3230
01:48:26,448 --> 01:48:28,988
but then, and the animatronics are all very good,

3231
01:48:28,988 --> 01:48:30,888
but it's a ride where you have like flashlights.

3232
01:48:30,928 --> 01:48:32,688
It's like a Buzz Lightyear style thing.

3233
01:48:33,168 --> 01:48:35,528
But there's no points, you don't score points,

3234
01:48:35,728 --> 01:48:37,808
but you shine the flashlight

3235
01:48:37,808 --> 01:48:39,548
and then like stuff happens kind of.

3236
01:48:39,708 --> 01:48:41,248
You're supposed to find the monsters

3237
01:48:41,248 --> 01:48:42,928
and when you shine the light on them,

3238
01:48:42,928 --> 01:48:45,368
they like pop up and reveal themselves.

3239
01:48:45,708 --> 01:48:48,128
But it was like not that satisfying when it happened.

3240
01:48:48,488 --> 01:48:49,808
Yeah, it was not satisfying.

3241
01:48:49,928 --> 01:48:51,328
And it was like in a similar way

3242
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:52,688
where I was criticizing Men in Black,

3243
01:48:52,768 --> 01:48:55,348
which is a much slower, I think more satisfying ride.

3244
01:48:55,928 --> 01:48:57,848
It felt like there wasn't even time

3245
01:48:57,848 --> 01:48:59,628
to enjoy the animatronics while you're trying

3246
01:48:59,628 --> 01:49:01,808
to figure out what to put your flashlight on.

3247
01:49:01,948 --> 01:49:04,288
That seems to me like some of the Harry Potter

3248
01:49:04,288 --> 01:49:06,508
like RFID wand effects,

3249
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:07,928
where it's like the effect is cool,

3250
01:49:07,928 --> 01:49:10,568
but you see kids like flicking their wrists

3251
01:49:10,568 --> 01:49:13,848
like five times to like try and get it to work.

3252
01:49:14,288 --> 01:49:15,488
Yeah, I mean a little bit of that.

3253
01:49:15,548 --> 01:49:16,248
I mean at least though,

3254
01:49:16,248 --> 01:49:18,248
that is just like one thing to focus on.

3255
01:49:18,348 --> 01:49:18,788
That's true.

3256
01:49:18,788 --> 01:49:19,748
This is just your two, like.

3257
01:49:19,748 --> 01:49:22,048
Yeah, it was too task oriented.

3258
01:49:22,608 --> 01:49:24,388
Yeah, and again, it's like too fast.

3259
01:49:24,468 --> 01:49:26,368
It was too fast to sort of enjoy it.

3260
01:49:26,368 --> 01:49:27,208
But it was not bad.

3261
01:49:27,228 --> 01:49:28,288
It was not a bad ride.

3262
01:49:29,388 --> 01:49:32,488
Space Mountain has the Spawn logo font for some reason.

3263
01:49:32,688 --> 01:49:33,648
I'll post a picture of that.

3264
01:49:33,848 --> 01:49:34,348
Wow. Oh yeah.

3265
01:49:34,468 --> 01:49:35,648
I don't know that it's exactly that,

3266
01:49:35,648 --> 01:49:36,808
but it looks like that to me.

3267
01:49:36,908 --> 01:49:38,568
It's a very 90s looking font.

3268
01:49:38,588 --> 01:49:39,988
That hits me right in the.

3269
01:49:39,988 --> 01:49:40,908
You got emotional.

3270
01:49:41,308 --> 01:49:42,468
Yeah, right in the heart.

3271
01:49:42,788 --> 01:49:44,668
It's in your eye when I said Spawn.

3272
01:49:45,188 --> 01:49:47,588
90s comic character Spawn.

3273
01:49:48,748 --> 01:49:52,168
Tokyo Disney itself, Disneyland itself is cool.

3274
01:49:52,448 --> 01:49:55,308
The shows we went to see, Party Grah, Let's Party Grah.

3275
01:49:55,608 --> 01:49:55,728
Oh.

3276
01:49:56,168 --> 01:49:57,048
We were never,

3277
01:49:57,468 --> 01:50:00,288
we never got there in time to get a good seat for anything.

3278
01:50:00,288 --> 01:50:02,088
We needed to get there at 8 a.m. every day.

3279
01:50:02,108 --> 01:50:03,188
But every show was very cool.

3280
01:50:03,888 --> 01:50:06,248
One of the weirdest things is that we,

3281
01:50:06,368 --> 01:50:07,668
Let's Party Grah.

3282
01:50:07,668 --> 01:50:08,288
Oh yeah.

3283
01:50:08,568 --> 01:50:10,728
Jose and Donald come out back

3284
01:50:10,728 --> 01:50:12,168
sort of toward the back of the theater

3285
01:50:12,168 --> 01:50:14,048
and they kind of clown around with people that are watching.

3286
01:50:14,148 --> 01:50:15,508
Cause we watch not inside the theater,

3287
01:50:15,508 --> 01:50:16,348
but outside the theater.

3288
01:50:16,348 --> 01:50:17,788
You can still see pretty well.

3289
01:50:18,248 --> 01:50:20,728
Jose and Donald walk around and they kind of clown around.

3290
01:50:20,888 --> 01:50:21,668
They say like, be quiet.

3291
01:50:21,828 --> 01:50:22,948
Don't show, don't tell the people

3292
01:50:22,948 --> 01:50:24,148
that are in the theater we're here.

3293
01:50:24,488 --> 01:50:27,308
And I have video and pictures of this to prove it.

3294
01:50:27,728 --> 01:50:30,008
Is that all of a sudden Donald,

3295
01:50:30,028 --> 01:50:31,108
I don't remember which order it went.

3296
01:50:31,328 --> 01:50:33,388
Donald starts patting Jose's back down

3297
01:50:33,388 --> 01:50:35,448
and then he starts just patting him on the butt.

3298
01:50:35,808 --> 01:50:37,008
Like fluffing up his little.

3299
01:50:37,008 --> 01:50:38,108
Fluffing up his tail on his butt.

3300
01:50:38,108 --> 01:50:39,108
Really he's got to go on.

3301
01:50:39,148 --> 01:50:40,108
He wants to make sure the butt looks good.

3302
01:50:40,108 --> 01:50:42,608
Yeah, and then Jose turns Donald around

3303
01:50:42,608 --> 01:50:44,288
and starts doing the same thing.

3304
01:50:44,568 --> 01:50:45,468
So I have pictures of.

3305
01:50:45,528 --> 01:50:46,868
Fluffing each other's butts.

3306
01:50:46,948 --> 01:50:48,388
So I have pictures of Jose and Donald

3307
01:50:48,388 --> 01:50:50,048
fluffing each other's butts,

3308
01:50:50,048 --> 01:50:52,988
which was very funny and weird.

3309
01:50:53,548 --> 01:50:54,528
Jungle Cruise very good.

3310
01:50:54,988 --> 01:50:56,368
I'll say this Jungle Cruise very good.

3311
01:50:56,368 --> 01:50:57,828
I like it better than the one out in Disneyland.

3312
01:50:57,988 --> 01:50:59,708
It's similar to the Florida one.

3313
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,128
Yeah, all right.

3314
01:51:01,128 --> 01:51:02,328
I guess we go to Disney now.

3315
01:51:02,528 --> 01:51:03,988
Cause I feel like we're racing against the clock.

3316
01:51:04,488 --> 01:51:06,848
I mean, where to, I mean, tell me what you,

3317
01:51:07,168 --> 01:51:08,788
Tower of Terror, Big Band Beat.

3318
01:51:09,328 --> 01:51:11,188
Oh, big, oh, oof, oof, oof.

3319
01:51:11,288 --> 01:51:11,788
Guys, I'm sorry.

3320
01:51:12,108 --> 01:51:13,868
I feel frantic right now.

3321
01:51:13,868 --> 01:51:15,368
You are talking fast.

3322
01:51:15,368 --> 01:51:16,128
Well, this is the problem.

3323
01:51:16,328 --> 01:51:18,328
Like Scott, again, Scott was like,

3324
01:51:18,368 --> 01:51:19,288
when are we going to get to it?

3325
01:51:19,288 --> 01:51:20,428
And it's like, well, we want to,

3326
01:51:20,848 --> 01:51:22,968
like we're, we need to rush through everything,

3327
01:51:22,988 --> 01:51:24,248
but it's all going to be a spoiler.

3328
01:51:24,248 --> 01:51:25,188
Yeah, right, right.

3329
01:51:25,188 --> 01:51:27,228
And also the two days, like going for two days.

3330
01:51:27,248 --> 01:51:28,568
I mean, God bless you.

3331
01:51:28,628 --> 01:51:30,248
That's just shit on Scott now that he's gone.

3332
01:51:30,588 --> 01:51:31,868
There's so much stuff we're talking about.

3333
01:51:31,968 --> 01:51:33,568
You need more than two days, my goodness.

3334
01:51:34,408 --> 01:51:35,188
So yeah, so.

3335
01:51:35,588 --> 01:51:37,588
Well, with him gone, we can draw up the shirt

3336
01:51:37,588 --> 01:51:40,208
someone suggested of Scott is wrong again.

3337
01:51:43,748 --> 01:51:45,168
Yeah, we'll do that.

3338
01:51:45,368 --> 01:51:46,028
We like Scott.

3339
01:51:46,288 --> 01:51:48,848
We all take turns playing the villain and the fool

3340
01:51:48,848 --> 01:51:50,068
and the hero of this podcast.

3341
01:51:50,128 --> 01:51:50,968
We all make fun of each other.

3342
01:51:51,728 --> 01:51:53,308
So we got into Tokyo Disney Sea

3343
01:51:53,308 --> 01:51:56,388
and it is really, your brain has to figure out,

3344
01:51:56,408 --> 01:51:57,808
what am I looking at?

3345
01:51:58,248 --> 01:51:58,528
Yeah.

3346
01:51:58,568 --> 01:52:00,328
There's a big volcano in the distance

3347
01:52:00,328 --> 01:52:02,748
and it's a giant, massive, like water,

3348
01:52:03,308 --> 01:52:04,988
body of water right there.

3349
01:52:05,208 --> 01:52:07,188
And which we come to learn, I didn't even realize,

3350
01:52:07,468 --> 01:52:09,528
there is a hotel when you walk in.

3351
01:52:09,788 --> 01:52:11,068
Miracosta, Hotel Miracosta.

3352
01:52:11,248 --> 01:52:13,048
And it's staying in there.

3353
01:52:13,408 --> 01:52:15,648
I guess that slipped by me

3354
01:52:15,648 --> 01:52:16,948
when I was reading about this stuff.

3355
01:52:17,108 --> 01:52:17,908
It's expensive.

3356
01:52:18,068 --> 01:52:18,608
It is expensive.

3357
01:52:18,788 --> 01:52:20,408
But it is staying inside the park.

3358
01:52:20,728 --> 01:52:22,948
And we didn't realize it until we were leaving

3359
01:52:22,948 --> 01:52:26,268
and everybody staying at the hotel does this cute thing

3360
01:52:26,268 --> 01:52:28,408
where they turn their flashlights on their phones

3361
01:52:28,408 --> 01:52:30,368
and they just wave at all the people leaving.

3362
01:52:30,588 --> 01:52:33,148
And so then everybody leaving pulls out their phones

3363
01:52:33,148 --> 01:52:35,488
with their flashlights and waves back at the people.

3364
01:52:35,788 --> 01:52:36,468
It was so cute.

3365
01:52:36,588 --> 01:52:38,108
Jason's eyes again going wide.

3366
01:52:38,468 --> 01:52:41,468
It was just this sweet exchange of all these strangers

3367
01:52:41,468 --> 01:52:42,708
saying goodbye.

3368
01:52:42,868 --> 01:52:44,928
You're lucky if you can get someone

3369
01:52:44,928 --> 01:52:47,788
staying at the Grand Californian on the balconies

3370
01:52:47,788 --> 01:52:52,808
to blast a big plume from their jewels, from their face.

3371
01:52:54,968 --> 01:52:55,868
Let alone wave.

3372
01:52:56,148 --> 01:52:57,708
No, everyone does it.

3373
01:52:57,768 --> 01:52:58,428
Cause we were like, wait,

3374
01:52:58,628 --> 01:53:00,348
cause it was before we even realized that was the hotel.

3375
01:53:00,748 --> 01:53:03,168
We were like, oh, are those just people hanging?

3376
01:53:03,368 --> 01:53:04,168
What is up there?

3377
01:53:04,248 --> 01:53:05,328
And then we're like, oh, it's a hotel.

3378
01:53:05,348 --> 01:53:06,608
Yeah, you were like, is someone in an office?

3379
01:53:06,608 --> 01:53:08,048
Oh, it's a five star hotel.

3380
01:53:08,128 --> 01:53:11,228
Yeah, those especially the park view rooms.

3381
01:53:11,228 --> 01:53:12,328
Oh my gosh, I'm sure.

3382
01:53:12,468 --> 01:53:13,228
Incredible.

3383
01:53:13,468 --> 01:53:13,828
Yeah.

3384
01:53:13,828 --> 01:53:15,888
A grand tonight, two grand and like something.

3385
01:53:15,888 --> 01:53:16,228
Yeah, at least.

3386
01:53:17,048 --> 01:53:18,488
So then, yeah, we went in there.

3387
01:53:18,608 --> 01:53:20,588
Which we of course did because we have so much money.

3388
01:53:20,608 --> 01:53:21,368
That's true.

3389
01:53:21,488 --> 01:53:22,128
Well, sure.

3390
01:53:22,448 --> 01:53:24,068
Yeah, that's how we can do four days.

3391
01:53:25,508 --> 01:53:27,688
So we want- Crazy to hear someone, not me,

3392
01:53:27,888 --> 01:53:29,528
complaining about money on the podcast.

3393
01:53:29,908 --> 01:53:32,008
That was an experience I don't often have.

3394
01:53:32,048 --> 01:53:32,448
That's true.

3395
01:53:32,528 --> 01:53:34,008
You're usually the miser of the three.

3396
01:53:34,148 --> 01:53:34,528
Yes.

3397
01:53:35,308 --> 01:53:36,288
So we walked.

3398
01:53:36,728 --> 01:53:38,588
It's also like everything's forest perspective too.

3399
01:53:38,728 --> 01:53:40,368
So like when we were, it was another day

3400
01:53:40,368 --> 01:53:42,728
where I was still recuperating from having a little cold

3401
01:53:42,728 --> 01:53:45,968
and I remember going, how long is the walk gonna be

3402
01:53:45,968 --> 01:53:47,288
to the volcano?

3403
01:53:47,688 --> 01:53:49,708
And it's not as long as you think it is,

3404
01:53:49,808 --> 01:53:51,588
but it is still a bit of a walk.

3405
01:53:52,148 --> 01:53:53,468
I think California Adventure, what did we say,

3406
01:53:53,568 --> 01:53:56,948
is like five acres bigger than California Adventure

3407
01:53:56,948 --> 01:53:57,968
or Disneyland or something?

3408
01:53:57,988 --> 01:53:59,008
Oh yeah, it was like-

3409
01:53:59,008 --> 01:53:59,468
It's like-

3410
01:53:59,468 --> 01:54:01,848
I should look it up.

3411
01:54:02,688 --> 01:54:03,868
It was like much bigger.

3412
01:54:03,868 --> 01:54:05,668
It was like at least a quarter bigger.

3413
01:54:05,668 --> 01:54:08,368
Yeah, so it is a lot of-

3414
01:54:08,368 --> 01:54:10,268
No, it was like a third bigger.

3415
01:54:10,868 --> 01:54:10,908
Hold on.

3416
01:54:10,908 --> 01:54:13,188
Closer to like an Epcot in size

3417
01:54:13,188 --> 01:54:16,188
than like a California Adventure in size, it sounds like.

3418
01:54:16,208 --> 01:54:19,228
So California Adventure size is 72 acres

3419
01:54:19,228 --> 01:54:25,268
and Tokyo Disney size is 121 acres.

3420
01:54:25,268 --> 01:54:27,928
Okay, so I said four acres, Jesus, 50 acres.

3421
01:54:27,928 --> 01:54:28,608
Oh, 50 acres.

3422
01:54:28,868 --> 01:54:30,148
Is more than California Adventure.

3423
01:54:30,288 --> 01:54:32,568
And you can see Tokyo Bay in the distance.

3424
01:54:32,568 --> 01:54:34,768
There's a sea wall, but the ocean is there.

3425
01:54:34,768 --> 01:54:35,468
It was right there.

3426
01:54:35,468 --> 01:54:36,148
You can see the ocean.

3427
01:54:36,148 --> 01:54:38,208
There's a fake ocean and then a real ocean.

3428
01:54:38,468 --> 01:54:38,688
Yeah.

3429
01:54:38,688 --> 01:54:43,068
It's great, I mean, I love any sorts of nature,

3430
01:54:43,248 --> 01:54:45,728
bodies of water, and especially the kinetic energy

3431
01:54:45,728 --> 01:54:48,508
of like boats and trains and stuff in the parks.

3432
01:54:48,888 --> 01:54:53,168
That is what to me is a thing that's really special.

3433
01:54:53,488 --> 01:54:54,708
What a delightful statement.

3434
01:54:55,368 --> 01:54:57,768
The kinetic energy of the boats and trains.

3435
01:54:57,788 --> 01:54:59,908
That's what goes back to the Devil in the White City.

3436
01:54:59,908 --> 01:55:03,288
It was a big focus of the Chicago Ferris

3437
01:55:03,288 --> 01:55:04,728
that we have to have a lot of movements

3438
01:55:04,728 --> 01:55:07,468
and colors and lights and nature altogether.

3439
01:55:07,768 --> 01:55:09,848
Yeah, it's what a lot of Imagineers talk about it.

3440
01:55:10,108 --> 01:55:12,248
And I'm sure, I think Walt for sure talked about it too,

3441
01:55:12,268 --> 01:55:14,548
because having a lot of modes of transportation

3442
01:55:14,548 --> 01:55:17,268
in parks and areas makes it feel alive.

3443
01:55:18,308 --> 01:55:21,208
Which is like, yeah, why Tomorrowland out here sucks

3444
01:55:21,208 --> 01:55:22,828
because the people mover's not running.

3445
01:55:23,588 --> 01:55:25,508
And there was so much movement,

3446
01:55:25,528 --> 01:55:28,128
it makes everything feel so much cooler and bustling.

3447
01:55:28,448 --> 01:55:30,488
Side note, there is a biography

3448
01:55:30,488 --> 01:55:32,328
of the environmental designer

3449
01:55:32,328 --> 01:55:34,888
who planned the World's Fair Park.

3450
01:55:35,028 --> 01:55:36,128
This Chicago one?

3451
01:55:36,848 --> 01:55:38,928
Is it landscape architect?

3452
01:55:39,128 --> 01:55:40,808
Is that the term? Maybe that's what, yeah, yeah.

3453
01:55:40,908 --> 01:55:42,128
Landscape architect. That guy seemed fascinated.

3454
01:55:42,128 --> 01:55:42,568
Yeah, yeah.

3455
01:55:42,888 --> 01:55:45,748
He was like the fifth main character of the book.

3456
01:55:47,028 --> 01:55:49,548
So the first thing we did is we went to

3457
01:55:49,548 --> 01:55:51,268
the 20,000 Leagues ride.

3458
01:55:51,788 --> 01:55:52,768
Yeah. Okay.

3459
01:55:53,088 --> 01:55:57,228
Well, we rushed to get our fast passes for Journey.

3460
01:55:57,408 --> 01:55:58,848
To the center of the earth.

3461
01:55:59,268 --> 01:56:00,668
So you go to the like.

3462
01:56:00,748 --> 01:56:02,428
This is the thing I have been sitting on

3463
01:56:02,428 --> 01:56:03,808
since the 20,000 Leagues episode.

3464
01:56:03,808 --> 01:56:04,748
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

3465
01:56:04,968 --> 01:56:09,028
The ride system of the Tokyo 20,000 Leagues

3466
01:56:09,028 --> 01:56:11,508
is so much more efficient.

3467
01:56:11,528 --> 01:56:12,148
Oh my gosh.

3468
01:56:12,568 --> 01:56:12,608
It's so cool.

3469
01:56:12,648 --> 01:56:17,088
There's no giant body of water to tend to.

3470
01:56:17,228 --> 01:56:19,248
It's just bubbles and water.

3471
01:56:19,408 --> 01:56:21,048
In a screen. In the screen.

3472
01:56:21,068 --> 01:56:22,748
The window, not the screen. In the window.

3473
01:56:23,268 --> 01:56:24,088
It's so much smarter.

3474
01:56:24,088 --> 01:56:26,168
It's brilliant. It's so much more sustainable.

3475
01:56:26,168 --> 01:56:30,268
And it also made it actually feel more fun.

3476
01:56:30,468 --> 01:56:31,928
Oh yeah, and you can see more.

3477
01:56:32,268 --> 01:56:33,308
Yeah, because it's just,

3478
01:56:33,448 --> 01:56:35,808
you can get the effects of going underwater

3479
01:56:35,808 --> 01:56:39,948
without the actual boringness of going underwater.

3480
01:56:40,728 --> 01:56:40,748
Yeah. Right.

3481
01:56:40,968 --> 01:56:43,248
So yeah, I mean, like the only,

3482
01:56:43,748 --> 01:56:46,408
yeah, so you're, it's basically like Peter Pan.

3483
01:56:46,588 --> 01:56:48,168
You're on the, I think, right?

3484
01:56:48,168 --> 01:56:50,268
Similar like down into. So you're hung from the ceiling.

3485
01:56:50,588 --> 01:56:51,888
Yes, the track is above you.

3486
01:56:52,088 --> 01:56:54,128
Yeah, which is very, very smart.

3487
01:56:55,028 --> 01:56:56,608
And like, I got a little scared.

3488
01:56:56,748 --> 01:56:58,748
The lights went out in the first time.

3489
01:56:58,868 --> 01:57:02,448
There's like a, like a electric eel shocks you.

3490
01:57:03,428 --> 01:57:05,708
And you're not like strapped in either, which is fun.

3491
01:57:06,208 --> 01:57:06,608
Yeah.

3492
01:57:06,608 --> 01:57:08,428
It's not like you're getting bumped around a lot.

3493
01:57:08,948 --> 01:57:12,508
And everybody's like not facing each other.

3494
01:57:12,588 --> 01:57:15,128
Everybody's facing out in a circle around.

3495
01:57:15,568 --> 01:57:16,328
Right. Yeah.

3496
01:57:16,468 --> 01:57:19,088
So yeah, so we did that.

3497
01:57:19,088 --> 01:57:21,968
There's an octopus in there, which is fun.

3498
01:57:22,248 --> 01:57:23,908
And then like you get carried by fairies.

3499
01:57:23,908 --> 01:57:25,108
They save you at the end.

3500
01:57:25,528 --> 01:57:27,108
The only gripe I would have with that is I was like,

3501
01:57:27,228 --> 01:57:29,948
I wanted like a crazy giant monster at the end or something.

3502
01:57:29,948 --> 01:57:33,068
Yeah. There wasn't like a good big,

3503
01:57:33,388 --> 01:57:36,388
I don't know what the word I'm looking for is,

3504
01:57:36,388 --> 01:57:37,668
but like a big.

3505
01:57:37,668 --> 01:57:39,968
Well, like the boulder at the end of Indiana Jones.

3506
01:57:40,108 --> 01:57:41,108
You want a big moment.

3507
01:57:41,108 --> 01:57:42,668
Yeah, there's not a big, I guess, set piece.

3508
01:57:42,668 --> 01:57:43,868
Yeah. That's good.

3509
01:57:45,608 --> 01:57:47,508
Yeah. So. Same with Journey.

3510
01:57:47,868 --> 01:57:49,988
Well, look, let's just, now that you mentioned.

3511
01:57:50,188 --> 01:57:52,328
So Journey was the one, I didn't know anything about it.

3512
01:57:52,328 --> 01:57:54,028
I do know there was some sort of monster.

3513
01:57:54,948 --> 01:57:55,808
Do you've read about it?

3514
01:57:56,148 --> 01:57:58,108
Yeah. I, that one is interesting to me

3515
01:57:58,108 --> 01:58:00,928
because it uses the test track, that ride system

3516
01:58:00,928 --> 01:58:03,668
that's used on test track and radar, springs, racers.

3517
01:58:03,708 --> 01:58:04,208
Is that right?

3518
01:58:04,688 --> 01:58:05,668
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

3519
01:58:05,668 --> 01:58:08,588
Which is, I always think that is an interesting choice

3520
01:58:08,588 --> 01:58:11,588
because that is so a malfunction pro.

3521
01:58:11,868 --> 01:58:12,848
Yeah. And it did.

3522
01:58:13,448 --> 01:58:14,508
It was, yeah.

3523
01:58:14,648 --> 01:58:15,568
It broke down when we.

3524
01:58:15,768 --> 01:58:18,708
Because we, the last thing we tried to do before we left

3525
01:58:18,708 --> 01:58:20,548
was go on Journey one more time.

3526
01:58:20,548 --> 01:58:23,368
We had a fast pass for it and it broke down.

3527
01:58:23,368 --> 01:58:25,008
Yeah. Right at the end of the time.

3528
01:58:25,008 --> 01:58:25,788
And we sat waiting there for 50.

3529
01:58:25,908 --> 01:58:28,568
We only had such a time crunch there to get to the airport

3530
01:58:28,568 --> 01:58:30,448
and it was like, we can wait for 10 minutes

3531
01:58:30,448 --> 01:58:32,208
to, but it did not open.

3532
01:58:32,388 --> 01:58:33,628
That was. And I think we even,

3533
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:35,608
we're like, we can wait for 10 minutes

3534
01:58:35,608 --> 01:58:37,768
and still be waited for like 20, just hoping.

3535
01:58:37,928 --> 01:58:38,588
Yeah, I know.

3536
01:58:38,948 --> 01:58:40,148
It was very sad. That was the half day

3537
01:58:40,148 --> 01:58:40,988
you had to get to the airport.

3538
01:58:40,988 --> 01:58:41,588
Yes, right.

3539
01:58:41,728 --> 01:58:42,308
Yeah. Yeah.

3540
01:58:42,308 --> 01:58:43,348
Is that easy?

3541
01:58:43,768 --> 01:58:46,128
And is it close, the airport to Tokyo Bay?

3542
01:58:48,628 --> 01:58:51,208
The resort is not close, but.

3543
01:58:51,848 --> 01:58:52,088
The train.

3544
01:58:52,548 --> 01:58:53,388
We didn't take a train.

3545
01:58:53,548 --> 01:58:55,388
We took a bus. Oh yeah, we took a bus.

3546
01:58:55,508 --> 01:58:58,628
There's a bus, they have a bus system and it's like 10 bucks

3547
01:58:58,628 --> 01:59:00,328
and it's just a bus takes you right to the airport.

3548
01:59:00,348 --> 01:59:01,328
Yeah, directly from the hotel.

3549
01:59:01,348 --> 01:59:01,668
And it's very simple.

3550
01:59:01,708 --> 01:59:03,868
That's cheaper than any ways

3551
01:59:03,868 --> 01:59:05,448
to get to the Los Angeles airport.

3552
01:59:05,468 --> 01:59:06,588
Oh yeah. Absolutely.

3553
01:59:08,008 --> 01:59:09,508
So yeah, Journey in the Center of the Earth,

3554
01:59:09,768 --> 01:59:12,828
it's got a bunch of cool Jules Verne shit in the line.

3555
01:59:13,108 --> 01:59:14,508
The ride vehicle is what you're saying.

3556
01:59:15,788 --> 01:59:17,508
It's the Trestrak cars,

3557
01:59:17,608 --> 01:59:21,028
but it looks like this cool steampunky drill thing.

3558
01:59:21,628 --> 01:59:22,348
And it's very cool.

3559
01:59:22,408 --> 01:59:25,248
So we went on and my expectations were too high.

3560
01:59:25,248 --> 01:59:26,008
Way too high.

3561
01:59:26,288 --> 01:59:28,768
Because you're going through underground things

3562
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:30,508
and there's some robots and fun.

3563
01:59:30,508 --> 01:59:33,608
Everything was amazing.

3564
01:59:34,128 --> 01:59:37,408
And it had just such a disappointing end.

3565
01:59:38,028 --> 01:59:39,288
Yeah, so yeah, we're going through which,

3566
01:59:39,368 --> 01:59:40,768
I don't know the exact number of rooms,

3567
01:59:40,848 --> 01:59:42,168
but you go through three or four rooms

3568
01:59:42,168 --> 01:59:43,468
and it's a very cool vibe.

3569
01:59:43,988 --> 01:59:45,928
I don't know, maybe there's some music.

3570
01:59:45,948 --> 01:59:47,208
I think there's some music on it.

3571
01:59:47,228 --> 01:59:47,728
Probably.

3572
01:59:48,868 --> 01:59:52,308
And it feels very much like that first part of Big Thunder

3573
01:59:52,308 --> 01:59:53,348
where you're going through,

3574
01:59:53,688 --> 01:59:55,148
ooh, these are cool caves.

3575
01:59:55,288 --> 01:59:57,208
And the ambiance is very cool.

3576
01:59:57,268 --> 01:59:58,308
And then all of a sudden there's a problem

3577
01:59:58,308 --> 02:00:00,508
and you're racing a little faster through it.

3578
02:00:00,688 --> 02:00:04,248
And then you zoom by this crazy, awesome lava monster.

3579
02:00:04,268 --> 02:00:08,028
And at that point, I think we both felt,

3580
02:00:08,608 --> 02:00:10,348
oh wow. Oh, now the ride really begins.

3581
02:00:10,728 --> 02:00:13,028
This is going to be amazing.

3582
02:00:13,028 --> 02:00:15,768
Because I expected we're going to blow through rocks

3583
02:00:15,768 --> 02:00:17,228
and we're going to be in a room now

3584
02:00:17,228 --> 02:00:19,028
where it's lava everywhere,

3585
02:00:19,368 --> 02:00:21,888
like the Indiana Jones drawbridge or something.

3586
02:00:22,448 --> 02:00:25,048
And then basically right after you hit that monster,

3587
02:00:25,588 --> 02:00:27,728
you shoot out into air.

3588
02:00:27,728 --> 02:00:28,928
In a really fun drop.

3589
02:00:29,028 --> 02:00:32,048
Oh yeah, in a fun little short drop into the open air.

3590
02:00:32,488 --> 02:00:34,648
And you can see that from when you're standing around

3591
02:00:34,648 --> 02:00:36,088
in the mysterious island area.

3592
02:00:36,448 --> 02:00:37,908
You shoot back through some rocks

3593
02:00:37,908 --> 02:00:39,608
and there's nothing really to see in there.

3594
02:00:39,608 --> 02:00:41,368
And then you shoot your back out in the open air again

3595
02:00:41,368 --> 02:00:42,208
and the ride is over.

3596
02:00:42,408 --> 02:00:45,328
Yeah, I expected it to be like,

3597
02:00:45,328 --> 02:00:48,548
oh God, I just forgot what I was going to compare it to.

3598
02:00:48,688 --> 02:00:51,528
But you think once you encounter the lava monster

3599
02:00:51,528 --> 02:00:54,568
and you hit that first drop,

3600
02:00:54,828 --> 02:00:56,788
that then, oh, I guess I expected it to be

3601
02:00:56,788 --> 02:00:58,168
like Space Mountain after that.

3602
02:00:58,368 --> 02:01:00,888
Where you're climbing, climbing, climbing, climbing, climbing.

3603
02:01:01,428 --> 02:01:03,768
Lava monster scares you and you zoom away

3604
02:01:03,768 --> 02:01:05,928
on a longer experience.

3605
02:01:05,948 --> 02:01:06,588
Yes, that is what-

3606
02:01:06,588 --> 02:01:08,748
With a bunch of turns and drops and stuff.

3607
02:01:08,968 --> 02:01:11,008
Yes, I think that's absolutely what I expected

3608
02:01:11,008 --> 02:01:14,208
just from cool ride pacing and then expectations

3609
02:01:14,208 --> 02:01:17,028
from how cool everything else is and theming and stuff.

3610
02:01:17,468 --> 02:01:18,748
So again, it's a good ride.

3611
02:01:19,108 --> 02:01:20,908
It's just that was always what everyone was talking about.

3612
02:01:21,008 --> 02:01:25,288
That's the crown jewel of Tokyo Disney Sea

3613
02:01:25,288 --> 02:01:28,088
and it felt like half of an amazing ride.

3614
02:01:28,308 --> 02:01:29,068
Yeah, exactly.

3615
02:01:29,448 --> 02:01:31,708
So it was like, ah, ah.

3616
02:01:32,328 --> 02:01:33,748
Yeah, because you're like, oh man,

3617
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:35,828
what crazy shit is going to happen now?

3618
02:01:35,888 --> 02:01:37,288
And it's like, no, nothing.

3619
02:01:37,908 --> 02:01:38,648
No crazy shit.

3620
02:01:38,788 --> 02:01:42,348
But there is a ride that you both have alluded to.

3621
02:01:42,348 --> 02:01:43,548
Oh, well, hold on a second.

3622
02:01:43,728 --> 02:01:44,108
Oh, okay.

3623
02:01:44,168 --> 02:01:44,788
I just wanted to say-

3624
02:01:44,788 --> 02:01:46,228
I thought that was such a good segue.

3625
02:01:46,228 --> 02:01:47,108
It was a good segue.

3626
02:01:47,328 --> 02:01:48,748
You did a good job, but unfortunately-

3627
02:01:48,748 --> 02:01:50,068
Yeah, no, no, no fault to you.

3628
02:01:50,188 --> 02:01:52,708
I just wanted to mention that both of these two rides

3629
02:01:52,708 --> 02:01:54,148
are in the mysterious island,

3630
02:01:54,488 --> 02:01:58,608
which might be the most impressive area to stand in

3631
02:01:58,608 --> 02:02:01,568
because you're in the middle of a volcano and mountains

3632
02:02:01,568 --> 02:02:04,388
and they got steam venting constantly.

3633
02:02:04,388 --> 02:02:04,848
Yeah, it's cool.

3634
02:02:04,948 --> 02:02:05,448
I have-

3635
02:02:05,448 --> 02:02:07,228
And it seems like there's a huge drill

3636
02:02:07,228 --> 02:02:08,688
in the center of it.

3637
02:02:08,688 --> 02:02:10,048
Yes, and there's like Nautilus.

3638
02:02:10,108 --> 02:02:12,648
I think there's a Nautilus sort of parked down there

3639
02:02:12,648 --> 02:02:14,708
and like you walk kind of down to 20,000 leagues.

3640
02:02:14,788 --> 02:02:18,768
All of that is so cool and just such a weird,

3641
02:02:18,928 --> 02:02:20,648
like where am I kind of a situation.

3642
02:02:20,668 --> 02:02:21,868
So now you segue.

3643
02:02:22,528 --> 02:02:24,928
Well, I have to ask, did you have the goyosa dog?

3644
02:02:25,368 --> 02:02:25,648
No.

3645
02:02:25,868 --> 02:02:29,448
No, it's essentially a hot dog or a sausage in the-

3646
02:02:29,448 --> 02:02:30,008
I know, I saw it.

3647
02:02:30,148 --> 02:02:31,268
I think we saw it, yeah.

3648
02:02:31,688 --> 02:02:32,208
Oh, I will.

3649
02:02:32,848 --> 02:02:34,948
So here, I'll help set it up even more.

3650
02:02:34,948 --> 02:02:38,068
So then when you leave the crap,

3651
02:02:38,088 --> 02:02:39,188
what is that area called?

3652
02:02:39,588 --> 02:02:39,948
Mysterious Island.

3653
02:02:40,188 --> 02:02:41,048
Mysterious Island.

3654
02:02:41,588 --> 02:02:45,968
Then you walk out into a further area with,

3655
02:02:46,848 --> 02:02:48,668
it's like what's the first thing you see

3656
02:02:48,668 --> 02:02:50,808
when you walk out of the Mysterious Island area?

3657
02:02:51,168 --> 02:02:52,168
Is it Ariel?

3658
02:02:52,808 --> 02:02:53,088
Yeah.

3659
02:02:53,088 --> 02:02:54,288
Is it the sea area?

3660
02:02:54,388 --> 02:02:57,408
Yeah, there's an Ariel's area basically,

3661
02:02:57,468 --> 02:02:58,428
whatever you call it.

3662
02:02:58,748 --> 02:03:00,468
It's, let's see the official,

3663
02:03:00,688 --> 02:03:02,468
a mermaid lagoon is the official name.

3664
02:03:02,468 --> 02:03:02,888
Yeah.

3665
02:03:02,988 --> 02:03:04,328
And it's kind of an indoor area

3666
02:03:04,328 --> 02:03:06,568
and it's got a fun mermaid show that we saw.

3667
02:03:06,568 --> 02:03:07,328
It looks awesome on the outside.

3668
02:03:07,448 --> 02:03:09,288
It looks like King Triton's castle.

3669
02:03:09,348 --> 02:03:09,728
Yeah.

3670
02:03:10,188 --> 02:03:11,828
So what do you, is that your-

3671
02:03:11,828 --> 02:03:14,488
And then you keep going and you reach,

3672
02:03:14,748 --> 02:03:18,208
what is that area called with the Aladdin stuff?

3673
02:03:18,348 --> 02:03:18,908
Agrabah.

3674
02:03:19,128 --> 02:03:20,028
The Arabian coast.

3675
02:03:20,148 --> 02:03:21,468
Arabian coast, yeah.

3676
02:03:21,868 --> 02:03:24,588
And so then that brings up-

3677
02:03:24,588 --> 02:03:25,948
What Jason was segueing into

3678
02:03:25,948 --> 02:03:27,088
and now we're here finally.

3679
02:03:27,288 --> 02:03:27,468
Yeah.

3680
02:03:28,008 --> 02:03:29,448
Oh, you want me to just go?

3681
02:03:29,528 --> 02:03:30,868
We were trying to let you do it again.

3682
02:03:30,868 --> 02:03:31,148
Yeah.

3683
02:03:31,148 --> 02:03:32,028
But that's fine, I'll do it.

3684
02:03:32,048 --> 02:03:33,408
Okay, I didn't have the official-

3685
02:03:33,408 --> 02:03:33,968
It's okay.

3686
02:03:33,968 --> 02:03:34,308
I'm sorry.

3687
02:03:34,748 --> 02:03:36,308
Sinbad's storybook voyage.

3688
02:03:36,488 --> 02:03:38,588
Okay, so we heard from our friend Andrew

3689
02:03:38,588 --> 02:03:40,768
because he had a day in Tokyo Disney

3690
02:03:40,768 --> 02:03:42,108
and he did all the big stuff

3691
02:03:42,108 --> 02:03:44,028
and he said, you have to go on Sinbad.

3692
02:03:44,708 --> 02:03:46,008
And I had no, like Scott was saying,

3693
02:03:46,028 --> 02:03:47,948
I had no idea what Sinbad was.

3694
02:03:48,368 --> 02:03:49,748
I didn't know that it was there.

3695
02:03:50,128 --> 02:03:51,628
I said, okay, we'll just go on Sinbad.

3696
02:03:51,648 --> 02:03:53,808
Well, it's based on a stunt show in Universal.

3697
02:03:53,868 --> 02:03:54,468
No, it's not.

3698
02:03:54,468 --> 02:03:56,168
Sinbad and his sidekick, Kebab.

3699
02:03:56,348 --> 02:03:58,108
It is not, there's no Kebab.

3700
02:03:58,368 --> 02:04:00,228
Kebab is the character sidekick.

3701
02:04:00,448 --> 02:04:01,628
Oh, okay.

3702
02:04:02,248 --> 02:04:04,428
So we went on Sinbad and you get in a boat

3703
02:04:04,428 --> 02:04:05,508
and there was no weight.

3704
02:04:06,088 --> 02:04:08,548
So much at this resort has just massive weight.

3705
02:04:08,588 --> 02:04:10,088
So many rides have massive weights.

3706
02:04:10,568 --> 02:04:12,248
Not Sinbad, it's a boat ride.

3707
02:04:12,328 --> 02:04:13,668
You get like right on.

3708
02:04:13,828 --> 02:04:15,688
Immediately you feel like, oh, it's Small World.

3709
02:04:15,908 --> 02:04:18,468
I can see the scale of all the animatronics,

3710
02:04:18,748 --> 02:04:19,928
it's like everyone thinks small.

3711
02:04:20,488 --> 02:04:22,048
And you're like, okay, like what?

3712
02:04:22,848 --> 02:04:24,928
I basically got in the boat going like,

3713
02:04:24,948 --> 02:04:28,088
okay, it might be a good Small World ride or something.

3714
02:04:28,248 --> 02:04:31,508
But then this music swells.

3715
02:04:31,748 --> 02:04:34,108
So yeah, immediately you're going on the boat ride

3716
02:04:34,108 --> 02:04:35,568
and there's music swelling

3717
02:04:35,568 --> 02:04:37,888
and you don't realize it right away.

3718
02:04:37,988 --> 02:04:42,168
But you go through a normal town and hey, you're like Sinbad

3719
02:04:42,168 --> 02:04:43,908
and he's got this fun, cheery voice.

3720
02:04:44,488 --> 02:04:47,088
Good luck Sinbad and everybody in the town

3721
02:04:47,088 --> 02:04:49,588
is out to see him off.

3722
02:04:49,748 --> 02:04:52,588
People are dancing, people are holding signs,

3723
02:04:52,788 --> 02:04:53,948
have a good voyage.

3724
02:04:54,908 --> 02:04:57,488
And like it's a very like classic setup

3725
02:04:57,488 --> 02:05:00,388
of I don't know, Disney movie-ish kind of a thing.

3726
02:05:00,808 --> 02:05:02,568
My hero's journey begins.

3727
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:06,948
Right and I think it was scene two or three on the ride.

3728
02:05:07,248 --> 02:05:10,728
And I didn't, I think what I said to you is I turned

3729
02:05:10,728 --> 02:05:13,448
and I went, I really like this Sinbad guy.

3730
02:05:13,688 --> 02:05:17,268
Yeah and here's, I think I do remember when it happened

3731
02:05:17,268 --> 02:05:20,988
and here is for me the moment where I went, okay.

3732
02:05:21,068 --> 02:05:25,268
And it was when you leave him, you leave the little town

3733
02:05:25,268 --> 02:05:30,088
and you are about to get out onto a rocky sea

3734
02:05:30,088 --> 02:05:32,568
and it's like storming and you see Sinbad

3735
02:05:32,568 --> 02:05:33,588
standing on his boat.

3736
02:05:33,588 --> 02:05:34,048
Oh yeah.

3737
02:05:34,768 --> 02:05:36,708
And it's like clouds and ominous.

3738
02:05:36,928 --> 02:05:38,948
And when you go through the little tunnel,

3739
02:05:39,288 --> 02:05:41,228
it all of a sudden rains on you.

3740
02:05:41,428 --> 02:05:43,468
Like there's this like, it kind of, yeah,

3741
02:05:43,528 --> 02:05:46,468
it kind of like hits you with some rain as you go through.

3742
02:05:46,588 --> 02:05:48,428
And I was like, well, that was a surprise.

3743
02:05:48,428 --> 02:05:52,168
And then you see Sinbad singing this song that plays

3744
02:05:52,168 --> 02:05:52,968
Yes.

3745
02:05:52,968 --> 02:05:54,868
Plays through the rest of the ride.

3746
02:05:55,068 --> 02:05:56,748
And I think a little after that,

3747
02:05:56,748 --> 02:05:59,368
and so he's singing this exciting song

3748
02:05:59,368 --> 02:06:00,728
about going on this journey.

3749
02:06:00,748 --> 02:06:02,288
And I think that's when you turned to me

3750
02:06:02,288 --> 02:06:04,628
and you were like, I really like Sinbad.

3751
02:06:04,908 --> 02:06:07,288
And I met him, because I met it personally at the time.

3752
02:06:07,368 --> 02:06:07,988
I didn't mean the ride.

3753
02:06:08,088 --> 02:06:11,188
I meant that this character Sinbad after three scenes,

3754
02:06:11,408 --> 02:06:14,748
I had it like, I felt a very strong connection to him.

3755
02:06:15,328 --> 02:06:17,508
I was like, this guy feels like a friend of mine now.

3756
02:06:17,508 --> 02:06:20,608
Or maybe it was just before he saves the birds.

3757
02:06:20,608 --> 02:06:21,368
Yeah, maybe.

3758
02:06:21,528 --> 02:06:21,728
Yeah.

3759
02:06:21,728 --> 02:06:23,368
After the mermaids help him on the ride.

3760
02:06:23,368 --> 02:06:27,528
So there's just like, so it very much is a small world

3761
02:06:27,528 --> 02:06:28,988
like ride system, you're on a boat

3762
02:06:28,988 --> 02:06:30,108
and there's little tiny characters,

3763
02:06:30,308 --> 02:06:31,488
but all the robots are great.

3764
02:06:32,088 --> 02:06:35,308
All, so basically the idea of the ride is,

3765
02:06:35,308 --> 02:06:36,888
and we'll do a full two hours on it,

3766
02:06:37,108 --> 02:06:38,508
is that you're going into scenes

3767
02:06:38,508 --> 02:06:40,888
where Sinbad has just done something great

3768
02:06:40,888 --> 02:06:44,708
and saved something, saved somebody, helped somebody.

3769
02:06:44,828 --> 02:06:46,668
And you're sort of seeing the aftermath and he's like,

3770
02:06:46,868 --> 02:06:48,448
look what I just did.

3771
02:06:48,768 --> 02:06:51,108
I like, and he's singing this wonderful little song.

3772
02:06:52,068 --> 02:06:54,888
And like, there's a scene with like a big genie

3773
02:06:54,888 --> 02:06:56,248
and it like, or an ogre.

3774
02:06:56,248 --> 02:06:56,688
Ogre, yeah.

3775
02:06:56,708 --> 02:06:58,428
And it's the best scene in the whole ride.

3776
02:06:58,848 --> 02:07:00,188
And he's playing a little,

3777
02:07:00,528 --> 02:07:02,148
Sinbad's playing this little guitar.

3778
02:07:02,148 --> 02:07:02,508
Yeah.

3779
02:07:02,508 --> 02:07:04,268
And the genie's playing a big bass,

3780
02:07:04,648 --> 02:07:07,168
like, and they're singing to each other from across the way.

3781
02:07:07,248 --> 02:07:07,908
And you're like, what the hell?

3782
02:07:07,908 --> 02:07:09,508
Yeah, and the ogre is huge.

3783
02:07:09,508 --> 02:07:10,668
He's so, the robot is fantastic.

3784
02:07:10,668 --> 02:07:12,488
And he's a really good animatronic, yeah.

3785
02:07:12,568 --> 02:07:14,448
Yeah, so like we go through the whole thing

3786
02:07:15,328 --> 02:07:19,108
and it was a situate, like we felt like high from it.

3787
02:07:19,348 --> 02:07:20,848
And like, we were trying to even sort out

3788
02:07:20,848 --> 02:07:23,248
what was going on. It was another like wide-eyed,

3789
02:07:23,248 --> 02:07:25,268
huge smile on my face the whole time.

3790
02:07:25,448 --> 02:07:27,148
Like, what is this?

3791
02:07:27,188 --> 02:07:28,588
This song is amazing.

3792
02:07:28,708 --> 02:07:30,388
So yeah, so we were getting, we're going down the stairs

3793
02:07:30,388 --> 02:07:32,128
and you're like, that's the thing you said on the ride.

3794
02:07:32,128 --> 02:07:33,708
You're like, what song is this?

3795
02:07:33,768 --> 02:07:34,408
Who is this from?

3796
02:07:34,408 --> 02:07:35,428
Another thing?

3797
02:07:35,788 --> 02:07:37,448
So you're Googling it and you're like,

3798
02:07:37,748 --> 02:07:39,368
it's Alan fucking Menken.

3799
02:07:39,588 --> 02:07:40,088
Yeah. Yeah.

3800
02:07:40,088 --> 02:07:42,968
It's an original composition for that ride.

3801
02:07:43,008 --> 02:07:43,648
Yeah, for the ride.

3802
02:07:43,868 --> 02:07:45,128
I had no clue.

3803
02:07:45,128 --> 02:07:47,508
It didn't originate with the ride.

3804
02:07:47,708 --> 02:07:49,328
Right, I had no clue of this.

3805
02:07:49,448 --> 02:07:49,708
Yep.

3806
02:07:50,088 --> 02:07:53,848
So we're like, oh, I see now why that song is incredible.

3807
02:07:54,068 --> 02:07:55,188
It's an Alan Menken song.

3808
02:07:55,208 --> 02:07:56,348
Yeah, because immediately it felt like something

3809
02:07:56,348 --> 02:07:57,948
you knew from childhood.

3810
02:07:58,628 --> 02:07:58,868
Yeah. Yeah.

3811
02:07:58,988 --> 02:08:03,168
And it's like, it's maybe the best dance song.

3812
02:08:03,168 --> 02:08:04,708
I said maybe next to Party World,

3813
02:08:04,788 --> 02:08:05,848
the best song he's ever written.

3814
02:08:05,988 --> 02:08:07,268
It's called Compass of Your Heart.

3815
02:08:07,608 --> 02:08:08,448
And you played it before.

3816
02:08:08,548 --> 02:08:09,048
We were driving.

3817
02:08:09,168 --> 02:08:09,348
I did, I played it for you.

3818
02:08:09,348 --> 02:08:10,668
When we were driving down to Disneyland,

3819
02:08:10,908 --> 02:08:11,868
you're like, listen to this.

3820
02:08:11,868 --> 02:08:14,128
Because you bought the two disc.

3821
02:08:14,228 --> 02:08:14,748
Three.

3822
02:08:14,908 --> 02:08:18,708
Three disc soundtrack set for the 35th anniversary

3823
02:08:18,708 --> 02:08:18,988
of Tokyo Disney.

3824
02:08:18,988 --> 02:08:19,888
But it was not on there.

3825
02:08:19,888 --> 02:08:20,588
It's not on there.

3826
02:08:20,968 --> 02:08:21,588
It's not?

3827
02:08:21,728 --> 02:08:22,148
Not on there.

3828
02:08:22,188 --> 02:08:23,308
I played it off of YouTube for you.

3829
02:08:23,328 --> 02:08:24,128
You played it off of YouTube?

3830
02:08:24,128 --> 02:08:26,308
You bought it like hoping it would be on there.

3831
02:08:26,348 --> 02:08:26,648
Yeah.

3832
02:08:26,708 --> 02:08:29,108
And you were trying to find the 12 disc.

3833
02:08:29,108 --> 02:08:30,828
Yes, they didn't have it at the resort.

3834
02:08:31,248 --> 02:08:32,828
Yeah, we went to multiple gift shops for that.

3835
02:08:32,828 --> 02:08:34,448
People tried so hard to help me

3836
02:08:34,448 --> 02:08:35,548
when I showed them pictures of it

3837
02:08:35,548 --> 02:08:36,888
and they were like, no, we don't know.

3838
02:08:37,848 --> 02:08:41,148
So yeah, so we went in Sinbad three times.

3839
02:08:41,148 --> 02:08:42,648
And it's mostly in Japanese,

3840
02:08:42,648 --> 02:08:45,188
unlike a lot of the other songs in the park,

3841
02:08:45,188 --> 02:08:47,808
except for the title of the song,

3842
02:08:47,888 --> 02:08:50,008
which is Compass of Your Heart.

3843
02:08:50,388 --> 02:08:51,808
Right, so he's like, that's whatever.

3844
02:08:52,068 --> 02:08:54,308
And then, compass of your heart.

3845
02:08:54,448 --> 02:08:55,468
So we were singing the song.

3846
02:08:55,588 --> 02:08:57,568
We didn't have it down until maybe the third ride,

3847
02:08:57,688 --> 02:08:58,928
exactly what the melody was.

3848
02:08:59,508 --> 02:09:02,388
But it is, I have an emotion,

3849
02:09:02,548 --> 02:09:05,368
like a strong emotional reaction to it now.

3850
02:09:05,448 --> 02:09:09,068
It really feels like now Sinbad was a Disney movie

3851
02:09:09,068 --> 02:09:11,788
that I saw a ton in childhood.

3852
02:09:11,988 --> 02:09:13,048
And when I hear it now,

3853
02:09:13,088 --> 02:09:16,128
I get nostalgic for a time that didn't exist.

3854
02:09:16,568 --> 02:09:17,348
Yeah, it is.

3855
02:09:17,588 --> 02:09:21,708
If I hear it, I imagine I'm like a child being on the ride.

3856
02:09:21,928 --> 02:09:25,468
Like there's something extra odd that happens to me

3857
02:09:25,468 --> 02:09:27,508
about the ride and the music now.

3858
02:09:27,528 --> 02:09:28,628
It's just the Alan Menken magic

3859
02:09:28,628 --> 02:09:31,928
where he just really hit it out of the park with this song.

3860
02:09:32,648 --> 02:09:34,708
And again, we'll do it on the full Sinbad episode.

3861
02:09:34,768 --> 02:09:36,588
But this was a reformatted ride.

3862
02:09:36,608 --> 02:09:37,988
Yeah, this changed, this ride.

3863
02:09:37,988 --> 02:09:40,468
This was open with, I don't know if it opened,

3864
02:09:40,548 --> 02:09:41,388
I can't remember when it opened,

3865
02:09:41,448 --> 02:09:43,688
but it opened as a much, like there was no cool song.

3866
02:09:43,708 --> 02:09:45,328
Well, it's a lot more,

3867
02:09:45,328 --> 02:09:45,888
Straight.

3868
02:09:46,148 --> 02:09:49,288
It's truer to the Sinbad stories.

3869
02:09:49,368 --> 02:09:53,828
Where Sinbad is not necessarily like the plucky hero

3870
02:09:53,828 --> 02:09:56,808
that we met on the ride.

3871
02:09:57,388 --> 02:09:58,148
That we fell in love.

3872
02:09:58,228 --> 02:09:59,508
It was a bearded.

3873
02:09:59,528 --> 02:10:00,688
That we fell, that stole my heart.

3874
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:03,768
And the Sinbad stories are a lot darker.

3875
02:10:04,408 --> 02:10:05,728
Like when we were on the ride,

3876
02:10:05,728 --> 02:10:09,368
the mermaids are helping him because he's crashed his boat.

3877
02:10:09,968 --> 02:10:12,128
Whereas obviously the traditional story

3878
02:10:12,128 --> 02:10:14,468
is the mermaids lure you onto the rocks.

3879
02:10:14,848 --> 02:10:16,528
Whoa, whoa, they do, mermaids do what?

3880
02:10:17,188 --> 02:10:18,508
They lure you onto rocks, Jason.

3881
02:10:18,648 --> 02:10:21,208
Oh, that explains all those boats I've destroyed.

3882
02:10:22,228 --> 02:10:24,508
Jason always calling for the siren song

3883
02:10:24,508 --> 02:10:26,408
of pack of mermaids.

3884
02:10:26,548 --> 02:10:28,168
But you love that kinetic energy of the boat

3885
02:10:28,168 --> 02:10:29,308
and you can't help yourself.

3886
02:10:29,328 --> 02:10:30,068
I do, I can't help.

3887
02:10:30,208 --> 02:10:31,668
You know I gotta go on a boat.

3888
02:10:31,668 --> 02:10:32,348
You know Jason.

3889
02:10:32,348 --> 02:10:33,528
If the boat's running, I'm going on it.

3890
02:10:33,548 --> 02:10:35,048
He loves treats and kinetic energy.

3891
02:10:35,268 --> 02:10:36,128
That's true.

3892
02:10:36,748 --> 02:10:39,068
So yeah, so we can talk about Sinbad all day.

3893
02:10:40,068 --> 02:10:40,768
It's incredible.

3894
02:10:41,048 --> 02:10:42,268
Our favorite ride.

3895
02:10:42,548 --> 02:10:45,148
But we didn't fully address the fact that,

3896
02:10:45,308 --> 02:10:48,248
so it was much truer to the original Sinbad tales.

3897
02:10:48,988 --> 02:10:50,928
And then it was, nobody liked it.

3898
02:10:51,508 --> 02:10:52,968
Because it was dark and unpleasant.

3899
02:10:53,188 --> 02:10:55,848
Yeah, so originally like in the ride we saw,

3900
02:10:56,008 --> 02:10:57,868
Sinbad is saving all of these birds

3901
02:10:57,868 --> 02:11:02,528
from these like rogue, like marauders

3902
02:11:02,528 --> 02:11:04,728
who were trying to steal these birds

3903
02:11:04,728 --> 02:11:06,388
for their own greedy purposes.

3904
02:11:07,108 --> 02:11:08,768
But Sinbad is setting the birds free

3905
02:11:08,768 --> 02:11:10,528
and tying up the guys.

3906
02:11:10,668 --> 02:11:11,848
But in the original stories,

3907
02:11:11,908 --> 02:11:14,488
that's his crew doing that out of greed.

3908
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:18,428
And the ogre, instead of being locked up by the pirates,

3909
02:11:18,508 --> 02:11:20,368
the ogre is just looking on,

3910
02:11:20,368 --> 02:11:22,648
laughing at the greed of these men.

3911
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:25,888
But Disney took care of it.

3912
02:11:25,928 --> 02:11:27,328
They sanitized the whole thing.

3913
02:11:27,488 --> 02:11:29,028
They made it so much more family friendly.

3914
02:11:29,048 --> 02:11:32,108
They gave him a cute little tiger cub sidekick.

3915
02:11:33,568 --> 02:11:34,008
Chandu.

3916
02:11:34,148 --> 02:11:35,048
Chandu is great.

3917
02:11:35,188 --> 02:11:37,368
They don't have any Sinbad plush.

3918
02:11:37,528 --> 02:11:38,668
They have Chandu, which is great.

3919
02:11:38,688 --> 02:11:40,808
Yeah, popular and then Chandu tales.

3920
02:11:40,808 --> 02:11:42,108
We should have gotten him.

3921
02:11:42,148 --> 02:11:43,368
Why didn't we get him?

3922
02:11:43,808 --> 02:11:44,388
I don't know.

3923
02:11:44,548 --> 02:11:45,148
I think I would have gotten Sinbad.

3924
02:11:45,148 --> 02:11:47,308
I should have given you money to get me the sunbonnet,

3925
02:11:47,448 --> 02:11:48,968
the stuffed sunbonnet girls.

3926
02:11:48,988 --> 02:11:49,688
Oh yeah.

3927
02:11:49,768 --> 02:11:50,628
They bet they have.

3928
02:11:50,968 --> 02:11:51,968
I got them for my sister.

3929
02:11:51,988 --> 02:11:52,608
Oh, okay.

3930
02:11:53,088 --> 02:11:53,888
Sorry.

3931
02:11:54,668 --> 02:11:56,128
I got you a tiny tin though.

3932
02:11:56,388 --> 02:11:56,968
That's fine.

3933
02:11:57,088 --> 02:11:59,408
They cheered up the whole story.

3934
02:12:01,348 --> 02:12:04,368
And then had Alan Menken write this song.

3935
02:12:04,568 --> 02:12:05,708
That is truly.

3936
02:12:06,148 --> 02:12:07,428
And it just blew us away.

3937
02:12:07,568 --> 02:12:10,888
Top five Menken, if not top three Menken.

3938
02:12:10,908 --> 02:12:13,448
You argued that it's the first.

3939
02:12:13,928 --> 02:12:16,208
And then you keep going maybe part of your world.

3940
02:12:16,208 --> 02:12:18,388
Part of your world probably best Menken.

3941
02:12:18,388 --> 02:12:21,768
But I agree that it's definitely in the top five.

3942
02:12:21,888 --> 02:12:24,388
It's top five Alan Menken songs, which is wild.

3943
02:12:24,508 --> 02:12:26,708
And then there's like, look up Compass of Your Heart.

3944
02:12:27,288 --> 02:12:30,088
Like listen to the official Tokyo Disney version

3945
02:12:30,088 --> 02:12:30,408
from the ride.

3946
02:12:30,408 --> 02:12:31,968
Because we also love this singer.

3947
02:12:32,108 --> 02:12:33,908
It's a Japanese singer of the song.

3948
02:12:34,208 --> 02:12:37,568
And he's, I can't really find him in anything else.

3949
02:12:37,568 --> 02:12:39,828
He's like a stage actor in Japan,

3950
02:12:39,828 --> 02:12:43,408
but his voice is so like lush and beautiful.

3951
02:12:44,368 --> 02:12:45,268
Yeah, amazing.

3952
02:12:45,468 --> 02:12:46,088
So yeah, look at all that.

3953
02:12:46,128 --> 02:12:47,928
There's also a clip of Alan Menken singing it

3954
02:12:47,928 --> 02:12:49,748
at D23 in Japan.

3955
02:12:50,328 --> 02:12:52,148
People like weeping in the audience.

3956
02:12:52,708 --> 02:12:55,028
The one woman we talked to who was working

3957
02:12:55,588 --> 02:12:57,368
at the 20,000 leagues, she was like,

3958
02:12:57,408 --> 02:12:58,608
what's your favorite ride here?

3959
02:12:58,868 --> 02:13:00,648
And we were like, well, she's like,

3960
02:13:01,128 --> 02:13:03,068
did she say she suggested Sinbad, right?

3961
02:13:03,248 --> 02:13:06,948
I think she said Sinbad and we were like, yes, Sinbad.

3962
02:13:06,988 --> 02:13:08,368
She goes, oh, it's my favorite too.

3963
02:13:08,688 --> 02:13:10,548
Yeah, I can't remember the interaction quite.

3964
02:13:10,548 --> 02:13:11,348
Which was interesting.

3965
02:13:11,488 --> 02:13:11,848
Never.

3966
02:13:12,308 --> 02:13:13,048
So that was odd.

3967
02:13:13,308 --> 02:13:15,108
And then like, even though it's great not to have a wait,

3968
02:13:15,168 --> 02:13:17,808
we were angry that there weren't more people

3969
02:13:17,808 --> 02:13:19,188
on the Sinbad ride.

3970
02:13:19,308 --> 02:13:19,948
Because we don't want people.

3971
02:13:20,648 --> 02:13:24,488
I feel like they don't like flip attractions as much.

3972
02:13:24,708 --> 02:13:25,188
No.

3973
02:13:25,628 --> 02:13:28,188
But they did the, was it Storm Rider?

3974
02:13:28,348 --> 02:13:30,248
That had changed by the time.

3975
02:13:30,248 --> 02:13:31,628
Oh yeah, Nemo and Friends.

3976
02:13:31,908 --> 02:13:34,968
Yeah, and that was a fun little overlay thing they did.

3977
02:13:35,368 --> 02:13:36,448
It was like kids star tours.

3978
02:13:36,488 --> 02:13:36,988
Yeah.

3979
02:13:36,988 --> 02:13:37,508
Oh, cute.

3980
02:13:38,168 --> 02:13:39,348
So, okay, let's see.

3981
02:13:39,828 --> 02:13:41,968
Let's, we can't get to every, there's plenty left.

3982
02:13:41,968 --> 02:13:43,428
I mean, Tower of Terror, we haven't even touched.

3983
02:13:43,428 --> 02:13:44,888
We have to do a little tower.

3984
02:13:45,008 --> 02:13:46,668
We're gonna have to do a full tower episode.

3985
02:13:47,928 --> 02:13:50,348
I'll say this just overall, before we get into,

3986
02:13:50,448 --> 02:13:52,068
we'll end with tower.

3987
02:13:53,428 --> 02:13:57,448
The Tokyo Disney Sea, what makes it so amazing is that,

3988
02:13:57,468 --> 02:13:59,748
especially in like the New York area and stuff,

3989
02:14:00,388 --> 02:14:02,868
like the Imagineers clearly were able to go wild

3990
02:14:02,868 --> 02:14:05,648
with every whim they had.

3991
02:14:05,968 --> 02:14:09,148
There are so many different billboards and posters

3992
02:14:09,148 --> 02:14:12,128
for fake products from the 20s.

3993
02:14:12,808 --> 02:14:13,208
And like just.

3994
02:14:13,288 --> 02:14:16,028
Scrooge McDucks, a department store that he owns.

3995
02:14:16,528 --> 02:14:16,548
McDucks, yes.

3996
02:14:16,788 --> 02:14:19,828
McDucks is the name of one of the gift shops.

3997
02:14:21,428 --> 02:14:23,928
Like they wrote paragraphs on,

3998
02:14:24,188 --> 02:14:25,568
like I think we were looking at like,

3999
02:14:25,568 --> 02:14:27,608
when we were eating, I was eating like,

4000
02:14:28,008 --> 02:14:31,048
I don't know if it was, what was it, soup or something?

4001
02:14:31,528 --> 02:14:34,248
We were eating in the 1920s area,

4002
02:14:34,308 --> 02:14:35,668
and they had all this like,

4003
02:14:35,668 --> 02:14:39,948
they had all this like ad dialogue on like the tray

4004
02:14:39,948 --> 02:14:40,608
or something.

4005
02:14:40,908 --> 02:14:42,048
Yeah, yeah.

4006
02:14:42,228 --> 02:14:44,368
Just like the amount of detail in places.

4007
02:14:44,368 --> 02:14:45,728
In English, and it was funny.

4008
02:14:46,188 --> 02:14:46,868
Yes, it was funny.

4009
02:14:46,908 --> 02:14:47,668
We'll post a picture of it.

4010
02:14:47,668 --> 02:14:48,368
I think I have it.

4011
02:14:48,748 --> 02:14:49,468
The amount just.

4012
02:14:49,468 --> 02:14:50,688
Yeah, it was a deli.

4013
02:14:50,848 --> 02:14:52,128
It was a deli in New York.

4014
02:14:52,308 --> 02:14:53,668
Thank you, we've been recording for four hours,

4015
02:14:53,688 --> 02:14:55,408
and I've forgotten already what I'm talking about.

4016
02:14:56,008 --> 02:14:58,608
But it's just so clear that they were able

4017
02:14:58,608 --> 02:15:02,148
to get the budget for all of this ancillary stuff.

4018
02:15:02,728 --> 02:15:05,348
The stuff that I think they probably skimp out on all that,

4019
02:15:05,408 --> 02:15:06,188
like a lot of times.

4020
02:15:06,188 --> 02:15:07,948
Yeah, and we were talking about how it was like,

4021
02:15:08,308 --> 02:15:11,288
oh man, these guys just got to go to town with jokes

4022
02:15:11,288 --> 02:15:12,968
because everything's so detailed.

4023
02:15:13,088 --> 02:15:13,748
Everything's so detailed,

4024
02:15:13,768 --> 02:15:16,068
and if you wanna stop and read every billboard,

4025
02:15:16,208 --> 02:15:16,848
they're funny.

4026
02:15:16,848 --> 02:15:19,968
They're funny, weird gags and jokes and stuff,

4027
02:15:20,148 --> 02:15:21,988
and it's just so clear.

4028
02:15:22,528 --> 02:15:24,688
When you're watching a movie, and you're like,

4029
02:15:24,708 --> 02:15:26,268
oh, this feels like a real auteur,

4030
02:15:26,848 --> 02:15:28,568
this director and writer.

4031
02:15:28,568 --> 02:15:30,688
Their vision was executed.

4032
02:15:31,208 --> 02:15:32,528
This is completely what they wanted to do,

4033
02:15:32,548 --> 02:15:34,648
and I can feel their personality in it.

4034
02:15:34,708 --> 02:15:38,348
It's like you can feel that when you're in this place.

4035
02:15:38,568 --> 02:15:39,088
That's interesting.

4036
02:15:39,488 --> 02:15:41,348
That sort of thing, I feel like,

4037
02:15:41,588 --> 02:15:44,748
is whether it's conscious or subconscious,

4038
02:15:45,028 --> 02:15:48,868
that is what makes people, really moves people.

4039
02:15:49,228 --> 02:15:50,928
It makes people come back and feel like,

4040
02:15:51,308 --> 02:15:52,808
what a trip, what a vacation,

4041
02:15:52,908 --> 02:15:53,648
what an experience we all had together.

4042
02:15:53,648 --> 02:15:55,388
That was really something special.

4043
02:15:56,028 --> 02:15:57,948
And I think Tony Baxter and other Imagineers

4044
02:15:57,948 --> 02:15:58,768
talk about it.

4045
02:15:59,388 --> 02:16:03,688
It's stuff that, even if you're not a nerd like we are,

4046
02:16:04,168 --> 02:16:07,288
you can feel it if you don't even notice it.

4047
02:16:07,288 --> 02:16:10,628
You can feel detail, and you can feel things like that,

4048
02:16:10,648 --> 02:16:11,768
and it makes you feel a certain way,

4049
02:16:11,768 --> 02:16:13,528
but it's not a conscious thought necessarily.

4050
02:16:13,628 --> 02:16:14,288
Yeah, you pick up on it, regardless.

4051
02:16:14,288 --> 02:16:16,848
But it's hard to quantify with metrics.

4052
02:16:17,288 --> 02:16:18,408
Oh, yeah, yeah.

4053
02:16:18,588 --> 02:16:21,848
Make sure corporate entities need a chart or a spreadsheet

4054
02:16:21,848 --> 02:16:25,568
they can point to and say, this will cause this.

4055
02:16:25,628 --> 02:16:26,488
Instead, there's just ticker tape

4056
02:16:26,488 --> 02:16:29,868
where their heart should be of the stock market.

4057
02:16:30,108 --> 02:16:32,328
Desserts, limited time mugs

4058
02:16:32,328 --> 02:16:34,108
that no one can buy the mugs,

4059
02:16:34,188 --> 02:16:36,228
but you can only buy two of the mugs.

4060
02:16:37,588 --> 02:16:41,248
Yeah, it's probably corporate culture.

4061
02:16:41,248 --> 02:16:44,768
It's hard to explain to money people

4062
02:16:44,768 --> 02:16:49,988
why you need money for 40-gag product billboards

4063
02:16:49,988 --> 02:16:51,468
in the 1920s.

4064
02:16:51,528 --> 02:16:55,888
But as money people ourselves, we understand it.

4065
02:16:55,888 --> 02:16:56,808
The upper crust.

4066
02:16:57,008 --> 02:16:59,468
The upper crust of fans, for sure.

4067
02:16:59,488 --> 02:17:01,168
The 1%.

4068
02:17:01,168 --> 02:17:05,388
Staying at your mid-range chain hotels,

4069
02:17:05,788 --> 02:17:09,988
and you're going to the, possibly the most affordable

4070
02:17:09,988 --> 02:17:13,008
Disney parks in the world due to government subsidies.

4071
02:17:13,248 --> 02:17:18,648
Thanks to points you earned freezing your girlfriend's eggs

4072
02:17:18,648 --> 02:17:22,588
because it was more affordable than having a child now.

4073
02:17:22,768 --> 02:17:27,748
Sure, when Michael needs his toy budget for his toys

4074
02:17:27,748 --> 02:17:29,588
as opposed to the child's toys.

4075
02:17:29,988 --> 02:17:32,228
My budget will be higher than the child's.

4076
02:17:32,588 --> 02:17:33,828
So, yeah.

4077
02:17:34,048 --> 02:17:35,168
Yeah, you could just feel it.

4078
02:17:35,168 --> 02:17:36,088
You can feel it there.

4079
02:17:36,088 --> 02:17:36,968
There's so much detail.

4080
02:17:37,068 --> 02:17:37,748
So much detail.

4081
02:17:37,888 --> 02:17:39,828
I'll say, if I have to knock Tokyo Disney,

4082
02:17:39,828 --> 02:17:41,188
I will say they need more rides.

4083
02:17:42,148 --> 02:17:44,288
They need better endings.

4084
02:17:44,768 --> 02:17:47,608
There's not much catharsis to the story of their rides.

4085
02:17:47,768 --> 02:17:49,088
And some of them don't feel as long.

4086
02:17:49,188 --> 02:17:50,828
And I will say that's about Tower of Terror,

4087
02:17:50,828 --> 02:17:53,528
which I just realized there's an overlaid of Tower of Terror

4088
02:17:53,528 --> 02:17:54,788
that happens in January to March

4089
02:17:54,788 --> 02:17:56,188
where the ride is twice as long.

4090
02:17:56,548 --> 02:17:57,408
That's what I'm talking about.

4091
02:17:57,428 --> 02:18:00,788
The normal ride is only three drops in Tokyo Disney Sea.

4092
02:18:00,908 --> 02:18:03,648
Yeah, which again, very anti-climactic.

4093
02:18:03,928 --> 02:18:04,268
Right.

4094
02:18:04,428 --> 02:18:06,128
Yeah, they don't nail the climax.

4095
02:18:06,548 --> 02:18:07,828
Right, so I think they are a couple.

4096
02:18:07,828 --> 02:18:09,688
Like if there was a real crazy,

4097
02:18:09,688 --> 02:18:10,808
I think they should add some sort of,

4098
02:18:10,928 --> 02:18:11,768
I mean, they're adding.

4099
02:18:11,988 --> 02:18:14,848
They are injecting a billion, two billion dollars.

4100
02:18:15,108 --> 02:18:17,248
Peter Pan, Frozen, and something else land there.

4101
02:18:17,248 --> 02:18:18,268
And I'm sure it'll be amazing.

4102
02:18:18,408 --> 02:18:22,028
However, the queue is so good.

4103
02:18:22,028 --> 02:18:23,088
Well, for a Tower of Terror.

4104
02:18:23,108 --> 02:18:23,488
Yes.

4105
02:18:23,848 --> 02:18:25,888
Yeah, so Tower of Terror, it has a different narrative.

4106
02:18:25,928 --> 02:18:26,808
It's not Twilight Zone.

4107
02:18:26,828 --> 02:18:28,048
It's not Guardians of the Galaxy.

4108
02:18:28,468 --> 02:18:30,808
It is a completely new narrative

4109
02:18:30,808 --> 02:18:33,148
about a character named Harrison Hightower.

4110
02:18:33,568 --> 02:18:37,668
And he is of course based on Imagineering legend, Joe Rhodey.

4111
02:18:37,668 --> 02:18:40,308
Getting there, I don't think officially working.

4112
02:18:40,308 --> 02:18:41,448
Not officially, I say it.

4113
02:18:41,568 --> 02:18:42,928
He's body of work, I think.

4114
02:18:43,028 --> 02:18:45,448
He's in his 60s, he's been working there forever.

4115
02:18:45,868 --> 02:18:46,488
I'll say he's a legend.

4116
02:18:46,488 --> 02:18:48,168
Oh, I just mean in terms of Disney hasn't done

4117
02:18:48,168 --> 02:18:50,068
the ceremony with the plaque and the window.

4118
02:18:50,068 --> 02:18:55,388
Oh, there's a literal ceremony where you are knighted?

4119
02:18:55,388 --> 02:18:56,448
Disney Legends, yeah.

4120
02:18:56,608 --> 02:18:57,348
Put a plaque.

4121
02:18:57,388 --> 02:18:57,788
Wow.

4122
02:18:57,968 --> 02:18:59,908
I walked through the Legends Courtyard

4123
02:18:59,908 --> 02:19:01,208
on the lot the other day.

4124
02:19:01,588 --> 02:19:04,148
Oh, so you mean like in very literal terms,

4125
02:19:04,308 --> 02:19:05,708
he's not yet been.

4126
02:19:05,708 --> 02:19:06,308
Deemed.

4127
02:19:06,408 --> 02:19:07,708
Yeah. Deemed a legend.

4128
02:19:07,868 --> 02:19:09,788
Yeah, he's not up there with like Tony Baxter

4129
02:19:09,788 --> 02:19:11,128
and Whoopi Goldberg.

4130
02:19:11,228 --> 02:19:12,248
But I'll throw him in there.

4131
02:19:12,268 --> 02:19:13,488
There's some oddballs in there.

4132
02:19:14,028 --> 02:19:15,788
Well, they all come from the range.

4133
02:19:15,968 --> 02:19:18,328
Like Ed Winn got in the same year Tony Baxter did.

4134
02:19:18,508 --> 02:19:19,088
Yeah.

4135
02:19:19,688 --> 02:19:22,628
It's like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame where.

4136
02:19:22,628 --> 02:19:23,868
You never know, yeah.

4137
02:19:23,928 --> 02:19:25,108
Some people don't get in right away.

4138
02:19:25,708 --> 02:19:28,008
It was very weird though that Walt insisted

4139
02:19:28,008 --> 02:19:30,728
the first one of these be Lenny Riefenstahl,

4140
02:19:30,808 --> 02:19:32,128
my favorite director.

4141
02:19:33,088 --> 02:19:34,728
It is weird, I agree with you.

4142
02:19:34,728 --> 02:19:35,308
It's weird.

4143
02:19:36,808 --> 02:19:40,568
So, Tower of Terror, Harrison Hightower, Hotel Hightower.

4144
02:19:41,208 --> 02:19:44,288
Now, I am forgotten, again, we're talking detail.

4145
02:19:44,308 --> 02:19:46,768
And this feels like roadie.

4146
02:19:47,108 --> 02:19:48,508
We'll have him on the show.

4147
02:19:48,968 --> 02:19:51,028
And I have mostly wanna talk to him about this.

4148
02:19:51,408 --> 02:19:51,588
Yeah.

4149
02:19:51,588 --> 02:19:52,528
He's done so many other great things.

4150
02:19:52,528 --> 02:19:52,988
So good.

4151
02:19:53,388 --> 02:19:55,068
But there's so much detail in this.

4152
02:19:55,428 --> 02:19:57,388
So we waited, we went in it twice.

4153
02:19:57,988 --> 02:19:59,568
Once fast pass, once not.

4154
02:19:59,708 --> 02:20:01,068
And we were walking, we were waiting outside

4155
02:20:01,068 --> 02:20:02,088
in the garden outside.

4156
02:20:02,368 --> 02:20:03,588
And I noticed one thing right away.

4157
02:20:03,708 --> 02:20:05,608
So his character is like a robber baron.

4158
02:20:05,648 --> 02:20:08,188
And he's a monster, really.

4159
02:20:09,248 --> 02:20:10,908
He goes into other cultures

4160
02:20:10,908 --> 02:20:15,528
and steals all of their most prized artifacts.

4161
02:20:15,908 --> 02:20:18,268
So yeah, there's painting, these immaculate paintings

4162
02:20:18,268 --> 02:20:19,288
of him stealing.

4163
02:20:19,288 --> 02:20:20,528
So fucking funny.

4164
02:20:20,668 --> 02:20:22,808
Stealing like the, I should find it here.

4165
02:20:22,828 --> 02:20:23,848
In every single painting,

4166
02:20:24,208 --> 02:20:27,048
it is him and his manservant

4167
02:20:27,048 --> 02:20:32,348
escaping from the native peoples of a culture.

4168
02:20:32,388 --> 02:20:33,248
Yes, and it's.

4169
02:20:34,668 --> 02:20:38,848
Carrying off with a prized artifact of their culture.

4170
02:20:39,128 --> 02:20:42,228
So like, it would be something like

4171
02:20:42,228 --> 02:20:44,428
one of the Easter Island heads or something.

4172
02:20:44,428 --> 02:20:45,988
Something comparable.

4173
02:20:46,268 --> 02:20:47,728
And there's paint, they're so,

4174
02:20:47,828 --> 02:20:49,908
the paintings are so amazing looking.

4175
02:20:49,928 --> 02:20:51,508
They're all like oil paintings.

4176
02:20:51,508 --> 02:20:53,228
Right, I don't know how they did it.

4177
02:20:53,228 --> 02:20:53,908
It's amazing.

4178
02:20:54,588 --> 02:20:55,768
Every single one.

4179
02:20:55,908 --> 02:20:59,188
There's one where it's him and his manservant.

4180
02:20:59,308 --> 02:20:59,828
Smelting.

4181
02:20:59,908 --> 02:21:00,768
Smelting.

4182
02:21:01,148 --> 02:21:01,348
Smelting.

4183
02:21:01,368 --> 02:21:01,968
It's so good.

4184
02:21:01,968 --> 02:21:03,728
He has a manservant and he's smelting.

4185
02:21:04,428 --> 02:21:07,268
Let's get the hashtag Jason for smelting.

4186
02:21:07,808 --> 02:21:10,968
But like escaping in a hot air balloon with smelting,

4187
02:21:11,188 --> 02:21:13,888
like I think like desperately trying to keep the artifact

4188
02:21:13,888 --> 02:21:15,088
inside the balloon.

4189
02:21:16,308 --> 02:21:18,548
Yeah, there's just, I have pictures of them.

4190
02:21:18,648 --> 02:21:19,088
Every time being chased.

4191
02:21:19,288 --> 02:21:20,308
It's so funny.

4192
02:21:20,628 --> 02:21:23,948
And that Easter Island head in a very tiny boat is so.

4193
02:21:23,948 --> 02:21:24,348
Yeah.

4194
02:21:24,448 --> 02:21:26,468
One of them isn't the Easter Island head.

4195
02:21:26,728 --> 02:21:26,928
It is.

4196
02:21:26,968 --> 02:21:27,288
It is.

4197
02:21:27,288 --> 02:21:28,308
You're right, yeah.

4198
02:21:28,468 --> 02:21:30,588
Okay, well sometimes my memory is bad

4199
02:21:30,588 --> 02:21:32,608
and then I think I've invented something.

4200
02:21:32,988 --> 02:21:36,128
Right, but there's like a maculite stained glass of him.

4201
02:21:36,328 --> 02:21:37,708
Yeah, it's so great.

4202
02:21:37,728 --> 02:21:39,728
There's this great portrait of him inside.

4203
02:21:39,728 --> 02:21:42,868
Everything is a monument to Harrison Hightower.

4204
02:21:42,888 --> 02:21:44,408
There's no monster.

4205
02:21:44,908 --> 02:21:47,808
They didn't have the context for the Twilight Zone

4206
02:21:47,808 --> 02:21:49,928
wasn't a big hit in Japan or something.

4207
02:21:50,128 --> 02:21:50,788
That makes sense.

4208
02:21:51,028 --> 02:21:52,888
So I also noticed in the line,

4209
02:21:53,248 --> 02:21:57,428
he has so many busty women's statues, like busty like.

4210
02:21:57,508 --> 02:22:00,068
It'll be like mythical creatures.

4211
02:22:00,788 --> 02:22:02,828
Kind of sphinxes and stuff like that

4212
02:22:02,828 --> 02:22:05,568
and they are all very well endowed.

4213
02:22:05,848 --> 02:22:07,048
It is very funny.

4214
02:22:07,348 --> 02:22:09,508
And he's just like paints this picture.

4215
02:22:10,048 --> 02:22:11,688
You know how horrible this,

4216
02:22:11,768 --> 02:22:13,408
I mean, it's funny because of how.

4217
02:22:13,468 --> 02:22:14,588
You're rooting against it.

4218
02:22:14,748 --> 02:22:17,248
Yeah, but it's also like real, but it's elevated.

4219
02:22:17,248 --> 02:22:19,608
Versions of him being real.

4220
02:22:19,628 --> 02:22:20,428
So funny.

4221
02:22:20,688 --> 02:22:22,288
Yeah, so like, and of course he dies,

4222
02:22:22,328 --> 02:22:24,108
he gets his comeuppance in the ride

4223
02:22:24,108 --> 02:22:25,848
because he's such an evil character.

4224
02:22:27,348 --> 02:22:27,848
So.

4225
02:22:28,048 --> 02:22:31,788
Yeah, because one of the things he steals is.

4226
02:22:32,068 --> 02:22:33,008
A tiki god.

4227
02:22:33,168 --> 02:22:33,568
Yeah.

4228
02:22:33,728 --> 02:22:35,808
A little tiki god from an African tribe.

4229
02:22:35,908 --> 02:22:37,108
He brings it back to the hotel.

4230
02:22:37,488 --> 02:22:39,748
And also what's great is that the whole narrative

4231
02:22:39,748 --> 02:22:43,268
of the ride is that the New York preservation society

4232
02:22:43,268 --> 02:22:47,508
has deemed this hotel like a site since the accident.

4233
02:22:48,248 --> 02:22:48,568
A historical site.

4234
02:22:48,568 --> 02:22:50,708
Thank you, a historical site since the accident

4235
02:22:50,708 --> 02:22:51,988
where Hightower was killed.

4236
02:22:52,268 --> 02:22:52,628
Okay.

4237
02:22:52,708 --> 02:22:55,568
So you're going in a thing that's been preserved.

4238
02:22:55,568 --> 02:22:57,408
As if you're going on tour.

4239
02:22:57,808 --> 02:22:57,928
Right.

4240
02:22:58,068 --> 02:22:59,628
A tour of the tower.

4241
02:22:59,968 --> 02:23:01,748
That's such a good justification.

4242
02:23:02,348 --> 02:23:03,228
It's so goddamn good.

4243
02:23:03,368 --> 02:23:05,028
I don't know if it's the best cue

4244
02:23:05,028 --> 02:23:06,748
and the best narrative of all rides.

4245
02:23:06,948 --> 02:23:09,388
I think the paintings to me make it.

4246
02:23:09,388 --> 02:23:09,848
It might take it.

4247
02:23:10,088 --> 02:23:12,528
Oh, but then, yeah, cause then it's awesome

4248
02:23:12,528 --> 02:23:14,808
when you get inside the place after the.

4249
02:23:14,808 --> 02:23:16,168
Yes, it's amazing when you get.

4250
02:23:16,368 --> 02:23:16,768
It's so good.

4251
02:23:16,928 --> 02:23:18,408
And I didn't mean to correct you there.

4252
02:23:18,548 --> 02:23:19,368
I was like, it's amazing.

4253
02:23:19,428 --> 02:23:20,528
No, yeah, it's incredible.

4254
02:23:21,228 --> 02:23:23,808
So yeah, you go through the line

4255
02:23:23,808 --> 02:23:25,508
and then I tried to take a picture

4256
02:23:25,508 --> 02:23:26,708
and someone yelled at me.

4257
02:23:26,868 --> 02:23:28,088
They're not supposed to do that.

4258
02:23:28,608 --> 02:23:28,908
I don't know why.

4259
02:23:28,908 --> 02:23:29,288
In the line?

4260
02:23:29,548 --> 02:23:32,548
Yeah, so I think you only got a couple pictures maybe.

4261
02:23:32,748 --> 02:23:33,628
So then the pre-show,

4262
02:23:33,768 --> 02:23:35,588
which is usually the Rod Serling pre-show

4263
02:23:35,588 --> 02:23:38,008
is in a big, big room

4264
02:23:38,008 --> 02:23:40,448
and the person says something in Japanese

4265
02:23:40,448 --> 02:23:41,368
and we're not sure.

4266
02:23:41,408 --> 02:23:42,528
Yeah, exactly, his office.

4267
02:23:42,928 --> 02:23:45,148
And then there's a big portrait of him

4268
02:23:45,148 --> 02:23:48,288
and they kind of tell you his story through this portrait.

4269
02:23:48,308 --> 02:23:49,388
In very reverent tones.

4270
02:23:49,528 --> 02:23:52,548
They were like, oh, the amazing Mr. Hightower.

4271
02:23:52,628 --> 02:23:56,308
Practically our hero, our wonderful

4272
02:23:56,308 --> 02:23:59,628
New York legend benefactor,

4273
02:24:00,328 --> 02:24:03,568
philanthropist kind of a vibe.

4274
02:24:04,648 --> 02:24:06,428
Yeah, it's very funny.

4275
02:24:06,768 --> 02:24:11,048
That's funny and self and very self-aware.

4276
02:24:11,568 --> 02:24:16,388
If you know that Joe Rodie as a person travels the world

4277
02:24:16,388 --> 02:24:18,188
to do research for these rides.

4278
02:24:18,428 --> 02:24:20,588
And he's certainly not a plunderer or anything.

4279
02:24:20,848 --> 02:24:21,728
No, I mean that's what's.

4280
02:24:21,928 --> 02:24:23,168
He's like, yeah.

4281
02:24:23,288 --> 02:24:25,988
But it's funny to see the polar opposite of him

4282
02:24:25,988 --> 02:24:26,888
in the fictional character.

4283
02:24:26,888 --> 02:24:29,428
Yeah, taking that and lampooning him into a monster.

4284
02:24:29,688 --> 02:24:30,008
Yeah.

4285
02:24:30,088 --> 02:24:33,608
I'm sure that was everyone was enjoying turning Joe Rodie,

4286
02:24:33,608 --> 02:24:34,948
who's like very much a man who like,

4287
02:24:35,108 --> 02:24:36,728
I wanna go live with indigenous people

4288
02:24:36,728 --> 02:24:37,868
and I wanna learn about their culture

4289
02:24:37,868 --> 02:24:39,408
and I've adopted their culture.

4290
02:24:40,128 --> 02:24:41,608
Like turning him into just the biggest,

4291
02:24:42,368 --> 02:24:44,748
crazy, horrible capitalist monster

4292
02:24:44,748 --> 02:24:46,728
who like desecrates culture.

4293
02:24:47,428 --> 02:24:48,108
It's very, it is,

4294
02:24:48,188 --> 02:24:49,828
I mean, I'm sure they all thought that was fun.

4295
02:24:49,828 --> 02:24:55,248
And it's sort of like the like employees on Tower of Terror,

4296
02:24:55,408 --> 02:24:57,848
their bit is to be like very spooky and ominous

4297
02:24:57,848 --> 02:25:00,308
if they're really committing to working the ride.

4298
02:25:00,728 --> 02:25:01,488
And here it was like,

4299
02:25:01,548 --> 02:25:04,728
they're committed to respecting Harrison Hightower

4300
02:25:04,728 --> 02:25:05,368
as the bit.

4301
02:25:05,688 --> 02:25:06,608
It's so funny.

4302
02:25:06,948 --> 02:25:07,568
It's so great.

4303
02:25:07,728 --> 02:25:08,488
And then the pre-show,

4304
02:25:08,728 --> 02:25:10,728
so there's the tiki god is in the room.

4305
02:25:10,828 --> 02:25:12,908
They show this is the god that,

4306
02:25:14,648 --> 02:25:16,988
was here the night that Harrison died or whatever.

4307
02:25:17,308 --> 02:25:18,428
And then the tiki god.

4308
02:25:18,428 --> 02:25:22,008
Well, the story is that,

4309
02:25:22,008 --> 02:25:27,088
so what happened the night that he was like killed

4310
02:25:27,088 --> 02:25:29,828
is that he was having,

4311
02:25:29,968 --> 02:25:32,308
what was it like a New Year's Eve party or something?

4312
02:25:32,428 --> 02:25:32,948
Yeah, something like that.

4313
02:25:33,108 --> 02:25:34,848
And a bunch of people were there

4314
02:25:34,848 --> 02:25:38,328
and he put his cigar out on the tiki god.

4315
02:25:38,508 --> 02:25:40,808
Yes, and the thing was it got angry

4316
02:25:40,808 --> 02:25:43,728
and killed him in the elevator shaft.

4317
02:25:43,748 --> 02:25:45,648
And trapped him in like another dimension

4318
02:25:45,648 --> 02:25:47,148
of the elevator shaft.

4319
02:25:47,388 --> 02:25:50,268
Yes, so then the god comes to life in the pre-show,

4320
02:25:50,268 --> 02:25:51,648
threatens all of us.

4321
02:25:52,168 --> 02:25:56,268
And at that point after whatever its evil smile appears,

4322
02:25:56,788 --> 02:25:58,668
the thing disappears.

4323
02:25:58,908 --> 02:26:00,448
It fully disappears like magic.

4324
02:26:00,448 --> 02:26:02,208
It disappears, we don't know how it happened.

4325
02:26:02,248 --> 02:26:03,568
We went up to it and we're like,

4326
02:26:03,768 --> 02:26:04,388
it's not there.

4327
02:26:04,548 --> 02:26:05,868
It must've been a projection I guess.

4328
02:26:05,868 --> 02:26:07,148
I think I gasped.

4329
02:26:07,388 --> 02:26:08,348
Yes, you did gasp.

4330
02:26:08,588 --> 02:26:10,588
This would be in like the study.

4331
02:26:10,868 --> 02:26:12,328
This would be in the pre-show anyway.

4332
02:26:12,348 --> 02:26:13,908
Yeah, but it's three times the size of the study

4333
02:26:13,908 --> 02:26:15,588
like in the normal Tower of Terror.

4334
02:26:15,588 --> 02:26:19,968
They put on a recording of maybe Harrison Hightower

4335
02:26:19,968 --> 02:26:24,168
or maybe a tour guide explaining what happened that night.

4336
02:26:24,428 --> 02:26:27,648
And then Harrison Hightower's ghost

4337
02:26:27,648 --> 02:26:30,588
emerges from the painting

4338
02:26:30,588 --> 02:26:32,868
and is giving a warning about everything.

4339
02:26:32,888 --> 02:26:34,728
And that's when the tiki god wakes up.

4340
02:26:35,148 --> 02:26:35,988
It is so great.

4341
02:26:36,048 --> 02:26:37,568
And then you go into the next room.

4342
02:26:37,768 --> 02:26:39,308
Is tiki god the right way to put it

4343
02:26:39,308 --> 02:26:40,888
if it's from an African culture?

4344
02:26:42,228 --> 02:26:42,848
That's a good question.

4345
02:26:43,108 --> 02:26:44,568
A totem or a talisman.

4346
02:26:45,088 --> 02:26:46,908
I read tiki though on websites.

4347
02:26:46,908 --> 02:26:47,508
So who knows?

4348
02:26:47,648 --> 02:26:48,308
They could all be wrong.

4349
02:26:48,568 --> 02:26:50,668
Maybe it's not from an African culture then.

4350
02:26:50,688 --> 02:26:51,668
Oh, I don't know.

4351
02:26:51,808 --> 02:26:54,348
I think we'll look into it.

4352
02:26:55,468 --> 02:26:57,088
So then the next in the loading area,

4353
02:26:57,348 --> 02:26:59,248
every different elevator loading shaft

4354
02:26:59,248 --> 02:27:01,708
is a different sort of collection of stuff he's got.

4355
02:27:02,308 --> 02:27:03,568
In the big area there's like-

4356
02:27:03,568 --> 02:27:04,408
There's so many files.

4357
02:27:04,548 --> 02:27:05,388
There's so many files.

4358
02:27:05,408 --> 02:27:06,248
So many little drawers.

4359
02:27:06,368 --> 02:27:08,928
There's just a room full of like rugs.

4360
02:27:09,288 --> 02:27:10,528
One of the elevator shafts,

4361
02:27:10,528 --> 02:27:12,948
like you walk in and it's just all these rugs he's taken.

4362
02:27:13,268 --> 02:27:17,408
And it's just, and there's also little hints of the god.

4363
02:27:17,928 --> 02:27:20,948
Like his evil eyes appear in places

4364
02:27:20,948 --> 02:27:22,148
when you're in the loading zone.

4365
02:27:22,308 --> 02:27:24,288
And it's so big and immaculate.

4366
02:27:24,548 --> 02:27:28,268
And all the drawers have a bunch of jokes on them too

4367
02:27:28,268 --> 02:27:32,048
of like things he's stolen and put into a drawer

4368
02:27:32,048 --> 02:27:33,788
in this huge storage hanger.

4369
02:27:34,028 --> 02:27:35,508
It is unbelievable.

4370
02:27:36,068 --> 02:27:38,348
And then the ride is really, it's the exact same ride.

4371
02:27:38,448 --> 02:27:39,228
It's the Florida version.

4372
02:27:39,608 --> 02:27:41,168
Or it's, excuse me, the California version

4373
02:27:41,168 --> 02:27:42,528
of Tower of Terror, not the Florida.

4374
02:27:42,528 --> 02:27:45,448
Yeah, so you don't like move forward through a room.

4375
02:27:45,708 --> 02:27:46,528
And like you see like-

4376
02:27:46,528 --> 02:27:47,648
Could you imagine if you did?

4377
02:27:47,908 --> 02:27:48,448
Oh my God, it'd be great.

4378
02:27:48,448 --> 02:27:49,268
I don't know why they didn't do it.

4379
02:27:49,288 --> 02:27:50,028
I wish they had done that.

4380
02:27:50,028 --> 02:27:52,108
It's crazy that that's the one-

4381
02:27:52,108 --> 02:27:53,908
Florida is definitely the superior.

4382
02:27:53,908 --> 02:27:54,648
Oh sure.

4383
02:27:55,328 --> 02:27:58,028
The one disappointing thing about the ride

4384
02:27:58,028 --> 02:28:00,368
is then it's the short version of Tower of Terror.

4385
02:28:00,988 --> 02:28:01,848
So like you see the cool,

4386
02:28:01,948 --> 02:28:04,808
like you see him putting the cigar out on the god

4387
02:28:04,808 --> 02:28:07,548
and then you see him getting trapped and then you drop.

4388
02:28:08,408 --> 02:28:08,608
But-

4389
02:28:08,608 --> 02:28:10,748
Not as many drops and not as intense.

4390
02:28:10,808 --> 02:28:11,388
Not as intense.

4391
02:28:11,388 --> 02:28:14,028
I think the main thing that jumped out at me

4392
02:28:14,028 --> 02:28:17,408
was that when you drop, there's not the then intense

4393
02:28:17,408 --> 02:28:19,108
like- Zoom back up.

4394
02:28:19,328 --> 02:28:20,088
Zooming back up.

4395
02:28:20,148 --> 02:28:20,548
Right.

4396
02:28:20,828 --> 02:28:23,108
It's just dropping and then you lift again

4397
02:28:23,108 --> 02:28:25,548
and then dropping and you lift again instead of,

4398
02:28:25,848 --> 02:28:31,088
cause in California, it's almost like you feel weightless

4399
02:28:31,088 --> 02:28:33,948
and you can't tell which direction you're headed

4400
02:28:33,948 --> 02:28:34,928
for a second even.

4401
02:28:35,048 --> 02:28:36,528
You don't, or at least personally,

4402
02:28:36,548 --> 02:28:39,108
I don't know if I'm going down or up for a second.

4403
02:28:39,108 --> 02:28:39,628
Yeah.

4404
02:28:39,848 --> 02:28:40,368
Yeah.

4405
02:28:40,208 --> 02:28:41,408
Which is very exciting.

4406
02:28:41,668 --> 02:28:44,188
So that was just the only let down is like

4407
02:28:44,188 --> 02:28:46,388
expecting more visceral thrills

4408
02:28:46,388 --> 02:28:47,968
and not quite getting them.

4409
02:28:48,088 --> 02:28:50,608
Obviously the fourth dimension room would be extra amazing

4410
02:28:50,608 --> 02:28:51,728
like in Florida, but whatever.

4411
02:28:52,608 --> 02:28:53,288
Just these, so we're like,

4412
02:28:53,288 --> 02:28:54,768
oh, that felt like a minute too short.

4413
02:28:55,308 --> 02:28:57,288
And then the other disappointing thing is that

4414
02:28:57,288 --> 02:29:01,868
they do not have any Harrison Hightower dolls or toys.

4415
02:29:02,008 --> 02:29:03,948
There's a tiny key chain that I don't think

4416
02:29:03,948 --> 02:29:06,808
is designed particularly well that has him on it.

4417
02:29:07,068 --> 02:29:08,808
But I, we were like, again, high.

4418
02:29:10,668 --> 02:29:12,548
Three items of the souvenirs,

4419
02:29:12,548 --> 02:29:16,788
but mostly you get out and it's all just random park stuff.

4420
02:29:16,808 --> 02:29:17,888
Like they should have prints.

4421
02:29:17,888 --> 02:29:18,888
There should have been so much.

4422
02:29:19,128 --> 02:29:21,568
Cause like it, California Adventure,

4423
02:29:22,148 --> 02:29:25,388
there is so much tower merch.

4424
02:29:25,588 --> 02:29:26,068
Yeah.

4425
02:29:26,108 --> 02:29:26,628
Yeah.

4426
02:29:26,888 --> 02:29:30,448
So, so like just a print of him of like getting,

4427
02:29:30,548 --> 02:29:31,408
stealing the stone head.

4428
02:29:31,428 --> 02:29:32,728
Oh God, that would have been great.

4429
02:29:32,788 --> 02:29:33,608
Something like that.

4430
02:29:33,868 --> 02:29:33,888
Yeah.

4431
02:29:33,928 --> 02:29:35,068
Prints of the paintings.

4432
02:29:35,328 --> 02:29:36,888
But I, they, maybe they have them somewhere else,

4433
02:29:36,888 --> 02:29:38,208
but they did not have them in the gift shop.

4434
02:29:38,208 --> 02:29:40,168
So we're like, ah man, bummed about that.

4435
02:29:40,808 --> 02:29:42,148
Like bummed ride specific merch.

4436
02:29:42,428 --> 02:29:45,188
Can somebody do fan art of Harrison Hightower

4437
02:29:45,188 --> 02:29:47,168
with Jason as smelding?

4438
02:29:47,688 --> 02:29:48,968
Oh, yes.

4439
02:29:49,108 --> 02:29:49,808
Hell yeah.

4440
02:29:49,968 --> 02:29:50,848
That's a great idea.

4441
02:29:51,328 --> 02:29:53,128
We'll post the photo you, we want you to copy

4442
02:29:53,128 --> 02:29:54,908
and change smelding into Jason.

4443
02:29:54,908 --> 02:29:55,728
So funny.

4444
02:29:56,088 --> 02:29:57,708
Yeah, smelding, what a wonderful name.

4445
02:29:57,828 --> 02:29:59,788
And then the last thing I'll say about it

4446
02:29:59,788 --> 02:30:01,548
is that Harrison Hightower,

4447
02:30:01,708 --> 02:30:03,288
a member of the Adventurers Club,

4448
02:30:03,808 --> 02:30:04,788
a member of C.

4449
02:30:05,088 --> 02:30:05,908
A member of C. Society.

4450
02:30:05,908 --> 02:30:07,148
Oh yeah, a member of C.

4451
02:30:07,308 --> 02:30:08,608
Explorers and Adventurers, yeah.

4452
02:30:08,828 --> 02:30:09,588
And like, just we were like,

4453
02:30:09,608 --> 02:30:13,468
well they've created his whole TV show or movie right here.

4454
02:30:13,588 --> 02:30:14,048
Yeah.

4455
02:30:14,068 --> 02:30:14,368
Amazing.

4456
02:30:14,368 --> 02:30:15,808
He's the perfect villain.

4457
02:30:17,788 --> 02:30:22,388
Like mid 20th century version of The Blacklist

4458
02:30:22,388 --> 02:30:23,068
Yes.

4459
02:30:23,348 --> 02:30:25,628
With Harrison Hightower instead of Red Reddington.

4460
02:30:25,708 --> 02:30:27,608
And being immersed in that just makes it all

4461
02:30:27,608 --> 02:30:30,108
the more disappointing that the Adventurers Club is gone.

4462
02:30:30,468 --> 02:30:30,908
Yeah.

4463
02:30:31,208 --> 02:30:31,468
Yeah.

4464
02:30:31,928 --> 02:30:32,368
So, you know what I mean?

4465
02:30:32,368 --> 02:30:33,048
You don't have to tell me twice.

4466
02:30:33,408 --> 02:30:34,508
So yeah, going in there and-

4467
02:30:34,508 --> 02:30:36,388
Mike has told me about a lot of it.

4468
02:30:36,388 --> 02:30:38,708
There's a guest book in the lobby

4469
02:30:38,708 --> 02:30:41,588
that has Rockefeller signed in and stuff.

4470
02:30:42,208 --> 02:30:42,988
That's great.

4471
02:30:43,268 --> 02:30:44,428
Industrialists.

4472
02:30:44,708 --> 02:30:46,748
And obviously we've rushed through so much of this,

4473
02:30:47,248 --> 02:30:50,208
but barely scratched the surface on the details

4474
02:30:50,208 --> 02:30:52,308
of just this ride and other stuff.

4475
02:30:53,048 --> 02:30:53,908
This is just a little thing.

4476
02:30:53,968 --> 02:30:55,288
I don't think it really came up

4477
02:30:55,288 --> 02:30:56,588
and I don't think we talked about it,

4478
02:30:56,588 --> 02:31:00,348
but in terms of, we talked about the food stuff

4479
02:31:00,348 --> 02:31:02,248
and that there wasn't a lot of culture shock.

4480
02:31:02,768 --> 02:31:05,948
What did you guys do for your phones when you went?

4481
02:31:05,948 --> 02:31:09,968
Because I have not traveled internationally since-

4482
02:31:09,968 --> 02:31:11,828
Mike doesn't have to do anything.

4483
02:31:11,968 --> 02:31:16,748
I have AT&T and you can turn on this function

4484
02:31:16,748 --> 02:31:20,428
that is international traveling basically.

4485
02:31:20,628 --> 02:31:23,748
And you pay $10 a day if you use it

4486
02:31:23,748 --> 02:31:25,188
and you don't pay anything if you don't.

4487
02:31:25,248 --> 02:31:28,488
But obviously I'm using tons of data every single time.

4488
02:31:28,528 --> 02:31:31,048
So my phone bill was very expensive.

4489
02:31:31,388 --> 02:31:34,508
But if you just used wifi,

4490
02:31:34,508 --> 02:31:38,888
because I know you can buy wireless routers

4491
02:31:38,888 --> 02:31:42,288
you can clip on your belt and just connect to.

4492
02:31:42,948 --> 02:31:46,628
I like that on this two and a half hour episode on air,

4493
02:31:46,888 --> 02:31:48,548
you have decided to close it out.

4494
02:31:48,828 --> 02:31:50,308
I didn't mean to close it out.

4495
02:31:50,388 --> 02:31:50,908
I was going to ask-

4496
02:31:50,908 --> 02:31:52,228
We don't have to close it out

4497
02:31:52,228 --> 02:31:53,588
without thinking of something else.

4498
02:31:53,908 --> 02:31:57,768
Because then I was gonna ask anything else to wrap up.

4499
02:31:57,768 --> 02:32:01,148
But it hadn't come up and there might be listeners

4500
02:32:01,148 --> 02:32:03,608
who are thinking about traveling internationally.

4501
02:32:03,828 --> 02:32:06,128
I'm punching and I'm being an asshole, I'm sorry.

4502
02:32:06,128 --> 02:32:07,068
No, it's fine.

4503
02:32:07,068 --> 02:32:09,388
We've recorded an episode before that.

4504
02:32:09,388 --> 02:32:10,628
We've been here a while.

4505
02:32:10,628 --> 02:32:10,728
I know, I feel crazy.

4506
02:32:10,968 --> 02:32:12,708
And Lindsay and I are gonna go around Disneyland now.

4507
02:32:12,708 --> 02:32:13,488
You're going down to Disneyland.

4508
02:32:13,508 --> 02:32:13,628
And I'm getting antsy.

4509
02:32:13,628 --> 02:32:16,308
And I really thought this was gonna happen earlier too.

4510
02:32:16,308 --> 02:32:18,328
How long have we been talking?

4511
02:32:18,448 --> 02:32:19,508
Two and a half hours.

4512
02:32:19,788 --> 02:32:20,188
Okay.

4513
02:32:20,528 --> 02:32:23,608
Well, I say that as though I'm fucking surprised.

4514
02:32:23,668 --> 02:32:25,188
You guys talk about this nonstop.

4515
02:32:25,448 --> 02:32:27,528
You guys have gone through two episodes of this

4516
02:32:27,528 --> 02:32:30,288
and then we went out to dinner at IKEA

4517
02:32:30,288 --> 02:32:33,168
which is a very funny thing to say now that I say it.

4518
02:32:33,168 --> 02:32:37,008
And you guys talked about Disney stuff the whole time then.

4519
02:32:37,008 --> 02:32:38,208
No, that's not fair.

4520
02:32:38,288 --> 02:32:40,168
That is when Mike finally got me to sign up

4521
02:32:40,168 --> 02:32:41,068
for one of these Chase cards.

4522
02:32:41,068 --> 02:32:44,628
Oh yes, you also talked about that Chase rewards trifecta.

4523
02:32:45,268 --> 02:32:47,008
Chase points trifecta?

4524
02:32:47,148 --> 02:32:47,448
Chase cards trifecta?

4525
02:32:47,448 --> 02:32:48,988
No, no, no, just Chase trifecta.

4526
02:32:48,988 --> 02:32:50,588
I just got that referred to the cards.

4527
02:32:50,948 --> 02:32:51,868
I did my little telling.

4528
02:32:51,868 --> 02:32:53,028
Yeah, this is your other.

4529
02:32:53,968 --> 02:32:58,588
Mike loves comic books, wrestling, Disney,

4530
02:32:59,268 --> 02:33:02,308
and Chase rewards, and haunts.

4531
02:33:02,628 --> 02:33:04,508
Yeah, but we're old now.

4532
02:33:04,508 --> 02:33:06,088
So we talk about like,

4533
02:33:06,088 --> 02:33:08,588
oh, the comics aren't as good as they used to be.

4534
02:33:08,768 --> 02:33:09,408
Well, that's true.

4535
02:33:09,428 --> 02:33:10,868
Oh, they're all the writers we like.

4536
02:33:10,888 --> 02:33:12,848
Chase trifecta isn't as good as it was in my day.

4537
02:33:12,848 --> 02:33:15,448
TV money and movie money, fair enough.

4538
02:33:16,908 --> 02:33:18,648
Well, I mean, closing thoughts.

4539
02:33:18,828 --> 02:33:21,708
Yeah, I've said mostly what I wanted to say.

4540
02:33:21,728 --> 02:33:23,328
I had some bullet points in my head.

4541
02:33:24,188 --> 02:33:27,748
So if you can afford it,

4542
02:33:28,088 --> 02:33:29,848
certainly try to do three days.

4543
02:33:30,328 --> 02:33:31,248
Certainly we can.

4544
02:33:31,568 --> 02:33:32,048
But.

4545
02:33:32,228 --> 02:33:33,668
Yeah, drop your monocle.

4546
02:33:34,008 --> 02:33:35,828
And also your second monocle.

4547
02:33:36,088 --> 02:33:37,108
And then when I went to pick it up,

4548
02:33:37,548 --> 02:33:39,588
my top hat fell off my head.

4549
02:33:39,768 --> 02:33:40,188
This is so embarrassing.

4550
02:33:41,688 --> 02:33:43,968
So yeah, so I would say like three days,

4551
02:33:44,228 --> 02:33:45,008
you could do it.

4552
02:33:45,008 --> 02:33:46,368
You're just gonna have to hustle.

4553
02:33:46,828 --> 02:33:47,108
Yeah.

4554
02:33:47,348 --> 02:33:49,408
Four days is a lot more comfortable.

4555
02:33:49,588 --> 02:33:51,448
Yeah, it really depends on how,

4556
02:33:51,968 --> 02:33:53,868
like if you are the type of person

4557
02:33:53,868 --> 02:33:56,748
who wants to immerse themselves in the experience,

4558
02:33:57,108 --> 02:33:59,488
rather than go to an amusement park for rides.

4559
02:33:59,488 --> 02:34:03,268
If you wanna do, we had Jason Wollner's did a day,

4560
02:34:03,328 --> 02:34:05,608
and I think he had to buy then two single day passes.

4561
02:34:05,688 --> 02:34:06,688
We didn't actually ask him.

4562
02:34:06,708 --> 02:34:08,188
Oh yeah, we should ask him about that.

4563
02:34:08,188 --> 02:34:10,388
Two single day passes, and then I think he just hit,

4564
02:34:10,688 --> 02:34:11,928
he started very early,

4565
02:34:12,348 --> 02:34:14,908
hit all the big rides that they don't have here.

4566
02:34:14,948 --> 02:34:16,888
And that's for sure a thing you can do.

4567
02:34:17,088 --> 02:34:19,948
I guess that's a valid life choice.

4568
02:34:19,988 --> 02:34:20,428
Sure.

4569
02:34:21,048 --> 02:34:22,088
That was all I was gonna say.

4570
02:34:22,308 --> 02:34:23,448
If you actually, yes.

4571
02:34:23,688 --> 02:34:26,368
If you're there and you're like a nerd like us,

4572
02:34:26,668 --> 02:34:27,808
three days at minimum,

4573
02:34:27,808 --> 02:34:29,748
but four is a nice comfortable time

4574
02:34:29,748 --> 02:34:31,348
to really absorb it and take it all in.

4575
02:34:31,548 --> 02:34:32,348
But I would do five.

4576
02:34:32,788 --> 02:34:33,688
But five would be great.

4577
02:34:33,808 --> 02:34:36,928
Like the record show, you guys entered the turnstiles

4578
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:38,988
in four days in a row.

4579
02:34:39,208 --> 02:34:40,888
You had to get to the airport on that last day.

4580
02:34:41,308 --> 02:34:41,428
Yes.

4581
02:34:41,428 --> 02:34:43,728
But technically you were there four days, so I won.

4582
02:34:43,948 --> 02:34:45,468
I won, me and Tony won.

4583
02:34:45,468 --> 02:34:46,148
Well that's a good point.

4584
02:34:46,248 --> 02:34:47,628
Jason does win, yeah.

4585
02:34:47,648 --> 02:34:50,048
Jason and Tony win, two best friends.

4586
02:34:51,248 --> 02:34:54,828
All right, look, we're gonna do a lot of single episodes

4587
02:34:54,828 --> 02:34:56,028
about all these things.

4588
02:34:56,628 --> 02:34:59,208
We can't possibly get to all the details.

4589
02:34:59,708 --> 02:35:01,388
Well, to close it out personally,

4590
02:35:01,768 --> 02:35:06,228
my final thoughts are I want five days of Disney,

4591
02:35:06,628 --> 02:35:09,728
I want five days of Tokyo on its own.

4592
02:35:10,288 --> 02:35:11,208
Oh yeah, of course.

4593
02:35:11,228 --> 02:35:13,188
And I wanna go back as soon as possible

4594
02:35:13,188 --> 02:35:14,708
and I loved the country.

4595
02:35:15,668 --> 02:35:15,988
Yeah, I know.

4596
02:35:15,988 --> 02:35:16,368
Japan was awesome.

4597
02:35:16,368 --> 02:35:17,508
Japan is, so I-

4598
02:35:17,508 --> 02:35:20,288
And you haven't even been to Osaka or like

4599
02:35:20,288 --> 02:35:22,788
the million other neighborhoods in Tokyo?

4600
02:35:23,568 --> 02:35:24,848
We sped through it.

4601
02:35:24,848 --> 02:35:25,868
That was kind of the thing is

4602
02:35:25,868 --> 02:35:27,328
we were having to speed through Tokyo

4603
02:35:27,328 --> 02:35:29,648
like somebody would have to speed through the parks

4604
02:35:29,648 --> 02:35:30,808
with three days.

4605
02:35:31,028 --> 02:35:34,108
Yeah, no, Tokyo was great and so familiar

4606
02:35:34,108 --> 02:35:38,148
and I was nostalgic for it as I was there of like, oh.

4607
02:35:38,148 --> 02:35:39,728
Yeah, just thinking about not being there.

4608
02:35:39,728 --> 02:35:42,168
Right, thinking about not being there, I was already sad.

4609
02:35:42,648 --> 02:35:45,268
And yeah, it's in the regular rotation hopefully

4610
02:35:45,268 --> 02:35:47,668
if we can afford it.

4611
02:35:47,928 --> 02:35:48,488
Pinky's up.

4612
02:35:48,588 --> 02:35:49,428
Pinky's up.

4613
02:35:49,828 --> 02:35:52,648
It's in the rotation if we can afford to go next month,

4614
02:35:52,768 --> 02:35:54,728
but like I'm having to cut that cost.

4615
02:35:54,888 --> 02:35:56,588
Can you wait that long?

4616
02:35:56,688 --> 02:35:57,488
So. Not next week?

4617
02:35:57,888 --> 02:36:00,168
Well, if I weren't unemployed,

4618
02:36:00,228 --> 02:36:01,628
I wouldn't have to wait that long.

4619
02:36:02,148 --> 02:36:02,928
Lindsay is unemployed.

4620
02:36:03,808 --> 02:36:04,868
So yeah, so it's great.

4621
02:36:04,868 --> 02:36:06,508
Go to Tokyo if you can do it.

4622
02:36:07,348 --> 02:36:10,988
And yeah, well, we're gonna do all this stuff separately

4623
02:36:10,988 --> 02:36:13,328
and waste a lot more of your time

4624
02:36:13,328 --> 02:36:16,528
only focusing on very small details

4625
02:36:16,528 --> 02:36:18,328
of all of this stuff we just talked about.

4626
02:36:19,088 --> 02:36:20,608
Jason. I will say it.

4627
02:36:20,608 --> 02:36:21,708
That I was gonna say, please.

4628
02:36:21,808 --> 02:36:25,428
And I remembered that he said it about himself,

4629
02:36:25,428 --> 02:36:26,768
but not about you.

4630
02:36:26,848 --> 02:36:27,548
Lindsay K. Tai.

4631
02:36:27,648 --> 02:36:29,288
You survived podcast the ride.

4632
02:36:29,288 --> 02:36:29,928
Yeah, I did.

4633
02:36:30,248 --> 02:36:31,288
Thank you.

4634
02:36:31,388 --> 02:36:32,088
Thanks so much.

4635
02:36:32,208 --> 02:36:32,428
How about some plugs?

4636
02:36:32,728 --> 02:36:34,528
Thank you for having me in my living room.

4637
02:36:34,608 --> 02:36:37,508
Thank you for having us in your living room constantly.

4638
02:36:37,948 --> 02:36:40,528
Truly is never like something I'm annoyed by.

4639
02:36:40,728 --> 02:36:41,308
Oh, good.

4640
02:36:41,368 --> 02:36:44,708
And sorry if I was too loud after hell at the moon.

4641
02:36:44,868 --> 02:36:45,708
No, it's fine.

4642
02:36:45,708 --> 02:36:47,888
It's an experience you've never had before

4643
02:36:47,888 --> 02:36:48,648
in the 10 years.

4644
02:36:48,768 --> 02:36:49,288
It's true.

4645
02:36:49,508 --> 02:36:50,368
I decided.

4646
02:36:50,368 --> 02:36:53,068
I decided not to accompany.

4647
02:36:54,268 --> 02:36:55,508
That's all right.

4648
02:36:55,808 --> 02:36:56,628
Right the correct choice.

4649
02:36:56,628 --> 02:36:56,968
Fair enough.

4650
02:36:57,428 --> 02:36:57,588
Yeah.

4651
02:36:57,588 --> 02:36:59,048
Plug something, plug whatever you want.

4652
02:36:59,068 --> 02:36:59,988
I'll plug all the things.

4653
02:37:00,308 --> 02:37:04,128
I host a podcast, actually I host two podcasts

4654
02:37:04,128 --> 02:37:06,168
also on the Forever Dog Network.

4655
02:37:06,568 --> 02:37:07,688
One is Teen Creeps.

4656
02:37:07,768 --> 02:37:11,028
We review YA Pulp Fiction like Christopher Pike,

4657
02:37:11,208 --> 02:37:15,188
Arl Stein, et cetera, and Public Domain Theater

4658
02:37:15,188 --> 02:37:19,208
where we read aloud a story from the public domain

4659
02:37:19,208 --> 02:37:22,648
because they're free and interrupt and comment

4660
02:37:22,648 --> 02:37:25,508
throughout kind of like Mystery Science Theater 3000 style.

4661
02:37:25,948 --> 02:37:29,168
And I write on the Cartoon Infinity Train

4662
02:37:29,168 --> 02:37:32,648
which will premiere on Cartoon Network in 2019.

4663
02:37:32,848 --> 02:37:33,508
Sometimes.

4664
02:37:33,688 --> 02:37:34,808
All very cool stuff.

4665
02:37:34,888 --> 02:37:36,028
Check all of it out.

4666
02:37:37,348 --> 02:37:38,828
Yeah, I mean, I don't know how to,

4667
02:37:39,008 --> 02:37:41,128
does there a Twitter for Infinity Train yet or no?

4668
02:37:41,768 --> 02:37:42,848
Just Cartoon Networks.

4669
02:37:42,848 --> 02:37:44,668
Follow Cartoon Network and they'll let you know.

4670
02:37:45,588 --> 02:37:47,648
Or follow Lindsey or I'll retweet something.

4671
02:37:47,648 --> 02:37:48,648
That's easy enough.

4672
02:37:48,648 --> 02:37:50,768
Oh, what's your name on Twitter?

4673
02:37:50,928 --> 02:37:52,128
Oh, Lindsey Kata.

4674
02:37:52,128 --> 02:37:56,888
Just L-I-N-T-S-A-Y K-A-T-A-I.

4675
02:37:56,928 --> 02:37:59,808
What was the thing I was gonna say?

4676
02:37:59,868 --> 02:38:00,348
I don't know.

4677
02:38:00,488 --> 02:38:04,508
Oh, if you want to watch the pilot for Infinity Train,

4678
02:38:04,688 --> 02:38:06,908
just go to YouTube and type Infinity Train

4679
02:38:06,908 --> 02:38:09,208
and you can see the short that was made

4680
02:38:09,208 --> 02:38:10,808
that got it greenlit.

4681
02:38:10,948 --> 02:38:11,868
Yeah, very cool.

4682
02:38:12,068 --> 02:38:12,228
Oh, it's delightful.

4683
02:38:12,368 --> 02:38:13,108
Four million views.

4684
02:38:13,688 --> 02:38:13,948
Wow.

4685
02:38:13,948 --> 02:38:14,668
Yeah, very popular.

4686
02:38:14,788 --> 02:38:16,008
It's gonna be the hottest show.

4687
02:38:16,008 --> 02:38:18,048
There's already a Reddit thread.

4688
02:38:18,528 --> 02:38:20,028
Oh yeah, and people like point,

4689
02:38:20,408 --> 02:38:22,248
like figure out you were a writer and stuff.

4690
02:38:22,728 --> 02:38:22,948
Yeah.

4691
02:38:22,948 --> 02:38:24,068
People are nervous.

4692
02:38:24,228 --> 02:38:25,468
Yeah, really paying attention.

4693
02:38:25,848 --> 02:38:29,388
And is it on, is there like, is it on Tumblr?

4694
02:38:29,608 --> 02:38:31,468
Like have people been drawing stuff

4695
02:38:31,468 --> 02:38:32,668
or like speculating about it on Tumblr?

4696
02:38:32,668 --> 02:38:34,108
Oh yeah, there's a ton of fan art.

4697
02:38:34,168 --> 02:38:36,648
There's people speculating about all the characters,

4698
02:38:36,728 --> 02:38:39,488
what's gonna happen on the show, what the train is.

4699
02:38:40,248 --> 02:38:41,288
I mean, that's awesome.

4700
02:38:41,288 --> 02:38:44,008
It's about a girl who finds herself on a mystical train

4701
02:38:44,008 --> 02:38:45,468
with an endless number of cars

4702
02:38:45,468 --> 02:38:46,988
and she has to figure out a way home.

4703
02:38:47,768 --> 02:38:48,268
Yeah, it's great.

4704
02:38:48,428 --> 02:38:50,588
Yeah, and she's voiced by Ashley Johnson.

4705
02:38:50,928 --> 02:38:51,348
A lot of cool.

4706
02:38:51,348 --> 02:38:53,688
And Ernie Hudson is also a voice.

4707
02:38:54,208 --> 02:38:54,788
It's very fun.

4708
02:38:55,288 --> 02:38:56,588
Yeah, check it out.

4709
02:38:57,368 --> 02:39:00,368
Us, Podcast the Ride, Podcast the Ride at Gmail,

4710
02:39:00,748 --> 02:39:04,228
Podcast the Ride on Instagram, Twitter, all of it.

4711
02:39:04,668 --> 02:39:08,308
Patreon.com slash Podcast the Ride.

4712
02:39:08,568 --> 02:39:10,088
Yeah, November, we've had exciting,

4713
02:39:10,228 --> 02:39:11,768
we've had a Disney Quest episode.

4714
02:39:11,868 --> 02:39:14,808
We do three bonus episodes on the Patreon for five bucks.

4715
02:39:14,808 --> 02:39:17,328
We got Disney Quest, we have Club 33,

4716
02:39:17,528 --> 02:39:19,408
and that very special episode

4717
02:39:19,408 --> 02:39:22,068
about my favorite character in fiction, Botanicus,

4718
02:39:22,248 --> 02:39:24,768
E.T.'s teacher from E.T. Adventure Ride.

4719
02:39:25,108 --> 02:39:25,828
Mike's brand.

4720
02:39:26,448 --> 02:39:26,848
Yeah, so.

4721
02:39:27,048 --> 02:39:29,408
Oh, choose Botanicus or Sinbad.

4722
02:39:30,308 --> 02:39:32,548
Well, if we're talking seriously.

4723
02:39:33,088 --> 02:39:33,928
Real Sophie's choice.

4724
02:39:34,148 --> 02:39:36,428
Botanicus I've been with longer,

4725
02:39:36,648 --> 02:39:40,148
but I mean, Sinbad is probably a better, more rich character

4726
02:39:40,148 --> 02:39:41,868
if I'm not being unironic.

4727
02:39:42,008 --> 02:39:42,888
First of all, this is cruel.

4728
02:39:43,048 --> 02:39:44,468
This is maybe the cruelest thing you've done to me

4729
02:39:44,468 --> 02:39:45,828
to make me choose on this.

4730
02:39:45,828 --> 02:39:46,388
Wow.

4731
02:39:46,608 --> 02:39:47,148
Toward the end.

4732
02:39:47,948 --> 02:39:48,708
So I'm very upset.

4733
02:39:48,968 --> 02:39:50,228
I ask the hard questions.

4734
02:39:50,408 --> 02:39:53,908
Yeah, so I would actually like to see them both

4735
02:39:53,908 --> 02:39:54,588
on one ride.

4736
02:39:55,068 --> 02:39:57,848
I would like to see Botanicus in the queue of Sinbad

4737
02:39:57,848 --> 02:40:00,768
telling you that you're about to go on an adventure.

4738
02:40:01,028 --> 02:40:02,588
And then Botanicus starts singing,

4739
02:40:03,748 --> 02:40:05,688
compass of your heart.

4740
02:40:05,988 --> 02:40:07,628
You know what's really interesting about that?

4741
02:40:07,808 --> 02:40:10,988
I bet they would both have things to teach each other.

4742
02:40:12,348 --> 02:40:12,788
Mmm.

4743
02:40:13,028 --> 02:40:14,388
Sinbad though seems like he knows everything.

4744
02:40:14,868 --> 02:40:15,868
So he might not need that.

4745
02:40:15,868 --> 02:40:16,428
He's really got it together.

4746
02:40:16,628 --> 02:40:18,948
I love that Sinbad guy.

4747
02:40:19,148 --> 02:40:21,328
