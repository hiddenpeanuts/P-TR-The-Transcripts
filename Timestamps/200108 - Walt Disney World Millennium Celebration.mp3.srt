1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,600
Happy New Year, happy new decade.

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,240
We're right at the start of it and welcome

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,320
to I Guess the Ride the Second Gate.

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,800
I'm Scott Gardner joined by Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,960
Happy New Year, I'm Mike Carlson.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,480
How special does it feel to hear it from us

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,880
and from Jason Sheridan.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,520
Happy New Year and welcome to the new millennium.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,160
The exciting innovations all around us.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,760
The gates of time have opened.

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,760
Let us march forth and be one anew with the spirit of time.

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Yeah, this is a bunch of nonsense.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,440
I'm excited to talk about it.

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,440
And we've talked for a little while about kicking off 2020

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,800
by celebrating a new year from 20 years ago.

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,440
Because this more importantly

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,160
than this being the beginning of a new decade,

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,240
this is the anniversary of the very famous,

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,840
very beloved Epcot Millennium Celebration.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,800
It was all of Disney World I guess.

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,640
But really, yes.

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,440
But very much anchored at Epcot.

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,480
Epcot was Millennium Central.

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,240
There was this whole pile of Millennium Celebration stuff

26
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,800
they did around 2000.

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,960
Should we take stock of it?

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,800
We'll talk about all of it.

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,600
Yeah, let's overview it first.

30
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,880
Yeah, to give us a little roadmap.

31
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,040
Yeah, I mean they rolled out a lot of new stuff

32
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,480
and under the umbrella of new.

33
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,840
So technically rock and roller coaster.

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,680
Okay, sure.

35
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,160
Is part of the Millennium Celebration.

36
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,880
Technically the introduction of fast passes.

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,720
They stuck as like, you know what else is coming.

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,480
Yeah, really.

39
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,320
Oh.

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,160
They put it like they folded it in

41
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,520
or they were just like, see what's new for the Millennium.

42
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,200
Well, they were at least in the TV special.

43
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,040
Maybe it had been around.

44
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,880
Well, I think.

45
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,720
Now that I'm saying.

46
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,880
But I feel like, yeah, there's a TV special

47
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,080
about the Millennium Celebration

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,560
and pin trading for sure was introduced.

49
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,320
Yeah, it was the beginning of pin trading.

50
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,600
The beginning of fast pass,

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,360
the horrible journey into your imagination

52
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,520
was part of this.

53
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,680
But those all seem like maybe they were kind of like

54
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,760
retconned into like, well, these things are going on.

55
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,320
So we'll sort of include them in the main stuff we're doing.

56
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,720
But the new things for the Millennium,

57
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,160
big illumination show.

58
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,000
Illumination 2000.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,840
With the globe rotating in the middle.

60
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,680
The Millennium Village,

61
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,880
a little like addendum area to World Showcase

62
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,560
off by the UK.

63
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,760
The big 2000 on the Epcot.

64
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,760
But which began the several years of ruining icons

65
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,760
at Disney World.

66
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,240
We've discussed for a long time,

67
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,560
was the Castle cake ruining or plusing

68
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,960
and was various opinions on that.

69
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,800
But I don't think anyone really likes the big 2000

70
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,880
on Spaceship Earth.

71
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,720
No.

72
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,440
Oh, I guess we should wait till the time.

73
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,360
But I remember I was there before the Millennium

74
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,600
and I saw it being built.

75
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,440
Oh, okay.

76
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,360
2000 being built.

77
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,120
Did it make you nervous?

78
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,760
It was very big, so it did make me nervous.

79
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,520
I don't have the same big thing fear that you'd,

80
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,440
although yours is specifically in a big thing

81
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,280
in a small space.

82
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,640
Which is why I'm nervous about Rise of the Resistance.

83
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,760
Oh, when the 8080s?

84
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,040
Yes, yeah, yeah.

85
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,880
Oh, right.

86
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,360
I think it's gonna freak me out in a good way.

87
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,800
Like being enclosed.

88
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,520
Full size TIE fighter too.

89
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,800
Oh boy, ooh.

90
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,640
Yeah.

91
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,320
If it's open air, well, I've seen TIE fighters.

92
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,240
They're around, but outside.

93
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,360
Something about being enclosed.

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,520
I don't think it's open air TIE fighter, or am I wrong?

95
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,600
No, he's saying he's seen them outside.

96
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,440
Oh, I see.

97
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,280
This is in a hangar.

98
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

99
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,440
If they're enclosed, it's scarier.

100
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,120
I didn't mean nervous so much, like it's big.

101
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,000
So were you nervous that it was going to be

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
aesthetically poor edition?

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,240
I think at the time I thought, oh, that's cool.

104
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,400
But then I don't even think I liked it

105
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,720
when I finally saw what it looked like.

106
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,480
So I just have a memory of going,

107
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,520
oh, there's a giant thing in the parking lot next to it.

108
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,000
Sure, sure. It was being constructed.

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,560
At 13 or 14, it had been enough years of going regularly

110
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,440
that I was like, there's always gonna be new stuff.

111
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,880
And I don't think I was often going,

112
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
ah, that wasn't as good.

113
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,840
Or maybe going with Journey, I was like,

114
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,600
why did they change that?

115
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,400
That wasn't as good as the old one.

116
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,400
But I feel like I gave them the benefit of the doubt

117
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,760
of if one thing didn't hit,

118
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,600
there's gonna be another new thing that quickly.

119
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,280
But this was an era where a lot of the new things

120
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,760
weren't hitting.

121
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,600
Yeah, I know.

122
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,120
I don't know, I don't wanna detain everything.

123
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,200
I found this era to be sort of odd and unpleasant

124
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,320
in general.

125
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,800
I don't have a lot of fondness

126
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,680
for the Millennium Celebration.

127
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,840
And that kind of, among which, as I continue to list things,

128
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,360
the Tapestry of Nations Parade

129
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,160
that happened around World Showcase

130
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,640
with these big puppet things.

131
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,080
Yeah, I mean, I don't have much affection

132
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,320
for this time either.

133
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,760
What, the Rock and Roller Coaster

134
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,880
and the Tower of Terror,

135
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,200
maybe the last things that happened at Disney World

136
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,800
where I have a lot of nostalgia for.

137
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,120
Either this whole stuff, all of these things,

138
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,000
it's either like, I don't care,

139
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,920
or, oh, this is bad, this looks bad.

140
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,120
Specifically bad, yeah.

141
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,920
I mean, I think even when it wasn't something

142
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,360
I was wild about, it was still like,

143
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,080
well, I'm still at Disney World,

144
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,320
and we're still having a nice family vacation,

145
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,280
so I can't complete too much.

146
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,080
I wasn't saying that I was like,

147
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,440
Disney World sucks now or anything.

148
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,440
I don't know how critical I was at 14.

149
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,040
I couldn't also, I wasn't some articulate,

150
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,880
I couldn't be like, you know,

151
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,160
I can pinpoint exactly what's wrong with the ride now.

152
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, for sure.

153
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,800
I'm just saying that in hindsight,

154
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,400
it's all hindsight is what I'm saying.

155
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,440
Ahana, okay, the hand on Spaceship Earth

156
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,760
seems like a misfire,

157
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,320
but they could have very easily made that

158
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,320
a little more aesthetically on game for Epcot.

159
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,560
Like, if it was that Epcot font,

160
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,880
if it was 2000 and kind of a futurey font,

161
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,640
kind of makes sense, makes a little more sense.

162
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,480
But why was it this swirly?

163
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,360
Why was it the Sorcerer Mickey hand?

164
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,720
Yeah, so in case you don't know what we're talking about,

165
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,040
yeah, the Sorcerer Mickey hand was popping out of,

166
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,320
essentially, the ground, I guess,

167
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,720
and like enchanting Spaceship Earth.

168
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,560
With a wand.

169
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,960
With a wand.

170
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,000
Did he have a wand?

171
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,880
There's a wand, here, I'm looking at a picture now.

172
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,960
Wait, are you asking, did-

173
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,720
Did Sorcerer Mickey often?

174
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't believe so. I think of the hat.

175
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,160
Like, and of course, the hat went in over at,

176
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,240
then, MGM Studios.

177
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,280
Yeah, I don't, in Sorcerer's Apprentice,

178
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,160
well, does he have a wand, like, in Phantasmic?

179
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,720
Well, he's a conductor in Phantasmic, so he has a-

180
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,160
He has a baton. A baton, yeah.

181
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,400
Maybe, and he does in Sorcerer's Apprentice.

182
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,560
Maybe it's not a magic wand, it's a magic baton.

183
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,960
Oh, interesting. That stars and

184
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,400
sparkles are coming out of.

185
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,040
That's interesting.

186
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,440
So he can conduct an orchestra with that.

187
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,160
Go ahead and Google, if you're listening to this,

188
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,320
and you've never seen it, Epcot 2000,

189
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,040
and that'll show you what we're talking about.

190
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,880
And also, I think my big problem with a lot of this,

191
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,720
some of this stuff, I mean, I saw, I was there.

192
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,960
I was there in, like, spring of 2000,

193
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,760
and I saw all of this stuff.

194
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,320
Yeah.

195
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,320
And so, I have an affection for the Millennium Village,

196
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,640
positive memories of the Millennium Village.

197
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,480
I have a lot to say about it with 20 years of perspective,

198
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,480
and some of the countries represented are a little wild.

199
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,840
But I remember being very excited for the Millennium,

200
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,200
and doing the research for this,

201
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,520
I kind of got the vibe of doing the research

202
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,920
for the Bicentennial.

203
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,200
Like, it was a big thing that everyone knew about,

204
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,760
everyone was all in on,

205
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,720
except the Millennium celebration had the edge

206
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,320
that the world could end with Y2K.

207
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,200
As a nervous child, I was concerned about Y2K.

208
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,160
Well, that's a good question.

209
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,560
Do you guys remember your Y2K night?

210
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,400
100%, yes.

211
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,880
My mom didn't want me going out,

212
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,080
because she thought the world might end, yes.

213
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,000
Uh, that's, oh, well, my mom didn't want me going out either.

214
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,920
That's why I didn't do anything that night,

215
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,280
not because I had no friends,

216
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,560
and nobody invited me to anything.

217
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,080
It was that my mom said no.

218
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,920
Sure.

219
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,760
Let me be clear about that.

220
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,960
Uh, I remember filling some extra pitchers of water,

221
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,720
and putting them in the fridge, just in case.

222
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,040
Wait, you put like two extra pitchers of water?

223
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,560
Two extra pitchers, like in case shit went down.

224
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,520
And you did it?

225
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,600
I did it.

226
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,280
And then, right when the ball dropped,

227
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,720
we were watching at the living room,

228
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,840
and it went five, four, three, two, one,

229
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,280
and my dad was standing at the back,

230
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,600
and like turned the lights off, and I was like,

231
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,920
oh, this is it.

232
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,880
And he was just like a lamb, and he got me.

233
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,800
He did get me.

234
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,480
That's a good joke.

235
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,680
Also, at the time, my dad worked in, did computer stuff.

236
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,880
My dad worked in software.

237
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,760
He was like, no, we figured it.

238
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,960
It's fine.

239
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,160
Everyone's figured it out.

240
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,560
It's gonna be fine.

241
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,600
That is, like, I hate to use fake news,

242
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,280
but they, like the media really ginned up.

243
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,120
Really?

244
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,960
Yeah.

245
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,840
The idea that that was very possible.

246
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,680
Yeah.

247
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,520
And it wasn't.

248
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,600
And everyone really on edge,

249
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,680
and maybe that's an early,

250
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,960
yet like the sensationalism of extinction.

251
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,720
I mean, every big company had to double check

252
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,600
their software and make sure all the T's were crossed

253
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,440
and I's dotted.

254
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,520
But the idea was that the computers,

255
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,800
the computers would all shut, think it's 1901,

256
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,200
and they would go back,

257
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,000
and it would just destroy every computer, right?

258
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,600
That's basically what they were trying to scare us about.

259
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,880
What was gonna happen?

260
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,840
Like, everyone's bank account was just gonna like,

261
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,680
go to figure out, or?

262
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,200
Right, because it would like think it.

263
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,520
Neck defense.

264
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,920
Yeah, it would erase everything,

265
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,160
because it would like start at the beginning.

266
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,240
Just stuff would crash.

267
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,720
That sounds like, in saying that now,

268
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,920
it sounds like somebody who doesn't have any idea

269
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,760
how computers work.

270
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,600
Yeah.

271
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,920
Like being like, well, what's gonna happen?

272
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,840
We didn't, like, when they made Windows 95,

273
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,080
when they were making operating systems,

274
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,320
there's no way that they were like,

275
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,120
well, let's only plan for five years from now.

276
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,280
It wasn't like these were made 500 years ago.

277
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,840
Somebody maybe is gonna correct me,

278
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,760
because I sound like an idiot,

279
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,440
and I often do on this show, I'm sure,

280
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,600
but I'm saying like, in hindsight,

281
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,600
the idea that like, oh, most of these computers

282
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,720
didn't prepare for after 1999 doesn't make any sense.

283
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,280
Yeah, it was not that-

284
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,800
It was like 20 years away.

285
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,120
Like, if a computer, like, mainstream, like,

286
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,640
home personal computers were like, what, 80s?

287
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,080
Yeah, and I mean, if you think about it,

288
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,400
when Windows 95, you click on the clock in the corner,

289
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,000
it brings up a tiny calendar,

290
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,160
and you can just keep going years ahead of time.

291
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,400
You can go 20, 30, 100 years ahead of time.

292
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,520
Everyone's worried the whole world

293
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,360
is gonna be like, Minesweeper.

294
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,080
It's gonna be bombs around any corner.

295
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,640
So yeah, I don't know what I'm talking about,

296
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,680
but I remember just not like being like, oh yeah,

297
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,960
but they didn't prepare for the year 2000

298
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,480
on all these computers.

299
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,480
And then there was the fear that was proven correct,

300
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,360
which was not Y2K, but Will2K.

301
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,200
Well.

302
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,720
That we would be, that we would end up

303
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,560
in not a millennium, but a Will-

304
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,680
Millennium. Yeah.

305
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,440
And that honestly, that was, surpassed my expectations.

306
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,320
Yeah, it has come true,

307
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,120
what with Will Smith's frequent YouTube presence.

308
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,720
I just watched him go to the robot restaurant in Japan.

309
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,080
Oh, really? Yeah.

310
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,120
Which is like a, it's a long video that shows you nothing.

311
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,680
And he's like, the idea of going

312
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,920
to the robot restaurant is so bizarre to him.

313
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,600
And he keeps like throwing other people under the bus.

314
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,440
Like, man, that was Steve's idea.

315
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,800
Steve was pushing this one.

316
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,800
What'd you get me into this time, Steve?

317
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,080
Going to a popular dinner show.

318
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,920
I don't, like, why is this so weird to you, Will?

319
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,040
I'm, well, I didn't know he was even doing that.

320
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,440
I know that Jada, his wife, has like a talk show on Facebook

321
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,560
with her mother and the kids.

322
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,000
What? And they talk, yeah, yeah.

323
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,480
They talk about like-

324
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,160
That's an official like Facebook,

325
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,800
like that's a show Facebook paid for, correct?

326
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,040
I believe so, yes.

327
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,200
But they like, it's like intense.

328
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,240
Oh. Check it out.

329
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,800
They have to go to Luntown.

330
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,040
Sex talk and like the relationship.

331
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,880
Well, there's a lot to develop into

332
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,000
when your marriage is false.

333
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,200
Well. Scientology arrangement.

334
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,240
Yeah, that does make it a little bit harder.

335
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,880
I don't think they ever spell that out specifically.

336
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,960
But there's pretty like, yeah, it's, anyway.

337
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,560
We don't have to do much more on that one.

338
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't have to go deep into Will 2K.

339
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,080
Yeah.

340
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,720
Did I already say, one of my issues

341
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,600
with some of this Millennium stuff is, you know,

342
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,040
it started October 1st, 1999, sort of a nod to Disneyland,

343
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,320
or Disney World opens October 1st.

344
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,520
Yeah, everything opens October 1st.

345
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,840
Everything opens October 1st.

346
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,200
Also traditionally a lower crowd season at the time.

347
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,520
So that way stuff breaks the first month or so.

348
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,920
That's fine.

349
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,360
And it ran to January 2001.

350
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
But a lot of this stuff,

351
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,440
they did not exactly wrap up in a timely manner.

352
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,400
The hand stuck around on Spaceship Earth

353
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,600
and they changed the 2000 to say Epcot after a while.

354
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,960
In the worst font that's ever existed.

355
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,440
In Epcot Center, a home of beautiful fonts.

356
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,280
Yes.

357
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,360
How many years was that?

358
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,160
2007 and finally.

359
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,000
What?

360
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,080
Is that long?

361
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,920
Yeah.

362
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,120
It looks like, shit, it ruins the symmetry.

363
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,880
Epcot I think is all about symmetry.

364
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,640
Because you keep walking past,

365
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,000
either way you go left or right,

366
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,800
then it's an even amount of Future World pavilion.

367
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,080
Maybe not that, that might not be true.

368
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,080
But it's, you know, here's Spaceship Earth

369
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,800
and it's a circle, then Future World's a circle,

370
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,720
then World Showcase is a circle.

371
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,400
It's this nice layered circular thing.

372
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,200
And then like, why is this big thing over on the left

373
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,640
that can't be seen from some angles?

374
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,360
Like Epcot, like Spaceship Earth looks good

375
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,520
no matter where you're looking at it.

376
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
It like mucked it up.

377
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,120
Now a lot of views don't work.

378
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,880
Why not something symmetrical?

379
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,280
Why not, I'm trying to think of a good,

380
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,320
okay there was a Sorcerer hat in front of the MGM studio

381
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,960
in front of the Chinese theater.

382
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,960
There was, what was it, was it in Magic Kingdom?

383
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,360
Well, there wasn't, there was-

384
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,280
They really didn't have-

385
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,120
15 years before they had the cake.

386
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,920
Yeah, but they didn't do something for that?

387
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,760
Not really.

388
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,800
For Millennium.

389
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,080
Throughout the 2000s, they kinda added like little touches

390
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,360
or they would spruce up the castle or something.

391
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,320
So it was just Sorcerer's Apprentice themed.

392
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,400
That was the idea?

393
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,440
Two of the icons became Sorcerer's Apprentice themed

394
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,720
for two, for a watt, for most of the 2000s.

395
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,200
Forever, for MGM studios.

396
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,000
Well, and they kind of reconfigured to the icon

397
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,320
for that park being the Earful Tower, the water tower.

398
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,160
Right, but they moved it.

399
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,800
Isn't that gone now?

400
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,520
Is the Earful Tower gone?

401
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,760
I'm not 100% sure if the Earful Tower is gone.

402
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,880
I don't recall seeing it, but it might still be there.

403
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,320
I think because it was,

404
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,760
I think that was on the back lot area

405
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,760
that is probably now Galaxy's Edge.

406
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,680
Right.

407
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,520
Honestly, why didn't they just put a hat on it at least,

408
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,720
put on Spatial Birth?

409
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,040
Or at least both hands, the 2000 on the top

410
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,800
and hands on either side.

411
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,560
Or Mickey making like Jay-Z's or Diamond Dallas Page's

412
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,520
diamond cutter. Making the Illuminati.

413
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,840
The Illuminati sign over Spatial Birth.

414
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,400
Just as a reminder of who will ultimately be in charge

415
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,320
for this millennium.

416
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,320
Don't worry, the Illuminati snuck into the Millennium Village.

417
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,600
There's some spots.

418
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,960
If someone could Photoshop either Diamond Dallas Page

419
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,360
or Jay-Z making that sign over Spatial Birth,

420
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,200
I'd appreciate it.

421
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,080
Sure. Yeah.

422
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,160
That sounds better.

423
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,440
That sounds better.

424
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,880
While we're in Spatial Birth territory,

425
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,560
Leave a Legacy.

426
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,680
Yeah. Oh yeah. Let's enter.

427
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,520
Let's enter.

428
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,640
And then when we get past all this,

429
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,280
we can decide which way to go.

430
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,360
But yes, you would have to enter through Leave a Legacy,

431
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,080
which are these big stone tablets, these big pillars

432
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,800
that you, where you could make an etching

433
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,080
that was a drawing of you or your family.

434
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,960
And those were etched into the stone.

435
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,680
Actually, I saw them referred to as megaliths.

436
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,640
Oh, interesting.

437
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,840
The term they were throwing around.

438
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,840
Because a monolith is just a big slate stone slab,

439
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,480
essentially. Like what's in 2001

440
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,800
of Space Odyssey. Right.

441
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,520
So these are mega, these are bigger.

442
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,920
Megaliths. And they are giant.

443
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,120
But they're not bigger than the stones in 2001.

444
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,080
No. No.

445
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,400
They are large. But there's more of them.

446
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,080
So they can't say monoliths.

447
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,920
Oh, right, because monoliths.

448
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,520
Because multiple monoliths is impossible

449
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,920
because it's mono. There's 32 of these.

450
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,160
So they could. Is it that many?

451
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,000
It is that many.

452
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,440
They could be multiliths, but megaliths sounds cooler.

453
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,680
Multiliths is probably more correct.

454
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,520
You're right. Yeah.

455
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,120
But megaliths is dumber.

456
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,520
Right, but funner.

457
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,360
Yeah, yeah.

458
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,120
These were, I think these like fit the old aesthetic.

459
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,960
These didn't seem like they like super stuck out

460
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,080
and didn't belong.

461
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,160
Well, they yanked the fountain for it.

462
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,080
Now, see, I don't remember a lot of this that well.

463
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,080
So there was like the fountain was like,

464
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,040
I didn't go a lot when there was the original fountain.

465
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,760
So that was like the glass.

466
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,440
The glass, which is coming back.

467
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,080
They're nodding to that.

468
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,720
Like they're sort of reinstalling it.

469
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,040
Okay.

470
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,480
Yeah, I don't know.

471
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,640
Looking back, I'm shocked my family

472
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,840
did not put ourselves on this

473
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,640
because we could have done all four of us

474
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,200
for under $120.

475
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,040
Wow, really?

476
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,040
It was like $35 a tile, I think.

477
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,760
And you could get. That's a great deal.

478
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,400
I mean, we would do that now if they could.

479
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,760
We would 100% do that now.

480
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,200
I don't think I would do that.

481
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,480
Why do I need my face on a tile?

482
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,760
The three of us.

483
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,600
I guess the three of us.

484
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,640
Yeah, it's kind of a fun little Easter egg.

485
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,480
Yeah.

486
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,720
Yeah, for content we would do it.

487
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,840
I think it was two per tile.

488
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,760
So you do like the parents and then the kids.

489
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,600
There's some famous people scattered there.

490
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,760
Like all of NSYNC is somewhere in here.

491
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,640
Yes. NSYNC, also if you knew where to look,

492
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,880
you could see all of NSYNC lined up in very like 99 era,

493
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,920
like a stylishly dopey era for NSYNC.

494
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,560
These were designed by John Hench.

495
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,120
Yes. That's interesting.

496
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,280
Who designed Spaceship Earth to begin with,

497
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,480
or is one of the people who did.

498
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,480
And so that maybe factors into like why it matches

499
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,840
and is okay.

500
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,680
It matches.

501
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,240
It does feel, I went to DC a lot growing up,

502
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,240
and it does feel like a little bit like a war memorial

503
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,120
for like, were we in the Falklands?

504
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:49,120
This is a memorial for like these six people who died

505
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,280
in like a car crash in the Falklands.

506
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Do you think anyone walked into Epcot Center

507
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,360
and was mistaken about what this was for

508
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,280
and like solemnly prayed for all of the victims?

509
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,120
Yes.

510
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,160
Like these are all the faces of the dead.

511
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,000
Yes, of course.

512
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,360
I don't think that's a joke.

513
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,480
I think that happened.

514
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,080
Yeah.

515
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,520
Like some kid was like, hey, cool it, stop playing.

516
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,360
Moment of silence.

517
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,080
Yes, I think for sure.

518
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,960
That's what it looks like.

519
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,480
It does look a little solemn,

520
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,680
even though all the faces on it, everyone's smiling.

521
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,720
Yeah, but it seems like.

522
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,000
I mean, it's true that everyone in all of the etchings

523
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,320
will be dead within the millennium.

524
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,160
Yes, that's true.

525
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,400
So we should stop and pray for the future dead.

526
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,360
Unless something happens technologically or scientifically

527
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,360
medically.

528
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,480
Yes, and the new millennium is full of hope and opportunity.

529
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,960
So it very well could.

530
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,640
Stem cells keep us alive until we're in our 200s.

531
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,680
That'd be great.

532
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,480
We'd have to go way past the millennium though.

533
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,160
We'd have to, nobody's gonna make it a thing.

534
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,240
I guess you're right.

535
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,520
Unless the technology you're describing

536
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,600
is really, really good.

537
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,640
Really good technology, really fast.

538
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,160
I guess it would have to be like robots

539
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,720
and then you put your brain in the robot.

540
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,880
Yeah, our consciousness.

541
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,080
And then you could keep the, yeah,

542
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,000
you would just inject stem cells into the brain

543
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,600
to keep it alive and we'd all have robot bodies.

544
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,840
Or one more option.

545
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,960
We get cloned.

546
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,160
So when you're around 40 or something,

547
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,120
you clone and you keep a brainless clone of yourself

548
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,760
growing somewhere.

549
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,840
And then when the clone is about 18 or 20,

550
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,560
you take the actual brain from your old head,

551
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,200
inject it with stem cells to keep it young

552
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,600
and put it in this new body.

553
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,360
Are you describing the movie, The Island?

554
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,200
Yeah, I think so.

555
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,040
I think you were describing it.

556
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,920
There's a couple movies.

557
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,560
Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson.

558
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,640
I think I'm describing probably a couple movies.

559
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,520
It's such a clean sci-fi premise you're describing

560
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,480
that I'm like, it feels like it has to be something.

561
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,720
I think it's a couple- That's a really strong idea.

562
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,360
Yeah, I don't think I invented it.

563
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,880
I think it's in probably a couple of things,

564
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
but it might be The Island.

565
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,760
How creepy, a lifeless body.

566
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,360
Oh yeah.

567
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,360
But they're doing where they genetically engineer animals

568
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,160
to eat, but it's only like,

569
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,360
it's like a headless chicken or something.

570
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,200
For sure.

571
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,040
Yeah, right.

572
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,360
So you're growing a weird caged version of yourself

573
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,400
and then you plan, and then maybe you can do that again

574
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,920
and again and just hop and hop and hop.

575
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,760
Yeah, forever.

576
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,600
Yeah.

577
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,320
I saw this movie called Get Out.

578
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,400
That implies a technology that we could all,

579
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,360
let's take the racial as a positive.

580
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,200
Yeah, I was gonna say-

581
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,120
If you could do it in a nice way,

582
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,960
that's an option for hopping from,

583
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,120
if you don't have to put anyone in a sunken place.

584
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,040
Yeah.

585
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,680
That was one of the things I thought about

586
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,520
because this is,

587
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,680
I don't think, there's a lot of stuff the millennium,

588
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,480
we could not have predicted.

589
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,000
One, how many countries are run by fascists?

590
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,120
Like how many?

591
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,160
Okay, America, Brazil.

592
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,200
Oh yeah, check it out.

593
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,240
Okay, it's-

594
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,520
How many have World Showcase?

595
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,000
At least America.

596
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,400
Well, Israel will get to,

597
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,400
the Prime Minister currently being charged with corruption.

598
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,240
Okay.

599
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,440
Yeah, but a lot of this stuff where,

600
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,440
we're all part of the human race.

601
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,640
Who could have possibly foreseen with accelerationism

602
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,960
that that devolved into all lives matter?

603
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,240
Who could have predicted that at the millennium?

604
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,200
That quickly.

605
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,400
Boy, how unfamiliar- Very quickly.

606
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,240
When you go back and watch this 2000 stuff,

607
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,800
how unfamiliar is it to you here in 2020?

608
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,000
Very hopeful, yeah.

609
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,840
Like boy, things took a turn real fast.

610
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,080
Well, cause some shit went down pretty soon

611
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,880
after the millennium turned.

612
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,080
Even at the millennium, I mean, 1999,

613
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,560
right after all this stuff started,

614
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:44,040
the battle for Seattle protests were happening

615
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,360
like a month later.

616
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,120
Yeah, rage against the machine.

617
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,720
Rage against the machine.

618
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,120
The rise of rage against the machine.

619
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,040
And I blame all of this on them.

620
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,880
Sure.

621
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,720
I think-

622
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,640
We need the machine.

623
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,600
I think rage against the machine will be playing

624
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,040
at Eat to the Beat at Epcot in a few years.

625
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,360
You know them four, bulls on parade.

626
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,120
Soon, rage against the machine will rock the lagoon.

627
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,720
Da-na-na-na-na-na.

628
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,040
Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me.

629
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,840
Mom's dance.

630
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,680
Yeah.

631
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,520
You'll be out on stage like breaking chairs.

632
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,000
All right, we'll be back at 7.45.

633
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,200
We did three songs.

634
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,560
Here are some other things

635
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,640
that we're probably not predicting at the millennium.

636
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,560
For Leave a Legacy, part of your purchase,

637
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,720
you got a website where you would see

638
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,440
your Leave a Legacy picture,

639
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,160
and you could add, if your family grew,

640
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:50,160
you could add more family members to your website.

641
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,480
That was of course built on the great website, go.com.

642
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,440
And Digital Leave a Legacy, no longer with us.

643
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,280
Oh my God.

644
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,240
We can't get to that?

645
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,200
It does not exist anymore, apparently.

646
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,760
The other thing is, so all of these,

647
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,920
the Megaliths are going away.

648
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,920
The metal sheets with the pictures

649
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,040
are being moved outside of the park

650
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,200
as part of the Epcot redo.

651
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,400
Apparently the contract people signed

652
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,640
said they would be around until 2027.

653
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,440
So who knows how long they will be

654
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,320
in that little area outside the park?

655
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,720
I have a guess, 2027.

656
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,560
2027.

657
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,560
And not a day past.

658
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,760
There will be a big dump truck full of Megaliths.

659
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,000
Unless they just are too lazy to take them out.

660
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,640
I guess it depends on the financial state

661
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,240
of the company at the time.

662
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,080
Yeah.

663
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,680
Like if they have, or they're flush with cash at that point.

664
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,720
We're gonna, the thing that they aren't accounting for

665
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,880
is that Disney Plus is doing well now.

666
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,720
Yeah.

667
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,640
But with the impending rise of Quibi,

668
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,880
Disney Plus could be crushed into the ground

669
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,640
by the end of this year, 2020.

670
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,880
When Quibi absorbs Disney.

671
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,720
Yeah.

672
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,560
Yeah.

673
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,480
Oh God, so then it's gonna be in the ultimate

674
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,840
Katzenberg left and now he's back

675
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,480
and now it's his hand lighting up Spaceship Earth.

676
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,200
And all the Mickey walk-around characters

677
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,840
have Katzenberg's head on it.

678
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,480
No, it's not Mickey anymore, it's Kassa.

679
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,160
It's Katzenberg.

680
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,960
He usurped, he really is get outing the Disney company.

681
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,800
Yes.

682
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,280
He's kicking Mickey's soul out of his own body.

683
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,800
I guess all the walk-around characters

684
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,800
have a big plastic Katzenberg head on.

685
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,120
So it's like Minnie in her dress,

686
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,680
but it's Katzenberg's head, goofy with the vests.

687
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,840
Well no, Katzenberg and Meg Whitman.

688
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,680
Oh yeah, you're right.

689
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,520
Oh yeah, yeah.

690
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,000
There's a boy and a girl.

691
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,800
Mickey and Minnie is Meg Whitman.

692
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,160
Yeah, you'll go to see those Duffy shows in Japan.

693
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,040
She's only, you know, and she deserves all the success.

694
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,720
If you fail to be elected governor of California,

695
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,840
tank a couple printer companies.

696
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,200
Keep going, keep going, go bigger, get promoted.

697
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,280
Are you really forgetting her observation

698
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,360
that young people watch content on their phones?

699
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,040
Like all of that is in the past

700
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,720
because she has made the most original declaration

701
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,000
that has ever been made.

702
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,800
So give her some credit and let her,

703
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,640
and let's put her on all the plushes in the parks.

704
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,560
I mean, the Q&A with the two of them

705
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,880
where the reporter is like,

706
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,320
I asked a millennial about this and they said,

707
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,800
Quibi look like a fam.

708
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,200
How do you respond to that?

709
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,200
They're like, what?

710
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,360
Like they're so caught off guard by there.

711
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,120
Like young person said, this is a stupid idea

712
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,800
and won't work.

713
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,680
How do you respond?

714
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,960
Well, that's just one.

715
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,960
Like, did I tell you guys about the,

716
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,560
there was a big article where Meg Whitman was explaining

717
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,440
like what young people,

718
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,280
like working with so many young people

719
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,040
has taught me all these terms I didn't know,

720
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,560
such as fam parentheses work friends.

721
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,960
Did the young people you work with tell you that?

722
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,280
Is anyone defined fam that way?

723
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,440
That fam, work friends?

724
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,360
Friends.

725
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,280
Huh.

726
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,360
They're like family.

727
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,160
You didn't choose them.

728
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,880
Fam means work friends.

729
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,400
Hey, well, you guys are weird.

730
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,240
This is work.

731
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,080
You guys, that means you guys are fam.

732
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,040
What up fam?

733
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,400
What up fam?

734
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,480
But not the audience.

735
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
They're not fam.

736
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,320
No.

737
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,160
They're listeners.

738
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,000
Sorry.

739
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,920
They're on the other end of the exchange.

740
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,080
They're not work friends like you guys are.

741
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,440
But fam, we would like, non fam, other word,

742
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,600
we would like you to click here, here, and here,

743
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,440
and to subscribe.

744
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,120
Mash that button.

745
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,960
How hellish is that?

746
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,160
If you guys got that about YouTube,

747
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,840
but now they have to, at the end of every video,

748
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,080
say subscribe and mash the button.

749
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,200
Like YouTube changed it.

750
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,040
So now all these YouTubers have to say, do two things.

751
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,880
Yeah.

752
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,440
Is it smash the button or what are they?

753
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,360
There's a phrase they still say smash that like button.

754
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,520
You'd have to ask Meg Whitman.

755
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,600
I only share it now.

756
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,440
Cause I don't know.

757
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
She's up on the phrases.

758
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,440
I do only, I mostly associate fam with, hey, what up fam?

759
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,880
Or on Twitter, people misusing it purposely to go like,

760
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,120
shoes look like a fam.

761
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,000
Which the joke being good.

762
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,320
Like, yeah.

763
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,520
It's purposely kind of wrong, purposely kind of off.

764
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,520
Like not, like you looked at a glossary of young people.

765
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,360
Yeah.

766
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,200
Yeah.

767
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,520
Anyways, yeah.

768
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,920
2027, in sinks going in the garbage.

769
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,480
It's the end of bye bye bye.

770
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,440
But yeah, if it's too expensive,

771
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,520
that's why the hand stuck around for so long.

772
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,120
Cause it's like, this is going to be so expensive

773
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,320
to disassemble.

774
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,160
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

775
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,600
I think very possible.

776
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,200
And like river country just sat there decaying for years.

777
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,120
I think they got rid, they finally took it out,

778
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,640
but it was there for years.

779
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,720
They honestly just sat there empty

780
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,680
until the snow-capped preview center.

781
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,480
So who knows how long they'll be there.

782
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,800
So we've entered the park.

783
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,200
We've passed the megaliths and perhaps

784
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,840
put ourselves on for future generations to see on go.com.

785
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,440
We've admired the amazing magic wand.

786
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,280
Yes.

787
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,320
Which way do we go now?

788
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,400
I guess, well, it's, hmm.

789
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,480
That's, it's hard to say.

790
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,240
I forget what times the parades were happening.

791
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,760
Well, and it's in three legs and it's,

792
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,360
it seems, it seemed like it was always happening

793
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,360
from what I remember.

794
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,200
Yeah. Yeah.

795
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,320
I mean, this is what I, one of my big memory of thinking like,

796
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,560
well, what is the aesthetic of the millennium?

797
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,480
And it's these large puppets and the score,

798
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,640
which it is a score.

799
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,960
It's not one song,

800
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,280
cause it's like a 20 to 30 minute long thing.

801
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,560
And the composer actively said like,

802
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,840
you know, the lyrics, there aren't really lyrics

803
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,200
because it's not a language, but it sounds like a language.

804
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,160
It's the impression of a language.

805
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,000
Oh.

806
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,120
And so I don't know if that,

807
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,120
it reminds me of the shaman of song.

808
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,960
Yes.

809
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,800
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

810
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,040
What we were doing in the live that very like,

811
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,160
Ha-ne-he, oh-he-oh-ha, ha-ne-ho.

812
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,600
Like, I do not like this kind of thing whatsoever.

813
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,000
If you take away from me that it's a real language

814
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,960
and I have to be differential to it and like,

815
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,560
okay, that's cultural.

816
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,000
Like if it's made up, get out of here.

817
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,120
I don't, I do not want to hear any hey-yah-ho.

818
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,320
If it was like an Ewok language though,

819
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,920
if it was a cuter sound like yub nub or whatever,

820
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,720
like a cuter language, would you like it better?

821
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,200
Or if the characters you had some affection for?

822
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,040
I don't know.

823
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,560
I do, well, I do like Lapti Neck,

824
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,360
the song from Return of the Jedi very much.

825
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,320
But that's, I don't know.

826
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,760
I think made up language chants are hard for me.

827
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,520
I think chants in general,

828
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,800
because I really hate, you know,

829
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,800
Imagine Dragon, 32nd to Mars kind of like,

830
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,640
hey, hey.

831
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,920
Oh, heaven don't have a name.

832
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,920
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

833
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,360
Oh, hey, hey, hey, oh.

834
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,720
Yes, well, who would have guessed that all of the 2000,

835
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,360
the entire millennium will be that kind of music.

836
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,560
It's never going away.

837
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,400
Never going away.

838
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,880
We're doing 20 years deep and it's all chance.

839
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,400
Really the Tapestry of Nations parade

840
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,240
set the stage for Journey Renner.

841
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,280
And Imagine Dragons.

842
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,120
And Imagine Dragons.

843
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,240
All of them were there as boys.

844
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,680
That's probably why.

845
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,520
Yeah.

846
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,080
Like it's kind of their biggest,

847
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,400
like when their brains were absorbing everything at 14.

848
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,720
And Journey Renner of course is a 50 year old man.

849
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,120
So he was a little older, but at 30 he was there.

850
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,520
I mean, of course the Tapestry of Nations parade,

851
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,560
one of the big things was the marionettes

852
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,640
would touch the ground.

853
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,600
Like you could reach, they would reach out and touch you.

854
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
I mean, I like that.

855
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,240
But if you said, I don't like this,

856
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,320
and Birdman heard you, he would say that famous phrase,

857
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,960
I will kill you and myself.

858
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,840
That famous Jeremy Renner catchphrase.

859
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,680
Oh, oh, oh.

860
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,520
Uh.

861
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,600
I didn't know where you were going with that for a second.

862
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,200
I know, it was a long journey, but I think it was worth it.

863
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,720
You said Birdman, I was like,

864
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,520
are we talking about Birdman?

865
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,160
I was confused, yeah, for a second.

866
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,440
I was confused reading about this.

867
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,040
Okay, maybe we need to explain this

868
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,880
from the ground up.

869
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,720
Yeah, let's go through it.

870
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,560
If you've never seen it,

871
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,000
the Tapestry of Nations was the parade,

872
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,680
and it was kind of this like street show.

873
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,080
It was somewhere between a parade

874
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,000
and a little street celebration

875
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,320
that I specifically remember seeing around Mexico,

876
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,920
Norway zone of World Showcase,

877
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,560
but I think it was in other spots.

878
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,720
But that's where I associated with.

879
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,240
But it was these huge tall marionette puppets

880
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,360
that walked around that were extremely post-Taymor.

881
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,280
This was very post-Lion King Taymor,

882
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,320
and in fact, I think it was a mask maker.

883
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,840
It was Michael Curry, the designer for the Lion King.

884
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,680
How would you describe it?

885
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,720
Like tassel-y?

886
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,920
Like, I don't know.

887
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,440
I mean, I know that it's all like,

888
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,480
it's very disconnected.

889
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,480
It's all like parts kind of abstractly forming a human shape.

890
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,400
That sort of model, like human shape thing you can buy

891
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,080
to learn to sketch.

892
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,720
Like you can pose.

893
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,560
You know what I'm talking about?

894
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,120
That sort of like one foot tall,

895
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,920
a little wooden model that you would use

896
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,840
to draw the human figure.

897
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,720
Yeah.

898
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,080
It's kind of like that,

899
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,480
is that early Mr. Show sketch

900
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,760
about like a little dancing marionette doll?

901
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,120
Oh, Mr. Limb Legs.

902
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,600
Mr. Limb Legs ain't got no clothes on.

903
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,000
It's funny you said that because I wrote down Pitpat.

904
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,840
Oh, yeah.

905
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,320
The spokes thing.

906
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,640
They are all spokes that they're all in.

907
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,960
A pansexual.

908
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,960
Pansexual spokes thing.

909
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,360
That's extremely accurate.

910
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,200
Yeah, yeah.

911
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,560
But which, that sketch, yeah, yeah.

912
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,520
Oh, I'm old Swirlo.

913
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,480
It's all, yeah, it's like weird.

914
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,480
It's like handcrafted art, but on this mega scale.

915
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,000
Lecivious.

916
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,480
Those are great.

917
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,880
Tanker Bell's having sex with him at the end.

918
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,760
I guess I was only saying Tassel

919
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,600
because there's that one,

920
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
and that one they made the Parkstar out of

921
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,120
has like hair that is kind of like hanging.

922
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,000
He looks like, he or she looks like

923
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,280
the Muppets newer friend from Muppets Tonight.

924
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,840
That's Discman.

925
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Oh, yes, Discman.

926
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,920
Thank you, thank you, Discman.

927
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,960
These are nightmare inducing.

928
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,480
I hated these.

929
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,560
I hated them.

930
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,960
I hated this thing a lot.

931
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,160
I like them if they were like the villains in a movie.

932
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,280
Yeah. Like they're cool.

933
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,520
They're all like Slender Man.

934
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,360
Yes.

935
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,440
They're like the creature from Signs.

936
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,160
Sage of Time.

937
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,800
I like Sage of Time.

938
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,520
I can't believe. A little more specific.

939
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,880
I had no idea these all had names.

940
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,400
We probably all stumbled into this

941
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,720
and you're excited about this, Jason.

942
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,600
Or exhausted by it might be the word.

943
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,440
Wait, show me again which one.

944
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,280
I just want to make sure we're on the same page.

945
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,960
The Sage of Time was like the grand marshal of the parade.

946
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,240
Is this the Sage of, hold on.

947
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,920
Oh yeah, this is, yes, this is the Sage of Time.

948
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,000
I like these in a return to Oz kind of way.

949
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,840
Yeah.

950
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,680
Where I'm disturbed.

951
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,240
I don't like, I'm scared of return to Oz still.

952
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,360
Right.

953
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,640
Have you watched it on Disney Plus?

954
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,480
No.

955
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,320
We should do that.

956
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,140
Okay, sure.

957
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,980
Is that on Disney Plus?

958
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,820
Yeah, yeah.

959
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,640
I've never seen it all the way.

960
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,080
Well, nothing scared me.

961
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,440
Very few things scared me harder as a child

962
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,280
than return to Oz.

963
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,120
I remember watching it.

964
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,200
Dark Crystal maybe, it's in that.

965
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,360
Yeah.

966
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,440
But I remember just, anyway, the woman,

967
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,520
I forget the character's name.

968
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,520
She takes her head off.

969
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,360
She has a whole room of heads and I melted down and ran.

970
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,400
I ran from whatever my grandmas.

971
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,200
My grandmother's, what I think upstairs, TV room.

972
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,240
I remember just running away.

973
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,080
But I did, there was a morbid curiosity to it.

974
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,920
We watched it.

975
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,760
The 80s.

976
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
Body part in the 80s.

977
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,400
Yeah, we watched it a couple years ago.

978
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,200
And it's not like a great movie, but I like it.

979
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,640
It's cool and weird and.

980
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,360
Is it fair to say like,

981
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,400
if it was a friendly, cute puppet

982
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,520
that we saw when we were under five,

983
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,400
then we still love it to this day

984
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,360
and want every piece of memorabilia about it.

985
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,160
And if it was a slightly scary puppet,

986
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,960
then we still have nightmares about it.

987
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,360
And it's the subject of our therapy

988
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,640
and we'll never get over the fear of them.

989
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,720
Yeah, that lines up.

990
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,280
That's probably pretty clear.

991
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,080
Ninja Turtles, we love forever.

992
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,920
Jim Edmonds.

993
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
Sure, Spectro Man?

994
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,760
Yeah.

995
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,600
No.

996
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,400
No, don't even talk about him.

997
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,360
Dolphay Spectro Man.

998
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,200
Hideous.

999
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,200
This was, so all these puppets, again,

1000
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,800
this is the whole thing at the Millennium,

1001
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,480
was again, the human race.

1002
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,000
It's kind of a melting pot.

1003
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,640
They literally said like,

1004
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,120
it's a melting pot of all cultures.

1005
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,720
So it's everything and nothing.

1006
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,080
Like they're abstract, quote.

1007
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,920
They can be anything you want them to be.

1008
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,640
But that can also be meaningless.

1009
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,120
Like.

1010
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,400
Scott's going home with the sage of time tonight.

1011
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,800
I think I am.

1012
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,200
He can be whatever I want.

1013
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,280
He can be anything.

1014
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,440
No way, man, I'm going with Wiggle Girl.

1015
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,440
Yeah, fellas, you're either a Wiggle Girl guy

1016
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,560
or an Angel Girl guy.

1017
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,320
Every type of man is,

1018
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,240
you could break them down by,

1019
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,760
do you answer, are you the sprite?

1020
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,200
Fellas, are you a Discman or are you a Hammer Man,

1021
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,920
also referred to as Hammered Copper Man?

1022
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,640
I gotta say, you know, hey, Wiggle Girl's hot and all,

1023
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,360
but I look, I love me a three tiered tail.

1024
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,040
But I'm sprite all the way.

1025
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,360
They had love Wiggle Girl.

1026
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,800
I mean, I probably the most upsetting is Reverse Marionette,

1027
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,520
a large multicolored puppet

1028
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,480
with a little Marionette being.

1029
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,880
Oh, wait, do I get to look at this?

1030
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,720
Reverse Marionette, what's it called?

1031
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,160
That's what it's called on Wikipedia.

1032
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,360
Reverse Marionette with a little Marionette.

1033
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,800
Oh no, no.

1034
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,360
I hate these ghosts.

1035
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,000
But sure, do you have a picture of it?

1036
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,840
Cause I can't.

1037
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,960
I don't have a picture.

1038
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,600
I still don't know.

1039
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,040
I could have made the effort to learn which is which,

1040
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,760
but I didn't want to think about these things

1041
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,080
for any longer than we had to.

1042
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,920
I saw the main ones,

1043
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,240
but I don't know where that Marionette,

1044
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,080
maybe I missed that.

1045
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,920
I feel like that would lead the, in the video,

1046
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,560
you can find it in the videos.

1047
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,000
There's also, they kind of break the pattern

1048
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,480
because one of the people is called Aztec Man.

1049
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,480
That is incredibly specific.

1050
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,200
That can't be whatever you want it to be.

1051
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,040
It's an Aztec Man.

1052
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,160
Yeah, it's an Aztec.

1053
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,400
And also like, oh no, there was a DC,

1054
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,240
there was a DC comics character named Aztec.

1055
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,360
That's just called Aztec.

1056
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,560
The ultimate something man?

1057
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,400
Am I wrong?

1058
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,240
Aztec?

1059
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,280
Aztec the something man?

1060
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,240
He was preparing to fight Quetzalcoatl,

1061
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,080
the ender of worlds, the Aztec ender of worlds.

1062
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,120
Aztec the ultimate man.

1063
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,240
The ultimate man, yeah.

1064
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,240
Created by Grant Morrison, anyway.

1065
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,600
These are, I can't,

1066
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,800
I couldn't believe these things all had names.

1067
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,520
The most, I am obsessed enough with Disney World trips

1068
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,280
that I do a podcast where I talk about it

1069
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,480
multiple times a week.

1070
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,400
All I've ever thought about these puppets was like,

1071
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,720
hey, I remember that awful thing for a couple of years.

1072
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,680
I can't believe that they all had names or backstories

1073
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,640
and the people have cataloged this.

1074
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,480
I'm upset by that there was,

1075
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,520
I mean, I guess it's good they thought about this.

1076
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,040
I mean, at the very least,

1077
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,440
you need a name for props and wardrobe on the checklist.

1078
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,960
Like just for stage managers to have a name.

1079
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,640
So like, I don't know that the public was necessarily,

1080
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,400
I mean, maybe on the maps or stuff,

1081
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,960
they would mention some of them.

1082
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,560
There's someone listening.

1083
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,760
There's one listener who is stewing

1084
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,240
that we hate these puppets.

1085
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,160
Well, and these puppets were everywhere.

1086
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,200
There was so much promotion with these puppets.

1087
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,600
They were in the 2000 Super Bowl halftime show.

1088
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,000
The Super Bowl halftime show,

1089
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,200
which we have discussed before

1090
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,800
because it also included Phil Collins

1091
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,280
and had a little bit of Tarzan Rocks vibe.

1092
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,880
And he performs two worlds and he's in dockers,

1093
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,720
the two primary components of Tarzan Rocks.

1094
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,760
So yeah, this Millennium Celebration vibe

1095
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,040
probably had its biggest grandest stage

1096
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,160
with the Super Bowl halftime show in which,

1097
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,640
and I didn't put any of this together

1098
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,240
until researching this episode.

1099
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,120
That halftime show was narrated by Edward James Olmos

1100
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,880
by just a creepy closeup of Edward James Olmos

1101
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,360
in an ambiguous space.

1102
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,560
And he says all of these weird word soups,

1103
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,160
let us reach out and touch the stars

1104
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,760
as we light the way to tomorrow

1105
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,840
and bring us hope for a better world.

1106
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,360
All this nothing, this meaningless jargon.

1107
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,080
I didn't realize until now that everything that he says

1108
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,640
was also the narration of the Tapestry Nations Parade.

1109
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,240
He says all of the same copy

1110
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,200
that a disembodied voice says.

1111
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,640
Yes.

1112
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,440
Including, he says in his copy,

1113
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,160
there's something about like, okay,

1114
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,840
a thousand years have passed

1115
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,120
and the Sage of Time is once again upon us,

1116
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,120
which I just heard and everyone heard

1117
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,000
watching the Super Bowl and was like,

1118
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,680
what the fuck, what are you talking about?

1119
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,720
No idea that the Sage of Time is a character.

1120
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,880
I don't think Edward James almost knew

1121
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,080
what the hell he was talking about.

1122
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,120
Just like, here's the copy, great go.

1123
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,040
They never communicated the Sage of Time

1124
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,640
is a character, a man.

1125
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,240
He also says this really,

1126
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,680
and the main parade says this really crazy thing about,

1127
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,640
as it does every thousand years,

1128
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,040
the gateway of time has opened.

1129
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,760
Let us begin, or no, behold the great millennium walk.

1130
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,800
And then the puppets all kind of shake around

1131
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,960
and that's what that means.

1132
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,200
They kind of just like, you know, jingle.

1133
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,160
The gateway of time is open?

1134
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,960
What do you mean, how so?

1135
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,000
You explain.

1136
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,880
You are about to enter a realm beyond pleasure and pain.

1137
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,720
Gateway of time, it has?

1138
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,720
And in this context of the Super Bowl halftime show,

1139
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,040
the gateway of time opening up

1140
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,120
meant that some puppets shook around

1141
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,280
and then Phil Collins went up on a crane

1142
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,440
and then back down on a crane.

1143
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,360
If the Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind

1144
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,000
has the Sage of Time in any of that narration,

1145
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,880
it'll be the greatest ride of all time.

1146
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,280
Oh, you know what I flashed too when you said that,

1147
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,960
that they're like dementors in the Harry Potter ride.

1148
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,720
If suddenly the Sage of Time swooped down in front of you

1149
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,720
by surprise, get me out of here.

1150
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,000
I would scream and scream until they stopped the ride,

1151
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,840
get me off.

1152
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,680
But you'd have to appreciate that.

1153
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,680
I could see one of these in the queue.

1154
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,800
Because these are around, these are in stores.

1155
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,040
I want them to be the villains on the ride,

1156
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,200
as Scott is describing.

1157
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,160
Only if I can shoot them in the head.

1158
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,960
Oh, I don't know if there's a gun in it.

1159
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,400
And they bleed blood.

1160
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,280
You know all that Guardians of the Galaxy blood scenes?

1161
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:13,280
And they give you, yeah, they give you just a handgun

1162
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,160
on the ride.

1163
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,000
Just a Glock.

1164
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,440
Again, the speeding up of reality,

1165
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,200
like just imagining the Adam Curtis hyper normalization

1166
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,640
voiceover going, like showing the 2000s

1167
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,920
Super Bowl halftime show.

1168
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,080
And then something happened.

1169
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,520
And it's Justin Timberlake ripping off

1170
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,080
Janet Jackson's costume.

1171
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,520
And then it jumps to like Lenny Kravitz's hog.

1172
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,160
And like, plop, plop.

1173
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,160
Like, plop it out.

1174
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,480
It could have never predicted what was coming for them.

1175
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,440
They couldn't picture,

1176
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,560
they couldn't have predicted the nudity.

1177
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,000
The nudity, the sheer nudity and the sort of like

1178
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,560
the devolving from like educational,

1179
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,760
like slash marketing halftime shows.

1180
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,280
If only the Lenny Kravitz penis popping out of the pants

1181
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,320
had happened not just in some random show.

1182
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,160
So we just have cell phone video of it.

1183
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,840
But if it had been part of a halftime show

1184
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,160
and the shot with like NFL Phantom cameras,

1185
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,960
like super slow mo that you could hire,

1186
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,160
you could zoom all the way, it'd be fascinating.

1187
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,200
It'd be like watching a nature documentary.

1188
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,640
It's like, it's frame by frame,

1189
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,520
the two minute version of the unveiling of Kravitz's hog.

1190
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,360
Kids would study it in school.

1191
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,400
I think I'm conflating two things.

1192
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,360
Cause his penis did fall out at a show, right?

1193
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,560
But then when he did the Super Bowl halftime show,

1194
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,400
he was wearing obscenely tight pants, I think.

1195
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,520
So you're just talking about his tight pants?

1196
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,880
I was just talking about like his like,

1197
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,720
Oh, you weren't even talking about the dick coming out.

1198
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,280
I was covered a little by high def work at cameras.

1199
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,760
Well, what about Prince's giant penis?

1200
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,960
Prince's was a little more mischievous.

1201
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,080
Yeah, it was his guitar.

1202
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,120
Oh yeah, that's right.

1203
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,000
With his silhouette, he used the guitar to insert it.

1204
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,760
The big, it was raining, the big like,

1205
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,080
whatever you'd call it, sheet shot up.

1206
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,000
And then as we're using a shadow effect,

1207
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,080
he made his pointed guitar look like his giant penis.

1208
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:12,920
That's right.

1209
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,920
This is a, well, the 2001 was,

1210
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,600
it didn't have any of this filth.

1211
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,720
Right. Yeah.

1212
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:24,440
The puppets, the Sage of Time does not have genitals.

1213
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,200
They did not, the Timur puppets did not come with that part.

1214
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,480
So again, something happened

1215
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,360
where the Millennium Celebration ends.

1216
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,560
This parade is reconfigured to the Tapestry of Dreams.

1217
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,880
The Sage of Time is-

1218
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,520
Very important, we changed it from nations to dreams.

1219
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,240
And you, but you can have the Sage of Time.

1220
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,040
The Sage of Time splits.

1221
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,360
He's fucking out of there.

1222
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,960
He's replaced by the Dream Seekers,

1223
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,760
Discovery, Magic, and the Unknown.

1224
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,960
Jason, what are their names?

1225
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,400
All I know is they represent

1226
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,080
Discovery, Magic, and the Unknown.

1227
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,040
Do you have the names?

1228
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,880
I have names here.

1229
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,040
Of the Dream Seekers, our favorite characters?

1230
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,520
Leonardo Columbus, who represents

1231
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,160
Discovery, Invention, and Genius.

1232
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,440
This sucks.

1233
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,960
Elfin, who represents nature, magic, and emotions.

1234
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,400
And Cosmo, who represented space and the unknown.

1235
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,560
Leonardo Columbus is my favorite, obviously.

1236
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,320
Wait a minute.

1237
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,760
Two of them have one name,

1238
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,480
and then one of them is Leonardo Columbus.

1239
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,320
Yeah, I know.

1240
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,040
The other two are not as exciting.

1241
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,320
I should have ended with Leonardo Columbus.

1242
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,800
I recently declared,

1243
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,960
I don't know if I said it specifically,

1244
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,080
but I regarded a discovery we found

1245
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,040
in the Schomburg episode,

1246
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,920
DVC, a character made to promote

1247
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,440
Disney Vacation Club purchasing.

1248
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,960
That in my head was the new worst Disney character.

1249
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,280
Like a physical location character.

1250
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,560
I think now I have to declare it's Leonardo Columbus.

1251
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,920
I believe this is a pic.

1252
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,520
Have you seen Leonardo Columbus?

1253
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,360
No.

1254
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,200
No.

1255
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,880
I think I'm gonna unplug my computer here.

1256
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,680
Hold on, let me get this.

1257
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,160
Do you wanna just text it to us?

1258
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,480
Cause you can record your text.

1259
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,040
I'm gonna text, I don't wanna.

1260
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:09,860
Text.

1261
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,200
David, Leonardo.

1262
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,880
We named the Ninja Turtles after great artists,

1263
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,080
and one of them was Leonardo,

1264
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,240
and they're like, do you think that bumps at all?

1265
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,200
No, no, this Leonardo is gonna stand on its own.

1266
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,600
And also, wasn't Columbus already,

1267
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,440
you were starting to be like,

1268
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,600
yeah, this Columbus might not have been a great guy.

1269
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,440
Yeah, they're gonna change his name

1270
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,360
to Leonardo Indigenous.

1271
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,960
What's happening in this millennium?

1272
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,960
All right, I've texted you a picture

1273
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,320
of Leonardo Columbus, I think.

1274
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,440
Open your phone.

1275
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,280
I bet he's cool.

1276
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,120
I've texted you a photo.

1277
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:36,960
Oh man.

1278
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,800
Oh man.

1279
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,400
I looked up Leonardo Columbus,

1280
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,440
it says Leonardo Columbus, tapestry of nations, Epcot.

1281
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,280
He's not that well documented.

1282
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,440
My man looks like shit.

1283
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,960
He's like, he's Michael Sheen's fake Bowie in Tron Legacy.

1284
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,240
He's kinda like that.

1285
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,840
Oh, but mixed a little with, he looks like fucking Khan.

1286
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,680
He starts like Khan.

1287
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,120
Yes, he does look like Khan, yes.

1288
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,920
Columbus.

1289
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,560
Here is a pin.

1290
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,920
There was an Epcot pin with Leonardo Columbus on it.

1291
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,200
I like that you sent us a Flickr from the username Miko.

1292
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,040
Flickr.

1293
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,040
Oh!

1294
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,320
Yeah.

1295
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,200
Sucks, worst font, worst character.

1296
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,000
He also, Leonardo Columbus looks like baby Billy,

1297
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,520
like running through the house with a pickle in his mouth.

1298
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,360
And also.

1299
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,200
Simpsons baby Billy, you're right.

1300
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,680
He looks like Dr. Zayas.

1301
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,800
He's dressed like Dr. Zayas with the big gray vest.

1302
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,840
He's like a Planet of the Apes character.

1303
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,560
He's all of these things and more.

1304
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,400
Leonardo Columbus.

1305
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,600
Maybe I'm coming around already.

1306
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,800
Maybe we need a full.

1307
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,600
Obviously we need to do a separate episode

1308
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,400
about Leonardo Columbus.

1309
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,400
This is so, again, a hodgepodge of specific,

1310
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:54,200
but not specific, not very, very non-offensive,

1311
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,000
but what they end up with is pit pat.

1312
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Yeah, when you have some crazy Imagineer who sees,

1313
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,800
for example, who sees Magnum P.I. and then thinks,

1314
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,160
oh my God, and then he makes up a dragon character

1315
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,480
and it's all for, it's a crazy idea from one guy.

1316
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,120
And that's neat and cool.

1317
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:17,240
Then 40 people all come together and have 20 meetings

1318
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,080
and they land on Leonardo Columbus.

1319
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,960
All right, I have one more photo to send you

1320
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,960
of Leonardo Columbus.

1321
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,120
In this photo.

1322
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,760
He's real and he's my friend.

1323
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,920
He looks like Tanelier Tavon, the collector.

1324
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,400
And honestly, he looks so much like him.

1325
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,480
I almost think maybe that the Marvel people copied

1326
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,720
when they were, hold on, here he comes.

1327
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,880
Sorry, I was just gonna drag him.

1328
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,720
Here we go.

1329
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,840
Here comes one more photo.

1330
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,800
Coming through the gateway of time.

1331
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,480
Leonardo Columbus.

1332
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,800
No, dreams, dreams.

1333
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,720
The gateway is closed at this point.

1334
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,560
A different gateway.

1335
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,640
Oh, here he is, sending you now, Leonardo Columbus.

1336
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,840
Re-routing you to a new gateway.

1337
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,680
Do you see him?

1338
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,400
Not yet, the gateway hasn't quite opened.

1339
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,920
Now, in this one, he looks like that me,

1340
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,600
like when you see your boys and you're about to get wild.

1341
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,200
He's a bro-ier Leonardo Columbus in this picture.

1342
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,040
So sad, mine hasn't come.

1343
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:09,880
There we go.

1344
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,120
He also looks kind of like, he looks like he's almost a lion,

1345
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,760
like he's a Zubali zoo.

1346
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,560
Oh yes, another great comparison.

1347
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,640
He does look like a Zubali zoo.

1348
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,520
But in this, but here he looks like he's being portrayed

1349
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,880
by like a cousin of Leno.

1350
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,800
He's like a, he's a Leno relative.

1351
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,480
Like a character from a one season kid show

1352
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,440
where the toys immediately show up at the KB outlet.

1353
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,200
Not the main KB toys, the KB outlet.

1354
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,640
Yeah, yeah, the KB outlet, I hear you.

1355
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,480
Straight to the outlet.

1356
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,960
I have a picture of his full like rig, not his hog,

1357
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,280
his rig, like what he's traveling on.

1358
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,000
There, here, that's gone through.

1359
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,640
But his hog, I'm sure, is Kravitz status.

1360
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,560
Kravitz-esque, for sure.

1361
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:56,920
Yeah.

1362
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,560
I mean, the floats are all,

1363
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,160
I think that's impressive.

1364
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,760
He is so much, if you go back and look at a picture

1365
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,560
of that now, after I've shown you Leonardo Columbus

1366
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,240
over and over again, you look at the picture

1367
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,760
of the Sage of Time and you go, oh my God,

1368
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,400
the Sage of Time looks like some perfectly realized

1369
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,080
character, so well designed.

1370
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,440
I'm dying for Sage of Time.

1371
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,840
And then you go back to Leonardo Columbus

1372
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,440
and you go, what the hell, it's just somebody

1373
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,880
who was rifling through a costume trunk.

1374
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,920
Leonardo Columbus is like, the prince is heading out

1375
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,080
on the road in 96 and he had agreed to name

1376
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,960
all the band members and they were like,

1377
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,480
the press release is going out right now.

1378
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,080
You're just like, Leonardo Columbus, okay, I gotta go.

1379
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:44,040
It's crazy this is coming a year after Animal Kingdom 2,

1380
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:49,600
like a stunning, visually rich, detail rich park.

1381
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,520
Well, you know, it's interesting.

1382
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,040
I'm trying to think, yeah, I know what you're saying,

1383
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,520
because in the context of now, it's like,

1384
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,720
what is the example of something where like, whoa,

1385
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,840
something amazing came and then it's like,

1386
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,840
I'm trying to think, like Cars Line opens

1387
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,160
and then a couple years later, it's the Summer of Heroes.

1388
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,200
And it's like, basically the Summer of Heroes is

1389
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,360
like Black Widow rides out on an ATV, not an ATV,

1390
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,200
like an armored vehicle to some menacing music.

1391
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,480
And that's like, you're supposed to be like,

1392
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,080
hell yeah, Marvel Comics.

1393
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,040
Yeah, Curved Metal kind of gives way to like,

1394
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,680
the Marvel movie shield aesthetic,

1395
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,160
which is not the fanciful like,

1396
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,840
no, it's militaristic.

1397
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,680
More militaristic.

1398
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,760
Which is sort of still what's happening.

1399
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,080
But I'm saying like, it may be an example of where like,

1400
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,200
something like really well realized with,

1401
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,480
well, like a ton of money in it.

1402
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,680
And then it's like, well, we had less money

1403
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,360
and we have to do this in a week

1404
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,680
and it's Leonardo Columbus and yeah,

1405
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,920
that white wig over there,

1406
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,240
just put the white wig on that college student.

1407
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,920
And yeah, that's who he looks like.

1408
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,600
They stripped a costume, they stripped like a snowman

1409
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,440
character they had lying around for Christmas,

1410
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,120
took all the white fluff off,

1411
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:08,280
pasted it on a guy's face and sent him out.

1412
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,880
There was a thing Disney was doing around this time,

1413
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,640
Tapestry of Nations is one of them.

1414
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,960
Light Magic is one of them, which we gotta do soon.

1415
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,440
And to a lesser extent, I don't just like this one as much,

1416
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,960
but Lion King Celebration, which was a parade

1417
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,960
that like stopped and there's shows.

1418
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,320
It's like, it's not a parade, it's a street abrasion.

1419
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:32,000
Bring back parades, fuck this.

1420
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,840
You don't have good, not only like four people

1421
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,600
have a good view of the street abrasion, it's boring.

1422
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,160
A float is cool to look at as long as it will be gone

1423
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,800
in five minutes.

1424
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,560
Like if it passes by, then I don't have time to stop

1425
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,640
and think like, this isn't that good.

1426
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,800
So why all of these things that stop

1427
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,160
and it's a party in the street?

1428
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,560
I don't wanna party with these puppets in the streets.

1429
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:58,000
Street abrasion contains a lot of the word aberration.

1430
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,200
You can't spell aberration

1431
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,280
without some of street abrasion.

1432
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,520
The other thing you mentioned that the parades,

1433
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:10,120
Epcot actively doesn't have parade,

1434
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,200
like not designed for parade.

1435
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,200
It's too tight.

1436
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,240
I remember this thing just congested everything.

1437
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,800
I have marched in a parade at Epcot though.

1438
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,520
Wow, marching band?

1439
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,400
Yes, I marched on Main Street and in Epcot.

1440
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,080
Where'd you go in Epcot?

1441
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,200
We didn't go through World Showcase,

1442
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,560
but we just sort of marched around Future World.

1443
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,720
And I'm trying to remember the exact,

1444
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,280
I don't remember the exact route.

1445
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,320
Little wider.

1446
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,720
A little wider, yeah.

1447
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,360
But it was not as scenic as walking down Main Street

1448
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,720
at night, which was legit awesome.

1449
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,800
I was in the front row.

1450
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,840
I was in the front row of the marching band

1451
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,680
down Main Street. Nice.

1452
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,520
Pretty, that's a hell of an advantage.

1453
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,160
Playing Paul Simon's late in the evening.

1454
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,360
Playing the triangle.

1455
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,040
Ding.

1456
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,760
You know, Jason, you mentioned that the carriages

1457
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,680
could touch you.

1458
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,520
They put their hands on you.

1459
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,360
It's a total liability, but it's in all the commercials.

1460
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,200
Would they?

1461
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,000
It would reach its hand down and you would touch it.

1462
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,080
Was it like the Magic Mike Show Lindsay and I saw in Vegas

1463
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,080
where it would be like the performers will come up

1464
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,960
and touch you, but here's your safe word.

1465
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,400
And if you'd say it to the performers,

1466
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,680
they won't grind their butts on you.

1467
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,520
I mean, I know because I think that show,

1468
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,920
part of the appeal is that like.

1469
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,840
But I think if you go to the Epcot puppet show,

1470
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,600
part of the appeal is you get touched.

1471
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,440
For me at least.

1472
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,680
But they're not lifting you up.

1473
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,640
Like the two puppets aren't lifting you up.

1474
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,640
No, Discman isn't grinding on you.

1475
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,200
He's grinding on you.

1476
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,800
Calling you beautiful.

1477
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,240
I'm gonna put a 20 in this age of times, butt crack.

1478
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,840
This age of time like,

1479
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,040
is just puts you up against a post.

1480
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,480
Please let me go.

1481
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,720
Please let me go, sir.

1482
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,080
They were so pushing that aspect of it that in fact,

1483
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:01,080
the main song that I realize now was not only used

1484
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,120
in the show, but also then sung in the halftime show

1485
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,400
by Christina Aguilera and Enrique Iglesias.

1486
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,240
Hey ah.

1487
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,080
Hey ah.

1488
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:08,920
Hey ah.

1489
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,760
Hey ah.

1490
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,480
Ah na na no no no.

1491
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,720
But that was so much, I mean, Ferngully,

1492
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,520
like so much of this in the 90s.

1493
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,720
What I don't like.

1494
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,920
And so many levels removed from any sort of actual

1495
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,640
indigenous chants or world music kind of stuff.

1496
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,200
But what I was heading for though,

1497
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,880
there's a specific song called

1498
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,120
Celebrate the Future Hand in Hand.

1499
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,080
Oh, okay.

1500
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,280
The chorus contains the words,

1501
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,640
put your hands on the future.

1502
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,120
Ick.

1503
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,080
Weird.

1504
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,280
Put your hands on it.

1505
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,120
It's so close to that.

1506
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,440
That's the same thing they said at Magic Mike.

1507
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,640
So close to like the excess tech,

1508
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,120
like alien encounters, sinister company,

1509
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,120
it's just a little different.

1510
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,320
A little, yeah, one notch on the dial.

1511
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,840
One notch down.

1512
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:00,680
Do we know?

1513
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,440
I might not have it timed up well enough, but.

1514
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:10,560
Put your hand on the future.

1515
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,240
No, you, no.

1516
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,080
How did I get it?

1517
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,240
Put your hand on the future, baby.

1518
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,760
Put your hand on the,

1519
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,760
actually singular is the worst.

1520
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,440
Sky Net is the beginning of a new era.

1521
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,640
I mean, that's what I think probably.

1522
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,960
Like I had seen the Terminator show so many times

1523
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:31,400
at Universal, they show that clip of Judgment Day.

1524
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,840
I was like, all right, gotta be ready.

1525
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,440
Put your hand on the future.

1526
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,720
Put your hand on.

1527
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,680
Has anyone ever said that in a sexual lease?

1528
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,160
Add to Magic Mike.

1529
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,680
And then Pony started playing.

1530
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:51,360
I think I would forgive the creepiness of this

1531
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,000
if Pony was the score.

1532
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,840
Can you imagine?

1533
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,920
And they all, if when they said,

1534
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,040
and now the Millennium Walk,

1535
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,640
bow, bow, bow, they all shook around the Pony.

1536
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,600
Now I'm in.

1537
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,960
Is there a Disney Pony that they could make new lyrics

1538
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,280
for it to make it not sexual?

1539
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,880
Like Mambo number five, in the TV special,

1540
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,560
which was just made by a local UPN,

1541
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,040
you can find it, a local affiliate

1542
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,920
made an hour and a half special about this.

1543
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,960
They play a clip of the Lou Baga Mambo number five

1544
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,320
where he names all the characters.

1545
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,680
He's like, a little bit of Minnie in my.

1546
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,960
Oh boy.

1547
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,160
I don't know if it's the same special,

1548
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,920
but there was a lot of,

1549
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,920
I noticed some Fat Boy Slim and some Moby.

1550
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,960
We are, that's, if you put your hand on the future,

1551
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,440
the future at that time seemed like it was gonna be DJs

1552
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,040
and trip hop.

1553
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,080
South side, yeah, here we are now.

1554
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:50,920
Yeah, yeah.

1555
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,400
Maybe that's a little later, but.

1556
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,080
But Moby turned out to be just the future of, you know,

1557
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,680
tweeting things that annoy people.

1558
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,520
Sleaze bag, yeah.

1559
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,600
Well guess what?

1560
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:03,160
Now the great Millennium Walk continues away

1561
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,760
from this puppet thing.

1562
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,080
As far away as we can go across the lagoon.

1563
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,160
I think we should head over to the Millennium Village.

1564
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,000
Yes.

1565
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,920
The Millennium Village, which was a temporary indoor

1566
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,160
like tenet experience that was sort of off

1567
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,720
by the International Gateway sort of.

1568
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,400
Yeah, sort of in between Canada and Britain.

1569
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,760
And this was the thing that I kind of like suggested.

1570
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,800
This is what kind of started us talking about doing this

1571
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,840
because I was like, oh, we should do the Millennium Village.

1572
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,360
Not forgetting about the parade and the hand and everything.

1573
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,120
Not forgetting about putting your hand on the future.

1574
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,880
That's really what Mickey was doing

1575
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,280
in the spaceship Earth Ball.

1576
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,120
Oh yeah.

1577
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:46,960
It's putting his hand on the future.

1578
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,800
It all ties together.

1579
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:51,240
But so there was this temporary thing

1580
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:56,240
for a couple years that in a lot of much smaller stations

1581
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,280
than the World Showcase pavilions,

1582
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:04,360
it was like, you know, a couple dozen different countries

1583
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,760
not represented in World Showcase,

1584
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,240
all with these little exhibits.

1585
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,680
In some cases, it's very small.

1586
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,400
It's like a desk and a representative from the country.

1587
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,240
And in some cases, it's a much bigger themed experience.

1588
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,040
And in one case, a ride.

1589
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:18,880
Yes.

1590
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,400
I did not go into this thing.

1591
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,240
I never went to this thing.

1592
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,320
It also really evoked the names,

1593
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,840
it evoked like Olympic Village to me.

1594
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,000
Yeah, that seems about what they were going for maybe.

1595
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,920
Which the Olympic Village, I think now,

1596
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,680
this episode's already a little sexual,

1597
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,000
but the Olympic Village now I just think

1598
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,960
is Olympians having sex with each other.

1599
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,280
That's what apparently.

1600
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,960
Which is what you hear about all the international,

1601
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,520
like the international students working in Epcot

1602
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,840
for the summer, that's whatever that dorm is.

1603
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:49,800
Oh, right, right, right.

1604
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,080
It's a crazy party place.

1605
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,760
So it very well may have been, maybe it reached its zenith

1606
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,160
when the, all the, like, oh boy,

1607
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:01,080
here comes Brazil and Scotland and all the countries

1608
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:01,920
that aren't usually around.

1609
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,760
Hey, Leonardo Columbus is around.

1610
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,560
Put your hand on the future.

1611
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,640
I went to the Millennium Village.

1612
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,360
I was, it was there, we saw it, we walked in.

1613
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:18,000
We were very, it was essentially, yeah, World Showcase 2.

1614
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,480
Do you remember being excited about it?

1615
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,320
Do you remember like going, oh, we're gonna go down?

1616
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,120
But I mean, like, do you remember like going,

1617
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,080
I know about it, I'm excited to go do it?

1618
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,880
Or was it just there and you were experiencing it?

1619
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:30,680
I think we, that trip we stayed at the boardwalks

1620
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,560
and we were coming in through that way

1621
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,760
and did kind of have a little bit of like,

1622
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,240
oh, what's this, sort of thing.

1623
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,680
It was something you happened upon as opposed to,

1624
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,520
was excited about before.

1625
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,440
If you happen upon it, it was very like,

1626
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:45,240
oh, there's a whole thing going on here.

1627
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:48,840
And specifically, and I was trying so hard

1628
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,440
to pin down which country it was.

1629
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:56,440
I remember one of the booths, a very nice cast member

1630
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:02,560
said, come in, sit down, I'll pour you all tea.

1631
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,920
And he gave us dates and he was like,

1632
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,920
this is hospitality in my country.

1633
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,720
Like, and I cannot for the life of me figure out

1634
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,560
which one it was.

1635
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,600
I think it might be Eritrea,

1636
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,520
but they said that was a coffee ceremony,

1637
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:21,240
but that was a similar like, come sit, sit with us.

1638
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,720
This is hospitality.

1639
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:23,560
This is-

1640
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:24,400
It must be, right?

1641
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,240
I guess so.

1642
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,080
I saw that in the special,

1643
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,880
like that's a big part of their culture is, yay,

1644
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,560
we're gonna offer you things and we wanna get to know you.

1645
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:33,840
And it was this like newer country at the time.

1646
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:34,760
Tea and dates.

1647
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,920
It was probably a Middle Eastern country,

1648
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,960
but I don't think they were doing that

1649
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,240
in the Saudi Arabia pavilion.

1650
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,080
I don't think, yes.

1651
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,480
Which seems like one of the more expensive ones.

1652
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,360
Yeah, Saudi Arabia, even at the time kind of,

1653
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,480
Saudi Arabia is an odd country.

1654
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,840
I mean, it is run by the House of Saud.

1655
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:01,840
It is the family that, essentially one family runs it

1656
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:07,280
and they subscribe to a form of Islam called Wahhabism.

1657
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:13,280
And that is a far right fundamentalist form of Islam

1658
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,040
that pretty much just like Saudi Arabia

1659
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,680
and Qatar subscribe to.

1660
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:19,520
That's it.

1661
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:24,520
So yeah, it's a little bonkers Saudi Arabia was here.

1662
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:27,600
Yes.

1663
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:32,600
Especially with them essentially doing 9-11 two years later

1664
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,960
and then killing Khashoggi very recently.

1665
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,760
It's been a crazy millennium.

1666
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,160
It's been a crazy millennium.

1667
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,560
For them through the Saudi perspective, sure.

1668
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:50,640
Yeah, but here they came and built a moving story book.

1669
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,680
It was an interactive book.

1670
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,480
I wrote down just like keywords

1671
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,240
of what some of the countries had

1672
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,760
and it's their driest bullets in my notes.

1673
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:06,320
Scotland, a golf game, Saudi Arabia moving book, Sweden,

1674
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,440
four 30-foot tall eggs.

1675
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,760
So, okay, okay.

1676
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,360
So the golf game, each hole would teach you

1677
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,800
about a different innovation that came out of Scotland.

1678
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:17,920
Like lasers.

1679
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,000
So you putted.

1680
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,840
You putted.

1681
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:21,960
The ball goes in the hole

1682
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,920
and then a story about lasers is told.

1683
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:29,640
The four Sweden eggs each represented a different season.

1684
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:30,720
Yes. In Sweden.

1685
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,400
And with that, what's my note on that?

1686
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,480
That, yeah, okay.

1687
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:43,480
So they have, there's like keywords around of every,

1688
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,040
you know, that are important to each season.

1689
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:49,600
Like whether it's a spring or fall in Sweden.

1690
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:54,600
And for summer, some of the words that signify summer

1691
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:59,600
in Sweden include strawberries, joggers, crayfish,

1692
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,680
herring and schnapps, and maple.

1693
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,080
Herring and schnapps.

1694
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,680
I guess so.

1695
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,560
Like that was projected up on a wall.

1696
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,720
Summer, time for herring.

1697
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,400
Jason, herring, what's your feeling on it?

1698
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,440
I haven't had herring that often.

1699
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,280
I don't think I've ever had herring.

1700
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,280
I like sardines.

1701
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,360
I like lox.

1702
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,720
I like sardines, yeah.

1703
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:22,560
Yeah.

1704
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,480
Keep them in the house sometimes.

1705
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,880
That's more of a summer thing.

1706
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:27,720
Herring summer for you.

1707
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,000
More of a summer fish.

1708
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
It's a herring summer next year, I hear.

1709
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,840
The herring's been good this summer.

1710
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,840
Cool.

1711
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:38,680
Yeah.

1712
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:42,800
Wait, I'm reading about the yurt.

1713
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,360
There's a yurt where a bunch of central Asian countries are.

1714
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:49,880
So too, there was an artisan craft area

1715
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,400
and you would have to go through a big yurt.

1716
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,000
That actually I think sounds badass.

1717
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,600
I think that sounds great.

1718
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,480
Like an actual yurt they brought over from,

1719
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,920
I think it was the Krugas Republic.

1720
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,080
Yeah.

1721
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,320
Jason, do you have photos of yourself

1722
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,000
running around this Millennium Village?

1723
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,840
Do you know?

1724
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,680
I don't know.

1725
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,520
I'd have to look.

1726
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,040
I think we only went like the first day.

1727
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,680
It was a quick thing probably.

1728
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:17,840
Like visit in and out.

1729
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,600
I don't know that we revisited the Millennium Village.

1730
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:26,760
You didn't take time to revisit the Saudi community scrapbook

1731
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:29,840
where you pick up a phone and a Saudi Arabian tells you

1732
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,560
their accomplishments, their dreams,

1733
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:33,000
and what their lives are like.

1734
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,800
Is that just a recording hopefully?

1735
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:37,960
That wasn't like a phone line

1736
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,840
in the middle of a town square or something.

1737
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:43,960
I tell you, there was an open phone in Jeddah

1738
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,200
that anybody could just pick up.

1739
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,360
And it was like, there was instruction,

1740
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:50,240
like you're gonna be talking to a tourist probably

1741
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,280
in a Florida theme park.

1742
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,920
And just explain your dreams to them.

1743
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,040
Say nice things because we've got like a dozen

1744
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,520
different secret police.

1745
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,240
That's a good way to weep people out.

1746
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,240
Yes. Yeah.

1747
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,480
Monitor their call on the phone of dreams.

1748
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,320
Sure.

1749
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,160
Yeah, it's interesting.

1750
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,640
I like, I mean, of course, like the optimum,

1751
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,280
I like the idea of it.

1752
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,280
Oh, we wanna represent more countries around the world.

1753
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:20,680
Like the idea on its surface is good.

1754
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,720
Brazil, there was like a soccer gate,

1755
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,040
like you controlled a soccer game with paddles.

1756
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,000
And they also told you about the rainforest.

1757
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,160
Chile, I think this sounds cool,

1758
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,680
gave guests an overview of harvesting fog

1759
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,440
through a system of nets to convert it

1760
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,320
to drinking water and for crops.

1761
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,240
I think that's legitimately interesting.

1762
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:44,840
But some of these were big, like we said,

1763
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,720
were bigger than others.

1764
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:49,880
Some of the smaller, some countries just crammed into

1765
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,800
what fell under the Expo 2000.

1766
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,760
So like exhibits from the Expo 2000,

1767
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:02,560
which was a part of a display of exhibits

1768
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,360
from the World's Fair 2000,

1769
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,320
which happened in Hanover, Germany,

1770
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:07,960
and seems like a disaster.

1771
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,280
Like it doesn't seem like they went well.

1772
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,120
Okay.

1773
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:14,600
And this is the, it seemed like it was just confusing.

1774
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,920
Like it didn't have a clear message.

1775
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,760
Sort of like the, if you can,

1776
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:22,160
listeners look up the Millennium Dome.

1777
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,800
That was London's big attempt at a Millennium thing

1778
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,840
that is now the O2 arena.

1779
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,360
They built this giant Epcotty kind of thing.

1780
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,640
There's a very good, very long Twitter thread

1781
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:34,760
about the Millennium Dome.

1782
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,440
And it's kind of fascinating.

1783
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,680
But another thing that wasn't super successful

1784
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,800
tried to be hopeful about the Millennium,

1785
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,120
but tried to be everything to everyone.

1786
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:49,640
And then that means it's just kind of directionless.

1787
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,120
Sure. Yeah.

1788
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:56,120
Like, you know, Fantasia 2000 around the same time.

1789
01:09:56,160 --> 01:10:00,560
The 2000 was an odd era of like, okay, so it's, you know,

1790
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,280
international and diverse and the message of hope.

1791
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:08,200
Okay, but why is it like good or interesting though?

1792
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,920
Cause hope and stage of time.

1793
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:11,920
Dreams, dreams.

1794
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,360
And drop in dreams.

1795
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,160
Okay. So get in there.

1796
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,000
Magic. Go.

1797
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,760
All the words.

1798
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,760
Of course the Millennium Village is also probably

1799
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:25,000
the most controversial part of the Millennium celebration

1800
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,840
because of just as soon as it opened,

1801
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,360
Disney immediately got flack for the presentation

1802
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,800
of the Israel Pavilion.

1803
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,640
Israel.

1804
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,360
And this is probably the main thing to talk about.

1805
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,200
Yeah.

1806
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,880
And just the strangest thing of all of this.

1807
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,080
This is wild.

1808
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:43,360
I mean, this was probably the most intensive

1809
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,680
exhibit represented.

1810
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:50,080
I believe the state of Israel gave millions of dollars

1811
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,000
to help start this.

1812
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,040
That is why it is the only one with a ride.

1813
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,720
$1.8 million from the Israeli Foreign Ministry.

1814
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:57,560
Yeah.

1815
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:02,160
And yes, there was a ride and there was a lot of,

1816
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:05,480
it seemed like before the thing even opened

1817
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:09,760
is when a lot of the concern came because there was,

1818
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,320
I don't know if it was justified fears

1819
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,400
or if Disney had put out something that indicated this,

1820
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,040
but there was a lot of like, well,

1821
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,520
is this exhibit going to call in,

1822
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:23,400
is this going to call Jerusalem the capital of Israel,

1823
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,120
which would be a problem to make that declaration.

1824
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:28,040
I can't tell if it ever did.

1825
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,760
So here, okay, the answer is twofold.

1826
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:34,240
One, the exhibit when it opened did not call it

1827
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,480
the capital of Israel.

1828
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:42,480
It heavily leans towards Jerusalem is the heart of Israel.

1829
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:48,040
Despite being a disputed city at the opening ceremonies,

1830
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:51,160
the director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry

1831
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:54,360
called it the capital of Israel three times.

1832
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,200
Oh.

1833
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:59,480
Three times to roaring applause.

1834
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,640
Okay.

1835
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:05,400
So now, disputed city between

1836
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:10,200
I believe this is the Six Day War,

1837
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,920
they captured Jerusalem from Jordan.

1838
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,640
I'm not 100% exactly sure on the history,

1839
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,320
but it's a disputed city.

1840
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:21,600
And who could have predicted 20 years later,

1841
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,520
failed casino magnet Donald Trump would make it a,

1842
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,120
like would make the thing Disney was worried about doing

1843
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,200
or Disney was getting in trouble for

1844
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:35,640
moves the American embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.

1845
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:39,000
Who could have predicted that happening at the time?

1846
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
A man who at the time was like, you know,

1847
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,080
trying to get laid after the end of days premiere.

1848
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,160
He's just like scoping out like,

1849
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,840
hmm, any models here at the city of angels?

1850
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,120
And soon enough he'll be.

1851
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,640
He's at like a Goo Goo Dolls concert or something.

1852
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:00,480
Yeah.

1853
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:04,440
Who could have thought like half of the country of Israel

1854
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,480
now named in honor of Donald,

1855
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,160
like buildings and neighborhoods.

1856
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:12,120
Do you think this age of time saw it in a prophecy?

1857
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,480
That's why he went away.

1858
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,440
He did it.

1859
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,040
He's like, no, I am out of here.

1860
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,440
I'm going off the grid.

1861
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,760
Once my dancing obligations are through,

1862
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:23,040
I need to go off and think for a while.

1863
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,960
I know what's happening this millennium

1864
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,720
and it freaks me out.

1865
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,520
Really strange.

1866
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:34,320
The exhibit did call Jerusalem the capital of the millennium

1867
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,600
and the heart of the Israeli people.

1868
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,680
That is wild.

1869
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,520
Like you cannot just build settlements

1870
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,600
on top of the millennium, easy.

1871
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,600
Like you can't just claim the millennium.

1872
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,680
You can't just bulldoze the millennium and claim it.

1873
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:48,680
Jesus.

1874
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,280
Yeah, the capital of the century.

1875
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,280
What do you mean?

1876
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,200
That's a place on a time.

1877
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,840
What do you, I don't get it.

1878
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,640
And I mean, and of course,

1879
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,840
like it probably goes without saying

1880
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,040
there is no representation of the Palestinian people

1881
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,320
in this pavilion.

1882
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,720
There's like no mention.

1883
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,880
Cause they didn't pay 1.8 million dollars.

1884
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,400
You gotta pony up the money, Jason.

1885
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,240
Well, sure.

1886
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:15,000
But like Disney must have,

1887
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,280
I mean, was the situation in Israel and Palestine

1888
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,960
complicated in 1999?

1889
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,040
Well, it was a year that ends in a number.

1890
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,440
So the answer is yes.

1891
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:25,440
Of course it was.

1892
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,480
So I don't know how they thought

1893
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:30,160
all of this millennium stuff is so like

1894
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,840
aimed at being non-offensive.

1895
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:32,680
That they didn't,

1896
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,800
they were like caught off guard by this happening.

1897
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,040
Why did they even wade into the waters here?

1898
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,600
I get, well, cause then the money is the answer.

1899
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,920
But the, it all backfired

1900
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,880
because Arab and Muslim groups were called,

1901
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,520
were threatening a worldwide boycott of Disney parks

1902
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,160
and maybe films and more.

1903
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,000
Yes.

1904
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,880
And the threat of the, yeah, the full Arab boycott was,

1905
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,000
it freaked everybody out.

1906
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,160
So they made sure to back off of the language

1907
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,640
and be more careful with it.

1908
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:05,640
And apparently one of the people who pressured Disney

1909
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:10,920
on this was Saudi Prince Al-Waleed,

1910
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,160
Al-Waleed Bintolal,

1911
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:17,160
who is the guy who basically bailed out Euro Disney

1912
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,680
for a long time, owned the majority of it.

1913
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,520
Oh my God.

1914
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,840
Now owns 10% of Euro Disney still.

1915
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:24,760
Wow.

1916
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:29,760
He is also a major shareholder in Planet Hollywood.

1917
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,000
I knew you were gonna say it.

1918
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,240
Honestly, as soon as I was like, yeah.

1919
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,160
It's all the dots are connecting.

1920
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,280
Earl flashed in my head.

1921
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,520
I go, is it gonna be an Earl?

1922
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,360
It's gonna be.

1923
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:40,400
I'm gonna, I wanna be in this story.

1924
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,520
I'm gonna be in it.

1925
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:47,480
And the thing I really associate Prince Al-Waleed with

1926
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,040
was his announcement, complete with a press conference,

1927
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,760
that he was starting a company

1928
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,800
called Kingdom Entertainment,

1929
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,880
which was supposed to be a theme park endeavor,

1930
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:02,880
mainly driven by him and the King of Pop, Michael Jackson.

1931
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:05,440
They did a press conference about this.

1932
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:09,120
Like, I'm so happy to be with Prince Al-Waleed.

1933
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,400
And not only that, as they got further now,

1934
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,240
obviously they're, they, as you probably know,

1935
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,280
Michael Jackson did not build a Saudi Arabian theme park,

1936
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:21,280
but if he had, the rides were to be built by Gary Goddard,

1937
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:24,720
evil son of a bitch, like allegedly,

1938
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,840
tied up in Encino, Brent's Singapore pool party,

1939
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,880
so there is a photo of Al-Waleed, Michael Jackson,

1940
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,800
and Gary Goddard all happily shaking hands.

1941
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,640
Amazing, amazing.

1942
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,480
Wonderful.

1943
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,560
Again, that sinister, with the perspective of time,

1944
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:42,760
like a lot of sinister stuff going on in the village.

1945
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,080
Wonderful.

1946
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,080
Yes.

1947
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,600
The journey to Jerusalem, yeah, I couldn't,

1948
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,760
that ride isn't really documented well.

1949
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,600
Not at all.

1950
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,200
Did you go on the ride, Jason?

1951
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,880
I don't remember going on the ride.

1952
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,720
Okay.

1953
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:59,120
I must, we must have walked through it.

1954
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:02,720
A lot of these smaller, like the sum of all thrills,

1955
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:05,200
the build your own, the design your own roller coaster,

1956
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:10,200
any rides, like, ad hoc rides in pavilions

1957
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:13,320
tend to have incredibly bad wait times.

1958
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,240
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,

1959
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,560
cause they aren't like built to be there forever, so yeah.

1960
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,000
Oh yes, so you're totally right.

1961
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,880
Yeah, I remember a weird temporary ride

1962
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:23,120
in Innoventions out here that was like way too long

1963
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,720
of a wait to just sit in a VR helmet

1964
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:27,680
and get around in a chair.

1965
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:32,280
So there is insanely one person I know

1966
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,920
who for sure has gone, went on the temporary ride,

1967
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:39,760
journey to Jerusalem, and defying all logic,

1968
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,200
or perhaps the most logical thing,

1969
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,960
that person is Bugmane.

1970
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:43,800
Mm.

1971
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:48,280
Our pal Bugmane definitely,

1972
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,360
and he talked about this a long time ago to me,

1973
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:54,920
and brought it up like, you know, the Jerusalem ride.

1974
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,120
I'm like, what are you talking about?

1975
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,720
You're out of your mind, but it did happen.

1976
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:03,600
And I texted him to ask his thoughts on it.

1977
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,360
Let me just read his thoughts.

1978
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,480
It was a temporary simulator ride,

1979
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:11,800
like if a fair tried to build a Star Tours really fast.

1980
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,480
I asked him what happened on the ride,

1981
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:16,400
because it is truly not documented, it's impossible to find.

1982
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,720
And he said, you went into the pages of the Old Testament,

1983
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:22,800
like into a parchment,

1984
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:27,240
guided by a guy dressed as an Old Testament king.

1985
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:28,920
Wow.

1986
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,600
And then like, whoa, that's insane.

1987
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,360
Come, come with me.

1988
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:38,040
And then I said, and then you fly to Jerusalem.

1989
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,440
And he confirmed yes.

1990
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,640
I did see one other account of this

1991
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,840
that said like, imagine if you were being shaken around

1992
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:50,480
while watching already shaky camcorder footage

1993
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,920
of the streets of Jerusalem.

1994
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,000
That's apparently what this was like.

1995
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,160
Bug went on to say, it made me sick.

1996
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,480
Not because it was about Israel.

1997
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,600
I was gonna throw, I was just almost gonna throw up,

1998
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:03,680
because of motion sickness.

1999
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:04,560
It was hot.

2000
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,240
It was a muggy simulation ride

2001
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:11,960
that did not sync up properly with what the chair was doing.

2002
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,520
So that's Bugmane's thoughts.

2003
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,040
And then he added buzz buzz, skittle, scattle.

2004
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:16,880
Oh, great.

2005
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,440
You said trademark.

2006
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:21,920
So, our man on the ground back in the 2000s,

2007
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,840
if that's not simulation, we're honest with a simulation ride.

2008
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,680
I caught it, yeah.

2009
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:28,920
So it sounds great.

2010
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:31,600
Journey to Jerusalem seems like a winner.

2011
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,280
When I Googled like Millennium Village,

2012
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:37,760
journey to Jerusalem, immediately got half a dozen

2013
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,680
different newspaper articles about the controversy.

2014
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,560
And if one of them pointed out,

2015
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,520
I think it was the Orlando Sentinel one,

2016
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:50,520
that this is, you know, when they threatened the Arab League

2017
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:56,680
and others threatened a boycott of Disney,

2018
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,600
that hit much, they're like,

2019
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,000
this is a season of boycotts for Disney,

2020
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,920
because I don't know what happened

2021
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,360
that would cause this reaction.

2022
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,880
But like the Southern Baptist Convention

2023
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,440
was like poo pooing Disney,

2024
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:13,440
because I don't, Jane wore pants in Tarzan or something.

2025
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,920
Like, I don't, but it was very clearly,

2026
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,520
like they were very clearly trying to make the distinction

2027
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,920
of like, yeah, one of these boycotts

2028
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:24,440
would be billions of people potentially.

2029
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,360
And one of these boycotts would be a couple

2030
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,400
of religious nuts in America.

2031
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,680
Like, so they literally said, like,

2032
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:35,720
they have not been able to see if there has been any,

2033
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,080
you know, big effect from the Southern Baptist boycott

2034
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,560
or what have you.

2035
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,760
But they had to take care of this

2036
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,320
or else the hope of eventual Jerusalem Disneyland

2037
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,320
was not gonna come to pass.

2038
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,280
Yeah.

2039
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,320
Like it's disputed now,

2040
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,520
but it won't be disputed as soon

2041
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,320
as they build a theme park there.

2042
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,800
I mean, there's rumors of over the years

2043
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,680
of them building in all sorts of places.

2044
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:57,520
Yeah.

2045
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,400
So who knows what, I mean, that was-

2046
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,960
Sure there's feasibility surveys.

2047
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:02,800
Yeah.

2048
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:08,280
I think like, I mean, the Middle East

2049
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,960
did not have a good showing at Millennium Village.

2050
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,200
Like Saudi Arabia and Israel were the represented.

2051
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,200
There's so many other countries-

2052
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,000
Which caused due to their proximity

2053
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,040
caused a powerful Saudi prince

2054
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:21,760
who bought their European park.

2055
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:22,880
Yeah.

2056
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,040
The only reason it's still around, Saudi money.

2057
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:28,200
He's like, hey, this is real thing.

2058
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,240
Maybe don't go for it guys.

2059
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,200
When Europe was in the dark ages,

2060
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:35,640
Arab mathematicians were inventing modern mathematics.

2061
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,120
Like this could have had an amazing represent.

2062
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,520
Asia also very underrepresented.

2063
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,520
Obviously Disney was just,

2064
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,280
as we were saying, it was just money.

2065
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,960
It would have been nice for like a total,

2066
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,200
like full picture representation.

2067
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,160
Yeah. Sure.

2068
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:52,720
But like hardly anything from Asia, which was odd.

2069
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,840
Well, they're all jammed into the yurt.

2070
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,560
All the Asian countries get in the yurt.

2071
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:59,920
Yeah, I guess it's-

2072
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,960
All that way, that's no, Venezuela is also in the yurt

2073
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,280
in Greece, there wasn't all Asian.

2074
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,880
But the, now they did now,

2075
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,240
there are one more description I found of the ride,

2076
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,760
which was eight minutes long.

2077
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,160
That's a very long ride.

2078
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,400
You get to go through stories of faith

2079
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,120
that corroborates the Old Testament thing.

2080
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:20,720
A dizzying dash to scenes of Abraham and Jesus

2081
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,760
and references to Muhammad.

2082
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:23,600
Wow.

2083
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,640
But you don't see Muhammad.

2084
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,200
So that's interesting because is there,

2085
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,120
and I'm trying to think of like on Spaceship Earth,

2086
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,240
is there religious,

2087
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,280
what's the closest thing to something being religious?

2088
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,120
They mention Arab and Jewish scholars preserving-

2089
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:37,960
Right, texts.

2090
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:40,880
Texts after the burning of the library at Alexandria.

2091
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,240
But like Jesus isn't in a ride anywhere in Disney parks.

2092
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:45,080
That's pretty nuts.

2093
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:46,520
For a couple of years, there's a ride

2094
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:47,600
where you went to see Jesus.

2095
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:48,640
That's what I'm saying, like-

2096
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,440
And nobody thought to film it?

2097
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,360
Right.

2098
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,200
That's it.

2099
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,200
I mean, did they just get so much money

2100
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,400
that they were like, whatever you want to do in here

2101
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,800
is fine, or just about anything.

2102
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,480
It's interesting because I'm trying to think of another,

2103
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:04,360
like Lincoln probably talks about God,

2104
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,200
but it's not such a-

2105
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,120
Some religion, yeah, yeah.

2106
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:07,960
Yeah.

2107
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:12,000
Like, and I'm sure it's like the general God mentions,

2108
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
but nothing.

2109
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:13,840
I mean-

2110
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:14,680
There's no Jesus.

2111
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:17,320
Could have been a very interesting,

2112
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:22,320
like Christianity and Judaism and Muslims,

2113
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,880
like all pulled from a similar,

2114
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,440
there's more similarities than difference that like

2115
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,040
there could have been something.

2116
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:31,880
Yeah.

2117
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:32,720
That'd be a nice message.

2118
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,840
Wait, I did find more.

2119
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,920
There's a tour guide, like somebody,

2120
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:38,720
they do that thing where somebody's like not on the screen

2121
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,600
and then they're shown a video.

2122
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,840
And then the person in the video talks to them.

2123
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,520
He appears amidst bright light.

2124
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:48,360
He says he is David, keeper of the stories.

2125
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,960
And there's so much stuff Jerusalem to explore.

2126
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,640
And then the simulators take you through the city.

2127
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,120
So that's, so there is a character,

2128
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:58,960
David, keeper of the stories takes you to see Jesus.

2129
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,160
This was a ride that was there that nobody,

2130
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,680
that is barely, there's not even like a full recap

2131
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:04,800
of what the ride was.

2132
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,520
Does he have a tiny blue alien friend?

2133
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:09,640
That's my question.

2134
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:12,120
Who himself is Christ like?

2135
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:12,960
Yeah.

2136
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,880
Who was persecuted and laughed at for his message of love.

2137
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,200
And his root beer farts.

2138
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:24,320
Now that leaves blue 32 as the closest depiction of Jesus

2139
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,120
in a themed attraction anywhere.

2140
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:26,960
Oh yeah, I think that's right.

2141
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,000
I mean, where there's probably like some Bible themed park

2142
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,040
that shows you Jesus.

2143
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:30,880
Outside of that.

2144
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,220
Here's a question for the listener.

2145
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:34,360
Is there a Jesus robot anywhere?

2146
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,280
Oh, good question.

2147
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,120
I mean, we should.

2148
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:36,960
It's gotta be in the Holy Land.

2149
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:37,800
I mean, let me Google it.

2150
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,240
Holy Land Park in Florida.

2151
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,240
Let me just Google Jesus animatronic.

2152
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:42,360
I think so.

2153
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:43,920
I just can't name it offhand.

2154
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,120
And this is a thing, here's a whole area

2155
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:49,080
we haven't gotten into guys is religious theme parks.

2156
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:49,920
We have not done.

2157
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:50,760
That's true.

2158
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:54,160
We did Heritage USA, the bizarre collapse

2159
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,920
of Dogpatch USA, but the real Heritage USA

2160
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,400
Jim Baker's Park we haven't done.

2161
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,240
Oh yeah.

2162
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:00,680
There's a whole bunch of that kinda.

2163
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:03,680
There's even in Costa Mesa, there's like a weird

2164
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:07,680
like a virtual reality Bible theater you can walk through.

2165
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:08,520
Wow.

2166
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,760
We have not done any religious.

2167
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:11,600
Yeah.

2168
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:12,440
We gotta do that.

2169
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,400
Probably time.

2170
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:14,840
Any results?

2171
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,680
It looks like maybe there's like a Jesus

2172
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:19,200
that kind of comes out of the ground,

2173
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:22,520
but it doesn't look like there's a full like arms,

2174
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,720
head moving, talking.

2175
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:27,320
There might be, you'd call it technically an animatronic

2176
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,280
cause it like comes up and like.

2177
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,200
Katy Perry coming from under the stage.

2178
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:34,400
Yeah, it's like Katy Perry coming from under the stage.

2179
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,640
Dollywood Jesus.

2180
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:41,080
There's no way there's a full robot Jesus in Dollywood.

2181
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,760
I think Dollywood is very religious.

2182
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,840
I think there would be a.

2183
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:44,680
I'm just saying like.

2184
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:45,520
Good question.

2185
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,080
If there was gonna be anywhere in the United States.

2186
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,560
Yeah, I think.

2187
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,400
Bye.

2188
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,360
Bye Lindsey.

2189
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,360
I think that Dollywood is very religious,

2190
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:56,480
but I don't know that, oh, maybe I'm wrong.

2191
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,240
There's, I wonder if anyone plays anyway.

2192
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,760
Robot is a whole other level.

2193
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,920
Yeah, robot I don't see.

2194
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,920
I don't see.

2195
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,520
But I think that what they clearly,

2196
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,040
and also, okay, if they wanna get out of the controversy

2197
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:14,040
of if Israel and Jerusalem are names that court controversy,

2198
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:17,520
they should have called this thing Jesus the ride.

2199
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,520
And then nobody would ever forget about it.

2200
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:20,360
Yeah, that's true.

2201
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,200
Yes.

2202
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,360
No one has done that definitively.

2203
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,200
Yeah.

2204
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,240
Look, just this week, there's someone,

2205
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,320
there was a lot of news stories about that Jesus video game.

2206
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,160
Really?

2207
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:32,720
First person Jesus video game on Steam.

2208
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,000
Is that coming out or is that out?

2209
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,520
I just looked up Jesus the ride and it's,

2210
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:41,120
there's some songs, but there's no ride, yeah.

2211
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,520
All right, it's time.

2212
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:45,560
I mean, I think we can just talk to Mel Gibson about it.

2213
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,680
He's probably got some sort of financier

2214
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:48,720
who might be interested in that.

2215
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:51,320
Anybody could front the money, yeah, absolutely.

2216
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:52,360
Yeah.

2217
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:55,000
All right, so they made a big mistake here.

2218
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,840
But what an insane thing.

2219
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,200
What a weird.

2220
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:03,360
It's, yeah, there's many layers.

2221
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:07,520
Many layers, political issues, money.

2222
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:12,520
We're talking about the oldest dispute in the world

2223
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:17,960
that's only a few hairs away from the Bryan Singer

2224
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:20,800
and Zeno ring.

2225
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:21,640
Yes, that's.

2226
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:24,040
Like I said, there's so much happening in this little,

2227
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,640
I think what we're describing right here

2228
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,680
is the most disputed territory in Disney,

2229
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:29,520
in all of Disney World.

2230
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:30,360
Yes.

2231
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,360
There's one more thing we haven't mentioned

2232
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:33,360
from the Millennium Village.

2233
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:37,280
The World Culture Game Quiz Show,

2234
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:42,280
which was a game show where people were playing

2235
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:45,760
and people would answer questions about games

2236
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:46,600
around the world.

2237
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:49,680
And it would be like Team Checkers, Team Backgammon.

2238
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:54,960
This game show was sponsored by the World Bank,

2239
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,440
a kind of shady, non-governmental,

2240
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:01,560
international development organization

2241
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:03,800
similar to the International Monetary Fund

2242
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,920
or the World Trade Organization.

2243
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,560
And these were the sorts of groups

2244
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:10,760
that they were protesting at the Battle for Seattle.

2245
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:15,760
So they sponsored this game show and it was constantly,

2246
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:22,760
controversy just follows these sorts of groups.

2247
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:27,280
Like the World Bank is run by very economic wealthy nations

2248
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:31,160
but helps develop less wealthy nations.

2249
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,800
And they did a fun game show.

2250
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,160
And then they have a fun game show.

2251
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:38,160
And they, at the end of the game show,

2252
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:40,640
they tell you about different World Bank projects

2253
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:41,640
that are going on.

2254
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:43,600
It's like, that's okay.

2255
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,840
This is a little sinister.

2256
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,960
It's told us everything we need to know about the Millennium.

2257
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:51,720
Like all the clues were here.

2258
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:52,560
Yeah.

2259
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,400
In this one building especially.

2260
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,240
It is true.

2261
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:56,400
You can, yeah.

2262
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,560
As if it was like a narrative story, you'd be like,

2263
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,000
well, they planted all the seeds

2264
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,520
at the Millennium Village in Epcot Center.

2265
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:03,960
The Sage of Time knew.

2266
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:04,800
Yeah.

2267
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,040
He told us everything we'd need to know.

2268
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,960
Who was the host of the show?

2269
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:08,800
Do we know?

2270
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:09,880
I think it was like a cast member.

2271
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:10,720
No.

2272
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:11,560
But it wasn't a character.

2273
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:12,400
Wasn't Leonardo.

2274
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,640
It also doesn't, I couldn't really find

2275
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,280
what the prizes were.

2276
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,800
I guess the prize was you got to watch like,

2277
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,640
here's the World Bank giving, you know,

2278
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:26,640
small loans to people with a 200% interest rate.

2279
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,760
Prize is watching chicks be handed out.

2280
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:30,720
Yeah.

2281
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:33,160
It's also apparently there's like a tradition

2282
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,920
that the head of the World Bank is always an American.

2283
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:40,120
And it's like, well, that isn't quite worldy.

2284
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,600
Yeah, yeah.

2285
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:46,800
I think it's because America fronts most of the money for it.

2286
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:51,400
But it's like, it's a little ominous looking back on it.

2287
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:52,880
Very strange.

2288
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:53,720
Very strange.

2289
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:54,560
All very bizarre.

2290
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:57,880
There's perhaps no stranger time to be at Epcot.

2291
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,600
They also did stuff in, you know,

2292
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:04,480
Illuminations was special and there was the big globe.

2293
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:07,120
I'll leave it up to you how much you want to talk about.

2294
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:07,960
The big globe.

2295
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:11,560
I would just bank it for an Illuminations episode.

2296
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:13,920
There's some interesting technological innovation

2297
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,760
involved in that one, but we'll touch on that in the future.

2298
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:18,120
Hit Illuminations.

2299
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,040
Yeah.

2300
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:19,880
Okay.

2301
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:22,320
So what did we learn?

2302
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:28,160
Don't try to do rides, but disputed territories.

2303
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,000
One little quick thing.

2304
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,160
Discman is scary.

2305
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:32,560
Yeah, Discman is scary, but we do,

2306
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,960
I do like him as a villain.

2307
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:37,560
They made for McDonald's in 2000,

2308
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:40,640
they had Happy Meal toys for the Millennium celebration.

2309
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,000
And I was excited because I was hoping

2310
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,800
it was some of those nightmare characters,

2311
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:47,600
but it's just the characters in the plush.

2312
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,760
Did they have this logo?

2313
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:53,760
This logo was everywhere to this 2000 Mickey ear logo.

2314
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:54,640
It was on the room keys.

2315
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:56,760
It was just, basically, you know how like

2316
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,320
when you have a thing on your closet

2317
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,240
that can hold your shoes.

2318
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,080
Yeah.

2319
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:05,760
I guess you would get that from McDonald's,

2320
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,200
and I'm gonna again, text it to you

2321
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,680
so I don't have to move my computer.

2322
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,000
Yep.

2323
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,080
And you would have room for all your favorite characters,

2324
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:15,040
and there were a lot of them.

2325
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,800
So I do like this, but it was not,

2326
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,880
I wish there was Discman.

2327
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,800
I wish there was like a Discman in a Sage of Time,

2328
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,200
but it's just Mickey Minnie and their ball plushes.

2329
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,840
And I can buy all of them for $50 right now,

2330
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,040
if I wanted to.

2331
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,560
The full set and the hanger?

2332
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:31,520
I believe so, yeah.

2333
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,360
Can you buy that Leonardo Columbus pin?

2334
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,280
How expensive is that?

2335
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,320
Oh yeah, good call.

2336
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,840
Let me look that up.

2337
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,120
I like these plushes.

2338
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:39,960
Yeah.

2339
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:44,400
I like all plush Cogsworth, and only him, not other.

2340
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,680
You know, that's what I'm interested in,

2341
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,320
like why do they pick these characters?

2342
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:48,680
A lot of dwarves.

2343
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:50,880
What the hell is little brother?

2344
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:51,720
Where does it say that?

2345
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,520
Is that from Brother Bear?

2346
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:54,360
Is it Brother Bear?

2347
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:56,480
I don't think Brother Bear was out yet.

2348
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,480
And it looks like, look at this with me.

2349
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:01,520
It's like little brother looks like he's got,

2350
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:04,160
he's vomiting black cotton.

2351
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,600
What the hell is little brother?

2352
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:07,880
Jason, you're gonna have to do this one

2353
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:09,560
while I'm looking up Leonardo Columbus pin.

2354
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:10,800
Hold on.

2355
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,000
Scott, you mentioning DVC reminds me,

2356
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,280
I bid on DVC pins and did not win any of those options.

2357
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,920
Disney Epcot Tapestry of Dreams Leonardo Columbus pin

2358
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,440
went for $8 on eBay.

2359
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:26,040
So if we can find another one,

2360
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,240
I don't imagine it would be much more

2361
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,640
to just get one of the greatest pieces

2362
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,760
of collectible merchandise of all time.

2363
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:33,680
Oh, there's a lot of them.

2364
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:34,840
Okay, good.

2365
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:37,840
There's a lot of Leonardo, when I say a lot, five.

2366
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:41,760
And there's one that at 399 to bid start at.

2367
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,600
You could buy it now for $6.

2368
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:46,480
I don't know, should I just buy it?

2369
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:49,840
Yeah, I think to own some Leonardo.

2370
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,400
$6 plus $5 shipping.

2371
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:55,200
Are the other ones, are there pins for the other one?

2372
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,040
I'm sure there are.

2373
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:56,920
You gotta get the full set.

2374
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:57,760
All right, you're right.

2375
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:59,440
Let's do that off air and we'll figure out.

2376
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,680
Well, we'll start out logistics,

2377
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:03,840
but when Leonardo Columbus arrives,

2378
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,040
that will herald the dawning

2379
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:09,800
of the gateway of podcast topics will have opened

2380
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:13,560
and the Leonardo Columbus episode will begin.

2381
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:18,560
Heralds the dawn of a new time of love and hope and dreams.

2382
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:21,760
A bunch of shit.

2383
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:24,080
A little brother is from Mulan.

2384
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:24,920
It's Mulan's.

2385
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:26,800
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2386
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,680
Somebody's so mad.

2387
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:31,000
A bunch of people are so mad at us for not knowing that.

2388
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,720
Why would we need to know that?

2389
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,640
I mean, Mooshu is,

2390
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:36,000
cause her horse is her friend.

2391
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,160
I haven't seen Mulan in a long time.

2392
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,000
I know Mooshu.

2393
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,800
And the dog is a friend and Mooshu is the friend.

2394
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,520
Sometimes there's too many friends.

2395
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:44,480
Tangled has the lizard and the horse.

2396
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,640
In this picture, yeah, they got confusing.

2397
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:49,840
In this picture, you cannot tell that it's a dog.

2398
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,880
Like it look like, are you guys looking at it?

2399
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:56,280
It looks like a very sick man, barfing black

2400
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:59,000
and like trying to shove it back in his mouth.

2401
01:33:59,000 --> 01:33:59,840
Yes.

2402
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:00,680
Are you seeing the same,

2403
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:02,000
would you agree with this depiction?

2404
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,640
I know what you're saying, yes.

2405
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:05,160
So I couldn't tell it's a dog.

2406
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:06,960
Lay off.

2407
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:09,800
In the spirit of millennium peace,

2408
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:12,920
don't be mad at us for not knowing who Mulan's dog was.

2409
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:16,200
In the spirit of the millennium, get off Scott's ass.

2410
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:19,080
Cut him a break.

2411
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:21,680
Damn right.

2412
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:24,600
All right, we'll buy this pin and hey guys,

2413
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:27,440
it's gonna be a great decade.

2414
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:29,040
It's gonna be.

Stay tuned here.

2418
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,140

Yeah, yeah.
