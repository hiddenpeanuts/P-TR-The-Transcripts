1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,080
When hinges creak in dork-filled chambers.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,560
And strange Pennsylvania pronunciations

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,740
echo through the halls.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,880
That is the time when good boys are present.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,840
Practicing their discomfort at mild sexuality

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,240
Is this haunted intro actually stretching

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,600
or is it time to start the show?

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,920
There's no turning back now.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,200
It's hot cast the fright live.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,760
Ha ha ha ha ha.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,000
Ah, how do you do?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Ah, how do you do?

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,320
Hello, hello and welcome to the first ever

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,040
hot cast the fright live.

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,640
Oh yes, oh yes.

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,680
It's the only, it's a show that does not

20
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,520
just make out of date 1960s pop culture references.

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,680
Tonight we also dress like them, that's right.

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,280
For anyone just listening, you may not be aware.

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,280
Nothing, nothing.

24
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,320
That was fast.

25
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,640
Well, first of all, you may not be aware

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,080
Mike was wearing bolts.

27
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,080
He is now wearing half a bolts, not for long.

28
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,680
Darn, darn, darn, darn, darn.

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,600
Carmen.

30
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,160
May perhaps that all implies to the listener

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,440
that we have finally assumed our ultimate true form

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,840
we are last dressed as the Munsters.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,600
Here, let's go, let's go down the line.

34
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,440
Who do we got over here?

35
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,280
Herman.

36
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,320
He sure is.

37
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,040
And I'm old grandpa Gardner.

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,080
Hello, hello.

39
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,920
Come visit my restaurant.

40
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,880
You'll find me reading a newspaper in the lobby

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,360
and I won't acknowledge you.

42
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,920
And over here.

43
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,400
And I'm little Eddie and I don't remember

44
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,320
any of his little things.

45
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,240
Although we did have multiple conversations

46
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,640
on whether I would be Eddie or grandpa.

47
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,880
I know, it felt like a default.

48
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,280
I mean, ultimately height order had to be taken into

49
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,520
consideration. Had to be honored.

50
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,520
Height order, costumes, all the best parts of podcasting

51
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,280
of an audio medium.

52
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,720
Enjoy it listener, but also enjoy it people here in person.

53
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,320
Thank you for coming.

54
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,240
Enjoy it people live streaming.

55
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,720
Thanks to dynasty typewriter.

56
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,480
Hello live streamers, hello live screamers.

57
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,600
We're so excited.

58
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,640
Here, let's take a seat.

59
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,400
No reason not to take a seat.

60
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,920
Well, Herman, if you want to do it in sort of, you know,

61
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,520
long legged, stiff legged fashion, feel free.

62
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,200
Not to put you on the physical comedy spot.

63
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,280
Yeah, fuck up that chair we don't own.

64
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,080
The bit was he would break things when he sat in them.

65
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,360
Oh, see again.

66
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,240
I think we're discovering we don't really know the monsters.

67
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,280
We just like dressing like them.

68
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,720
That's good. Yep. Great.

69
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,800
Okay. Wonderful.

70
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,640
And nothing is broken.

71
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,200
Oh, wait, wait, Jason, don't sit on your little guy.

72
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,040
You got a little guy with you too.

73
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,920
Oh, I got the little guy.

74
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,000
We did know that about Eddie.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,840
Yeah.

76
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,680
Eddie has his little wolf.

77
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,640
And Jane found a little wolf man.

78
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,280
It's a dog toy wolf man.

79
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,520
Cause all of the others were,

80
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,160
the movie appropriate ones were 40 to $50.

81
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,160
And this one was significantly less

82
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,600
and we can give it to the dog later tonight.

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,160
He can have a good time.

84
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,080
It's a thrill.

85
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,880
It's a thrill to be here,

86
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,240
but it's especially a thrill to assume this,

87
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,000
this monster form.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,160
And for me personally,

89
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,520
even being kind of like a cheap version

90
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,880
of a of grandpa monster feels really great.

91
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,960
Just given the like pedigree

92
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,880
of who has played this part in the past.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,480
Of course you've got Al Lewis.

94
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,880
Obviously Al Lewis is the, you know,

95
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,800
the primary in the originator.

96
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,600
And he's great and his restaurant was great.

97
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,840
But last year in a new iteration of the monsters,

98
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,280
somebody else joined the proud lineup of grandpa portrayers.

99
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,520
And that is an actor named Daniel Roebuck.

100
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,240
Give it up for Daniel Roebuck.

101
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,560
Daniel Roebuck comes up a lot on the show

102
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,200
because he also played another role

103
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,440
that is very important to us.

104
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,760
The role of Jay Leno in the HBO TV movie,

105
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,680
The Late Shift.

106
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,520
Yeah.

107
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,800
Which we covered in one of our longest episodes ever.

108
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,320
The less theme park, the longer we go.

109
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,080
And I bring all this up for a reason

110
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,600
because are we up to, are our stills up?

111
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,120
Mike, can you bring up the picture

112
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,880
I've kept secret from you?

113
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,720
Look at that!

114
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,480
My bolts fell off, I'm in such shock.

115
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,880
Roebuck!

116
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,320
Listeners, I met Daniel Roebuck

117
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,320
and I've kept it secret from my host for weeks.

118
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,280
This happened on October 1st

119
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,600
and I wanted to tell you as soon as it happened.

120
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,440
What?

121
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,000
And then we keep doing episodes

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,040
and I'm like, is now the time?

123
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,880
Is now the time?

124
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,700
No, no, no.

125
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,800
And then eventually it just became,

126
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,600
I'm gonna be dressed as grandpa.

127
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,040
I'm gonna show everybody that I met a grandpa.

128
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,200
I met a grandpa!

129
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,040
Wow.

130
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,120
Look at that!

131
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,480
And that is, I know that background.

132
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,160
That is the historic Tam O' Shanter lobby.

133
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,000
That is it.

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,840
Tam O' Shanter.

135
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,840
I met Daniel Roebuck in the lobby

136
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,640
of Walt Disney's favorite restaurant.

137
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,560
Now I feel like doing it on stage is usurping the,

138
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,000
I've been wanting to see your guys' faces.

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,840
I'm shocked!

140
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,040
I haven't announced this news for so long.

141
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,400
Yeah, yeah.

142
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,680
I'm also shocked that you could keep a secret from us that long.

143
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,440
I told as many other people as I could

144
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,240
to get the Jones out.

145
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,240
But I knew ultimately I had to tell you on mic

146
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,640
and then eventually on stage.

147
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,520
History, I couldn't believe it.

148
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,760
What did the average person say

149
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,760
when you said the sentences

150
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,360
to indicate what happened here?

151
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,160
Well, you are assuming that I texted any average people.

152
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,120
Fair enough, fair enough.

153
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,280
Griffin Newman knew right away.

154
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,560
My wife Farron knew right away.

155
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,280
A gasp in a text message form.

156
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,000
And this photo was taken by a friend of the show, Buzz Buzz.

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,720
And he, yeah, well thanks for the woos for that.

158
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,560
It's crazy because on his very phone the day before,

159
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,640
he texted a photo of this man,

160
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,640
but due to his role in a Star Wars cartoon.

161
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,840
Here's a real test of the audience.

162
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,880
Does anyone know who Daniel Roebuck plays in Star Wars?

163
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,280
Grease.

164
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,120
Wait, Grease was the name?

165
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,280
Wow, thank you.

166
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,560
It's a video game.

167
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,360
Got some Grease heads here.

168
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,240
Grease heads here.

169
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Grease.

170
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,320
This is also, it's really, it's just like,

171
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,200
it's an audience that has your back.

172
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,160
I knew I could throw that out and I'd be back.

173
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
Thank you so much for that.

174
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,040
Anyway, incredible.

175
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,600
He was super nice.

176
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,720
I said, I have a toy of you.

177
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,400
My co-host on my podcast gave me a toy of you.

178
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,720
He said, oh, you have a podcast.

179
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,160
We talked for a little bit and guess what?

180
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,920
I got them digits.

181
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,760
So.

182
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,800
Whoa.

183
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,640
So.

184
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,480
Holy shit.

185
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,360
Nothing's official yet.

186
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
You believe?

187
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,720
You are not prepared for this on stage.

188
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,800
Should we pull the Monsters episode down?

189
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,200
We liked him a lot.

190
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,040
Not about it.

191
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,880
Not about J.A.?

192
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,720
No, possibly.

193
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,480
It's behind a paywall, I think that'll be okay.

194
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,240
You've all heard it though.

195
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,080
So we can pull it.

196
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,920
Unhear it.

197
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,640
Audio, denuralize it, whatever the Men in Black thing is.

198
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,480
Okay.

199
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,640
So anyway, possibility of Roebuck content to come,

200
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,520
but I had to do some live Roebuck content here for you now.

201
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,360
Oh, I need a lot.

202
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,400
I just need a second.

203
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,560
Yeah, I know.

204
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,960
Take it, yeah, me too.

205
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,240
This is like, I'm trying to think,

206
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,160
if it was you and Eisner in the Tam

207
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,280
and you got his phone number,

208
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,400
that's maybe the only other thing

209
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,680
I would have been more excited about.

210
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,400
I also, I wanted to be really careful

211
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,960
about how I did that little introduction

212
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,000
because I didn't want you to start thinking,

213
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,520
and ladies and gentlemen, here he is.

214
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,360
And then you get disappointed.

215
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,600
I hope the photo was enough, is enough.

216
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,200
It can remain up as long as anyone wants.

217
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,040
There it is.

218
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,200
Thank you, Daniel.

219
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
You were so nice to me.

220
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,280
Hopefully we can talk again.

221
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,120
That's amazing.

222
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,360
Yeah, how about that?

223
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,200
Oh, I know.

224
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,880
We gotta calm down now, I think, from this.

225
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,320
Well, maybe the thing to do is to put the spotlight

226
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,120
away from us and away from Mr. Roebuck

227
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,200
and say, like, okay, it's pretty,

228
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,560
I was hoping that I could check out costumes a little bit,

229
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,880
but it's pretty blinding light,

230
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,080
so I can't really tell.

231
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,080
But we stepped up our costume game,

232
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,200
and I am curious.

233
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,040
It was a little light.

234
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
If any, oh, thank you.

235
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Thanks for doing something.

236
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,800
Our, okay, I see some stuff.

237
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,760
I see some stuff, but still people would have to call it out.

238
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,760
I guess the question is,

239
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,120
does anybody feel like they are wearing a costume

240
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,040
that is especially theme park oriented,

241
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,160
and oh my god, well, we've got a really good,

242
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,440
you know what, here, guys, come on up.

243
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,520
If it's not so insane to come on up.

244
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,240
I think you might have won already.

245
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,080
Wow.

246
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,900
Oh, why?

247
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,960
We have, I can't see enough that this is a,

248
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,160
Oh my god.

249
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,480
Wow.

250
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,960
We got an awe from the audience,

251
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,760
because that is a Winnie the Pooh and a hopping Tigger.

252
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,600
Oh my god.

253
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,440
Wow.

254
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,960
Oh, geez, come on up.

255
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,800
Wow, wow.

256
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,640
Oh, thanks for coming.

257
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
Thank you for dressing.

258
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,920
Wait, I'm like, wait.

259
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,600
The hand?

260
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,440
Whoa.

261
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,280
The hand goes.

262
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,520
This is, this was my like childhood beloved toy

263
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,620
was to squeeze the hand.

264
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,000
I feel like, can I give you a hug?

265
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,840
Is that okay?

266
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,760
I feel like, this is like, that is so,

267
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,200
I don't want, here, I won't leave you out, Tigger.

268
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,040
Thank you.

269
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,920
What are you guys' names?

270
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,760
Holly.

271
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,360
Will.

272
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,800
Holly and Will.

273
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,640
Great to meet you.

274
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,560
And I think Mike's got something for you.

275
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,400
You know what?

276
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,040
I have two little treats over here

277
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
for two people that dressed up.

278
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,240
And of course, I have little toys.

279
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,200
Just save the hopping, save the hopping.

280
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,240
Let's all say your favorite Disney character at once.

281
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,560
No, one, two, three, Dr. Lily Hawton.

282
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,000
Wow.

283
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,560
From Disney's Jungle Cruise.

284
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,400
Wow.

285
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,360
Oh my gosh.

286
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,400
So I have two Lily Hawtons.

287
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,240
Wow.

288
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,840
You each get. Thank you for dressing up.

289
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,680
Wow, wow, wow.

290
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,100
Wait, Holly and Will, is that correct?

291
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,940
All right, awesome.

292
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,520
Thank you, give it up for Holly and Will.

293
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,240
Winning the Poo and Tigger.

294
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,800
Four listeners, incredible costumes.

295
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,320
That felt, I feel like I needed the hugs.

296
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
It felt so theme park quality.

297
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,120
God, that's fantastic.

298
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,920
Was it better or worse than hugging Minnie?

299
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,080
Well, you know the answer.

300
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,040
Oh, you're right.

301
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,480
Yes, well yes, because I went in for the hug

302
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,920
as opposed to, you all felt like

303
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,760
it was a misread of a signal.

304
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,920
The Disneyland Minnie did not want to hug me.

305
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,840
And I stand by that.

306
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,200
All the Orlando Minis wanted to hug me.

307
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,880
It was about eight minutes to park closing

308
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,000
and there was a line behind us with actual children.

309
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,840
You think that's?

310
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,440
Yeah, and I got in the line before them,

311
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,760
so I got a hug before them.

312
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,920
That's how it works.

313
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,600
Oh, he did call firsties.

314
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,840
He did call firsties.

315
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,520
Orlando Minis wanting to hug you feels like

316
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,040
we're somewhere close to like a Lou Baga

317
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,480
kind of song premise.

318
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,240
Should I write a song called Orlando Minis?

319
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,760
Absolutely, and I don't mean to dictate a genre,

320
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,680
but it kind of feels in the vicinity of Pitbull.

321
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,000
I couldn't love this out of that more.

322
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,480
You've been looking for a reason

323
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,280
to get those short leather gloves

324
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,120
to wear while you podcast and perform.

325
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,920
I guess the question is, does Pitbull wear?

326
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,600
It's like little leather gloves, right?

327
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,920
I can picture it.

328
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,960
I'm not sure if that's the kind of thing

329
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,920
you can ask them about.

330
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,760
I don't know.

331
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,400
Grizz or whatever, sure.

332
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,520
I feel like I saw another hand go up on this side though.

333
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,480
Okay, everybody's pointing at somebody.

334
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,360
Oh, I see it.

335
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,960
Okay, you want to come up here?

336
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,680
We have, oh, I don't have more.

337
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,080
We don't, we don't, but I have kind of a,

338
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,720
oh, yes, yeah, cool, go ahead.

339
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,560
Not a physical present.

340
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,800
Oh, you have a Dr. Lilly Houghton.

341
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,040
Look at this.

342
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,520
Wow, wow.

343
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,600
Here, Mike, do you want to, oh my gosh.

344
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,560
I think I know what we're dealing with here.

345
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,520
Wow, wow, what's your name?

346
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,360
I'm Crystal.

347
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,040
Crystal, thank you so, wow.

348
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,720
Thank you for dressing up.

349
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,280
Would you like to announce anything specific

350
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,760
about what your dress does?

351
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,960
I'm Bula from Country Bear Jamboree.

352
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,920
Nice.

353
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,840
One of the Sunbond and Trio.

354
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,760
That's what I was hearing.

355
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,560
I was like, you must know the name

356
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,200
and you clearly know the name.

357
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Yeah, me and my two other friends

358
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,680
already decided which ones we were, so.

359
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,400
Great, I'm glad you sorted that out.

360
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,240
You have to.

361
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,480
Let me, here is the, that is an amazing costume,

362
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,480
much appreciated, and here is your present.

363
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,080
It's not something that you can take home,

364
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,800
but if you're up for it,

365
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,560
would you like to do the honors

366
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,080
of introducing tonight's topic?

367
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,920
Oh.

368
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,080
Okay, here you go, and I'll use my microphone.

369
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,000
Here is the topic reveal,

370
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,800
courtesy of, wait, sorry, what's your name again?

371
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,960
Crystal. Crystal, okay.

372
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,200
All right, here you go, and I'll give you the microphone.

373
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,240
Foolish good boys, please discuss the Haunted Mansion.

374
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,080
Yeah!

375
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,920
So much.

376
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,440
You can take that if you want.

377
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,800
Take a dirty bolt on the ground if you want to.

378
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,640
Or don't.

379
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,560
You want the dirty bolt?

380
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,280
No, it's, no.

381
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,680
No, please.

382
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,560
Give it up for Crystal, everybody.

383
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,200
Incredible costume, wow, wow.

384
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,680
And that takes us to this.

385
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,160
We have now revealed this tonight's topic,

386
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,600
the Haunted Mansion.

387
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,440
Yes.

388
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,760
Let's have a seat here.

389
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,360
Haunted Mansion 6, baby.

390
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,560
Haunted Mansion 6.

391
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,200
The first live one.

392
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,120
Well, yes.

393
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,240
Never been done live before,

394
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,720
but it felt like the thing to do,

395
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,960
the big ticket item in the Halloween season.

396
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,200
Now, let me ask this question.

397
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,600
Are people here generally familiar

398
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,240
with how we have dealt with the Haunted Mansion in the past?

399
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,040
Right, right.

400
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,280
Just to recap, just in case,

401
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,640
and in case anyone's wondering why Haunted Mansion 6.

402
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,120
Because the way that we have done this

403
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,640
is every year, Halloween week,

404
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,000
we cover the Haunted Mansion.

405
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,120
This was a decision that I made a long time ago.

406
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,640
And it's a decision that I have reconsidered

407
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,920
at Sleepless Nights about since.

408
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,880
However, I think it's been fun.

409
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,040
It's let us cover a lot of ground.

410
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,880
But I would say that the only underlying thing

411
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,960
with the Haunted Mansion

412
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,240
is that my co-host and I will sometimes have disagreements

413
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,000
about the speed at which we proceed

414
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,520
through this classic attraction.

415
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,320
Now, of course, it makes sense to do many, many years of it.

416
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,440
There's so much culture there, so much to discuss.

417
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,200
However, we're not always completely aligned.

418
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,200
I think that I maybe hit a bit of a wall in year two.

419
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Yeah, that was fast.

420
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,800
In year two, I thought that it might be good

421
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,240
to discuss a little bit of the ride

422
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,800
in the podcast series about the ride.

423
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,640
And we discovered our disagreements together.

424
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,800
I was told to slow my roll

425
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,040
and that it was more important to discuss

426
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,760
the full history of American foyers.

427
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,480
And we're all looking at a particular host.

428
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,840
Well, look, there was a lot of woodworking

429
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,160
when you start the ride.

430
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
There's a lot of wallpaper history.

431
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,200
Was that the year that I said we should talk about the chair

432
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,440
and you lost it on us?

433
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,520
That's a pretty notable chair.

434
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,640
Or has that happened every year?

435
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,360
I assume, again, we've talked about things

436
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,640
that I immediately erase.

437
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,520
The pencil is followed right by the eraser.

438
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,760
There's probably a chair in every one of these rooms

439
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,040
that gets discussed.

440
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,880
That's true.

441
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,720
I think that's a year three thing.

442
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,800
I suggested moving through a room

443
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,400
and then it was a lot of no, no, no, no, no.

444
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,640
Where is a chair that needs to be discussed?

445
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,360
Now, these are the early days

446
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,120
because this is year six of this somehow, right?

447
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,960
Incredible.

448
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,640
And I feel like we are a little more aligned.

449
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,320
This is what's happened as the years have gone on.

450
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,560
We've gotten a little more in sync.

451
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,760
And just to illustrate this,

452
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,600
Mike, if you could bring up that little map, that diagram.

453
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,680
So, there we go.

454
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,240
This is what you're looking at right now.

455
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,480
This is an overhead of the Haunted Mansion,

456
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,440
like a schematic,

457
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,240
and the yellow line is where we were after year four.

458
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,200
Now, if you could show us where we ended up after year five.

459
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,200
We're still making progress.

460
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,040
Yes.

461
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,840
We didn't go backwards.

462
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,680
Yeah.

463
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,160
The hat box ghost got re-edited

464
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,360
as part of the diamond celebration.

465
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,240
Oh, that is one of my triggers.

466
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,640
It's like Steve had a birthday.

467
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,000
Scott hates when we say diamond celebration.

468
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,120
Diamond celebration drives me insane.

469
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,760
The assumption that I know what the diamond celebration is

470
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,640
is that it's a diamond celebration.

471
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,480
It's a diamond celebration.

472
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,320
It's a diamond celebration.

473
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,160
It's a diamond celebration.

474
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,000
It's a diamond celebration.

475
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,840
It's a diamond celebration.

476
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,720
I know what the diamond celebration was.

477
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,080
Well, because the Mad Tea Party,

478
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,560
they had a special diamond celebration playlist

479
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,520
where they would play like a different Blink-182 song.

480
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,760
Yeah, they had two Pitbull songs on that playlist.

481
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,920
And hey, look, it's our sixth year,

482
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,480
which they call the little diamond celebration.

483
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,800
We all know that.

484
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,480
Is that true?

485
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,320
Is that true?

486
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,160
No, it's not at all.

487
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh, okay.

488
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,120
Oh, baby.

489
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,640
I'm lying for comedic effect.

490
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,480
I don't know.

491
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,840
That's just how few diamonds I've bought.

492
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,000
Little or big.

493
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,280
But so, for the listener,

494
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,200
that little jump in the yellow line,

495
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,760
that probably represents about six feet

496
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,040
in attraction ride track.

497
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,640
And that is because last year was entirely about

498
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,360
the Hatbox Ghost.

499
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,840
And there definitely was a ton about the Hatbox Ghost.

500
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,800
And I agree.

501
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,680
We all signed off on this.

502
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,680
And I think it's become a friendlier, more empathetic.

503
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,720
I think brotherhood is formed between us

504
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,040
as this has gone on.

505
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,200
That said, I think tonight,

506
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,800
there is an opportunity to make a little bit of headway.

507
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,400
Wouldn't you say?

508
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,640
There's an opportunity.

509
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,640
There's some dramatic tension, certainly,

510
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,600
because I don't wanna get too far past that caretaker.

511
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,960
But I'm an entertainer at heart,

512
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,200
and I want the people to feel like

513
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,000
they got their money's worth.

514
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But I got a lot to say about that fall.

515
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,440
The fall?

516
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,160
You mean like going backwards down the hill?

517
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,880
Well, I learned some stuff about the fall this year

518
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,360
that we need to discuss.

519
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,200
Okay.

520
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,040
Well, I hear you.

521
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,360
Look, I'm excited.

522
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,960
I'm excited for all this.

523
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,800
This will be great.

524
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,360
We'll see where we land.

525
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,760
Listeners, get a guess ready in your mind.

526
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,120
You've got the map there.

527
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,840
Just physically, just mark it off mentally.

528
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,640
I know where I'd like to be.

529
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,040
And it's not the exit, okay?

530
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,000
It isn't.

531
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,640
Not the exit of the ride or the exit of the building.

532
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,600
I'm excited for this.

533
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,400
So, that said, there is some business

534
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,960
that needs to be attended to

535
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,080
before we can even get to this fall.

536
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,480
Right, we need to discuss how Mike said

537
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,440
he wants the hat box ghosts that's going into Florida

538
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,200
to look like Jared Leto.

539
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,040
Mm-hmm.

540
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,600
I wanted it to be different.

541
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,840
And I'm just trying to help.

542
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,880
I mean, that's a whole,

543
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,320
I could talk about the hat box ghosts

544
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,040
where they're putting it in Florida.

545
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,360
Okay, yep, that's fine.

546
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,200
Yes. Oh, whoa.

547
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,880
I was gonna say that for a few years from now.

548
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,160
Well, I'll allow it.

549
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,760
It's, you know, that's the other thing.

550
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,520
Because there is so much Haunted Mansion news

551
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,880
and there's a few of them around the world,

552
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,080
you do end up with every one of these years

553
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,320
the need to do like,

554
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,000
Haunted Mansion news and views.

555
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,840
Yeah, that's true.

556
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,880
Things do happen every year.

557
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,720
They do happen.

558
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,200
But I'm like, whatever you were talking about.

559
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,640
No, no, I feel free.

560
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,280
Next month it is going in Disney World, I believe.

561
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,520
Right after Halloween.

562
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,200
Always time this stuff perfectly.

563
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,280
And you don't like where they are putting it?

564
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,080
No one likes where they're putting it.

565
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,920
No.

566
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,760
No.

567
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,600
No.

568
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,120
Oh, you like it?

569
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,280
No, I don't like it.

570
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,240
No, it's at the hallway, right?

571
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,080
Yeah, it's way before-

572
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,920
And it's too busy.

573
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,760
It's too busy.

574
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,720
Before Leota summons the ghosts.

575
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,440
Yeah.

576
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,560
It's like, he's coming in like the doorway down the hall

577
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,880
way before the ghosts materialize.

578
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,560
This is getting this interesting abstract

579
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,080
like reaction from the eye that's always like, oh.

580
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,920
Some people didn't know.

581
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,440
Some people may need a minute to process this.

582
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,360
I'm hearing about this for the first time.

583
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,720
If you need to take,

584
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,360
if you need to excuse yourself and go to the lobby

585
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,160
and make a few calls, now you know.

586
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,760
Feel free, because I understand that's heavy news to hear.

587
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,160
But they're, yeah, I don't know.

588
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,400
It's weird.

589
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,560
People are arguing about why, like there's not,

590
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,840
the electrical isn't right to put it in the attic,

591
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,800
like right after the attic.

592
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,560
What is the problem?

593
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,400
What is there?

594
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,520
An electrical issue?

595
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,640
There's not an outlet near-

596
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,480
There's not a Disney company.

597
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,320
There's not an outlet near.

598
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,360
They're missing an outlet.

599
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,960
And if they ran an extension cord, it would look ugly.

600
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,240
Oh, he's gotta be grounded.

601
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,640
He's gotta be plugged right in the wall.

602
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,120
He can't use an extension cord.

603
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,480
Oh, you're right.

604
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,720
Too much power to blow out the, oh, sure.

605
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,680
Yeah, it's gotta be plugged in the shoe.

606
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,800
Well, they should have thought of that years ago.

607
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,040
Anyway, here's what we need to address

608
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,800
is that we've already broken from tradition

609
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,720
by having other people around for this

610
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,560
and by not doing like a cold open

611
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,440
because typically as we've done this series,

612
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,720
the fact that there's that year gap

613
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,640
between all of the episodes,

614
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,440
and I think it'll be interesting to listen back

615
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,600
when you're like, wow, an entire decade,

616
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,960
how many we think it's gonna be at this point,

617
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,720
that you'll be able to listen to all that in a row

618
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,080
and hopefully in a seamless fashion.

619
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,080
And some of that run where it's on Zoom,

620
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,320
so there's a lot of delays and a lot of sad sacri

621
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,640
about how we're on Zoom.

622
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,040
But besides that, hopefully it all kind of flows together.

623
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,480
And part of the seamless stitching of these episodes

624
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,880
is that we've done these little like assignments.

625
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,600
Like next year, the episode will start

626
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,560
and we'll all do this and we'll all like say something.

627
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,680
I don't know if that's a character's name.

628
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,280
I think last time it was the amount of weeks

629
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,280
until Avatar Way of Water came out.

630
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,320
James made it, six weeks later,

631
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,880
we all fell in love with everybody, the Metkaina.

632
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,120
Yeah, that's right, yes.

633
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,400
Agreed with applause.

634
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,960
But what started happening was my co-hosts

635
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,960
were not doing the assignment.

636
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,760
All you had to do was go back and listen

637
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,480
to what are we gonna yell at the top of next year,

638
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,240
a pretty small assignment.

639
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,200
And that broke down some of the trust

640
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,280
that I think is built up

641
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,160
during this somewhat combative series.

642
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,680
So the assignment for next year became something

643
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,640
that was a little more complicated

644
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,160
and it had a little more stakes.

645
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,880
I don't know if I should say the assignment

646
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,920
or if I should say the,

647
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,120
I mean, I won't say the assignment.

648
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,960
I will say that if you guys didn't achieve

649
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,520
what we agreed on that you would achieve,

650
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,880
that we would never talk about the hitchhiking ghosts.

651
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,880
The hitchhiking ghosts are pulled

652
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,360
if you don't do the little assignment.

653
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,360
And so, I ask you now.

654
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,360
Um, gentlemen, can I see, first of all, your stickers.

655
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,960
Step one was a sticker.

656
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,800
Was it technically a sticker?

657
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,640
It had to be a sticker?

658
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,960
I don't remember a sticker.

659
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,440
Oh wait, maybe not a sticker.

660
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,360
I think what it had to be was a hoodie

661
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,200
and I'll cut some slack

662
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,160
because we're dressed like the Munsters.

663
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,760
I'll cut some slack on this.

664
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,600
We didn't plan to dress like the Munsters last year.

665
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,720
The Munsters not part of the plan last year.

666
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,520
So I will say, here's what I will agree to.

667
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,600
Any amount of any of the plan being done by either of you

668
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,520
puts the hitchhiking ghosts back on the table.

669
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,800
All right.

670
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,200
But I noticed, Mike, that you're wearing something.

671
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,840
There's a hoodie under, oh my God.

672
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,480
Whoa!

673
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,680
Oh my God!

674
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,800
It says Pyakin.

675
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,680
Pyacon!

676
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,680
The mighty Pyacon!

677
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,920
The leader of the great Tulkun!

678
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,000
You're not the leader, the wisest, I think.

679
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I think he was the most, what?

680
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,720
The deepest of the Tulkun.

681
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,560
That's right.

682
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,520
Mike, I can't, and you snuck it in there.

683
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,000
Here you are getting dressed like Herman Munster

684
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,520
and it was, I didn't even notice.

685
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,720
I hid this from them.

686
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,000
So I'm not, you're not the only one with secrets.

687
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,720
I've got a few.

688
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,680
Jason, I turn to you.

689
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,680
Gosh, I've just been so busy lately with the move

690
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,400
and I don't wanna let everyone down.

691
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,080
You know, I love our listeners

692
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,520
and they mean so much to me.

693
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,360
And you're an entertainer in art.

694
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,920
So that it's good, I follow the fucking assignment.

695
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,760
Whoa!

696
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,600
What does that say?

697
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Also Pyacon?

698
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,440
Pyacon!

699
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,280
Pyacon!

700
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,120
Pyacon!

701
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,120
A double Pyacon!

702
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,160
It's a Feliz Navidad miracle.

703
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,000
Oh my gosh.

704
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Wow, wow you guys.

705
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,960
I'm so impressed.

706
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,600
I like, and here I've been wondering like,

707
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,400
is the whole thing here gonna be the gear up

708
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,240
to where then it does it because it got lost in the shuffle,

709
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,080
got lost in putting the live show together.

710
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,160
And then, oh wait, and I forgot,

711
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,680
part of the assignment was it was a reveal

712
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,560
of your favorite character from Avatar Wavewater

713
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,080
in blue ink and sure enough, blue from both of you.

714
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,160
Great job.

715
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,160
However, second part of the assignment,

716
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,640
and I do notice, Jason,

717
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,080
there is a box already on the stage.

718
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,920
I get to open it even.

719
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,840
Wow.

720
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,280
What's in the box?

721
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,120
What's in the fucking box?

722
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,880
What's in the fucking box?

723
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,880
Wow.

724
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,880
The assignment was, in honor of the hat box ghost,

725
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,160
to get a box of any kind and to put a hat in it

726
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,600
that would surprise me.

727
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,320
I did say that a Phillies hat wouldn't count

728
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,520
because I know you have those.

729
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,360
They're playing right now.

730
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,200
Do you need to check a score?

731
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,040
He's playing right now currently.

732
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,880
Five to three.

733
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,720
What is it?

734
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,880
Five to three.

735
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,720
Phillies.

736
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,560
Wow. Thank you.

737
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,400
Five to three.

738
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,040
Yay, Phillies.

739
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,320
Go Phillies.

740
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,640
And let's keep that support for Jason's team

741
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,160
and for Jason because he has brought me,

742
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,600
and I'm very surprised to see, a propeller beanie.

743
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,440
Wow.

744
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,440
You got, this does feel like Christmas to me.

745
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,800
Your unwrapping presents.

746
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,360
I'm so happy.

747
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,200
I guess what?

748
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,520
I just thought of a new rule though.

749
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,480
You need to put it on, Eddie Monster.

750
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,800
I'm gonna do the best I can

751
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,920
because I've already tried it on

752
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,800
and I have too big of a head.

753
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,960
Usually I'm up for adults.

754
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,800
Wow.

755
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,640
I'm so happy.

756
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,480
I'm so happy.

757
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,320
I'm so happy.

758
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,160
I'm so happy.

759
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,280
I'm your adults.

760
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,400
Wow.

761
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,720
Oh my gosh.

762
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,920
Spin it around.

763
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,040
Wow, you spin it.

764
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,200
Can you help?

765
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,040
Yay!

766
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,320
He got it.

767
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,160
He got it.

768
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,800
This has turned into what I was like.

769
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,960
I just need to be ready

770
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,200
in case it's the greatest disappointment

771
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,440
and it needs thews most anger for me,

772
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,080
and then one of the audiences mad and boos me,

773
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,920
but instead it's such a victory unlessENS

774
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,320
you have not achieved the final step of the point.

775
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,760
Well, it doesn't seem like I have a box

776
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,680
anywhere around here.

777
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,960
No, not like, not on a table like Jason has.

778
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,960
Does it, does it, does it seem like that?

779
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,840
Are you gonna propose to me?

780
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,760
Then it would be the perfect night.

781
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,400
I'm gonna propose, I don't have a hat,

782
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,760
but I am going to propose.

783
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,880
I'll let you do the honors.

784
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,640
It is the tiniest little chest.

785
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,800
And the like three people who were like,

786
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,360
oh, so they're gonna talk about the haunted mansion.

787
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,160
They're like, why are they over on the little chest?

788
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,600
Where the hell does this go?

789
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,480
Do I know how, oh, well.

790
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,680
It is, and inside is the tiniest little hat.

791
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,040
So glad we did this.

792
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:01,400
It is a little cloth-ish hat that says weird on it.

793
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,240
Weird on it?

794
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,400
To what does that refer?

795
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,160
That is a hat for my little Ninja Turtles.

796
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,280
In that, please do not let me pocket this.

797
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,240
Do not let me accidentally throw it in the audience.

798
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,480
I know how much these are important to you.

799
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,000
This hat is, Michelangelo has been wearing this hat

800
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,960
for about a year.

801
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,320
In the current set of my hat,

802
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,880
he's having a little house party

803
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,000
with Mondo Gecko in the sewer.

804
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,640
And Mondo Gecko is break dancing

805
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,920
and Michelangelo is holding like a boombox.

806
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,760
With this hat on.

807
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,600
Wow.

808
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,920
That's what's happening.

809
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,760
Encouraging weirdness.

810
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,520
Wait, actually, I know it's gonna come right off,

811
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,480
but can you put the hat on as well?

812
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,200
Wow.

813
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,840
Yeah.

814
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,840
Right on that Herman flat top.

815
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,120
That's perfect.

816
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,800
Oh my gosh.

817
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,000
You guys, delightful.

818
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,840
I'm so glad.

819
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,560
I do have to give credit.

820
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,480
Gene helped me out and got this hat

821
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,520
because the hat I ordered kept getting pushed back

822
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,480
and pushed back and it was a bucket hat

823
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,000
with a propeller on it.

824
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,920
I know, I know.

825
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,320
I'm disappointed too.

826
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,160
Wow, wow.

827
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,000
Not a bucket head, like the guitar player bucket head.

828
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,840
Yeah, yeah.

829
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,960
That would have surprised me too.

830
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,920
So this is a Burbank Halloween store,

831
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,000
this is not returnable purchase.

832
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,840
Yeah.

833
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,840
Now leave in our new apartment.

834
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,880
I've discovered that over the course of getting us

835
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,440
all Munster's costumes and various things,

836
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,400
yeah, not a lot of return policies out there.

837
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,240
No.

838
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,440
Nor would they want anything.

839
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,000
We're all gonna be sweating into these implements.

840
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,400
Is everything, are we like,

841
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,960
are we dripping paint at this point?

842
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,880
Yeah, it's disgusting.

843
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,920
Please just scream if you're too alarmed

844
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,560
by our appearance at some point.

845
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,480
Guys, that was so great.

846
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,680
Can I tell you what I would have done

847
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,200
had you not done this?

848
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,160
The plan- Spanked our little bottoms?

849
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,000
Yeah.

850
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,840
Yeah, Scott, was it spank our little bottoms?

851
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,640
No, I would never wanna spank your little bottoms.

852
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,200
That's not the kind of thing I'd like to do.

853
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,760
These guys are crazy.

854
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,520
Spin that propeller again, Jason.

855
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,080
Just the thought of it is-

856
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,400
He's so annoyed.

857
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,920
I'm not used to it.

858
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,920
Who would be?

859
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,800
Who wears one on a daily basis enough?

860
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,280
My plan was, I was gonna,

861
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,240
I don't wanna lose the hitchhiking ghosts either,

862
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,400
and I was gonna make a little sacrifice,

863
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,640
and if Jason didn't fulfill the plan,

864
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,800
I was gonna say, guess what, we're making a trade.

865
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,960
Brian Setzer will no longer be mentioned on the show.

866
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,720
Oh, we dodged them.

867
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,640
Yeah, well that would have caused the bootleg.

868
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,720
It's not happening.

869
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,040
And Mike, I didn't think it would come to this,

870
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,240
but I had to bring out the big guns.

871
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,640
If you had not succeeded in the plan, Green Day, gone.

872
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,160
Green Day and Smashing Pumpkins

873
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,600
just announced an arena tour for next year.

874
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,520
Stadium tour, stadium tour, you're right.

875
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,000
Not a sphere tour?

876
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,840
Not yet.

877
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,040
In which case, I may be there.

878
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,840
All right, well that is the end

879
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,320
of what typically is supposed to have been

880
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,720
a minute and a half intro of these episodes.

881
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,160
So what has happened now, I would say,

882
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,960
we've eaten into enough of the time,

883
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,040
now we're looking at about an hour left.

884
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,240
We've basically guaranteed that we will not get anywhere

885
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,200
in all of that nonsense.

886
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,440
This surely will be the least productive

887
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,280
of the Haunted Mansion.

888
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,120
I'm not sure.

889
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,760
And the fact that you guys are here too.

890
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,360
I'm glad they're here, but I'm just saying,

891
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,920
who knows what could happen?

892
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,000
Maybe we just speed through it

893
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,720
and we end the ride tonight.

894
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,560
That's right.

895
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,400
We don't want that.

896
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,120
Is there anyone who'd like to vocalize wanting it?

897
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,680
Yay, thank you, all right.

898
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,520
And it's Fred.

899
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,240
Easy filler, easy.

900
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,800
Easy filler.

901
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,400
Extra horse.

902
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,240
So now this having been dealt with,

903
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,800
let's talk about the ride.

904
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,680
We're in the ride, let's get into the ride.

905
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,520
Yes.

906
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,720
Because this is an exciting part

907
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,720
because when you get away from the Hapbox Ghost,

908
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,600
with the very first thing when you turn

909
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,560
is that you enter the sequence, the graveyard.

910
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,600
We are in the graveyard, the big finale,

911
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,280
the most complicated, full of different characters

912
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,680
and scenes and gags part.

913
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,360
There's so much to talk about here.

914
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,400
We've got a lot to deal with tonight.

915
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,160
That said, Jason, I almost feel like you should be deputized

916
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,480
to set the pace, to be the pace car.

917
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,320
And I also feel like you maybe have some thoughts

918
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,680
you were saying about the very first thing.

919
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,480
So we've kind of, we've turned, right?

920
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,640
We've gotten a view of that graveyard.

921
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,200
And we're up on the second level.

922
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,640
This is like a, this visual to talk about for a minute.

923
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,440
This is like the, maybe only beaten by the Mara room

924
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,800
in Indiana Jones in terms of it's multi-layered

925
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,440
and it seems to go on forever.

926
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,320
And it's a big dramatic beat where you're like,

927
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,920
wow, we're gonna be there for a while.

928
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,840
I can't wait.

929
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,840
Let's get into it.

930
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,880
Yeah, sure.

931
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,800
Just one thing.

932
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,640
Before that?

933
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,160
Well, yeah, before that, a little epilogue

934
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,280
on the Hapbox Ghost.

935
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,800
I got a hold of the Jason Sorrell coffee table book

936
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,960
about Haunted Mansion.

937
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,240
Because I finally broke down and bought it

938
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,640
after years of taking out the Burbank library's coffee.

939
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,160
You never bought the book?

940
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,000
You don't have the book?

941
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
In all the years of basically reading it on a podcast.

942
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,920
You never gave the man some money?

943
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,760
I did.

944
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,160
I bought it now.

945
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,320
Cause, and I said.

946
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,800
Wait, can I, did you buy it

947
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,160
because the book was checked out?

948
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,120
No, no, the book is still available.

949
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,760
The book is still available.

950
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,240
Head there after this.

951
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,880
I'd have to break in at this hour, but you understand?

952
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,720
Yeah, worth it.

953
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,680
So that was in 2004 printing.

954
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,400
And we talked about how the Hapbox Ghost

955
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,320
only had one page in that edition.

956
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,840
And I got a hold of the newest edition,

957
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,440
which is dated 2015.

958
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,440
And now the Hapbox Ghost has one page dedicated to himself.

959
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,800
Is there any new information?

960
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,240
Yeah, not really.

961
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,960
There's a picture of that guy Ray Spencer.

962
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,600
Is that his name that we talked about last year?

963
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,360
Remember?

964
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,640
He's the, he's the, he's the circus man.

965
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,720
He's in the toy store at California Adventure.

966
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,640
Oh yes, yeah, yeah, I remember that.

967
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,000
There's a picture of him in there.

968
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So you're the writer.

969
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,760
Is he in a fun hat in that too?

970
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,840
Oh no, just slacks and a button up.

971
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,720
All right, so the book is unchanged,

972
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,280
is what you're telling us.

973
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,160
Pretty much, there's little bits and pieces here

974
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,920
and there it seems like,

975
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,200
but not much more about the Hapbox Ghost.

976
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,840
Thank God, boy, hey, it keeps working out tonight.

977
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,200
Things keep, things keep coming up grandpa.

978
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,040
Hey.

979
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,520
Okay, so that means we get to,

980
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,680
let's talk about going in reverse, right?

981
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,880
You tell me, we get to, we spin in reverse

982
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,240
and we go down the hill into the graveyard.

983
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,840
You are essentially falling out of the attic.

984
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,760
This is what I didn't know until recently.

985
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,160
Yeah, I kinda didn't either.

986
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,480
I guess really what you,

987
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,520
cause like, it's like you're being killed

988
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,440
and you're falling backwards into the graveyard.

989
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,200
That's some interpretations, yes.

990
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,120
Or you could be falling, you're saying you could be alive,

991
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,160
falling backwards out a window

992
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,360
and maybe upon impact you die.

993
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,440
Oh, and it goes so slowly

994
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,640
because everything's flashing before you.

995
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,480
Right.

996
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,640
What in reality would be just one or two seconds

997
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,680
of horror is stretched out to 10 seconds or so.

998
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,040
Right, what's interesting about it

999
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,080
is I find that part of the ride so relaxing.

1000
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,520
It's kind of like a reset,

1001
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,480
gives you a break from all the activity

1002
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,320
and lights and stuff.

1003
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,960
Well, and it's like, it's like you're in a hospital bed

1004
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,000
and it like starts going down.

1005
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,840
Famously comfortable.

1006
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,760
Yeah, like, yeah, pretty good.

1007
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,600
But now that I'm hearing what like it might be simulating,

1008
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,960
it's kind of, I don't know, it's weird.

1009
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,480
I feel like it should be, here's what I'm saying,

1010
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,720
it should be a jerky, violent motion

1011
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,320
when you're falling out the window.

1012
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,000
The thing should like whip around

1013
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,800
and then you'd like do like a drop like pirates

1014
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,040
but you're backwards in the omnimover.

1015
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,880
I'm just saying they fucked up.

1016
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,720
Huh?

1017
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,560
They're like.

1018
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,560
It's an unclear death.

1019
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,240
The exact supposed to be dead.

1020
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,920
Well, there was something apparently

1021
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,080
that would have spelled this moment out

1022
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,640
a little more clearly, although this is very speculative

1023
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,720
and this is from doombuggies.com.

1024
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,000
I now will read in front of an audience.

1025
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,320
Part of a website.

1026
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,000
As a printed out part of a website.

1027
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,520
Here we go, that's what you came here and paid for.

1028
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,720
And then Grandpa Munster read me a website.

1029
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,800
That's my favorite show.

1030
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,000
And six years of this, you're saying.

1031
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,720
And Daniel Roebuck was in the Tam O'Shanter.

1032
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,040
Yeah, and we all got excited about it.

1033
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,480
Huh?

1034
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,320
Very not very good.

1035
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,160
We're sorry.

1036
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,960
Lock them up, lock them up, put them away.

1037
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,800
We're sorry.

1038
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,000
All right, it's the idea of that

1039
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,520
that part is supposed to be dying

1040
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,800
has been maybe written off as revisionist history.

1041
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,320
Maybe not the Imagineers intention,

1042
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,480
but a haunted mansion enthusiast named Hunter Adamson

1043
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,720
shared a story with doombuggies.

1044
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,440
He swears it's from a reliable source.

1045
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,960
I once heard from an old Disney manager

1046
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,200
that part of the original plan for the haunted mansion

1047
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,960
was that as you leaned backwards to descend to the graveyard

1048
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,760
there would have been a Pepper's Ghost type figure

1049
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,440
shoveling dirt as if to be burying the occupants

1050
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,160
of the doom buggy in the cemetery alive.

1051
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,760
So that would be like in the ceiling essentially.

1052
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,600
Jason is a big guy.

1053
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,440
I don't smile like this.

1054
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,280
You sit, Jason does.

1055
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,920
I'm just imagining someone hosing a thing of caramel cord

1056
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,400
and then going on this ride and it's like,

1057
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,880
oh wow, we're getting buried alive.

1058
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,080
It's that famous Disney touch.

1059
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,600
Walt's like introducing the ride on,

1060
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,800
or not ABC, whatever channel it was on.

1061
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,200
And then NBC.

1062
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,040
NBC.

1063
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,520
And then you'll go and you'll be buried alive.

1064
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,200
It's very strange.

1065
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,680
It doesn't open up like what else you could do there

1066
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:13,840
if they're gonna make it so personal and so much your death.

1067
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,600
If the next step of that was more Pepper's Ghost

1068
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,000
but not too many because the idea could be

1069
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,720
that there's just one Grantskeeper and nobody else there

1070
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,280
because you were having a sparsely attended funeral.

1071
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,280
Or it's like if you're actually dying

1072
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,680
everybody's really happy about it.

1073
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,960
You're about to go to a big party.

1074
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,920
Which on one end I guess is like, it's a nice,

1075
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,600
it's comforting in a way because you go like,

1076
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,000
oh, there'll be an afterlife in the party

1077
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,160
in the afterlife, excuse me.

1078
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,160
Or everyone's thrilled that I'm dead.

1079
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,040
Well, it'd be great if there were a bunch of revelers

1080
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,240
all celebrating above your grave.

1081
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,200
And then you wonder aloud,

1082
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,040
is this because they're celebrating my life?

1083
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,640
And one of them says, no, we're happy you're dead.

1084
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,520
You're going to hell.

1085
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,160
You know what?

1086
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,600
They should have kept then,

1087
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,720
you should be on your back for that whole section.

1088
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,800
They should have kept you that way.

1089
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,720
And then you go like the whole ride like this.

1090
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,160
Like looking to your side and you're like, oh shit.

1091
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,400
And then you have to figure out how to get out lying

1092
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,240
on your back.

1093
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,120
Oh yeah, okay, so then they have to build a door on it

1094
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,400
and it has to close on you.

1095
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,320
And you have to bang your way out at the end.

1096
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,320
So coffin challenge, we've just reinvented

1097
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,920
the coffin challenge.

1098
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,920
Always my problem with doom buggies, no lid.

1099
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,920
That Bob Gur didn't know what he was doing.

1100
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,040
So I'm very interested, the Pepper's ghost was going to be,

1101
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,520
had to be in the ceiling then,

1102
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,000
or I guess maybe to one of the sides

1103
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,160
because it couldn't be on the left

1104
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,800
when you're going down the Disneyland.

1105
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,320
They have the scrim, you can see the scrim

1106
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,520
when you're up top of all the ghosts flying upwards.

1107
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,360
Right, so in the distance you can see all the ghosts flying.

1108
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,280
But you couldn't put the Pepper's ghost, I don't know.

1109
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,040
I'm interested in the geography of this.

1110
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,280
I was there with my family recently

1111
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,080
and through trying to get on doom buggies,

1112
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,600
it ended up where I was in one with my brother

1113
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,280
and Jane and my dad were in one.

1114
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,840
And so of course me and my brother

1115
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,960
were totally silent the whole time.

1116
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,200
And I think I leaned over at one point and went like,

1117
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,960
that one's name is Bickwick.

1118
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,160
Because of course I did.

1119
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,200
But Jane and my dad were so excited when they got out there

1120
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,600
like that part when you go backwards,

1121
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,200
you see the side of the house.

1122
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,160
I'd never noticed that before.

1123
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,080
And honestly, I had to go back and look it up.

1124
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,480
I hadn't really noticed either that you can see the side

1125
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,280
of the mansion in here.

1126
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,520
But did either of them talk about Bickwick?

1127
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,120
No, I can't imagine.

1128
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,360
That's the only way to ride.

1129
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,240
Next time everybody start whispering stuff to each other,

1130
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,840
whoever you're with, next time we go.

1131
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,680
Well, there you go.

1132
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,880
So we didn't get to actually be buried alive.

1133
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,200
You don't go on your back.

1134
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,160
You comfortably sit for the rest of it.

1135
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,000
You know what?

1136
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,840
You get an appearance from the Raven,

1137
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,920
one of the many Raven appearances.

1138
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,960
And this is really good.

1139
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,800
Yeah.

1140
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,040
I really, the Raven,

1141
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,800
I forget the Raven's there almost every time.

1142
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,280
So it gets you when it calls.

1143
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,000
I'm not scared, I just go, yeah.

1144
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,800
The Raven's there, that's nice.

1145
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,360
You do the move when like an Everclear song

1146
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,480
is on at a restaurant.

1147
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,160
Listeners don't get to see it usually.

1148
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,000
Okay.

1149
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
My answer's a miracle point.

1150
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,840
Oh, yeah.

1151
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,640
It's like you're in the lobby of a courtyard

1152
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,080
by Marriott with Mike.

1153
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,000
Bruh, Everclear's cover of Brown Eyed Girl.

1154
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,240
They wrote a new intro for it.

1155
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,120
The other thing when you're going backwards,

1156
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,880
next to the Raven, Scary Trees, your favorite song.

1157
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,720
Oh, God.

1158
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,560
I know.

1159
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,680
Big shout out for Scary Trees.

1160
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,960
Yeah.

1161
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,280
Hang on now.

1162
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,040
Let's not support them too much.

1163
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,080
They don't bother me too much

1164
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,040
because they don't talk.

1165
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,840
We're not in that Wizard of Oz, you know.

1166
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,560
Hey, what are you doing?

1167
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,240
If they, no dialogue for that.

1168
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,320
As long as they never,

1169
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,720
that's a plus up I don't ever want.

1170
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,720
Is for them to talk?

1171
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,560
Yeah, yeah.

1172
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,400
No, keep them silent.

1173
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,920
What if they did the E.T. effect?

1174
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,160
And you, can I give your name at the start of the ride?

1175
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,160
And then the trees were like,

1176
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,000
Scat.

1177
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,840
Scat.

1178
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,000
Friend.

1179
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,840
Friend.

1180
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,480
Person.

1181
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,960
The afterlife is just me and you.

1182
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,040
I'm gonna be there throwing apples at you.

1183
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,360
Yeah, you should see,

1184
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,520
cause yeah, if you were going to the afterlife,

1185
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,600
it shouldn't be trees, it should be like little devils.

1186
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,360
Oh, they're right.

1187
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,520
Or little angels, I guess.

1188
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,040
Depending.

1189
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,120
I guess you could, yeah, you could,

1190
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,360
that would be a plus up is where you would flip them out.

1191
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,880
Sometimes like cars, sometimes you win,

1192
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,960
sometimes you lose.

1193
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,320
Sometimes on a mansion, you get a little devil,

1194
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,480
sometimes you get little angels.

1195
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,600
Wow, it decides for you?

1196
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,680
Yeah, it's random.

1197
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,520
Wow.

1198
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,120
Yeah, it's like the end of Ray Dator Springs racers.

1199
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:43,960
That's what I said.

1200
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,480
Sometimes you lose.

1201
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,960
Sometimes you get the one you didn't want.

1202
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,360
Would you prefer if they replaced the trees

1203
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,280
with little devils or little angels?

1204
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,240
Maybe for the oddity of it, sure.

1205
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,720
But then, you know, maybe not,

1206
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,600
because at some point in the nearish future,

1207
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,120
I'll be taking my son on there.

1208
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,960
And I don't know if I want.

1209
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,440
I think I want the motive, like,

1210
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,200
we've chosen hell for you.

1211
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,440
Yeah, that's a little intense, I guess.

1212
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,280
Okay, but what if-

1213
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,920
Next guy's heaven, next guy's a better kid, he gets heaven.

1214
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,920
What if the little devils are hot stuff, the little devil,

1215
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,640
and the angel is the biblically accurate angel,

1216
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,800
which is like the floating eye and the tentacles,

1217
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,840
and it says, be not afraid.

1218
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,200
Because then it's,

1219
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,040
then it's like a good, it's a lesson.

1220
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,200
It's historically accurate.

1221
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,520
I mean, the angel part, I guess, hot stuff.

1222
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,600
Hot stuff's just fun, it's just fun to see him.

1223
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,440
Yeah.

1224
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,200
Well, they got a branding deal to work out, I guess.

1225
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,640
I don't know who owns hot stuff.

1226
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,880
That's amazing, is that something I can ask the audience?

1227
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,560
Who owns hot stuff? Who owns the hot stuff devil?

1228
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,360
Yeah, who owns Harvey Comics at this point?

1229
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,200
That's a good question.

1230
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,200
They got hot stuff, they got Baby Huey, Casper, Richie,

1231
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,120
you know? Dreamworks.

1232
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:09,960
Dreamworks? Dreamworks.

1233
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,800
Don't lie to me, huh?

1234
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,360
That's right, they did all those like,

1235
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,480
cartoons that we all remember.

1236
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,280
Also, what's on your shoulders?

1237
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,640
I got a Ghost Mickey from Tokyo Disneyland.

1238
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,480
Whoa!

1239
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,960
Oh, nice!

1240
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,720
And a Jelatoni as a pumpkin from Hong Kong Disneyland.

1241
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,800
Wow, a Jelatoni and a Ghost Mickey on his shoulders.

1242
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,000
Great job, I'm glad we could shout out another costumer.

1243
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,360
Yeah, what was that?

1244
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,200
Yeah!

1245
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,280
Big round of applause, dude.

1246
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,920
Wow, yeah, wow.

1247
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,720
Oh, everybody's nervous, we didn't know Jelatoni

1248
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,720
was in the building.

1249
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,320
Oh.

1250
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,800
Fellas, hide the ladies.

1251
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,640
Jelatoni's here.

1252
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,800
By that, you mean Dr. Lily Hotten?

1253
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,640
Is that her name?

1254
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,480
That was her name, yeah.

1255
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,320
Oh, okay, great.

1256
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:05,080
Jelatoni's gonna go find those Lily Hotten dolls.

1257
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,200
Give them away, give them away in the packages.

1258
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,960
Do we move on?

1259
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,160
Are we off of the downhill?

1260
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,000
This is the first time.

1261
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,440
I don't know, trees, I mean, okay, yeah.

1262
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,960
Let's go over trees we talked about,

1263
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,280
we talked about going on your back.

1264
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,240
Generally being backwards, yes.

1265
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,520
How do you feel about being backwards?

1266
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,840
It's cool, it's nice that the ride can do it for me.

1267
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,040
Because this is, I really think this is,

1268
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,160
we've taken this for granted after all these years.

1269
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,840
I bet this blew people's mind when they went on this first,

1270
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,440
that this vehicle could do things.

1271
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,440
Because in the same way that, oh my God,

1272
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,320
the trackless risers, oh wow, look what this can do.

1273
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,600
I'm sure people were like, holy shit,

1274
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,640
this thing turns around and flips me on my back.

1275
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,280
Going backwards with elevation, with an incline.

1276
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,120
Yes, two things, two.

1277
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,960
It's two things, so.

1278
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,760
And it has like, you know, a decent amount of wrap around

1279
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,760
so you can do some awkward team making out.

1280
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,680
Well this is.

1281
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,360
That came up in the first year with me.

1282
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,120
This is the most romantic part of the ride.

1283
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,680
The downhill, oh yeah, because it kind of like,

1284
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,680
clunks you back, and oh that's true.

1285
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,040
This is like romantic comedy city here.

1286
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,800
If you are not, like you better be prepared

1287
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,440
when you do this, if you know what's happening.

1288
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,600
Like you better not go on with your crush

1289
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,760
if you're not prepared.

1290
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,840
Okay?

1291
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,760
Yeah, you better not go on with your brother

1292
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,600
or your boyfriend's dad.

1293
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,840
You gotta know what's coming.

1294
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,480
Will that new, will Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell,

1295
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,680
who the guy I know, will they go on this ride?

1296
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,840
Well you think they're a couple, but watch out.

1297
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,400
So they're gonna go on the Haunted Mansion?

1298
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,240
They're gonna go on the Haunted Mansion

1299
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,160
and maybe they'll get stuck on the decline.

1300
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,200
Oh, getting stuck on the decline with your crush?

1301
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,640
Get outta here, oh my God.

1302
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,960
He's so stressful.

1303
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,480
Oh wait, I thought you were saying it was a good thing.

1304
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,000
Oh no, I would, not good at all.

1305
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,360
Then you're gonna kiss, ew.

1306
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,480
No, thank you.

1307
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,360
Let's use this time wisely and figure out our itinerary

1308
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,120
for the rest of the day.

1309
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,200
Oh, I think my Disneyland app still works.

1310
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,360
Let me get it out, see if those dining reservations

1311
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,720
are available.

1312
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,840
Oh, not yet, I better check over and over again.

1313
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,680
Until the ride works.

1314
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,520
Turning the other way as far as I can.

1315
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,400
Can I pull this bar off me entirely?

1316
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,000
Oh, I think the ride's starting.

1317
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,720
Did they say the ride's starting?

1318
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,160
Oh no, I must've misheard.

1319
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,200
So.

1320
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,200
I'll ask this gravedigger for help.

1321
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,760
Excuse me, good sir.

1322
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,960
Yeah, so is there a more romantic motion

1323
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,920
on a ride vehicle in the history of rides than this?

1324
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,000
Just gently moving?

1325
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,840
Clunk.

1326
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,480
I'm not saying it's perfect, I'm just saying

1327
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,640
of all the ride systems, is there one that sort of

1328
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,000
forces you sort of in a position?

1329
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,720
What's that?

1330
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,600
The Mater Swaying Mater is one.

1331
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,440
Oh, you can slide.

1332
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,520
You barely have extra room.

1333
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,600
You toss and turn.

1334
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,800
I think that's a good number two.

1335
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,560
The Old Matterhorn.

1336
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,720
Oh yeah, you're right, yes.

1337
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,520
Lap straddle, yeah.

1338
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,960
There you go.

1339
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,160
Wait, let's demonstrate in case they don't know.

1340
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,600
Here, let's do a little.

1341
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,440
Woo!

1342
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,280
Aw.

1343
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,120
Woo!

1344
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,960
Woo!

1345
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,800
Woo!

1346
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,640
Woo!

1347
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,480
Oh.

1348
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,320
Oh.

1349
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,160
Woo!

1350
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,000
Woo!

1351
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,600
We should ride separate, I think.

1352
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,480
Party of one, please.

1353
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,280
Party of one, yeah.

1354
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,880
You'll enjoy the ride better.

1355
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,920
So yeah, that'll keep Matterhorn, but Matterhorn.

1356
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:16,800
Matterhorn is more like erotic.

1357
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,640
Ha!

1358
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,480
And not ha!

1359
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,320
No, hold on.

1360
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,160
Excuse me.

1361
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,000
Hold on.

1362
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Explain eroticism to us.

1363
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,480
Hold on.

1364
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,720
That's a, okay.

1365
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,000
The Matterhorn, it's all about like vibration

1366
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
and aggressiveness and it's like,

1367
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
that's like just having aggressive sexual intercourse.

1368
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,840
Fun in Mansion is it swings you around,

1369
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,720
you lower, that's romantic.

1370
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,240
Really seems like you're trying to get us

1371
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,640
to recognize you as a sexual being right now.

1372
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,800
Thank you for recognizing me as a sexual being.

1373
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,720
So.

1374
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,120
Well, I mean, in terms of romantic,

1375
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,360
there's literally a Little Mermaid ride

1376
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,720
where you very slowly go by the kiss the girl scene.

1377
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,560
How romantic?

1378
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,400
That's a pretty romantic song.

1379
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,680
Well, it's the same ride vehicle

1380
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,600
and there are similar moves in it,

1381
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,720
but I just, it doesn't do it for me.

1382
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,640
There is a Caribbean crab singing at a teenager.

1383
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,120
Yeah.

1384
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,640
Keep in mind that part.

1385
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,560
You know what it is?

1386
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,400
There's too many robots around there.

1387
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,640
On a mansion, you're just seeing that raven.

1388
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,760
Oh, there's some privacy.

1389
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,120
It's more chaste.

1390
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,200
And it's dark, it's dark in there too.

1391
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,400
That the kiss the girl scene is very well lit.

1392
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,720
So you're not getting that mood.

1393
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,920
People can see, the little turtles can see, they'll see.

1394
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,720
That might be for someone a little bolder,

1395
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,400
but for my preference,

1396
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,840
I prefer the backwards on a mansion

1397
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,920
is for a romantic movement.

1398
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,040
Okay, so most sweeping movements,

1399
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,120
most romantic ride there is,

1400
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,560
part of a ride that there is,

1401
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,960
except that in the dead center of it, there's a,

1402
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,800
car!

1403
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,360
If you can ignore that, you're a romance.

1404
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,560
He's just cheering me on.

1405
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,400
So.

1406
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,240
It's not true love to me!

1407
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,080
Car!

1408
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,600
You're a sexual being!

1409
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,440
Car!

1410
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,280
Car!

1411
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,120
I love you!

1412
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:45,960
Car!

1413
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,800
Car!

1414
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,040
Okay, okay.

1415
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,000
I think we're moving on,

1416
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,960
but just to like-

1417
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,800
Can you say something?

1418
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,480
Just, I just get, the romance is just too much.

1419
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,600
I'm getting flustered.

1420
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:02,040
I wanna, just before we move to another part of the ride,

1421
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,320
there's one more bit of business.

1422
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,720
I wanted to talk about some ride before we backtrack into

1423
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,800
this because there is something else that was a lingering

1424
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,720
thing from last year's episode,

1425
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,400
because between last year's episode and this year,

1426
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,720
a big, something happened in Haunted Mansion World,

1427
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,320
Haunted Mansion the movie came out.

1428
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,160
Yeah.

1429
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,680
How about everyone cheer as much as you liked it?

1430
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,520
Yeah!

1431
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,880
Okay, huh.

1432
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,360
Mixed, interesting mix.

1433
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,720
Well, another thing that was mixed were our guesses

1434
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:36,720
as to how many skulls out of 10 we would give this film.

1435
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,600
We didn't, it was just a guess, just based on rumors.

1436
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,960
We hadn't even seen a poster.

1437
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,080
There was no real way to know,

1438
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,120
but we were like, let's guess for next year.

1439
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,880
Here were our guesses.

1440
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,760
Mike thought he would like the movie 6.5 skulls out of 10.

1441
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,760
I guessed 3.5.

1442
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,120
My rationale being it is a product being released

1443
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,400
in this year by the Walt Disney Company.

1444
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:06,720
Uh, Jason, 8 skulls out of 10.

1445
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,520
8 skulls.

1446
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:13,520
Um, would we all like to say what we officially give the movie

1447
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,120
out of 10 skulls?

1448
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:15,960
Yeah.

1449
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,800
Um.

1450
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,640
First.

1451
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,480
Yeah.

1452
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,960
I haven't gotten around to it yet.

1453
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,120
I know, I know.

1454
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:22,960
I know.

1455
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,800
I know.

1456
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,640
I know.

1457
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,480
I know.

1458
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,320
I know.

1459
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,160
I know.

1460
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,000
I know.

1461
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,840
I know.

1462
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,680
Also no, Mike.

1463
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,520
I know.

1464
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,120
I'm after Yellowstone.

1465
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:36,720
I will watch it.

1466
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,440
There's a lot going on.

1467
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,640
Uh huh.

1468
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,880
It's just that you have all that,

1469
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,160
literally anything else to do.

1470
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,120
Yeah, it's true as well.

1471
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,080
I had a little evening nap

1472
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:53,480
after the Phillies lost last night.

1473
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,320
And I-

1474
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,160
Wait, hold, hold.

1475
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,000
An evening?

1476
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,400
Isn't that just going to bed?

1477
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,560
Uh, no, I woke up for a couple hours.

1478
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,920
Then we went for a few hours.

1479
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,760
What time were we talking?

1480
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,600
What time?

1481
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,520
Well, it was a 2 of 5 game local time.

1482
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,360
So it was probably about,

1483
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:13,000
so I think I slept from like five to eight.

1484
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,600
Or five to eight thirty.

1485
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,440
Wow.

1486
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,200
That's a long, that's a long, God.

1487
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,120
I went, my kid's not even taking naps anymore.

1488
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,960
I would kill for that long of a nap

1489
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,320
in my three year old who lives in my house.

1490
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,360
Yeah.

1491
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,720
And I just found out through my watch

1492
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,720
that they lost again tonight.

1493
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,200
So, I know.

1494
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,040
Sounds like-

1495
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,600
They got more chances, they got more chances.

1496
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,440
It's okay.

1497
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,880
Oh boy, you're going to make it through

1498
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,440
the rest of this one, you're going to be okay?

1499
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,760
Yeah, we'll see.

1500
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:43,320
At least we don't have a second show or anything.

1501
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,160
Yeah.

1502
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,560
Um, let me, here's,

1503
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,040
I know I lied a little bit.

1504
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,280
I've seen some of the movie.

1505
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,640
I've seen the first three seconds of the movie.

1506
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,560
And I saw it because someone alerted me

1507
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,320
that at the beginning of the movie,

1508
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,280
there's Disney does, Disney Plus has the warnings

1509
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,560
and it's PG-13 and this scene is made,

1510
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,800
contains such and such.

1511
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,960
There's literally, this movie has so much product placement

1512
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,280
that literally there's a warning on Disney Plus

1513
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,480
that is warning, this film contains product placements.

1514
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,320
Wow.

1515
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:22,320
That is unheard of in the history of movies.

1516
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,200
I have never heard of that.

1517
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,200
Well, keep in mind, they had to go through

1518
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,640
the governing body of themselves, Disney.

1519
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:40,120
Like this didn't pass through some FDA outside body.

1520
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,480
They were just like, God, even for us, this is,

1521
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,480
this is a lot.

1522
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,120
That's the type of warning you get printed on a sign

1523
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,120
at Staples Copy and Print Center.

1524
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,240
Literal dialogue from the film.

1525
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,320
This is, if I could just really quick

1526
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,440
and I credit the screen rant for this information.

1527
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,720
If you wouldn't mind me reading to you

1528
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,360
some of the product placements that occur

1529
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:14,240
in Haunted Mansion 2023.

1530
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,200
Most of them I don't have in context.

1531
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,720
I just have the products themselves.

1532
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:19,640
Here we go.

1533
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,640
U-Haul, BMW, Dell, Pentax camera,

1534
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:27,400
Fujifilm, Tito's vodka, Budweiser, Jose Cuervo, Fritos.

1535
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,600
Those ones we know are all real

1536
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,400
because that's who has the liquor licenses

1537
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,560
in the Disney parks.

1538
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,160
It's a general partnership there.

1539
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,080
Crocs, Zillow, Yelp, Benihana, Chevrolet, Apple Watch,

1540
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,720
Black Panther, the movie.

1541
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,760
Marvel Comics, collector's edition, Monopoly.

1542
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:48,040
Costco, Canon, Burger King, Zatarain's,

1543
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,520
New Orleans style Creole seasoning.

1544
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:54,480
Zatarans.

1545
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,640
Zatarans, thank you.

1546
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,560
I had a feeling, should have looked it up.

1547
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:03,800
Yankee Candle, which is purchased via subscription

1548
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,040
on Amazon.

1549
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,560
There's a part where Tiffany Haddish wants a ghost

1550
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:08,960
to write a message, quote,

1551
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,080
using this pen and pad I bought from CBS.

1552
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,640
And finally, the emotional crux of the film occurs

1553
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,440
during a dramatic monologue about how

1554
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,960
Lakeith Stanfield's wife died on the way to Baskin Robbins.

1555
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:36,040
I think maybe all of us guessed many too many skulls.

1556
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,320
Wow.

1557
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,800
I've read that list a few times,

1558
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,280
and every time just makes me wanna watch it more.

1559
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,760
It also makes me go like, oh, that company's still around.

1560
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,160
Okay.

1561
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:54,240
Dell computers hanging in there, all right.

1562
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,880
Well, the where if you try to watch it,

1563
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,240
because it's dark, it's a dark film,

1564
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,800
and I don't mean like the themes.

1565
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,760
I mean, it is so hard to see.

1566
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,600
What's happening?

1567
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,840
Disney, all just colored, all our eye photos have it.

1568
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,160
We'll do it for you.

1569
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,760
Give me a couple bucks up right in the movie.

1570
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,160
It's so weird.

1571
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,240
Anyway, that's my weird,

1572
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,480
I wanted to get a little of that out

1573
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,480
because the haunt cast season will not be going

1574
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,320
too much longer.

1575
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,680
We got a couple more episodes on the pod,

1576
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,480
but we aren't doing an episode about the movie

1577
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,680
because we don't wanna be sad.

1578
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,640
And we all know, everyone agrees it is much more important

1579
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,280
to talk about Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart's

1580
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,120
Halloween.

1581
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:38,960
Hey!

1582
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,360
Yes, great.

1583
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,320
Everyone agrees.

1584
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,840
The Reddit agrees.

1585
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,840
Our Reddit can't wait for it.

1586
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,800
Hey, our pretty-

1587
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,640
Good news.

1588
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,280
Every minute closer to it, we get.

1589
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,240
Good news, foolish mortals.

1590
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,440
It's already in the cast.

1591
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,480
Okay, back to the ride, to the caretaker.

1592
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,760
Can we see it still in the caretaker, Mike?

1593
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,520
Let's see our pal.

1594
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:09,080
He is the shaky-knee guy.

1595
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:13,040
He is holding a lantern.

1596
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,880
He's got a trusty dog and a trusty shovel.

1597
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:18,960
He's great.

1598
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,080
It's a moment, Mike, of intimacy.

1599
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,200
You get so close to this character,

1600
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,760
you sense emotion.

1601
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,760
This is no cold distance, you know?

1602
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,880
Not like all those presidents you sit really far away from

1603
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,920
and all the presidents who aren't feeling anything

1604
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,920
in particular.

1605
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,040
This guy's scared and you can tell.

1606
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,520
Yeah, he's scared because he just discovered

1607
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,520
that you were in the middle of intimacy.

1608
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,360
Look at that face.

1609
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,080
That's the face you would make.

1610
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,600
This guy is great.

1611
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:57,040
I mean, I feel like in some ways he's sort of

1612
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:00,360
like not as celebrated as some of the other characters

1613
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,840
in the ride because he's not a ghost.

1614
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,520
But he's iconic.

1615
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,360
Yeah.

1616
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,200
You can see us.

1617
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,520
Let's celebrate a non-ghost.

1618
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,360
Celebrate him.

1619
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,800
Let's show them we can do it.

1620
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,960
Everyone here, round of applause for this robot.

1621
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,720
Lit by regular light as opposed to black light,

1622
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,680
a lot of the others lit differently.

1623
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:26,840
One of the few living things in the mansion.

1624
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,680
That's true.

1625
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,560
Like, yeah, he's organic matter.

1626
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,840
Yeah.

1627
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:32,960
I can't see through him.

1628
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:33,800
Right.

1629
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,960
The dog is malnourished and I don't care for that.

1630
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,600
Yeah, I gotta feed the dog more.

1631
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,200
Yeah, that has nothing to do with anything.

1632
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,720
He doesn't look like that because he's scared.

1633
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:42,600
Something happened.

1634
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:46,160
So you can at least, you can surmise from just

1635
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,960
the picture here that he's a bad owner.

1636
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,840
Unless, what if they're meeting

1637
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,600
for the first time right now?

1638
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,000
No, no.

1639
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,360
That's his dog.

1640
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,520
That's what I've always felt, but since I like this guy,

1641
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,120
I don't wanna go throwing accusations at him.

1642
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,880
I don't wanna take him to PETA.

1643
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,720
Jason, what do you think that's his dog?

1644
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,200
I think it's his dog.

1645
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,440
They seem acquainted.

1646
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,560
He's a bad owner then, two out of three say.

1647
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,000
Yeah, cause he's not looking at the dog.

1648
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,160
So like if the dog was just a random dog,

1649
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,760
he would be looking down like, ah, like he'd be scared.

1650
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,080
And he would be saying the same thing.

1651
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,040
I, he would be like, where's your owner?

1652
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,520
They're taking such bad care of you.

1653
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,920
I mean, I feel like he's a little distracted

1654
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,760
by the graveyard jamboree.

1655
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,400
Yeah, that would probably take my attention over.

1656
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,120
Yeah, but he's not looking toward the graveyard jamboree.

1657
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,520
He's looking toward you.

1658
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,760
He's not noticing the graveyard jamboree.

1659
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,960
He's not, I've always taken this as, at least he's seen.

1660
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,440
So I take that face as he is looking

1661
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,360
at a thousand ghosts at once.

1662
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,320
Yeah, I feel like his jaw is like jabbering.

1663
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,880
Like it's scared, like, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1664
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,200
He's like, what was that?

1665
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,200
What was that?

1666
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,040
What was that?

1667
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:06,000
He's either just seeing the ghost for the first time

1668
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,920
or it's just like, he looks, he looks a little rough, right?

1669
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,480
He looks a little like shit.

1670
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,800
So maybe he sees the ghost every night

1671
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,040
and he's still not used to it.

1672
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:20,200
Yeah, he is look, he's, I think he's seeing you as a ghost.

1673
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,480
That's what I think.

1674
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,400
But he's not looking toward the big party.

1675
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,080
I think he's like, oh my God, who goes there?

1676
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,720
It's a ghost people and that they're necking

1677
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:33,720
and my dog needs food, but I keep forgetting.

1678
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,280
That's not her letterman jacket.

1679
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,080
It must be his.

1680
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,760
She must have put it on.

1681
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,440
You think it's at you, like, like that you were

1682
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,120
so horrifying as a ghost.

1683
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,000
I believe, I think so.

1684
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,640
Cause why wouldn't he be pointing the other way?

1685
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:55,400
He's blocked off from seeing the actual graveyard.

1686
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,960
This to me ties into your kind of paranoid,

1687
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,160
everyone's looking at me, runner, everybody's,

1688
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,200
everyone at City Walk will notice me

1689
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,440
throwing the mini monster away.

1690
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:14,560
I'm in a haunted mansion and there's many ghosts around,

1691
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:18,080
but you are the scariest one of all.

1692
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,880
Well, the room for one, the further they say it,

1693
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,280
room for one more.

1694
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:24,160
And yeah, everywhere I go, I'm a star.

1695
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:30,040
And yes, want to hug me, especially Orlando.

1696
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,280
Orlando, many be wanting to hug me.

1697
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:37,720
In Mike's defense, there's a lot bigger security corridor

1698
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:41,080
now, so they might be checking him out.

1699
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:41,920
Wait, what?

1700
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,760
What does that mean?

1701
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:47,400
Like there's a lot more fences and presumably cameras

1702
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:52,400
and metal detectors at City Walk, at City Walk, Hollywood.

1703
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,720
We went back to City Walk.

1704
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,400
They might be like, what is that guy being weird

1705
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,320
with the drake?

1706
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,080
Should we keep an eye on him?

1707
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,600
Where are there more security fences?

1708
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,000
The metal detectors are for like going into the park.

1709
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,480
Yeah, I'm just saying there's more of a presence

1710
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,480
than I feel like when we did that City Walk saga.

1711
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,240
We need to, we've gotten reports of people throwing

1712
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,800
mini monsters away.

1713
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:19,240
We need to put three milkshake detectors outside the store.

1714
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:22,160
We're gonna pat these people down,

1715
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,200
force them to finish it in the store.

1716
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:25,760
Shove those bobas down.

1717
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:29,040
We need to train 10 milkshake sniffing dogs.

1718
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,640
And they need to be patrolling at all points.

1719
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,440
The dogs need to know that you can buy glass at City Walk,

1720
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,240
but you cannot carry it 20 feet into the theme park

1721
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,600
you're probably going to.

1722
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,120
Teach them to bark at that.

1723
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:51,680
Let me say something else about this guy, Caretaker.

1724
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,680
He, I mean, I feel like always iconic

1725
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,320
probably like lived his toys or in artwork,

1726
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:00,400
but I think he really, his iconic status really got sealed.

1727
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,960
I want to say it was last year that Lowe's made him available

1728
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,240
in a take-home version.

1729
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,560
Do we have a still of that?

1730
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,400
There we go.

1731
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,080
Lowe's or wish.com?

1732
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,920
Can we see the next still, Mike?

1733
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:28,360
What is this one looking at?

1734
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:36,800
Presumably he's going to be on like on your front lawn.

1735
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,800
So he's looking at local teens drag racing.

1736
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,760
Oh yeah, Jay Walkers.

1737
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:45,600
Jay Walkers?

1738
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,240
He's a guest at Jay Walkers.

1739
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:51,160
He's sort of like a nosy neighbor at this point.

1740
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,320
He's just sort of like,

1741
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,760
he knows everyone's business in the neighborhood.

1742
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,040
He's mad about the 15 year olds

1743
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,680
are not even in costume and it's 8.30.

1744
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,560
Come on, it's too late for this.

1745
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:06,200
You should just put him in like a window at your house

1746
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,440
with like drapes like this.

1747
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,480
So people will be,

1748
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:16,960
no matter what they're doing on the street,

1749
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,640
if they catch a view of him, they will be like, ah!

1750
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,320
There's a peeping Tom.

1751
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,880
He could always be watching your moments of intimacy.

1752
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:27,720
That's true.

1753
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,040
Bring him home.

1754
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,560
You could do, you know, you could do a lot with him,

1755
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,120
just not even in Halloween.

1756
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,520
Like you could maybe put him in a Hawaiian shirt

1757
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,440
and like his glasses, like put him on the beach

1758
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,840
and his glasses like tip down his nose.

1759
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,360
And like, as people walk by,

1760
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,200
he's sort of like checking them out.

1761
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,280
And he can't believe what he's seeing,

1762
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,400
how hot everyone is.

1763
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:56,000
You could, it's very, it's, it's bug eyes and white hair.

1764
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,320
And I think that in non-Halloween season,

1765
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,480
you could easily restyle this guy to be Rodney Dangerfield.

1766
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,240
Put him in a Hawaiian shirt.

1767
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,080
Yeah.

1768
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,560
And you know, you put him in your yard

1769
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,400
and people ask what it is.

1770
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,480
It's Rodney Dangerfield for back to school season.

1771
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,320
Oh yeah.

1772
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,640
There's so many, I wonder if the hat comes off.

1773
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:19,000
It'd be nice.

1774
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,320
You could, well, or everything,

1775
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,680
like could you switch clothes with him?

1776
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:28,680
Um, I, I mean, presumably it's removable somehow.

1777
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,320
Yeah. Let's see the full wardrobe.

1778
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,640
We got a brown jacket and a green scarf.

1779
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,880
Yeah, the jacket's a little long, but I like the jacket.

1780
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:36,720
I like the jacket.

1781
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:37,560
I like the jacket.

1782
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,400
I like the jacket.

1783
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,240
I like the jacket.

1784
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,080
I like the jacket.

1785
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:40,920
I like the jacket.

1786
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:41,760
I like the jacket.

1787
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,600
I like the jacket.

1788
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,440
I like the jacket.

1789
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,640
I think this guy's going to be a little,

1790
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,640
he's not quite the size of the real one.

1791
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,720
So he's going to be a little smaller than you.

1792
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,640
You're going to, it's going to be a squeeze for you, Mike.

1793
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:51,480
Okay.

1794
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,440
He's got big pants on though.

1795
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,040
He hasn't been to the tailor.

1796
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,960
It has not come with a dog figure.

1797
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:04,320
Louis is not selling a sickly looking dog option.

1798
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,760
That's a clue that it's his dog.

1799
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,600
But you could put a mini next to him.

1800
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,560
No, it is. It's a clue.

1801
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,880
What is the clue?

1802
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,800
It's a clue they're not selling the dog with him

1803
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,360
because it would not be his dog.

1804
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,520
It would be a separate dog.

1805
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:21,200
Oh, so you're saying Louis is really concerned about Canon.

1806
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,320
Well, I'm saying that Louis knows that he's doing a bad job.

1807
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,520
So they just want to sweep it under the rug.

1808
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,840
They're not going to want the dog, right?

1809
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:31,680
No, of course not.

1810
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:33,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1811
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,000
we're not going to sell any of these if we.

1812
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,280
The president of Louis had a meeting about this.

1813
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,320
We're not selling a groundskeeper

1814
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,000
that treats his dog poorly.

1815
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,800
So either we don't sell it or remove the dog.

1816
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:48,400
And that's why you got CEO of the year.

1817
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,240
That's right.

1818
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:50,960
Mike, can you.

1819
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:51,800
The man who stands up for his beliefs.

1820
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,080
Can you go back to the ride picture?

1821
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:54,920
Which one?

1822
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:55,760
The real.

1823
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:56,880
The real Silas.

1824
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:02,280
I guess the question I have that I'm sure we've all been

1825
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:06,360
wondering though is, is the caretaker daddy?

1826
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:11,360
I mean, I don't know.

1827
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,760
He seems not threatening.

1828
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:17,840
He could be nice, but he seems confident in his job.

1829
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,240
Well, daddy seems to say you're attracted to the

1830
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,600
groundskeeper or whatever.

1831
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,160
Is that when you say daddy.

1832
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,000
Well, that's what I would.

1833
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:25,840
Yeah, no, I wasn't saying.

1834
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,960
Can he get it is what you're asking.

1835
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,040
It's hard to tell.

1836
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,600
He's so covered up.

1837
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,280
I got to see that pod.

1838
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,520
He dressed.

1839
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:37,840
Switch clothes with him.

1840
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:44,480
I think like, literally like maybe the pants, like maybe if

1841
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:48,040
he just went to a tailor and got them a little bit hemmed.

1842
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,440
I do think like this is an outfit I would wear.

1843
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,560
So he is dressed pretty well.

1844
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,920
Like you would think like he'd be all like much more like

1845
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:00,400
ragged and like his clothes would be torn asunder because

1846
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,600
he's just, he's out there and he's just takes

1847
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,440
for care of himself.

1848
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,560
But he looks pretty good.

1849
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,840
I will give you that.

1850
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,960
I don't know that he's my type of guy.

1851
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:13,440
Let's poll the audience.

1852
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,880
Who thinks that the caretaker is daddy?

1853
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,680
That's not nothing.

1854
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,800
Well, is Pickwick daddy?

1855
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:29,480
Yep.

1856
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:34,040
Pickwick brings the party with him.

1857
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:34,880
Doesn't he?

1858
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:38,280
Which character on the Haunted Mansion is everyone

1859
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,640
most attracted to?

1860
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,640
I mean, the organist can play an instrument.

1861
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,560
That is always attractive.

1862
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,600
That is always attractive.

1863
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:51,440
That's a good question.

1864
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,000
I mean, Hapox has the charisma.

1865
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,400
I know that's a little bit, that's like.

1866
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,560
Those dual guys are pretty dashing.

1867
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:00,400
Yeah.

1868
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,560
Constance might chop my head off.

1869
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,080
Figures crossed.

1870
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,440
If you're into a certain thing,

1871
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,480
Constance is probably the answer.

1872
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,000
Ultimate Finn-doming.

1873
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,600
Murdering your husband.

1874
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:30,400
All right, well, I think that's my job for the evening.

1875
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,400
Should be getting to bed.

1876
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,240
That's it.

1877
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,560
Take two or three hour naps with you.

1878
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:38,560
This liquid death makes me crazy.

1879
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,400
Canned water.

1880
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,400
Let's put some other.

1881
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:46,080
What did he say about canned water?

1882
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:46,920
It made him crazy.

1883
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:48,760
It made him crazy, yeah.

1884
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:53,760
Let's throw some other characters into the possibility

1885
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:59,760
mill of who is daddy, I guess.

1886
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,960
Which is the Weird Little Band.

1887
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,840
Can we see the Weird Little Band?

1888
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,920
Give it up for the Weird Little Band.

1889
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:06,760
Our next.

1890
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:13,600
And I say that because I've seen this referred to

1891
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:18,440
as the Phantom Five, but I've also seen the singing busts

1892
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,640
referred to as the Phantom Five.

1893
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,080
And it's not even, it's like half and half.

1894
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,520
No one can decide which is which.

1895
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,040
So I don't know.

1896
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,920
As with a lot of this lore, it's like good lore,

1897
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,840
but it's also like pretty fuzzy, right?

1898
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:33,680
Yeah.

1899
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,600
Like, you know, nobody quite knows what they're called.

1900
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,080
I don't know.

1901
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,840
But we know, well, you know, and I'm scanning them

1902
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:43,080
pretty fast, I don't think we got any daddies in this bunch.

1903
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:43,920
Unfortunately.

1904
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,680
That's why they took up music.

1905
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,640
They had to offer something else to the world.

1906
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:48,880
Yeah, they seem.

1907
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,240
If I can take a step back,

1908
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:52,400
cause you brought up confusing lore.

1909
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,640
Did you guys see all the names for the caretaker?

1910
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:57,480
Sure.

1911
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:58,320
Yes.

1912
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,160
Oh yeah, yeah.

1913
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,000
It's backtrack.

1914
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,840
Fine.

1915
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:01,680
Get back.

1916
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,520
Let's go back.

1917
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,360
Re-wind.

1918
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,640
Get back on your back.

1919
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:05,480
Re-wind.

1920
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:06,320
Yeah.

1921
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,560
I already, it's funny.

1922
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,480
Like I will tell you where I was thinking maybe

1923
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,200
optimistically we get is singing busts.

1924
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,240
I'm watching that dream dissipate.

1925
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:18,040
It is floating away.

1926
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,280
So names, names.

1927
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:23,960
Silas Crump.

1928
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:25,680
This is another one.

1929
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:26,840
Everybody's Crump.

1930
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,880
Everyone's right is Crump.

1931
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,000
Alastair Crump.

1932
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,840
And these guys, this little band,

1933
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:32,840
they're all named Crump.

1934
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,640
Everyone in this thing is Crump.

1935
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,440
Who are the two guys shooting at each other?

1936
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:39,640
It's Aloysius Crump and Foggin Bottom Crump.

1937
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,080
I don't think I like the lore.

1938
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:45,320
This is what I've learned after six years.

1939
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,480
Crump, Crump, Crump.

1940
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,920
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas with the Crumps.

1941
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,600
It would have, that's what I'm saying.

1942
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,560
It would have made the Eddie Murphy movie

1943
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:56,720
a little more dynamic if the Crumps showed up.

1944
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,880
I think that fellow being dynamic.

1945
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,560
They all farted each other.

1946
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,400
They all make up one of them.

1947
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,800
What's more dynamic than that?

1948
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:07,800
Okay.

1949
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:08,800
But also there's some special

1950
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,040
where Phyllis Diller calls him Clyde.

1951
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,920
Ken, we're all over the map.

1952
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,800
There's a model from, I believe the 70s

1953
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,480
where he is referred to as a grave robber.

1954
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,440
Oh, that adds something to it, doesn't it?

1955
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,960
Oh, I didn't see that.

1956
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,880
Well, let's, I guess, yeah, he's got the shovel.

1957
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,080
So he's obviously digging.

1958
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,880
It's either, is he doing it virtuously

1959
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:33,120
or is he doing it for his own nefarious deeds?

1960
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:38,960
I think it's virtuously because he doesn't have a sack.

1961
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,960
If he was gonna grave rob,

1962
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:45,000
you would need a sack to take the stuff, you know?

1963
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,040
Not if, not if he's gonna dig him up

1964
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,040
and then do something with it.

1965
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:53,120
No, no, no, no, no.

1966
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,680
And then put them back.

1967
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,520
There's no need to be body.

1968
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,360
No.

1969
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:02,360
Jason said grave robber, not grave fucker.

1970
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:03,200
Yeah.

1971
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,480
Grave robber's fun.

1972
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,280
The other one, no.

1973
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:13,280
There's a number of comic book short stories

1974
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:17,920
with conflicting, like they hire a younger caretaker

1975
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,200
and then he gets his old job back.

1976
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,600
I can't believe I thought we were out of this.

1977
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:26,080
That was, I was like, there was no pushback.

1978
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,160
There were no comic stories.

1979
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,000
I thought we were out.

1980
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:30,960
What was I thinking?

1981
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,800
That's why this guy's the best in the biz.

1982
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:33,640
Hey.

1983
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:34,480
Yeah.

1984
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,320
Woo.

1985
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,160
Woo.

1986
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:37,000
Woo.

1987
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Spin it, spin it, spin it.

1988
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,840
Woo.

1989
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,320
It's so much higher than you think it is.

1990
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:48,400
We have, guys, we gotta talk about something.

1991
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,440
We have to, we have to.

1992
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,160
We have time to talk about the Phantom Five.

1993
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,000
We do.

1994
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:52,840
Okay.

1995
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:55,280
And you know what else I think we have time to do

1996
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:59,200
is to play my favorite little part of Grimgarden Ghosts.

1997
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,600
There's a little video and I think like to the extent

1998
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,920
that anyone wants to.

1999
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:03,760
I feel like the monsters.

2000
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,240
Well, yeah, at one Grimgarden time, they had 30 tracks

2001
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,080
and they recorded 42.

2002
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,040
So, you're gonna have to go through all of those.

2003
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,240
Yes, definitely.

2004
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,680
Yes, I'm just saying it's my favorite part

2005
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:17,200
and I feel like maybe the monsters should dance to this song.

2006
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,360
Can you put on the song?

2007
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,440
Oh, we're gonna do a little dance?

2008
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:22,080
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna do a little Grimgarden dance.

2009
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:22,920
Hold on.

2010
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:26,000
Oh my God, it's not working.

2011
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:29,880
Yeah, there we go.

2012
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:30,720
There we go, there we go.

2013
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,560
There we go.

2014
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,600
You can just spin the propeller around.

2015
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,440
Woo.

2016
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:35,280
Woo.

2017
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,120
Woo.

2018
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:36,960
Woo.

2019
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:37,800
Woo.

2020
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:38,640
Woo.

2021
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:39,480
Woo.

2022
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,320
Woo.

2023
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,160
Woo.

2024
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:42,000
Oh yeah, that's it.

2025
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:43,680
I just wanted a quick hit of that.

2026
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,520
Great.

2027
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,360
That's.

2028
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,200
Woo.

2029
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,400
Oh, the theater does stuff.

2030
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,240
Wow, hey.

2031
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,080
Woo.

2032
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:49,920
Woo.

2033
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:50,760
I just got bold.

2034
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,080
Thank you for that.

2035
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,880
That's my favorite iteration of Grimgarden Ghost.

2036
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,840
I have notes about Grimgarden Ghost.

2037
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:59,160
These are also clearly going out the door.

2038
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:02,000
That's how much these things expand.

2039
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,840
Well, it's a fine place to start up next year.

2040
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,200
Well, we're not done yet.

2041
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,800
Go back to the Phantom Five.

2042
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,280
Let's talk about them.

2043
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:13,680
I mean, my question about them is,

2044
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:17,800
did they, were they musicians in our world?

2045
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,200
Or like, were they a band first

2046
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:25,200
and they died altogether in a bus accident or something?

2047
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,280
Did they die and was this a day the music died?

2048
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:30,320
Yeah, it's the day the music died.

2049
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,320
The musicians.

2050
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,480
They were all on one plane.

2051
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,120
I think, yeah.

2052
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,640
They were on an airplane getting ready

2053
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:44,640
for their Loot Bagpipe and Ovo show.

2054
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:47,800
Big tour.

2055
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:49,840
Yeah, they were on a big tour.

2056
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,200
And yeah, I mean, I guess it brings up the question

2057
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,400
that can ghosts learn?

2058
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:01,400
And that's why he's the best.

2059
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:14,640
It's pretty heavy.

2060
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:15,600
It's pretty heavy.

2061
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,240
We can all sit and think about it.

2062
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,640
You think when the moon rises,

2063
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:23,640
when the clock strikes midnight,

2064
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:28,280
they like get memento disease and forget everything?

2065
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:30,560
Every day?

2066
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,800
Or they forget the afterlife and then they-

2067
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,720
Or it's because learning is so vague.

2068
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,360
You learn little things all day, every day.

2069
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:38,200
Well, right.

2070
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,040
I hope you learn.

2071
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:42,400
Yeah, can you learn a skill if you're a ghost

2072
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,000
or is it like Groundhog Day?

2073
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Although he learns.

2074
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,440
That's exactly, yes.

2075
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,840
He does learn.

2076
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:51,000
He becomes incredible musician.

2077
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:51,840
He remembers.

2078
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:52,680
He remembers everything.

2079
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:53,520
Yeah, I think it's that.

2080
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,880
I think you get to Groundhog Day.

2081
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,920
It's a Groundhog Day that you have no hope of escaping.

2082
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,960
There's no rom-com ending for your Groundhog Day.

2083
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:04,720
So you better learn every instrument.

2084
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:07,840
Because ghosts, yeah, ghosts seem tortured.

2085
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:10,600
Because they're stuck, they have unfinished business.

2086
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,640
But if you could occupy your time learning new skills,

2087
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:15,920
I have so much stuff.

2088
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:20,920
You can watch Yellowstone season one through whatever it is.

2089
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:21,840
Five, six?

2090
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,280
So you're saying the afterlife is good

2091
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:27,160
because you get to get caught up on your shows.

2092
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,600
Yeah.

2093
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,920
Knock out the curriculum of ITT tech.

2094
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:36,840
The world is your oyster at that point.

2095
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:37,680
Yeah.

2096
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,960
The afterworld is your community college.

2097
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,600
The afterworld is your community college.

2098
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:45,560
Air conditioning repair and private investigator.

2099
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,920
There's time for it all.

2100
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,000
These guys are proof.

2101
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,720
I don't know, that's possible they couldn't play Lick.

2102
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:56,920
And now, and all it took was 900 years.

2103
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:57,760
Yeah.

2104
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,400
And now they can play one song over and over again.

2105
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,560
I like that long horn.

2106
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,440
Yeah.

2107
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,280
Yes.

2108
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:07,120
That's funny looking.

2109
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:11,920
Yeah, I think there's the specific here

2110
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:15,160
that a lot of the music was played backwards.

2111
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,480
That's a way that it's weird and ghostly.

2112
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:21,160
Like they transcribed it and ran it backwards.

2113
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,560
It's got this weird little sucking effect,

2114
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:25,440
a lot of the melodies.

2115
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:29,520
I think it's not a bagpipe, it's an oboe in reverse.

2116
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,280
Because I guess bagpipes are tough to play.

2117
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:34,280
I think even finding a session bagpipe player

2118
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:35,320
is a very tough thing.

2119
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,760
In the 60s, let alone now.

2120
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,080
I don't know the market today.

2121
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:41,720
Some of the stuff is played out of tune on purpose.

2122
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,640
Unsettling, sure.

2123
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:51,440
Proper tune age, that's the land of the living musicians.

2124
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:54,800
It's all creaky around here.

2125
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,320
Yeah, step wrong.

2126
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,720
You also, I think maybe my favorite musical

2127
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:03,240
little stingers or section in any of the Grim Grinning Ghosts

2128
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,280
versions in the ride,

2129
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,800
is probably when a little trumpet comes in.

2130
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,800
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

2131
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,520
And that's fun, that's good, thank you.

2132
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:17,440
I'll learn it better in the afterlife.

2133
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:22,200
But I learned who played the music on the thing.

2134
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:23,480
A lot of the musicians you're hearing

2135
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:26,120
are all these Benny Goodman kind of guys.

2136
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,760
But the guy who plays that little trumpet part,

2137
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,440
his name is Cappy Lewis.

2138
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:32,720
And he made an album called Get Happy with Cappy.

2139
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:33,560
Cappy!

2140
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:40,680
I definitely got happy looking at Cappy.

2141
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,680
Look at that watch he's wearing.

2142
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:45,680
Wow, you don't get a watch like this

2143
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:48,040
being a mediocre trumpet player.

2144
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,480
Say that.

2145
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:51,040
This is great, I love he's wearing

2146
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,440
almost like a bowling shirt.

2147
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:55,440
Like a red bowling shirt.

2148
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,320
This feels very Jason-esque too, I feel like.

2149
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,720
I mean look, we'll start next year with an hour on Cappy

2150
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:03,560
and his various endeavors.

2151
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,920
We can go back to simple assignments.

2152
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:11,720
Next year, as much as I loved the boxes

2153
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,680
and what you're wearing, maybe next year

2154
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:16,520
we go back to a simple shout out of Cappy.

2155
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,000
Cappy!

2156
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,720
We come up with our favorite song of his

2157
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:23,320
and then we learn that he was nicknamed

2158
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:27,360
Cappy the Killer after bodies were found in his yard.

2159
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:32,360
If you were a musician, a male musician in the 60s,

2160
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,080
chances are you were a murderer.

2161
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:40,640
That's just how it is.

2162
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:46,280
Well, I don't know exactly what else we have time for.

2163
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:47,560
I don't know, I mean, there was the whole,

2164
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:50,600
like they announced like changes to the Haunted Mansion Q.

2165
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,040
There's a get like.

2166
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,040
I wasn't sure if you pulled something up or not

2167
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,280
and then the audience response was like.

2168
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:02,080
People seem upset by that.

2169
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:05,080
There's a gift shop coming next year too.

2170
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,560
So I could be, the gift shop of course

2171
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,920
is outside of the confines of the ride.

2172
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:11,920
Literally we're looking at the exit of the ride

2173
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,760
so that is not something we will need to discuss, yes?

2174
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:15,600
We have to.

2175
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,480
Well, eventually.

2176
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:20,360
Just let me try, let me try please.

2177
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,600
So I kind of wanted to propose next year

2178
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,480
we take a break from the graveyard

2179
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:29,560
and we go right to the new queue and the gift shop

2180
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:33,680
because it's gonna be so fresh.

2181
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:35,680
It's like.

2182
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:38,360
Thinking outside the box.

2183
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,560
It's gonna be so.

2184
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:48,160
And it's gonna be fun to like sort of take a quick break

2185
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:50,560
from the whole way we've been doing it.

2186
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:55,760
Who knows what new feature on the Disney Play app

2187
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:58,120
will be integrated in this gift shop.

2188
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:05,120
That it'll over eat your phone in all sorts of new ways.

2189
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,760
What kind of spirit jerseys will they sell?

2190
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:13,160
Can I hide in a cape for a year?

2191
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,720
Oh, trust me, I've tried.

2192
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:20,920
I, well, okay, look, you guys, you know,

2193
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,080
you filled the assignment.

2194
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,360
I was delighted by your fulfilling of the assignment

2195
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:27,680
so I guess whatever we wanna do next year.

2196
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,600
But let me just say this.

2197
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,000
And this is like, you know, I'm looking at a clock

2198
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,560
that's winding down.

2199
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:34,800
I know we're ticking down here

2200
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,080
and we got another show to do.

2201
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:40,280
So, and I had no fantasy that tonight would be the end

2202
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,080
of the entire thing.

2203
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,560
Of course not, I know that.

2204
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,880
I'm no fool.

2205
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,040
But I, you know, just imagine for a second

2206
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,600
while we have an audience here,

2207
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:53,960
just hypothetical, imagine if we could all be together

2208
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:57,120
for the moment where we finally finished this series.

2209
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:00,160
Wouldn't that be cool to like, shall share that together?

2210
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:01,280
Sure, yeah.

2211
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:04,120
Yes, we can totally agree on that.

2212
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:06,960
But I, you know, that's just a thing to imagine.

2213
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,760
That's just kind of a thing to like brainstorm

2214
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,440
because like we're ticking down, right?

2215
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,960
And you know, it's not like you could possibly finish

2216
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:16,200
the rest of the ride in just, I don't know,

2217
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:19,040
exactly 26 seconds, right?

2218
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,000
Unless.

2219
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:20,820
No.

2220
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:21,920
Mike, could you play that video?

2221
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:22,760
What?

2222
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:25,160
Just click on the video, see what's there.

2223
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:28,280
Scott sent me a video and said, don't watch it.

2224
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:29,640
Yeah, just watch it now.

2225
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,000
Here we go.

2226
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,040
Okay, all right.

2227
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:35,040
Oh, it's one of his misbehave videos.

2228
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,840
Five singing bus perform the iconic song

2229
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:37,680
Grim Grinning Ghost.

2230
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:39,240
Then we weave through a series of comical

2231
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,880
rave-mode scenes involving many spirits

2232
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,240
set behind a number of scrims.

2233
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:44,200
There's a tea party, the headed guy, a Viking lady,

2234
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,040
all kinds of shit.

2235
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,120
The ghost host returns to warn us of hitchhiking ghosts.

2236
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,760
I can't even understand what he's saying.

2237
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:50,600
What funny names.

2238
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:51,920
In a series of mirrors, the ghosts appear to follow us home.

2239
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,080
I seem to be getting through it.

2240
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:55,200
Climb off our doom bunnies and step onto a moving ramp

2241
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,920
where we see a small ghostly bride who tells us

2242
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:57,900
to hurry back.

2243
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:00,600
The ramp leads to the exit and that's the haunted mansion.

2244
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:31,640
Wow.

2245
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,480
I knew we could, I knew we could.

2246
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,720
The guy from the Oscars held up the envelope

2247
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,720
and it said haunted mansion is done.

2248
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:49,720
That means it's official.

2249
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,480
We got to do it together, guys.

2250
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:53,160
Nice try, champ.

2251
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:55,560
That video didn't even include the phrase

2252
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:58,320
Ned Nubber Uncle Theodore.

2253
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:05,240
You know what?

2254
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,320
That video was very nice.

2255
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:08,600
Yeah, I thought so.

2256
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:09,440
I liked the effort.

2257
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,720
Went over pretty well, yeah.

2258
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,440
And it's official and binding.

2259
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:15,800
And what I think is nice about it is actually

2260
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,960
it sets perfectly up next time for us to talk

2261
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:21,640
about the new gift shop and the new queue.

2262
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,840
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

2263
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:28,120
You're saying that by exiting I have actually reset it

2264
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:30,480
which makes it more justified to go back

2265
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:34,280
so what we'll just do is we'll do the gift shop

2266
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:36,400
then we'll go to the queue and then yeah,

2267
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,400
we'll go through and see what we missed.

2268
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,920
Yeah, because we barely touched on the various types

2269
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:47,920
of audio recording and playback, analog and digital.

2270
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:51,440
So yeah, so this is perfect.

2271
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,400
Thank you for that nice little video.

2272
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:54,640
Thank you so much.

2273
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:57,440
Let's have a round of applause for the nice little video.

2274
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:01,320
That's perfect, that's perfect.

2275
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:03,920
Okay, glad you enjoyed it.

2276
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:04,800
Yeah, it was nice.

2277
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,080
That's why you guys are the worst.

2278
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:09,720
All right, that's our show.

On the mention it's gone.

2290
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:35,560
I was right, they were wrong.
