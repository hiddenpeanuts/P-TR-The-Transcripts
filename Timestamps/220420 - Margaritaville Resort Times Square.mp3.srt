1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:25,160
Welcome to Podcasts that Ride the Second Gate, where it's Easter Sunday as we record, but

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,040
it's always Island Time.

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,680
I'm Jason Jared and joined by Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,960
Yeah, Finns up.

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,160
It is Easter Sunday just for a little peek behind the curtain there.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,840
And we're all wearing our Easter best, I guess I'll say.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,600
We're all wearing four shrouds of torrents.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,160
That's what I meant.

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,880
Scott Garner also here.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,920
Yes.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,160
And it's important to know that Easter can overlap with Island Time and that even that

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:00,000
Christ, while he was suffering on the cross, technically still was on Island Time, as

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,680
darkest things may have been.

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,720
It is still even at the darkest hour there could ever be.

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,480
The glimmer of hope is that technically it's still Island Time somewhere.

17
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,680
When he was resurrected, he got resurrected and he came out like on a surfboard.

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,160
Yes.

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,080
And he was kind of like a big surfing, a big wave back into the.

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,560
And Saturday was just kind of a chill day for him.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,280
Like, and just got the rest.

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,040
Yeah, the left hand sat at the left hand of the father.

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,480
Right.

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,560
Which is well learned.

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,800
He had a tough run with all of the obvious, obvious crucifixion and all that.

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,160
But then, you know, when he had to, when he flipped over everything, when he was mad at

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,720
the goods being sold in church and, you know, I think the devil showed up and was mean to

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,440
him also.

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,240
So, yeah, I mean, a day of rest.

30
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,640
Great.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,120
That's what you guys got.

32
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,280
Yeah, that's right.

33
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,480
On the trip that we're talking about.

34
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,120
Left hand of the father, probably also one of the name of the bars we missed in this

35
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,760
establishment.

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,600
Left hand of the father.

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,160
26th floor.

38
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,320
Yeah.

39
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,600
We're talking about the Margaritaville Resort Hotel in Times Square, which of the three

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,560
of us, one of us and our special guests stayed at for four nights in New York City.

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,160
Four nights.

42
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,120
It's me.

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,480
I stayed there with our returning guests.

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,240
My wonderful girlfriend, Jay Claire.

45
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,720
Hi, Jay.

46
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:12,840
Hi.

47
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,200
You may say I'm the woman to blame.

48
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:15,920
Yeah.

49
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,840
We may say that.

50
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,360
Yeah, you're right.

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,440
Yeah, because you did go along with this.

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,400
Well, I think your initial reaction was, is this a bit?

53
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,280
It was.

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,160
I went, is this like a bit?

55
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,080
Like, can we just have a nice little trip?

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,480
Like.

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,880
Well, that would be the question.

58
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,920
That is the question I had when you said this was your plan was like, because, you

59
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,000
know, then I looked it up and like, oh, maybe this is a viable place to stay.

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,320
But my biggest concern was, would this be annoying to be in for a number of days?

61
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,640
Oh, good question.

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,520
That was my fee.

63
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,360
And now I think I know that that was not how it played out, but I will leave you

64
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,960
guys to answer that question.

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,400
Yeah.

66
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,000
So, I mean, I looked it up initially because I thought like, oh, well, what?

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,440
I mean, we have to stay somewhere.

68
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,280
And the, it was kind of an off season when we were in New York for the show, we

69
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,840
stayed leading up to the New York live show.

70
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,120
We got in early Thursday morning and yes, Jane, a number of times on this trip,

71
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,480
you were like, is this picture for content?

72
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,920
Like, are you taking this for memories or for content?

73
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

74
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,360
There's a thin line though.

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,560
You lose the, everything can be all of that at once.

76
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,480
And that's, you know, everything all at once.

77
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
And then I'd be like, well, can you take my picture?

78
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,320
Because I'd be like wearing like a cool fit or whatever.

79
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,520
And he's like, is this for content?

80
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,640
I'm like, oh, fuck you.

81
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,040
Like, very good.

82
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,960
It goes both ways.

83
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,600
Oh yeah.

84
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,040
Yeah.

85
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,960
No, I mean, I quite liked staying there because New York is very, you know, it's

86
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,520
not like LA, it's not a lot of greenery.

87
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,840
It's very hustle bustle city.

88
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,040
And so you'd go back to this place that felt very like vacation and very tropical

89
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,520
and very like Oasis, which I liked a lot.

90
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,120
Like, sure.

91
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,800
And it did feel though, what this is fascinating to me is if that, if you

92
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,560
can possibly get that vibe in New York, you went, we didn't even, they have

93
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,880
outdoor bars and there's a pool and everything, but it's not like so much

94
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,880
out of this, but you felt the Island vibe.

95
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,880
Oh yeah.

96
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,920
It was nice.

97
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,000
I think just cause it was so, the hospitality was great and like everything

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,600
was very like clean and very like pretty, even though it was not huge and built

99
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,560
up, you know, as opposed to like out.

100
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,680
Um, but I, yeah, our view was really nice.

101
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,960
I thought we had a nice view.

102
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,520
Yeah.

103
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,000
The vibes were good.

104
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,480
The service was very good.

105
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,120
Very good.

106
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,600
Um, and yeah, so that's, I mean, that's the main thing.

107
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,320
Spoiler alert.

108
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,280
The vibes are good.

109
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,280
The service is good.

110
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,040
So this is okay.

111
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,560
They've got some stars pretty close to Times Square.

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,400
It's pretty close.

113
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,200
All, all the, you know, tourist trapping and the 40th and seventh, I

114
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,280
think was the street corner.

115
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,520
Yeah.

116
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,280
And it's a massive, it's like a big, it's like not, I was my concern initially

117
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,160
when I heard this was being built.

118
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,000
This was going to be like almost like a tiny little sign added to like an

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,160
existing hotel chain or something, but it is a big, like a pretty impressive

120
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,800
building with multiple signs that you know, you see it and you identify the,

121
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,360
of course the iconic.

122
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,520
We were worried there would only be one sign.

123
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,680
That was your main concern.

124
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,080
When you saw the multiple signs, I wanted the building to be fun.

125
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,480
I wanted the building to give me at least a vibe where we could take a photo and

126
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,560
you could send it for content to different people even and say, Oh, look,

127
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,040
we're all over.

128
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,600
I am text conversations content as well.

129
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,120
Yeah.

130
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,760
Content.

131
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,120
Yeah.

132
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,440
I'm trying to entertain on content for everybody.

133
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,560
It's more curated content to the people on your thread.

134
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,480
Well, I think that's concern pulling.

135
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,480
I would like when we're telling the taxi guy, taxi driver pull over here.

136
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,320
Excuse me.

137
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,720
She said to Marguerite, there was a sign.

138
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,160
I was surprised the sign was sizable.

139
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,360
See other signs.

140
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,120
Other signs.

141
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,040
People were very, everyone was very concerned.

142
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,400
What if it's just, what if there's many, many signs, but they're all extremely

143
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,720
small that only bugs could see them.

144
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,080
Well, I was worried about that.

145
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,680
It turned out also some of the signs turned out to be wrong.

146
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,680
That is one of the shortcomings.

147
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,360
Every now and then there were a few things where it's like, Oh, this was not accurate.

148
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,040
Like times like restaurants were open.

149
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,440
Yeah.

150
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,160
Like on a street level, five o'clock somewhere, there was a happy hour and it

151
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,880
was like noon to four and we got the hotel and it's like the happy hour was one to six.

152
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,200
Or like the restaurant was like open seven to seven and it was like seven

153
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,920
thirty or eight and they were acting like, what are you doing up here?

154
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,880
Like, we're not open.

155
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,640
Sweeping and it's like, can we help you?

156
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,200
Okay.

157
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,640
So yeah, we got into this a little bit during the live show, but it was a, you had a

158
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,720
smallish sort of New York Times Square area hotel room.

159
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:49,240
But you were talking about one of the best things about it was that there were free waters.

160
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,320
Good, good as water.

161
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,280
Free spring water.

162
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,680
People have been waiting.

163
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,880
Like it only, the free waters were only addressed so briefly in the live show.

164
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,120
When are they going to open this up?

165
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,480
Yeah.

166
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,000
People are disappointed the episode's not called, murdering the free water.

167
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,680
Yeah, which is, I mean, it is spring water.

168
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,280
They were labeled paradise water.

169
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,680
Let's be clear.

170
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,680
They were pretty.

171
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,080
They had like a little, and then the inside had like a little beach like picture so you

172
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,760
could look through it.

173
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
It had a beach thing.

174
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,600
And it said Margaritaville on the water.

175
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:14,960
It did.

176
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,280
It said Margaritaville Resort.

177
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,760
So I'm assuming this is standard.

178
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,640
And like, I genuinely think that it was smart water and they had their own special

179
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,360
brand. The bottle was very similar.

180
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,760
The taste was very, like that's what I would compare it to.

181
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
It wasn't like shitty.

182
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,080
Do you think there is like a person in the basement pouring smart water into their

183
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,600
bottles?

184
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,960
I can tell you no, because the only things in the basement were a gym and a single

185
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,760
bathroom.

186
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,080
Which I, you spoof.

187
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,600
We did.

188
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,040
We did go to the gym once.

189
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,800
And I got to tell you about that.

190
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,160
We'll get there.

191
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,440
And that was kind of an adventure because, OK, if you've ever stayed in a New York

192
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,840
hotel room, this is a big thing about like, imagine a holiday in the center of

193
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,360
Manhattan.

194
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,200
The rooms are smaller.

195
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,480
These are smaller hotel rooms.

196
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:56,920
Right.

197
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:04,160
And sometimes you have to wait a long time for the elevators, which we encountered

198
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,240
here because there was a bank of four elevators, but not every elevator went to

199
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
all floors.

200
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Like one elevator is a service elevator.

201
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,480
So it's got the doors on both sides.

202
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,280
One elevator does not go to street level.

203
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,880
Some of it. Yeah.

204
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,000
If you're in a if you're especially if it's a big building.

205
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And this wasn't even that tall of a building, but this is, you know, 30

206
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
something.

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,680
I guess you're right.

208
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,480
That is tall.

209
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,080
Tall. And we are on the top.

210
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,960
It's like going to the elevator bank is like some sort of legend of Zelda puzzle

211
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,600
you have to unlock because there are four elevators and not all of them go to the

212
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,280
floor you want.

213
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,480
But if you're going to the restaurant, it's a different floor.

214
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,600
Then you have to figure out which one to get on.

215
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,680
And it's taking forever.

216
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,880
And some of them are full.

217
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,280
And there's other people that are they're confused and you're making eye contact

218
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,200
with them. And they're like, I don't know either.

219
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,560
I've been here for seven minutes.

220
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,960
What was very helpful is there was on most of them, there was like a digital

221
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,680
screen and you could just touch the like where you wanted to go as opposed to a

222
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,960
floor number for like restaurants or bars or like street level.

223
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,200
Once we figured that out and we were teaching other people in the elevator, too,

224
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,920
as we were doing it and they're checking in, they're like, oh, you could just push

225
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,800
the button. Everyone did feel very vacationy.

226
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,720
That was there. Like everyone was like happy and feeling chill.

227
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,520
I thought, yeah, how could you not be when you're surrounded by free water,

228
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,960
the greatest songs and decorations?

229
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,160
Well, now, now that is decorations.

230
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,080
Yes, because as soon as you walk in on the ground floor, you saw the giant flip flop,

231
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,120
the giant flip flop.

232
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,760
Big flip flop with the pop top with a giant sculpted pop top from the famous line

233
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,720
from the song Margaritaville stepped on a pop top.

234
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,200
It's the old old cans when you used to have to pop the tops off cans like beer cans

235
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,280
and stuff. It's an old thing.

236
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,880
So if you and then if you look closely at the flip flop on the back,

237
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,120
it's a little fucked up. So, you know, in the the the on the front, too,

238
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,920
one of the rubber straps. Oh, yeah.

239
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,080
On the front. Yeah. Oh, I see. OK. OK.

240
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,000
Popped off. So we also haven't said, by the way, just this is not only just

241
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,120
not a hotel only we're talking about, but of course, a multiple story

242
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,800
Margaritaville restaurant. Right.

243
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,560
Part of it is you need not stay there to experience this if you're in the New York

244
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,360
area. Of course, the spectacular sized Margaritaville restaurant.

245
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,080
Anyway, just yes. Yeah.

246
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,600
And we went there for happy hour the first day and there was a roving photographer.

247
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,520
And they took and gave us this free picture.

248
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,520
And they took a bunch of other pictures.

249
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,320
And they're like, if you want the other pictures, they cost money.

250
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,520
And we're like, oh, we're good with we're good with that.

251
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,160
So that was free.

252
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,120
Does you describe the notion of the postcard at the restaurant

253
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,040
as if that is a brand new.

254
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,240
So you're telling me that there's a person with a camera.

255
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,840
Though the photographer did not start in with the hard sell until she gave us

256
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,320
the free one and then started.

257
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,240
I don't I never get this.

258
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,440
I never, I never, I never.

259
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,400
At Bucatubepo, it happens all the time.

260
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,720
Sure. Yes. Yes. That seems like the place. Yeah.

261
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,080
Yeah. I went separate from you guys on that.

262
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,080
You said no, I didn't get it.

263
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,840
That was that summer where you kept saying no pictures everywhere you went.

264
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,920
You were kind of waving people away.

265
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,480
I was part of the spot too much content lately.

266
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,320
There's no pictures.

267
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,520
Make it up for it now. Those damn content.

268
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,520
That's right. Now he says pictures, please.

269
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,720
All these pictures.

270
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,960
I just needed a few pictures of me looking sad in front of closed chain

271
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,320
restaurants or chain restaurants that have flipped to other thematic chain

272
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,880
restaurants. That's it.

273
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,720
Oh, yeah. Up the like one block away from the Margaritaville Hotel

274
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,680
is the Hard Rock Cafe that used to be the WWE.

275
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,720
Yeah. New York. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever.

276
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,800
So, yeah, what?

277
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,440
Yeah. So the Margaritaville restaurant, there is giant escalators

278
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,160
when you walk in the ground floor.

279
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,280
And that's like on floors two and three.

280
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,400
The Landshark Bar and Grill, which we all did eat at with Griffin Newman.

281
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,160
Yes. Is on floor six and then floor seven is the hotel lobby.

282
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,360
The Joe Merchant Coffee and Pastry.

283
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,880
Mike, Mike can fill us all in on Joe Merchant.

284
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,440
And then what that's in you is this accurate?

285
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,040
Yeah. Yeah. That's one of his characters in his books.

286
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,600
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

287
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,200
There was Joe Merchant mentioned in the actual room, too.

288
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,200
Oh, really? There was a Joe Merchant mentioned.

289
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,440
We didn't tell them that yet. We have some secrets.

290
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,520
Because Tully Mars is like his main guy from most of the books.

291
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,280
I think Tully Mars is trying to find Joe Merchant.

292
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,600
Yeah. Yeah. But I'm happy to see more Joe.

293
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,120
Joe Merchant is like Hondo Anaka in, you know, Smuggler's Run.

294
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,000
It's like you're getting some small, like less character, less big characters

295
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,960
than Tully Mars. I don't know whether.

296
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,360
OK, I don't want to ask more.

297
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,640
But I also feel like I am lacking.

298
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,840
Absolutely. I have zero information.

299
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,800
Who? Why does Tully Mars?

300
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,280
What is Tully Mars?

301
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,320
Why does he need to find Joe Merchant?

302
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,080
And what is Joe Merchant? What's Joe Merchant?

303
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,000
What is the.

304
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,560
Well, I believe the book is called Where is Joe Merchant? Right.

305
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,320
Yeah, I forget what the I have not read this book.

306
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,080
Tully Mars is in multiple books.

307
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,080
He's also the star of the Escape to Margaritaville musical.

308
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,880
OK. Well, but Joe Merchant is also a character, I think.

309
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,800
Oh, yeah. Isn't he?

310
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,760
Yeah, maybe you're right.

311
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,640
I think so. How could I miss the plot of that?

312
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,240
And I saw it.

313
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,040
So the musicals involved the greater Buffett lore, the lore from the novels.

314
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Kind of use what they had.

315
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:24,400
The lobby also had the license to chill lobby bar, which is the Saturday.

316
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,320
I told you guys were all coming and I said, meet us in the lobby bar

317
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,640
because I thought, oh, we'll go from there.

318
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,400
And Jane and I went down early to go to the lobby bar.

319
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,440
And it was closed because there was an engagement party going on

320
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,520
at this tiny little lobby bar.

321
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,920
And they're like, oh, we can't do regular drinks. Right.

322
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,440
Like they were clearly our way to the bar.

323
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,800
We fought our way through this crowd.

324
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,280
And we got here and she's like, sorry, we can't.

325
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,240
We were like, I was I was so pissed for.

326
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,000
I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

327
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,600
And it wasn't that they couldn't make us drinks.

328
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,880
That was they were clearly ringing up everyone's drinks on one

329
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,040
tap like whoever organized this party.

330
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,800
Really small. So it wasn't like.

331
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,880
I don't think Joe Merchant was in that musical.

332
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,720
Was Joe Merchant not but Tully Mars was.

333
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,800
Tully Mars is the star.

334
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,760
Is the star. OK.

335
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,240
Well, then I ask the question, where is Joe Merchant?

336
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,600
Well, I got to read the book then.

337
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,960
I the only Margaritaville book I have read.

338
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,760
Wait, hang on.

339
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,840
You have read one.

340
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,440
I got to tell you, well, I haven't read it in its entirety.

341
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,240
I've read most of Chapter one.

342
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,840
There's a pirate looks at.

343
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,400
We're all over the map here.

344
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,440
I know.

345
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,480
You know, it's just that's been one of those weeks.

346
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,960
It's a pirate looks at 50 because it's on the back of Jason's toilet

347
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,160
and has been there for.

348
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,720
The back of his toilet.

349
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,320
Just under the like the tissue, like it was just the toilet.

350
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,640
Like a toilet book, like a poopy book.

351
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,560
OK, like a bad. Yeah.

352
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,120
Jason's toilet book.

353
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,120
Jason's toilet book is a pirate looks at 50.

354
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Jimmy's Jimmy's book memoir kind of book about when he turned 50

355
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,360
and took all his family and friends down to the island.

356
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
Weird.

357
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,040
This one's not a narrative.

358
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,320
There's no Tully Mars autobiography.

359
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,720
This is nonfiction.

360
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,040
Yeah, it was like very and I was like, hmm.

361
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,520
But I was really bored one time.

362
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,720
I was probably high, honestly.

363
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,760
Yeah, it was not going well in there. So. Yeah.

364
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,600
We're deep in detail.

365
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,560
Oh, my gosh.

366
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,160
Where are we?

367
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,000
But not in that because you only had time to read.

368
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,880
If you'd been in multiple chapters.

369
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,840
Territories.

370
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,800
Because I was like, this guy kind of sounds like a dick.

371
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,320
Like, I don't know about this, like white ass man trying to tell me.

372
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,720
I was like, yeah, fuck this shit.

373
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,880
But I have a problem with the guy

374
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,320
reflecting on his life of 50 years of hard living

375
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,720
and that being that he took people he knew on a trip.

376
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,920
That didn't seem like enough of a compelling struggle for you.

377
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,200
It was enough to like keep me entertained for a couple of minutes in the bathroom.

378
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,400
That might have been the time to I like dropped my phone into your toilet.

379
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,800
Was that it? OK.

380
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,120
So that's the struggle, not some other.

381
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,960
Well, I don't want to make anyone talk about the struggle, but you know.

382
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,560
You I mean, did you say like, oh, you're like, I don't think this Jimmy Buffett

383
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,440
guy is a nice guy.

384
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,360
And Jason threw a coffee cup at the wall and was like,

385
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,960
you take that back.

386
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,760
You better stay in there the rest of the day.

387
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,720
Those kind of words. So upset.

388
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,240
Yeah. Yeah. Huh.

389
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,280
Well, I got it. Look, I have a lot of read.

390
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,800
I know it's embarrassing. I haven't.

391
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,000
I have I have only have we have a lot of reading.

392
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,960
I have swine not.

393
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,920
I have swine.

394
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,960
Buffett's you were embarrassed before saying swine.

395
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,880
Not that you would.

396
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,360
The embarrassment kicked in before you said that phrase.

397
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,400
Yeah, swine not.

398
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,720
But I don't have the.

399
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,440
I got I got a lot of catching up to do.

400
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,920
Well, do you want to know the Joe Merchant touch in the room?

401
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,640
Of course. So again, behind the toilet.

402
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,240
There's a toilet.

403
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,160
Joe Merchant toilet.

404
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,200
Where is Joe Merchant behind the toilet?

405
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,960
OK, so there was one of the pieces of like art was

406
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,040
the cover of the New Yorker where it has the Statue of Liberty,

407
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,840
like laying down chilling by one of the bridges. Right.

408
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,880
Yes. That was a cover.

409
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,760
And that was real. But they like altered it.

410
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,320
And the book that was on there was Where's Joe Merchant?

411
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,160
As opposed to whatever it was in the right.

412
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,960
Yeah. So this is a blown up like print of a New Yorker cover

413
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,360
with a Statue of Liberty is lounging on one of the bridges.

414
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,200
They replaced the torch with a margarita,

415
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,240
one of the main decorative motifs in this building.

416
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,120
And then instead of reading just a copy of the New Yorker,

417
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,680
reading a regular book, they Photoshopped

418
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,160
and are painted in a copy of Where's Joe Merchant?

419
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,240
So the New Yorker, which made this art, they have erased

420
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,640
the source of it and shoved their own book.

421
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,480
Well, it still said the New Yorker on the top.

422
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,320
OK, well, it's yeah, it's it's unclear who who made this art.

423
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,080
I mean, it started as a New Yorker cover, but it's unclear.

424
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,320
They got it on Redbubble. Yeah, it is.

425
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah. They bought hundreds of prints on Redbubble to furnish this.

426
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,040
The Joe Merchant. OK, the plot of the Joe Merchant book is,

427
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,360
first of all, was a bestseller,

428
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,360
but it revolves around Frank Bama, which is a character Jimmy plays

429
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,400
on Hawaii Five, oh, of course, we know that.

430
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,120
And his ex-girlfriend, hemorrhoid ointment heiress, Trevor Kane.

431
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,800
You did not just say hemorrhoid.

432
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,120
I certainly did.

433
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,320
Frank, a down on his seaplane pilot, is about to escape to Alaska

434
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,280
when Trevor unexpectedly jumps back into his life, asking for help

435
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,320
and tracking down her brother, the notorious rock star Joe Merchant.

436
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,960
Other characters joining Frank and Trevor in their search

437
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,160
include sleazy tabloid reporter Rudy Brino, rocket scientist Desdemona,

438
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,080
who appears in the song Fruit Cakes.

439
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,320
Oh, yeah. Many mercenaries and the jet ski killer.

440
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,520
So that's a little bit about what the book is about.

441
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,000
I wouldn't have thought.

442
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,560
Why does Joe Merchant have the least colorful name as a rock star,

443
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,240
as a notorious rock star, rather?

444
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,600
That's a good question. I got to get the book.

445
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,520
I'll buy the book. Just do it now.

446
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,080
It'll be a second date. I'm worried.

447
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,920
Yeah, it takes a down. Joe Merchant's second date.

448
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,080
Joe Merchant's second date book club.

449
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,440
So, yeah, so that New Yorker painting was above the toilet.

450
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,440
The bathroom.

451
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,880
Well, you can't that's that's like you can't look at Joe Merchant's name

452
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,160
while you're trying to take a shot.

453
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,920
Well, there's a mirror in front of you.

454
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,920
There is a mirror. So while you're shooting, you actually could.

455
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,720
Great. OK. Yeah.

456
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,200
So as long as you're already familiar with the with the name Joe Merchant,

457
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,640
enough to recognize it backwards, then you're fine.

458
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,480
You can meditate on Joe and his notoriety.

459
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,640
Yes. As you use the facilities.

460
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,400
Some some confusing stuff in this bathroom.

461
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,480
So at the end, tiny New York Hotel bathroom, very small.

462
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,000
The so I'll give them a positive first.

463
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,080
The towels were very big, like giant comfy towels, like very, very nice.

464
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,440
I just like to say now we are this is the most micro review

465
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,760
of a themed experience we've ever we are now reviewing one particular bathroom,

466
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,560
which might apply to all of the bathrooms in the hotel.

467
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,880
But specifically, I don't know if you want to give the floor number

468
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,160
or the room number. Oh, yeah.

469
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,360
Give it to people.

470
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,520
Well, for one, yeah.

471
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,960
Well, OK, so we were doing the bathroom in room

472
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,720
1201 at the Margaritaville Times Square.

473
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,400
It's a standard king.

474
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,600
And the king, the king takes up the king that takes up most of the room

475
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,680
with some very, very narrow walkways.

476
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,400
Yeah. The so big towels, very small floor space.

477
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,240
If you use a couple of towels, the bathroom feels very crowded,

478
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,040
very quickly. Oh, my God. Yeah.

479
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:28,560
Also, and and we we went to an Airbnb like a year and a half ago or something.

480
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,400
And they had this design feature, too.

481
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,040
I keep seeing this.

482
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,800
So imagine a shower.

483
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,240
There's a glass like wall for the shower.

484
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,560
There's no sliding door.

485
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,920
The half a wall, half a glass wall.

486
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,200
So then what happens is you take a shower and if you just move a little,

487
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,560
the entire floor of the bathroom just kind of floods.

488
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,120
Like there's nothing stopping.

489
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,920
Well, what didn't help is there was like a rain shower.

490
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,440
But then there was also one of the hand ones.

491
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,480
And if you turned the hand one at all towards like yourself,

492
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,760
it would just shoot right out.

493
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,520
And so I got out and I was like, why is the toilet covered in water

494
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,800
and the floor and the counter?

495
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,840
And I was like, what the fuck?

496
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,840
So then the rest of the time, I'd like hug the front of the shower

497
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,360
to like try to avoid.

498
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,440
Yeah, not ideal.

499
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,640
Not not ideal.

500
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,720
But hey, correct with a Margaritaville coffee pods for different kinds,

501
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,320
for different kinds of for different flavors, for different flavors.

502
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,720
You know, can we get the flavors?

503
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,760
You have them written down?

504
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,600
Did you take a pic?

505
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,320
I did. I take a pic.

506
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,400
I don't know the flavors.

507
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,680
You had a good one.

508
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,040
Yeah, I kept drinking the coconut.

509
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,240
It was coconut light roast, medium roast, dark roast.

510
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,960
So can I ask just vacation wise, both of you? Yeah.

511
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,080
What's the review?

512
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,560
Always put the do not disturb in the morning, because I generally am like that

513
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,960
where I'm just like, I'm going to sleep in late.

514
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,400
Like, are you on the same page about getting up later on vacation?

515
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,320
This one is that all?

516
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,080
This one was a little less of like a leisurely because we had stuff to do.

517
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,080
You know what I mean? Right.

518
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,080
So we kind of planned like the housekeeping and stuff around what we were doing.

519
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,240
But I mean, you know what I'm doing?

520
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,520
You know what I'm saying? Like, yeah, yeah.

521
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,440
Like Joshua Tree, the one you were just talking about.

522
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,520
That was obviously we didn't do anything.

523
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,760
But this one we had like plans.

524
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,840
So that did kind of dictate like what we were doing.

525
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,800
But yeah, I mean, I like to chill and sleep in like.

526
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,920
If I if I put the do not disturb on the door, I usually call and say,

527
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,160
hey, just letting housekeeping know we're leaving for the day.

528
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,240
Like if I'm oh, yeah, you're if I'm too late,

529
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,400
you need a human being to have been in there.

530
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,880
I know that about you.

531
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,320
Oh, one day we did it.

532
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,280
Yeah, one day we did.

533
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,080
And then you just slept in.

534
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:40,200
No. Well, but we needed someone to take away the hotel towels.

535
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,600
They were piling up so much that it was like at the top of the.

536
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,160
Toilet. Well, I will take blame.

537
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,200
I will take blame for a lot of them because.

538
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,680
Look, a bunch of showers and also we had to use one of the towels.

539
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,960
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

540
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,840
All right. Here we go.

541
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,920
Showers left and right every five minutes.

542
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,280
Well, here we go.

543
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,440
New York just makes me feel dirty the second I get there.

544
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,240
I feel grimy.

545
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,280
Also, it was more humid than I had been used to because, you know,

546
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,160
and I was like, why do I just feel wet?

547
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,240
And also, I think I just had like generalized anxiety,

548
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,760
which comes out in weird ways.

549
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,960
So like, admittedly, it was probably my anxiety, too.

550
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,960
And like the shower was just it was actually really nice.

551
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,280
The water pressure was nice.

552
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,840
It was like nice fixtures that I don't have at my apartment.

553
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,600
So part of it was like, oh, this is kind of like a luxury.

554
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,480
Yeah. But I also like use a lot of towels for like makeup or for like,

555
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,840
I, you know, I use them for a lot of shit.

556
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,560
And so also like, you know, you don't have to wash them.

557
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,200
It's like hotels. Fun.

558
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,440
You just be like more towels, please.

559
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,280
I would love a picture of how many towels you.

560
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,760
Man, I wish I would have found by this.

561
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,880
Yeah. I mean, between hand towels and washcloths and stuff, you know,

562
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,360
I was only what did I stay three nights and I used like one and a half towels.

563
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,160
I think I went through probably.

564
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,800
Yeah. Eight to ten between hand towels, washcloths and regular towels,

565
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,280
because I change my washcloth every time in the shower.

566
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,480
And then I have one used filled

567
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,520
foundation all over the carpet at one point.

568
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,280
Hi. Comes out.

569
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,720
Whatever.

570
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,320
So we tell that up, we wipe that up.

571
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,440
Did you ruin the beautiful carpet they have in there?

572
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,920
No, it was like the wood floor on the part where I was.

573
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,520
Oh, yeah, it was.

574
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,080
The foundation did not splash on the Joe Merchant name.

575
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,600
We kept Joe's name from history.

576
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,720
No, I was really worried that you would like

577
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,000
ruined a beautiful picture of a Marlin on a piece of carpet.

578
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,320
There there was some very generic kind of like

579
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,680
island art along the wall.

580
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,440
OK, good. They chose to.

581
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,200
This also kind of pissed me off.

582
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,680
So the the king bed was like perfectly square in this square room.

583
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But then in front of you, the TV was like a skew just to the right

584
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,840
so they could put three like shitty generic pieces of art.

585
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,960
And I was like, why didn't they center this?

586
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,440
So you're watching the TV like slightly askew and it really bothered. Yeah.

587
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,560
Where they were all like sort of like aquatic life.

588
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,440
It's like a beach, like it had like a life painting of like a lifeguard stand.

589
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,960
And yes, like a girl surfing or something.

590
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,400
They want you staring at that stuff and not looking at the stock report.

591
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,720
They want you getting near that island lifestyle.

592
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,680
And I guess so. Yeah.

593
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,520
It's five o'clock somewhere, you know.

594
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,920
We had a window that opened.

595
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,240
We yes, we did have floor ceiling windows.

596
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,680
Oh, what was like? Yeah.

597
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,480
So it was a weird. Yes, you're right.

598
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,760
It did kind of wind open, but only a few inches.

599
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,560
No screen. Yeah, because they don't want.

600
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,360
Is it illegal to have a window where you could jump out?

601
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,720
Is that what? No.

602
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,280
But hotels liability insurance goes way down

603
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,120
if there is not a balcony and you can't fully like open the windows.

604
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,600
But it was nice, though, to like get some fresh air in there

605
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,200
for a few minutes if we wanted to.

606
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,400
Yeah. Like here, the city and like, I don't know. It's nice.

607
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,160
Yes. That brings up another negative about this hotel

608
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,640
that I would catch every now and then.

609
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,560
The smell I would ever not just in the room, the smell of cigarettes

610
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,760
in the room and then in the gift shop on the ground floor.

611
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,880
So I think it was the ventilation system needs a cleaning.

612
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,240
Are there smoking floors? I don't think there are.

613
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,920
I think it's a nice.

614
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,600
Smell the tune. I was like, we were like, what is that?

615
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,760
This is a new facility. How could this be?

616
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,720
That is yes. I was saying.

617
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,360
Do you think somebody might have been smoking cigarettes in the room illegally?

618
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,640
I don't know.

619
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,640
Or if it was like someone smoking.

620
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,880
I mean, in all fairness, we were like

621
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,600
eight floors up from the lobby terrace.

622
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,960
But when we looked out there, there was never anyone out there.

623
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,480
So I did feel like it was coming through the vents.

624
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,800
Could there have been like ghosts smoking ghosts?

625
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,760
It could have been smoking ghosts.

626
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,040
Which characters that the smoking ghost, the smoking ghost.

627
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,480
Is there it's Jimmy Buffett's book, The Smoking Ghost.

628
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,520
Yeah. OK. He's in his own.

629
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,840
Yeah, that's that's separate from the token.

630
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,520
Yeah. Well, that's the newer version.

631
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,520
But everything else smelled like really nice.

632
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,080
That's the thing. It was weird.

633
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,280
Like the I know the room was really nice.

634
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,240
Like everything was very clean and really pretty.

635
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,440
Like the the color motif that they kind of had throughout

636
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,360
was a shade that I kind of described as Tiffany's

637
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,800
like blue green, but a few shades darker.

638
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,520
And that was kind of what one of the main walls was.

639
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,000
So it was like this kind of like, you know, like a aqua water, but like nice.

640
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,120
Like a turquoise here.

641
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,880
You can see it in the decorative pillow that says

642
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,520
changes in latitude on one side and then the other side says changes in attitude.

643
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,760
So from from here, it looks like when you put a baby on a bed or something.

644
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,320
We OK, that bed is so big.

645
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,360
Yeah. I mean, we're the way your legs are positioned.

646
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,240
I'm not. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

647
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,320
Yeah. I'm wearing little sweatpants and I got little socks on.

648
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,200
So I'm looking at this from four or five feet away.

649
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,320
Yeah, I'll point out.

650
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,680
I'm sure you'll post these pictures, but yeah, one side said changes in

651
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,000
latitude, changes in attitude.

652
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,560
He goes now flip it over and is like, put your sunglasses on.

653
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,200
And then he's like, changes in attitude.

654
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,480
And he was like, look at all cool attitude changed between the two photos.

655
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,360
This is good. You're living content.

656
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,520
The motto. Do you feel like you bonded over your love of content creation?

657
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,160
During the day overlay, you're creating content.

658
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,840
You're both creating content together.

659
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,200
You're collaborating as you are now lifting each other up.

660
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,360
Well, you know, we did not take advantage of it.

661
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,240
So this was a nice feature.

662
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,720
I hadn't seen a hotel room before.

663
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,800
The room service menu you ordered on the TV.

664
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,360
But interesting.

665
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,120
There was how does it work?

666
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,520
Are you going to tell me like you select like here's the entrees and like drinks

667
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,640
and sandwiches and stuff.

668
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,960
Beer is spelled with three E's on this.

669
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,080
I didn't know that.

670
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,880
So every now and then I would catch a little thing where I was like

671
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,280
like a little misspelling or a little like, you know,

672
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,000
rug is fucked up or something.

673
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,840
So that menu is like as if you were changing the like brightness of your screen

674
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,720
is the same sort of type of menu you would you would get to order a quesadilla.

675
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,080
Yeah, it's sort of like, oh, every I couldn't get it to work,

676
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,000
but it did have a built in Chromecast.

677
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
So like in theory, you should have been able to cast.

678
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,640
I tried to cast a YouTube video and it worked up until it said like,

679
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,960
this app is not supported, so YouTube must like. Yeah. So.

680
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,600
The company that Google owns doesn't Google owns YouTube.

681
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,160
It wasn't working.

682
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,240
What was working was the channel that's just footage of beaches.

683
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,920
Here we go. This is what we need.

684
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,960
Pro con con the loop.

685
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,720
The video loop is four minutes long. What?

686
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,040
And it's very abrupt. It's very abrupt.

687
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,160
It goes to a black silent screen.

688
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,200
And so we tried to fall asleep to it and we'd start drifting.

689
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,880
And then it'd be like an abrupt black screen.

690
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,280
And then like, like it was it sucked and allowed.

691
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,000
You're watching beach TV.

692
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,640
Back to the beginning.

693
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,560
Yeah. And we're like, that's crazy that that's not an hour long loop or something.

694
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,560
We should look to the look to your restaurants, look to islands restaurants.

695
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,720
There's a precedent for this.

696
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,960
And they have loops every day of video loops from the restaurants

697
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,680
and from the museum, the elevators like. Yes.

698
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,320
We got to talk about the elevators.

699
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,240
So the elevators had big screen TVs in them playing like stock island footage

700
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,640
with rock music over it.

701
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,200
Got to say, not enough Jimmy in this whole resort.

702
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,680
They'd so much other music.

703
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,960
And then I feel like those loops.

704
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,880
Well, I will say we heard you make a mistake over the one of the loops like twice.

705
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,280
And I heard jaded. I got jaded.

706
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,760
You got jaded. That was very exciting.

707
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,960
You got the jade. I kept sending you guys that the ambience elevator clips.

708
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,160
I heard that Beatles.

709
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,240
I saw her standing there like two or three times in the elevator.

710
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,480
So the elevator loops are not long either.

711
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,560
So they're short loops. Yeah. Interesting.

712
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,240
I feel like points knocked for short.

713
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,680
Loops. No points.

714
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,600
How good big tells too big for small room.

715
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,720
Water is good.

716
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,160
We did. Good.

717
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,200
We did get some little cards when we checked in.

718
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,040
So one was the buy one, get one free cocktail,

719
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,160
which we ended up using at the Landshark bar.

720
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,320
Oh, I got a free drink. Remember to.

721
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,640
Oh, yes. And they messed up.

722
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,320
Like they gave you the wrong like happy hour drinks.

723
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,360
So they just let you keep it.

724
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,360
She was like, it's just a waste if I throw it away.

725
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,680
Do you want you want to just keep it?

726
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,560
And I was like, hell yeah.

727
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,880
Yeah. It was a frozen margarita.

728
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,600
I asked for mango. She gave me strawberry and then she came out and gave me mango.

729
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,000
So there was like the first day I was like, I got a free drink. I'm good.

730
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,240
So you said hell with extra ease, like the extra beer.

731
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,720
Yeah. Yeah. That's what I think.

732
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,200
Maybe that's maybe it wasn't a mistake.

733
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,080
Maybe they're telling you just like, don't be done with the order.

734
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,720
I'll have a beer. No, no, no. Yeah.

735
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,360
I'll have a beer.

736
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,720
That's a reference to one of the books.

737
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,560
Yeah. The character spells beer with three.

738
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,640
You had to really work with the editor and the publisher to say, no, no, no.

739
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,480
I want all those ease.

740
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,200
I'm checking that.

741
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,320
Don't even do this.

742
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,800
Put in a macro. Put in a rule.

743
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,400
All those mustard stains on the.

744
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,880
I want those.

745
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,520
You need to stain page 76 in each copy.

746
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,320
Simon and Schuster get sand between the pages.

747
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,080
That's what I want.

748
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,680
So, yeah, we like the Margaritaville.

749
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,840
I tried to reserve the Statue of Liberty booth.

750
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,920
Well, let's see what this needs to be explained.

751
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,960
Let's explain this is the big Griffin sent us a video of this a few months ago.

752
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,400
Yes, this tantalized us.

753
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,000
We wanted to see this very much.

754
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,200
A giant statue of a 30 foot statue of liberty

755
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,200
that is, look, to repeat the thing from the wall art that you saw.

756
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,400
If you can believe it, not holding a torch, not holding America's torch,

757
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,800
but rather a margarita, a margarita glass, which I think is very disrespectful.

758
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,720
Let's not mess with the Statue of Liberty for laughs and giggles and fun.

759
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,560
Yeah. So maybe I didn't want to see it.

760
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,880
No, but there's a whole light show that happens every and then we're in.

761
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,800
Then I looked at video of it because we didn't get to do it.

762
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,720
But there's a little booth.

763
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,000
There's one solitary booth inside the Statue of Liberty. Yes.

764
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,280
With two little TVs that loop to little TVs playing the little little.

765
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,000
They're very little.

766
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,400
Tv's are weird.

767
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:28,200
Like languages coming out are weird, like our weird little relationship.

768
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,480
Idiosyncrasies.

769
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,240
Um, yeah, I don't know.

770
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,160
I mean, I feel like the the restaurant loops have gotten more generic to.

771
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,600
Well, we have we talked on the show before about the Margaritaville at City

772
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,200
Walk, how sometimes you go in there and it's like nonstop Jimmy.

773
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,760
And then sometimes you go, they play the Jimmy song in nine songs.

774
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,280
Like what's going on? Without looking it up, I guarantee you.

775
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,520
Yes, we've talked about this.

776
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,120
Yeah, probably many times.

777
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,040
But yes, go on.

778
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,560
When we were at the Margaritaville, a Jimmy song started playing.

779
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
And then it seemed like they hit next.

780
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,560
It's like little interlude.

781
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,800
It seemed as though it was like, yeah, was I programming it?

782
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:10,400
Yeah, we got to get to Applebee's on date night or chicken fried or whatever.

783
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,400
I think, though, they are making maybe they are making this calculation

784
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,360
in the markets of New York and Los Angeles, that maybe the fandom

785
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,160
of Mr. Jimmy Buffett is not that large.

786
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:27,480
But I wanted more New York like Jimmy famously has a property in Montauk,

787
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,360
just north of the city famously.

788
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,360
There was a big profile.

789
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,480
The audience knows all like this is obvious.

790
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,480
This is plain as what is the sky blue.

791
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,040
I think we all read that profile in the New Yorker from the New York Times

792
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,880
a few years ago talking about the changing face of Montauk.

793
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,000
And they started profiling the locals at a bar and slowly

794
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,080
revealed one of them was Jimmy Buffett.

795
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,720
And yeah, I want it.

796
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,160
I want a little more, Jimmy.

797
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,960
I want a little more New York stuff.

798
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,560
You were just like, give it a special soundtrack.

799
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,280
Do Jimmy singing like New York, New York or something?

800
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,440
I think I just want it a little more than just the Statue of Liberty

801
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,680
and some like photos of taxi cabs.

802
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,280
What? What do you mean?

803
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,840
I don't know. You want to know?

804
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,280
Well, all right. A starfish is driving the taxi.

805
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,760
Great. I like that.

806
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,520
The precedent.

807
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,000
Look, I understand what you're coming from, because the precedent

808
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,320
they've set so far of immaculate theming based on the city they're in.

809
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,720
You know, it's just it's it's I mean, the Orlando one,

810
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,200
honestly, makes the other ones look like shit.

811
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,240
Like because it's a little it's it's not like amazing.

812
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,360
But it's bad. It certainly got more specific stuff.

813
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,320
But, you know, look, is the city walk

814
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,360
Margaritaville a little disappointing? Yes.

815
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,080
I've still never been.

816
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,920
It seems like it's been dying since two weeks after it.

817
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,280
You guys all make it sound like shit.

818
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,520
Why am I trying to go there?

819
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,920
Because the Orlando City Walk one I've been to because I used to live there.

820
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,440
And like, yeah, it's great. It's super fun.

821
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,760
I'm like, well, why the fuck am I trying to go here if the food sucks and it sucks?

822
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,200
We did go to the bar. There's a bar.

823
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,800
It's not technically the roof, but it's like a top floor, I guess.

824
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,440
And we that one that we're very clearly trying to do.

825
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,240
Let me get the name.

826
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,760
So the top bar was the five o'clock somewhere bar,

827
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,600
because sometimes they just throw these signs up at the rest.

828
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,720
We didn't go there, though.

829
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,400
No, we didn't go there.

830
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,080
Commit to the site. They're throwing signs out willy nilly.

831
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,160
I don't like this.

832
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,800
No, I think it's better in New York because they've given each one

833
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,320
its own little space and a sign and a sign. OK.

834
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,440
It was a little I mean, we were like, OK, we'll get cocktails

835
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,720
and we'll go out on the patio.

836
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,360
The only thing was it was 43 degrees and windy.

837
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,280
So it's like, all right, we're taking the cocktails back to the city.

838
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,520
Is so cold in April.

839
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,120
And I was so unhappy.

840
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,680
Yeah, they're in a good time.

841
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,640
I would call that a good period. Yeah.

842
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,560
There. And yet, yeah, I got tricked.

843
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,920
I went in April a couple of years ago and I didn't bring enough

844
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,200
heavy clothes, heavy clothes, and I got tricked again.

845
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,520
Just bring me what I did between the buildings that like genuinely

846
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,560
the wind gets so insane that like I think that's part of it, too.

847
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,120
I found. Yeah. The first night I was in, I found Scott

848
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,720
wandering alone Times Square at what time it was like the wind was blowing.

849
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,800
It was like almost like we had like found each other

850
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,400
in the middle of Antarctica or something.

851
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,000
Yeah, that was very intense.

852
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,960
You should say I wasn't like walking around looking for

853
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,640
drugs or offering offering peep show services.

854
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,400
I was I was trying to find you.

855
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,360
No, that's fair. I wasn't in.

856
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,120
I went into this. I had fallen into a gutter.

857
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,080
I was in a super. What time was this?

858
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,520
That was really late. It was pretty late.

859
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,400
Yeah. And I was in the Taco Bell Cantina.

860
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,360
And then you said you came, but you didn't see me.

861
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,360
I went to a raw, the incorrect Taco Bell Cantina.

862
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,960
And I started trying to find the one you were at and you informed me

863
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,960
that a big fight was breaking out.

864
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,520
So maybe I should not go to that.

865
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,960
I was like, I'm not going to that.

866
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,320
The Taco Bell Cantina was a real scene.

867
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,120
Yeah. There there were two Taco Bell Cantina's within blocks of each other.

868
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,240
And they just seemed like a fight is about to break out at any any moment.

869
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,520
And they didn't have my food.

870
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,520
And the manager was half dealing with that and then half had his eyes trained

871
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,400
on something that like he knew something was going on.

872
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,640
But I couldn't tell what it was because I kept turning around

873
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,960
and going, there's people back there, but I don't see anything going on.

874
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,640
So he was like, what's your order? What is it?

875
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,400
And then he's like shouting at somebody to do something from my.

876
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,680
That was exactly my experience as well.

877
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,920
I'm not even kidding you. Yeah. OK.

878
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,560
It was a lot of yelling and a lot of chaos.

879
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,840
And I was just like so overwhelmed.

880
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,040
I like grabbed the food and I went outside and waited for Jason.

881
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,120
And then I got more overwhelmed because it was so cold.

882
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,840
And this guy started like talking to me, like trying to hit on me a little bit.

883
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,520
And I was like so pissed about it.

884
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,680
I was like, Jason, where are you?

885
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,840
Jason came in and she knocked the guy, knocked the guy right out.

886
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,040
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

887
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,400
Come help me. Took it.

888
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,520
I got to grab the Times Square Elmo, barreled him right into the guy.

889
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,440
Not grab the dirty, dirty.

890
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,760
Reality, what happened was I like stormed off in front of Jason.

891
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,800
I just met him back.

892
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,120
Well, in front of Jason.

893
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,800
Well, I said I said like, keep like we were going through a crowd.

894
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,840
And I was like, oh, don't wait for me because like my

895
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,480
I my knee is actually pretty good right now.

896
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,360
But it was it was so cold in New York.

897
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,800
It was it was really like uncomfortable.

898
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,680
I do feel bad.

899
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,200
Oh, no, that's I did help.

900
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,040
I did. We did help people.

901
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,240
You did help me a lot.

902
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,160
But but awfully defensive.

903
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,800
Totally missed. But you abandoned him.

904
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,560
She totally missed when I said, well, you get your food.

905
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,240
I'll take you back to the hotel and then I'll get mine.

906
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,360
She missed that suggestion.

907
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,960
And so she ordered something.

908
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,200
And then she went, now, go get whatever you're going to eat.

909
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,120
And I was like, all right, I guess I'm leaving you alone in the talk.

910
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,600
The Taco Bell Cantina.

911
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,720
I look to be, you know, to be fair to everyone, the Taco Bell.

912
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,320
It's a high pressure situation.

913
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,000
I've learned to learn.

914
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,160
It's not like the Vegas one.

915
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,240
Vegas, which is so chill.

916
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,320
And I was like, oh, I'll get one of the Baja blasts that are spiked to take it

917
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,200
with me. He's like, what are you talking about?

918
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,840
And I was like, can you do that?

919
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,880
Oh, I guess because I've only done that in Vegas.

920
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

921
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,960
We were also just so confused because every block in Times Square,

922
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,200
there's guys just going like weed, edibles, joint, like cocaine.

923
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,720
We're like, we're OK.

924
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,840
Like I kept saying, like, I'm an idiot.

925
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,880
I'm not a sucker.

926
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,480
Like, I know this isn't real.

927
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,960
Did you say it? Did you say it?

928
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,240
I didn't say that.

929
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,240
I kept saying that to myself.

930
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,440
No, no, no, no.

931
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,400
What is that real?

932
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,680
Jay's raising her hand.

933
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,360
I call on Jayne.

934
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,760
OK, so right downstairs from Margaritaville,

935
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,040
there were like two little like tables of dudes who had like card

936
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,240
tape, like three card Monte tables repurposed.

937
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,840
And they were like, hey, like they clearly have like joints and nugs

938
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,920
and stuff. And we walked up.

939
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,040
So like, Jason, did the tables have like card marks on them?

940
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,080
Was it did it have like the I'm just saying it's a perfect size

941
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,120
for three cards and a little bit of room to move around.

942
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,320
Purchase for three card Monte, but people, the jig is up on that.

943
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,840
So we've all right.

944
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,120
Let's convert them to a new scam.

945
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,280
But like New York is not.

946
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,480
Yeah, yes, I'm sorry.

947
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,680
What the tables were made for.

948
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,240
Anyway, I swear to God, I just want to talk over you.

949
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,560
There's three of us. I'm sorry.

950
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,360
I know. Now the floor is yours.

951
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,280
Thank you. So anyway, I would say, oh, I'll stop.

952
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,600
I'll stop. I'll stop.

953
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,320
Oh, he's OK.

954
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:16,040
So I was like all about it because I was like, you know, I like to smoke New York.

955
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,720
I couldn't really smoke because they don't have it.

956
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,920
I was like, why don't we just like go see what's up?

957
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,240
So we walk up to this table and there's like a thing of pre-rolls

958
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,080
and there's things of nugs.

959
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,480
And we were like, is this real THC?

960
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,840
Like we were like not fucking around.

961
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,440
And they were like, oh, I'm sorry.

962
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,440
This sounds like Jason seemed like you were starting to fight as soon as you saw it.

963
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,400
And now you're saying you guys were looking at the table and like

964
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:35,920
actually think about it.

965
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,560
I'm telling you my thought process.

966
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,840
Yeah. So and we were like

967
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,080
we were like, they're going to think we're like dumb.

968
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,440
And we were like, what strain is it?

969
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,400
And they were like, oh, it's this is this.

970
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,880
And they opened the bags and we're smelling nugs on the street.

971
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,920
Like we're straight up just smelling nugs.

972
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,200
And I was like, well, we're from L.A.

973
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,400
And they were like, oh, they knew the jig was up.

974
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,000
We were like, so I don't know about that.

975
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,560
They're like, yeah.

976
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,280
Just quick question for a non weed guy.

977
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,840
What are you talking about?

978
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,280
Well, you mean it was bad or it was like, it was like, no, it smelled.

979
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,920
Mostly right.

980
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,800
But there were vans, every block and a storefront for Weedworld.

981
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,240
And I looked I Googled We World scam.

982
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,960
Just edible. And it is.

983
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,640
Yeah. Yeah. Edibles.

984
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,160
And it is there's multiple articles about it being a scam.

985
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,240
Like it's scam.

986
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:25,880
Hold on. Yeah.

987
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,520
When one way that's what I'm thinking.

988
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,840
Take us through it. Yes. Go. Go ahead.

989
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,000
Thank you.

990
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,560
So the content and potency of these nugs and and different things

991
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,880
was probably not high grade, was probably like a lot of CBD or hemp base.

992
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,600
So they're trying to go like, oh, here, this is a high THC concentration.

993
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,680
Like you're going to get really high.

994
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,600
And it's really probably just shitty, like nothing.

995
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,240
You know what I mean?

996
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,000
So in this sense, they're like charging you because they were like, oh,

997
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,760
what did they say, like 10 or 15 per pre roll that they had sitting there?

998
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,720
And I was like, for that, like in my head, I'm like, that's not even like

999
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,080
half a gram pre roll. That's not even a gram.

1000
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,680
Yeah. So you're not going to really get high.

1001
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,200
You might feel a little body relax from the if it's if there is

1002
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,680
CBD in there, but they also weren't pushing that it was so the Nug.

1003
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,920
So I apologize for this, but the Nug is like flower fake.

1004
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,000
No, it's like a fake. It's flower Nug.

1005
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,240
It's a complete fake Nug.

1006
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,560
No, it's probably just extracted hemp.

1007
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,360
So hemp is not the same.

1008
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,760
How do you all know this, though?

1009
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,480
You're just you're are you guessing? Are you looking at it?

1010
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,880
It doesn't look. It's just both.

1011
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,640
It's not legal. Yeah, it's not.

1012
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,800
It's not fully. Yeah, it's legal to possess,

1013
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,880
but they haven't set up the selling.

1014
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,520
They haven't finished setting up how to properly sell it.

1015
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,120
And I think to the way the guys were trying to sell it.

1016
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,200
And as soon as we kind of were like, we know what's up.

1017
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,200
And they kind of were like, yeah, you know what I mean?

1018
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,120
Like they're going to try to get people to buy it because it's like weed.

1019
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,280
And people are cool.

1020
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,640
But if you know what's up, it's like this isn't even good.

1021
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,520
I like the idea, though, because this is like I am so

1022
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,840
like I don't want to talk to anybody that's asked, like anybody

1023
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,640
that's shouting stuff at me on the street ever.

1024
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,800
Like I'm just so not like interested in that.

1025
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,840
I just find it fascinating that you two walked up there

1026
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,400
and he's like, hey, take a look what I've got.

1027
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,480
And you're like, I don't think so, pal.

1028
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,880
Like this is the most stressful situation to me ever.

1029
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,080
We were in charge. We are little, but we are alpha. Yeah.

1030
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,080
And now we know you say little in this way.

1031
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,280
I love that little. Which adds some force to it.

1032
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,880
You may be little.

1033
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,200
Because you add a little syllable there.

1034
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,680
Listen, weed people.

1035
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,920
First, we know that table was for three karatmati.

1036
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,120
Second, we may be little.

1037
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,000
I like so yeah, Jason rolls up, Jason rolls up.

1038
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,040
He starts like running his finger on the table.

1039
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,000
Uses for three karatmati before.

1040
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,440
This looks like a three karatmati table.

1041
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,880
I know card residue when I see it.

1042
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,520
Crack that bag. Let me smell those nugs.

1043
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,280
We literally did. We were like, here, let's see.

1044
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,480
And we were sniffing little bags and we were like, well, what?

1045
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,880
They were like, oh, it's this, this, this.

1046
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,640
And I was like, yeah, I don't know.

1047
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,200
It's also they weren't even doing because I had read about

1048
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,560
and have acquired something.

1049
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,760
There is a thing pulled from hemp called THCB,

1050
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,000
which because it's pulled from hemp is legal in like 40 plus states.

1051
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,720
And it can be kind of potent.

1052
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,080
They call it diet weed.

1053
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,400
There's a bunch of articles about diet weed. Huh?

1054
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,400
So you that is easier to sell.

1055
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,240
I think they'll start regulating it like like anything else.

1056
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,680
These guys, I said, I asked, is it THCB?

1057
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,840
Is it diet? They're like, no, no, it's real.

1058
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,160
And it's like, I know this isn't real.

1059
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,160
So so so you so you didn't even just try a little bit

1060
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,120
just to see like no price because it was overpriced.

1061
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,920
And it was like a J was like 15 bucks and it definitely was not a full gram,

1062
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,400
which if it's good quality weed, 15 bucks for like, OK, like maybe.

1063
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,040
Yeah, make sense out here.

1064
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,520
But like, yeah, how much?

1065
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,080
Excuse me. How much is a J normally?

1066
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,600
Well, anywhere between like four dollars and like twenty dollars.

1067
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,120
We're really going for it.

1068
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,000
And we get now.

1069
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,160
So we get what we like is Pacific Stone is a really good brand out here.

1070
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,120
Well, it's like it's like it's like a solid brand.

1071
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,080
You're going to find it everywhere.

1072
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,640
We get is Jimmy involved in that?

1073
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,560
Is that is that part of Margaritaville holding?

1074
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,480
No, no, no.

1075
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,360
Does it ask from the Pacific?

1076
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,560
We tried Seth Rogen's weed a few weeks ago.

1077
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,880
Oh, it was very cute.

1078
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,920
It was the first day that the pre rolls came out.

1079
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,760
I like to buy pre rolls on like to roll my own.

1080
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,280
And Jason surprised me for our three year anniversary

1081
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,760
on the day that the J's dropped.

1082
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,200
I was in the bathtub and he came in and went happy anniversary.

1083
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,560
And I freaked out. I was so pumped.

1084
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,320
I was like literally like you got me Seth Rogen's weed.

1085
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,600
I'm so excited.

1086
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,640
And we went out and smoked it.

1087
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,520
And I was like, this is the best day of my fucking life.

1088
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,480
So that is pretty good.

1089
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,000
But I was going to say, well, usually. Yeah.

1090
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,160
So and that one was it lived up to your expectations?

1091
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,720
Yeah. OK, that was very good.

1092
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,640
Very smooth, a really nice high.

1093
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,400
It was a sativa.

1094
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,800
It's apparently one he smokes all day that he like curated.

1095
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,720
Made sense.

1096
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,480
It like you could.

1097
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,040
I felt pretty like with it, but just kind of nice.

1098
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,560
But what we usually smoke to go back to how much is a pre roll or a J or whatever.

1099
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,960
But J, that's how I said it.

1100
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,640
Like Jay Leno.

1101
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,720
So like, hey, no, I didn't do it.

1102
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,720
That was my nerd voice gotten on my cool comedian voice.

1103
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,920
So Jay Leno is cool.

1104
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,160
If you're doing a cool voice, that's how I know you're doing.

1105
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,560
Yeah, it was a very voice.

1106
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,800
Anyway, so we like to get the 14 packs.

1107
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,120
And those are about well, we go to a place now where every Sunday,

1108
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,520
those are 15 percent off.

1109
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,400
So for forty nine dollars, you get 14 pre rolls.

1110
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,360
So whatever that math is, I don't know.

1111
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,880
Now, my question is, why aren't you guys doing a weed podcat?

1112
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,480
We're talking about content.

1113
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,240
You know, like he told me I cannot be on a podcast.

1114
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,960
I said, what if I started a podcast?

1115
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,840
He said, stay in your lane and do music.

1116
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,440
And he threw a coffee cup against the wall.

1117
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,720
I heard about that.

1118
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,520
I'm so sick of these theme park coffee

1119
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,680
coffee, I've gotten too many.

1120
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,560
I need to whittle them down some way.

1121
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,840
Yeah, he said, no, no.

1122
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,640
It said I'm too grumpy for this morning and he threw it.

1123
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,880
Every day, every goddamn day.

1124
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,920
Anything. OK, so this is fascinating.

1125
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,640
I didn't realize because I know you you I was hearing this sort of just a little

1126
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,520
bit here and there during the trip, like, oh, you know, they don't have anything.

1127
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,840
And I was like, there are people constantly asking me

1128
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,880
if I want weed or cocaine on the street.

1129
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,120
Yes, it's not going to be good.

1130
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,320
So that's probably going to be you got offered cocaine.

1131
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,160
Multiple times.

1132
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,160
We both did.

1133
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:26,840
Multiple times.

1134
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,560
That's not going to be clean.

1135
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,840
That's going to be some real shitty stuff is going to make you.

1136
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,480
That's the thing, too.

1137
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,720
Yeah, I did so much.

1138
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,840
It was great.

1139
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,440
Yeah, I didn't sleep the whole trip.

1140
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,440
Cut it with laxatives.

1141
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,000
It's a powder.

1142
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,920
No problem.

1143
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,920
You know, they put like preface.

1144
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,000
I've never done cocaine.

1145
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,040
All I've ever done, honestly, is weed.

1146
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,480
I've never even smoked a cigarette.

1147
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,440
So to be fair, all I do is smoke weed.

1148
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,280
In general.

1149
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,840
I mean, there goes your short term memory.

1150
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,200
It's fried out in that moment.

1151
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,560
He gets frustrated with me because I like can't pay attention.

1152
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,880
He's like, oh, that weed fried your brain.

1153
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,400
I'm like, you smoked too.

1154
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,600
I'm like, oh, here we go.

1155
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,480
Jason has turned to his notes.

1156
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,320
What can I turn to?

1157
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,120
What's the next topic?

1158
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,160
Why did I tell them you were coming on this?

1159
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,200
Oh, I don't know.

1160
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,360
I think I don't know why I'm like on one.

1161
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,520
I'm sorry.

1162
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,080
You're fine.

1163
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,520
We're just having fun.

1164
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,320
We're just having a good time.

1165
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,200
This is more than fun.

1166
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,200
Exactly what we want.

1167
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,560
Yeah, keep going.

1168
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:28,560
I mean, I will say that I we I mentioned we didn't get the weed.

1169
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,480
We did get cocktails from that rooftop bar.

1170
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,720
And then he goes, but I ate.

1171
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,560
So that's a negative.

1172
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,400
Then street tells weed.

1173
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,440
But then it turned out I was that turned out to be wrong.

1174
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:45,480
So the rooftop kind of bar, they're going more for a mixology kind of thing,

1175
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,840
like a little higher end than the Margaritaville bar.

1176
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,080
And we got this that this is meant to be more of a like New York wine bar.

1177
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:57,960
Yeah, the bite is not not super trot like going for like what other rooftop bars

1178
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,000
are like, yeah, the one that had the sign that said like, forgive me, father,

1179
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,760
for I have finned or was that that was that land shark?

1180
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,200
I saw you take a picture of it, Mike.

1181
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,720
But it said like, give me father, for I have finned.

1182
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,200
And I was like, what the fuck?

1183
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,120
Yeah.

1184
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,240
Why would you ever need to ask for forgiveness for that?

1185
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,680
No, for finning.

1186
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,600
But what was funny is the joyous act.

1187
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,600
The rooftop bar was funny as he was like, we just bring these back to the room.

1188
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,960
Just be cool about it. I was like, OK.

1189
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,840
But he was so precise and adamant about me hiding it.

1190
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,080
I was like, I know how to do this.

1191
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,080
He's like, no, no, no. Turn this way so they don't see it.

1192
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,680
I'm like, it's a plastic cup that they're probably fine with us

1193
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,920
taking to the room. He's like, wait, this is this Jason, you're saying?

1194
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,080
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1195
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,080
It's trying to get around about not where to.

1196
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,800
But why are you making it sound like I'm so mean?

1197
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,160
Oh, I don't know. Sorry.

1198
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,000
I love it. He's just he's just worried.

1199
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,280
You know, I'm just worried.

1200
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,960
We have anxiety. I don't.

1201
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,440
I for whatever.

1202
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,960
Showers, he for whatever reason.

1203
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,560
For whatever reason, every cup in this building is plastic.

1204
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,520
I didn't see any glassware.

1205
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,240
I am like a bull in a china shop.

1206
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,080
I would have dropped that shit everywhere.

1207
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,720
Yeah. Out onto the street.

1208
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,880
And then people are would have landed right on top of that table.

1209
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,120
The end of their business.

1210
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,800
So I'm on the three car Monty table.

1211
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,520
But the cocktails were like 20 bucks each.

1212
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,800
And one was right.

1213
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,000
One was vodka. And they tasted.

1214
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,200
We switched. We switched because it's like, oh, this.

1215
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,280
Neither of these were very good.

1216
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,240
Did they have fun?

1217
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:26,920
And do you have the menu?

1218
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,480
Do they have fun?

1219
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,280
Funner names than the regular ones?

1220
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,040
I not really.

1221
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,080
I saw I looked up some of the names.

1222
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,600
I think these are from this bar.

1223
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,760
You got the you got the not a care in the world.

1224
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,240
OK, you got the Jamaica mistake.

1225
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,360
There you go. There you go.

1226
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,560
You got the all right, all right, all right.

1227
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,160
I did see that. Oh, yeah.

1228
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,800
So now I feel it because here's another.

1229
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,400
Is it elsewhere in the restaurant?

1230
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,640
You can order the Lyman de Coconut, which is a tropical song.

1231
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,160
But this is a Harry Nilsson song.

1232
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,240
Yeah, at this point, I feel like they're co-opting other.

1233
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,840
And with all right, all right, all right.

1234
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:05,400
We are now taking the McConaughey phrase, which I'm amazed.

1235
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,480
He is not copyrighted.

1236
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,320
I'm amazed that you can say I could do it right now on this Patreon

1237
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,760
and not get say all right three times in a row.

1238
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,680
He's he needs to lock that shit down.

1239
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,120
Yeah, Paris Hilton did.

1240
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,520
Did she get that's hot many years ago?

1241
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,720
I didn't see so trademark case.

1242
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,640
She's bleep it.

1243
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,800
Bleep it. She's looking up the cocktails.

1244
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,360
So I think I got the.

1245
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,520
One was like Yuzu, lemon and vodka, and one was like pineapple and rye.

1246
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,480
And yeah, they weren't super different.

1247
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,280
Wasn't it like cucumber?

1248
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,840
Cucumber. That sounds good and exotic.

1249
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:49,840
Can we talk real quick just about when I got there for the first time

1250
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,680
is when we had that we were we when we ate with Griffin.

1251
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,360
And I went up, I went in there, I got excited.

1252
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,640
I took photos for content, took photos, texted for content to some people.

1253
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,680
And then I went up the escalator.

1254
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,200
That elevator trip was easy.

1255
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,320
I got right to the floor.

1256
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,800
And then you guys were all outside and it was freezing.

1257
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,760
And we sat down and there was a whole like beach deck by the pool,

1258
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,920
which was like, cool, it was a good scenic area. Yeah.

1259
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,840
And we sat down and there were, I would say, like seven or eight heaters

1260
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,680
sort of right lining the wall, would you say?

1261
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,960
Like, yeah, I don't know.

1262
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,280
To see it was pretty cloudy, drippy. Right.

1263
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,920
It's like, OK, so we are heated out here.

1264
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,400
That'll be good. Yeah, that'll be great.

1265
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,400
And we sat down and of all the heaters, one was working

1266
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,680
and we asked one of the people who worked there,

1267
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,400
can we turn some of these other ones on?

1268
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,640
And he basically told us if he if he turned it on,

1269
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,480
it would blow out a fuse, essentially. Right.

1270
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,800
That might be even a blow up the entire facility. Yeah.

1271
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,840
Oh, well, they someone had told they couldn't find us.

1272
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,600
They couldn't find extension cords.

1273
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,240
It's like, oh, yeah, I'll send the other bar.

1274
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,400
Keep stealing extension cords from each other.

1275
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,160
And the ones that were out there, it was like a weird tangled mess.

1276
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,640
Yeah. Let's see if we can weave this one.

1277
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:08,440
Yeah, you're really not supposed to plug heaters into

1278
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,760
power strips or extension cord, but they were like the big like weed

1279
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,840
whacker kind of extension.

1280
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,480
So I'm like, oh, maybe that's OK.

1281
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,800
But I'm like, I got to figure this extension cord thing out.

1282
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,200
They got to figure out this heater thing.

1283
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,160
Heater at the five o'clock somewhere bar.

1284
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,240
Remember this? Oh, yeah.

1285
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,640
He was going to go get it, but they were closing in like 10 minutes.

1286
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,800
And we just kind of gave up because this guy was going to go get it for us.

1287
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,520
And then it just never happened. We just went.

1288
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,480
Yeah. Every now and then someone would just say

1289
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,520
they were going to do something and then just disappear.

1290
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,720
That would happen a few times where someone's like, yeah, I'll be right there.

1291
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,080
They disappeared forever.

1292
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,600
And then we'd never see them again. Yeah.

1293
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,240
Restaurants. But I will say housekeeping and everything.

1294
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,200
Man, Miguel was really cool.

1295
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,240
I think Amelia was you.

1296
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,400
You were. They might be listening.

1297
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,480
So show them all. Yeah, I'm just saying.

1298
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,440
They were nice.

1299
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,400
I like to learn their names and stuff because it's like, hey, like, what's up?

1300
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,720
You're like, if you're nice and also, yeah, they're just people.

1301
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,280
You nice people. But like, yeah, they would fucking hook you up.

1302
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,200
Be like, hey, Miguel, what's up?

1303
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,880
But run into him in the because it's small.

1304
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,600
I run into him all the time in the elevators and be like, oh, hey, how's your trip?

1305
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,520
You know, like people were cool.

1306
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,960
It also sounds like you guys you were telling us before we started.

1307
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,520
You guys made a lot of calls downstairs.

1308
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,720
Every got you made a lot of requests.

1309
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,680
I mean, yeah, she's going through a towel every 10 minutes.

1310
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,880
So would it be the same?

1311
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,240
Would it be the same flip?

1312
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,600
Jane just flipped him off.

1313
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,520
Would it be the same?

1314
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,080
You know, I don't know if you know this, this baby predates you guys dating.

1315
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,720
There is an option on this show to put Jason in a penalty box.

1316
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,920
No, I'm just letting you know.

1317
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,720
Do not.

1318
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,000
This is a precedent.

1319
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,960
Penalty box is covered in dust.

1320
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,240
Only money as a key.

1321
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,960
And that was the next deck here.

1322
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,560
We'd have to send you into the yard for a minute.

1323
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,800
Well, he could still go to my deck if he wants.

1324
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,480
You just got to drive.

1325
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,360
Oh, I just got to drive.

1326
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,040
OK, so if you want, you can ask him to drive to Mike's place.

1327
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,480
OK, good to know.

1328
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,160
It's an option.

1329
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,400
There was one big sure coming we haven't touched upon yet.

1330
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,920
The website promised.

1331
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,240
Oh, in the room.

1332
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,480
Yeah. Oh, is right.

1333
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,200
The website from his slippers and robes in every room.

1334
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,120
We only got slippers. We got slippers.

1335
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:05,960
They were nice. They were nice.

1336
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,920
I went to the lobby.

1337
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,240
They were nice.

1338
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,000
They were nice.

1339
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,840
I was a little hungover.

1340
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,120
Call down said there are no robes.

1341
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,080
And they're like, oh, we don't have robes.

1342
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,120
You made the call.

1343
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,320
I made the call.

1344
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,360
Do you want to know how many times we called?

1345
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,880
I would call and go like, hey, we need more towels.

1346
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,720
And then they wouldn't come.

1347
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,680
And then they brought us beach towels and we're like, hey, bro, like,

1348
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,040
can we get the regular towels?

1349
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,520
We started and we started calling.

1350
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,800
This is how you knew everyone's name.

1351
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,960
You were talking to staff.

1352
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,680
Constantly, many times a day because we kept going.

1353
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,640
I'll go down and get this in the lobby.

1354
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,840
And then we'd stand at the elevator for 10 or 15 minutes and no elevator would come.

1355
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,720
So we'd call down.

1356
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,680
We'd go back and go like, I can we get that?

1357
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,760
Like we we were going to go get ourselves.

1358
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,840
We couldn't get down there.

1359
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:51,640
Yeah. I just call me like, hey, we need some more washcloths.

1360
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,120
And also, can you give us like four waters?

1361
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,400
And they'd be like, yeah, sure.

1362
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,440
Yeah. One morning when we were really feeling it from the night before, again,

1363
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,760
Jordan, very nice man named Jordan.

1364
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,600
I was like, Jordan, we need water.

1365
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,200
We're so hung over.

1366
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,840
And he would just come to our door with four waters.

1367
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,320
And then like a couple hours later, I'd be like, Jordan, we need more.

1368
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,920
And he would come and like, give us water.

1369
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,720
Jordan, Jordan, Jordan.

1370
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,880
He thought it was so funny.

1371
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,800
Like, he was really not. Everyone was really nice.

1372
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:20,440
I puked all over the Joe Merchant sign on the wall.

1373
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:24,880
Jordan, please clean it up so I can learn about Joe Merchant more.

1374
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,120
Like they know what's up.

1375
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,920
And if you're nice and chill, they're like, yeah, what's up?

1376
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,240
Here you go. Like, you know, I mean, like,

1377
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,000
oh, I was going to call him Joe Noah.

1378
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,040
What's his name again? Jordan, Jordan, Jordan.

1379
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,200
Jason needs a table to play three card monty.

1380
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,320
You steal it from those guys on the street.

1381
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,800
Their weed's no good anyway.

1382
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,400
Look, it's the same vibe as the fake watches, fake designer,

1383
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,240
clothes, designer bags, fake.

1384
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,800
It's just fake. You know,

1385
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,600
it was like right downstairs from our hotel, which was funny.

1386
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,240
It was like always right by our hotel.

1387
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:59,280
The the the best person selling stuff on the street, there was even more.

1388
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,720
They were always like stand up comedy tonight, stand up comedy tonight.

1389
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,160
The flyers for that.

1390
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,280
And we were walking by. It was so cold.

1391
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,960
We were going to go see company.

1392
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,840
And the one guy went stand up comedy. I went, oh, no, thank you.

1393
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,200
And he went, look at you shivering and you're holding your coat.

1394
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,800
What's wrong with you? Like, yeah.

1395
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,080
Oh, I got roasted by this stand up guy.

1396
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,080
And I was just like, I'm just trying to get there in my head.

1397
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,920
I'm like, I didn't want to stop and put it on so crowded right now.

1398
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,360
But yeah, I got roasted by a liar guy.

1399
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,440
Going up to a rooftop bar and yell about where glasses can go and not.

1400
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,200
He's on your. Wow.

1401
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,920
So that was yeah, I don't think I got roasted.

1402
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,000
I'm trying to think.

1403
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,720
People were upset that I was ignoring like the cocaine.

1404
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,120
They asked if I want a cocaine.

1405
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,560
They were it was in Times Square somewhere. Yeah, constantly.

1406
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,720
Why didn't we get asked if we want to do cocaine?

1407
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,040
I don't. Yeah, I don't.

1408
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,440
I didn't look cool enough, I guess.

1409
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,880
Not like cool Mike. Yeah, not like cool me.

1410
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:55,920
Because you are little and I.

1411
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,280
So be little people don't do cocaine.

1412
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,480
I've been in this business my whole life.

1413
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,520
My father was as well. I know this.

1414
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,160
I am five. I am. I am.

1415
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,320
Two people. I am big.

1416
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,440
So I was offered.

1417
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,720
Mike is my egg.

1418
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,120
You can handle it in your you have more blood.

1419
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,480
You can't handle it in your bloodstream.

1420
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,680
Mike, have you been sitting there drinking a Coca-Cola Starlight?

1421
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,760
This I love Coca-Cola Starlight.

1422
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,400
Wait, yeah, I've only barely caught what this is.

1423
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,240
I'm excited about it.

1424
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,640
It's a bit tastes like space somehow.

1425
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,920
Where do you get it?

1426
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,280
You get it at all major retailers.

1427
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,960
Just call Jordan. They'll bring you four.

1428
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,200
This is Jordan.

1429
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,720
Jordan, you're car.

1430
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,760
I need a soda that tastes like the cosmos.

1431
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,200
Jordan, save me.

1432
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,320
It's yeah, I got it.

1433
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,760
I think it's Vans.

1434
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,560
This is a zero.

1435
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,440
This is a Coke Zero.

1436
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,640
The Coke Starlight Zero.

1437
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,360
And I couldn't be more addicted to it.

1438
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,760
I love it so much.

1439
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,640
Keep looking for it.

1440
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,280
I'm looking inside that bottle and there's no space on the inside of the label.

1441
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,560
Not like the island water.

1442
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,000
You see island on the back of the stickers.

1443
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,280
Yeah, that's true.

1444
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,800
So they throw it away.

1445
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,360
It's trash. You're right. You're right.

1446
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,440
It's nothing compared to island water.

1447
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,840
You guys got to sample the water.

1448
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,720
Jane gave you guys waters, right?

1449
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,800
Did I have? Yeah, on the way to the airport.

1450
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,000
You guys all wear the same.

1451
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,160
You may not even like you may just throw it away.

1452
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,560
They're free. So I was like, hey, no, I certainly had it.

1453
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,880
They threw it away in the airport.

1454
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,600
I totally forgot.

1455
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,640
And I had in my bag and they were like, we got to throw this away.

1456
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,640
And I go, oh, yeah, of course.

1457
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,520
You didn't say this is island water.

1458
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,560
I forgot. I forgot.

1459
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,040
I gave it to you guys just kind of like as a hey, like,

1460
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,080
you know, funny, but also like for the way.

1461
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,880
Yeah. I know, Scott, you had some years anyway.

1462
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,280
You were the three of you were on the same flight back.

1463
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,760
And I was on an Amtrak to Pennsylvania.

1464
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,480
And you guys made it to the airport by the skin of your teeth.

1465
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,440
Michael, I swear. I was getting up.

1466
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,160
We have the phrase because I just said that that phrase is getting right.

1467
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,240
It is as soon as I said it, because you said about Club Cool,

1468
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,480
the skin of your teeth. Why is it that cool?

1469
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,880
I was crazy. I looked back and I think when we were there,

1470
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:01,080
the reason I said that phrase was not just the storms and the crowds.

1471
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,920
I think Club Cool closed before the rest of the park.

1472
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,760
I think that's why I meant that.

1473
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,320
I know. But then why is the phrase that skin and teeth?

1474
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,280
Yeah. What is that phrase?

1475
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,360
You don't have skin.

1476
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,880
I don't know the origin of that. That's a great question.

1477
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,800
Craziness. I just was when I said it, I felt crazy.

1478
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,240
I mean, you all made it back in one piece.

1479
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,520
You all made the flight. But that was one of the most stressful

1480
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,920
afternoons that I had had in a long time.

1481
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:29,280
I mean, like, I guess I will like take the blame for not going like,

1482
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,120
hey, I like to get to the airport early.

1483
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,600
Maybe I should leave before you all are like, you know,

1484
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,120
you should have just been on the on the same page

1485
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,080
because I may get to the airport late.

1486
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,760
I love getting to the airport late. I do it almost every time.

1487
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:45,080
It never occurred to me that that might be that that was a thing you liked.

1488
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,680
Yeah, I usually like to be there too early.

1489
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,160
I don't like to be there early.

1490
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,640
We both went to we both left out of Chicago,

1491
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,680
but we were on different flights. So, yes.

1492
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:56,960
Got there at different times.

1493
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,080
We'll fill you in on the flight schedules for all the live shows,

1494
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,760
because, you know, you guys come and you want to track it like Santa.

1495
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,200
Wasn't there a listener on the plane that like recognized y'all?

1496
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,080
Yes. Oh, very nice.

1497
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,400
And then they walked by me because we did not sit together.

1498
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,400
They didn't talk to me, the listener.

1499
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,080
They only talked to Scott, I guess.

1500
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,160
Why we ended up next to her in the line. Oh, OK.

1501
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,840
And then when you guys both walked by me, I was like, are you are

1502
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,440
do you do podcasts?

1503
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,680
Thank you for recognizing us.

1504
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,480
Yes, we were like, thank you.

1505
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,120
What were you? Well, yeah, we're all we're stressed trying to get to the airport.

1506
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,240
And then you text us.

1507
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:35,160
I'm already in my mom's house eating and you guys are ruining my trip.

1508
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,960
You're like, and you're ruining my nice train ride.

1509
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,640
And I was like, Michael, isn't here yet.

1510
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:40,840
I don't know what the fuck to do.

1511
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,000
And then Jason, though, I will say I've been very mean to him today.

1512
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,080
I don't know why. I think I'm just like tired.

1513
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,520
He's not I don't think it's I don't think it's been enough.

1514
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,680
Let's keep. No, I will say it was very sweet because I was like Jason.

1515
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,840
Like the guys aren't here yet.

1516
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:56,600
And he sent me $50 and said, get on your own taxi and here you go.

1517
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,840
You can get on your own.

1518
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,160
I did it because they were five minutes away and I waited.

1519
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,840
But it's very well, there's a bluebird.

1520
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,080
Oh, yes. The blue bird.

1521
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,960
Oh, it landed on Jason's shoulder.

1522
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:09,880
Oh, geez.

1523
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,320
Oh, wait, that was so pretty.

1524
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,640
I've never seen a bluebird.

1525
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,400
But back back. Sorry. Sorry.

1526
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,960
Snapped a chain like a dog.

1527
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:22,200
Like that was so pretty.

1528
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,400
OK, it was a look.

1529
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,040
It was a good looking bird.

1530
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,080
I don't disagree.

1531
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:29,640
Yeah. So that was really sweet of him.

1532
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,720
That was very, very nice.

1533
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,400
Well, now, if you feel let's build up Jason with other what else?

1534
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,840
Give him something else.

1535
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,880
Well.

1536
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Let me talk like I don't want to say inappropriate things on this show.

1537
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,280
This is the second gate.

1538
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,280
It's where this is.

1539
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,520
This is the rowdiest gate in podcasting.

1540
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,120
Whatever I'm on, this is like people are throwing up out of the gate.

1541
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,960
I'm hanging off of it, pole dancing off of it.

1542
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,560
Let me tell a quick hypochondriac story on my end.

1543
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,240
And you can think of formulating that good Jason story.

1544
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,240
This is this will be quick, though, so you better work fast.

1545
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,320
So I look well, there was one I think was Saturday night.

1546
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:15,280
We got I got back very late and I watched like 45 minutes of WrestleMania.

1547
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,240
And I looked at my foot and my foot.

1548
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,800
There was a large bump on the top of my foot,

1549
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,040
on top of what looked like a vein.

1550
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:27,000
And I went, oh, come on, what is this?

1551
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,720
Like I was so annoyed and I was like, all right, maybe it's nothing.

1552
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,560
We'll see in the morning, whatever.

1553
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,240
And then in the morning it was still there.

1554
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,760
And I started getting panicky because it was on top of a vein.

1555
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,560
And I go, is this a blood clot? Oh, my God, this is a blood clot.

1556
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,080
And I was like, it doesn't I don't know.

1557
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,720
I feel like it doesn't hurt or anything.

1558
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:45,080
So I ended up at the CVS Minute Clinic. What?

1559
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,640
You didn't tell us.

1560
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,280
No, I was maybe going to tell the live show.

1561
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,920
There's too much stuff to talk about during the live show.

1562
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:54,720
So I started like I like about a 25 minute dialogue with myself

1563
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,520
Sunday morning about like, are you going to what are you going to do?

1564
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,160
What is it? I'm in fucking Manhattan.

1565
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,800
What am I going to?

1566
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,960
I have Kaiser. Kaiser is not in New York.

1567
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,960
What am I going to do? I'm looking through like the Kaiser website.

1568
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,400
They're like, you can go to the CVS Minute Clinic.

1569
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,120
And I'm like, OK.

1570
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:13,160
And I'm looking through like times and I'm like, OK, there's one

1571
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,440
that's like in 45 minutes.

1572
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,840
All right. I'm going to walk to the Minute Clinic.

1573
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,400
Like it was like, yeah, like Fortley was like a 25 minute walk.

1574
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:27,280
So I get there and it's like it's just like there's a couple of old folks

1575
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,080
and they're so confused, like I'm like in line with them.

1576
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,880
And like there's something probably wrong with them.

1577
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,120
Like there could maybe not be.

1578
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,560
But like, I'm like, I know there's nothing wrong here,

1579
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:39,680
but I have to go in and it's so embarrassing because

1580
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,400
some like waiting.

1581
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,320
No, no, I was in.

1582
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,080
I was ahead of one of the older people and I was like, I should let them.

1583
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,200
Push them away. You push your way to the front.

1584
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,760
Oh, yeah. It was like the Seinfeld where George knocks the old lady out of the way

1585
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,560
because there's a fire in the house.

1586
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,880
And you're OK, by the way, like, what was it?

1587
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,800
So so well, honestly, OK.

1588
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:03,920
So I went in there and the nicest person is working at the Minute Clinic,

1589
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,680
which I guess is just like a thing they have everywhere.

1590
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,480
And like it's just a doctor in there.

1591
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,760
Yeah, there's one in Burbank. Yeah.

1592
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,320
Yeah, it's not that unusual. Yeah.

1593
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,080
So I went in there and she's like, everything OK?

1594
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,560
And I go, I remember I go, I think so.

1595
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,680
And I get like this weird like I was like, oh, it's so embarrassing

1596
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,800
the way you just sounded.

1597
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:24,400
And so I took my foot, my foot off, my shoe off and I show her

1598
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,080
what's going on. I go, there's like a bump on the top of the vein.

1599
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,960
This isn't a blood clot, is it?

1600
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,200
She's like looking at it and she goes,

1601
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,640
and this is this is a very common thing where she like makes me feel good,

1602
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,560
but not good enough, where she's looking at it and she goes,

1603
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,920
I don't think it's a blood clot, but I don't know what it is.

1604
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:46,040
All right. And I go, OK.

1605
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,440
She goes, I don't think you should.

1606
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,880
I go, she goes, like a walking, been walking around a lot.

1607
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,280
And I go, yeah, a lot standing today.

1608
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,840
And she goes, or yesterday, she goes, I don't know, keep an eye on it.

1609
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,600
I'm not sure what it is, though.

1610
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:01,000
So I go, OK, but not a blood clot.

1611
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,680
She goes, yeah, be red and it would hurt a little bit.

1612
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,640
So just yeah.

1613
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:08,760
So it has gone down and it might be gone today.

1614
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:09,800
I actually forgot to check.

1615
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:14,440
So the morning around, though, it stuck around for a few days,

1616
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,480
even coming back here.

1617
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:20,520
But it was the morning of the show started

1618
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,560
because I got all this. I got stuff to do.

1619
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,400
I put some stuff not that it was anything crazy,

1620
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,480
but you know, you got to get to the venue.

1621
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,160
We got to go to Jekyll and Hyde's.

1622
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,480
I got all this stuff to do.

1623
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,640
And I'm like, we reversed our green goblin.

1624
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,040
Yeah, perfect.

1625
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,440
Exit for us to beat by beat.

1626
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:39,440
I dropped a line during that because I was thinking about everyone knew it.

1627
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,760
Everyone could tell.

1628
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:44,120
But yeah, I started the day by like trudging through

1629
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,080
like a rainy morning to try to get a bump on my foot.

1630
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:51,320
Looked at you dropped the line because you were worried that that clot

1631
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:55,600
was going to like build up and up and up into geyser level

1632
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:59,720
and then like rocket through your shoe and spray the whole audience with blood.

1633
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,040
We're going to begin and probably end our show unless they were down to stay

1634
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:08,600
after that like the the lizard, like the inflatable lizard from that show.

1635
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,840
Of course. Yeah. Oh, yes.

1636
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,000
Yeah. Just suddenly.

1637
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,600
And they think it was part of it.

1638
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,600
It was stage blood.

1639
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,720
But of course, you'd have to say no, ladies and gentlemen.

1640
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,080
No, no. You're all covered in my foot blood.

1641
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:21,160
So I didn't want to get the audience covered in my foot.

1642
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,760
Blood is really what was happening.

1643
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:28,680
So so, yeah, I told I told some listeners this story after the live show outside.

1644
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,000
You told listeners there was a group of yeah, there's a group of listeners

1645
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,520
that got like a private five, like five of them or six of them

1646
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,760
got this foot story. It's crazy.

1647
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,840
That's like if you meet like, you know, yeah, you hang out after the concert

1648
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,920
and he thinks of a song in front of you.

1649
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,680
I got a Mike Panic story custom that is right.

1650
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,400
I also think I framed it like that to them.

1651
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,920
I go, you know what I'm giving you a little sugar. All right.

1652
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,480
Yeah, I still got that energy.

1653
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,960
I could toss some more.

1654
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:01,960
I was sharing a bottle of Jack with Brett Michaels here at a blister story

1655
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,880
from Mike Carlson.

1656
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,080
I put the hat down in some places.

1657
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,360
Yeah. Yeah. They gave me stuff in this life.

1658
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,920
They gave me money in the hat. I made them give me money for it.

1659
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,120
If you like the story, if you want to kick me a little bit, fine.

1660
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:20,000
But not not require really just glad you came to your like a one style

1661
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,360
busker with your hat on the ground.

1662
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,800
But you're telling your ailment stories. Oh, I see. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1663
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,280
We would make so much money if we really did that.

1664
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,200
I mean, you'd be like, do you want to hear this anxiety,

1665
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,360
like hyperchondriac story and you can give me money for it.

1666
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,840
Me and Michael would be like making out like bandits.

1667
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:39,920
Just people on the street love, love hyperchondriac stories.

1668
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,720
You go on a Burbank tonight, you're going by the Batman statue tonight.

1669
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:48,000
Yeah, I guess it's better than the street preachers.

1670
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,080
Step right up, step right up.

1671
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,160
You're a story where I almost lost my mind for no reason.

1672
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,920
Person and egg person tell you about their anxiety.

1673
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,320
Tall and a Higg.

1674
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,960
No, you don't stop in the middle of his little.

1675
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,480
Sorry, I'm adding too many pronounce the T. Little.

1676
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:07,160
Egg. Any any other Margueriteville stuff?

1677
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,880
I'm sorry. Yeah. Well, I suppose say nice thing.

1678
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,640

01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,800
Well, OK, sure.

1680
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,240
The first thing that was very nice is my luggage kind of fell apart

1681
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:18,680
and I didn't have anything great and I was meaning to get some more.

1682
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,720
And Jason let me have one of his to use.

1683
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,960
So I wasn't stressed out and I thought that was very nice.

1684
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,240
He helped me with that.

1685
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:28,320
We had a really nice day in Central Park because I said, like,

1686
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,720
the one thing I really want to do on this trip, like I know we have

1687
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,200
like actual stuff to do.

1688
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,840
I really want to go to Central Park. I love going to Central Park.

1689
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,160
So he like puts that time aside.

1690
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,840
We got up and went because he knew I wanted to go.

1691
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,800
We got a really cute picture, actually.

1692
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:44,800
I didn't post anywhere because trying to keep something for us.

1693
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,960
Not content. Well, I like to give some stuff for us,

1694
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,160
but we got a cute little picture.

1695
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,960
We saw lots of dogs and no dice.

1696
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,360
You're there on the company dime.

1697
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,960
You're going to post that to our Instagram, our Twitter.

1698
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,640
And that's that.

1699
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,360
I do have more pictures. I mean, I do have some company.

1700
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:04,040
No dime. Anyway, that was nice trip.

1701
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,600
It was a really nice trip. Yeah, the vibes were good.

1702
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,120
The vibes were great at the show and.

1703
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,600
Yeah, I had so much fun at the show.

1704
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,520
Geez, I was a bad. That was an amazing crowd.

1705
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,720
Thanks anybody who was there and especially to we should touch on this

1706
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:17,800
really quick.

1707
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,800
We've been getting like really nice things.

1708
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:23,920
Yeah. Who have come to the shows recently and always.

1709
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,880
This is like crazy. This has always been happening.

1710
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:29,160
But there's one and I don't look at anybody who brings us anything.

1711
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,280
It's it's amazing.

1712
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:34,960
But this one thing, jeez, like we have to talk about this a little right.

1713
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,520
This is like the finest object ever.

1714
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,120
Yeah, we've been to anyone.

1715
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,160
We had too much too much stuff.

1716
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,760
It's too nice to bring.

1717
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:47,280
And there's so many crazy things, too.

1718
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:52,000
But yeah, we were we were gifted a custom Michael Eisner doll.

1719
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,200
It's really quite something.

1720
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,320
Yeah. Yeah.

1721
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,600
With like a custom box to take it in, really.

1722
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,760
I mean, you're the rightful, you know, well, no, it's a daddy of it.

1723
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,520
But we're splitting it like the comic book in the Simpson episode, I think,

1724
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,320
where we'll take turns and then we'll eventually tear it apart.

1725
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,640
Yeah. But this thing is.

1726
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,840
Yeah. Well, we'll post a photo of it and we'll we'll.

1727
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,680
Yeah, we'll give you a detailed like I should do like a full.

1728
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,840
I don't know. I don't even want to unbox it.

1729
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:23,240
So you know, just all the deep because it's like the finest box work.

1730
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,680
The graphic design on it is a met.

1731
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,240
They took the step.

1732
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,520
And I do. Do you know the name? I don't know, because I didn't meet the person.

1733
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,440
So I don't know. They have tweeted it.

1734
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,880
We'll do it in the tweets.

1735
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,720
We'll give everyone a tribute.

1736
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:40,440
Because the box then it's done in the style of like 86, 87 era

1737
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,560
Disney store, like clearly, yes, it's so good.

1738
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:48,280
Yeah. From like how Disney would have done retail stuff back then.

1739
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:52,280
And then, you know how action figures have a quote maybe on the back.

1740
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,440
He has hello. Hello. Hello.

1741
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:59,480
Hello. Hello. In many different like Disney ish fonts that change every time.

1742
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:01,400
This is wild. This piece.

1743
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,280
Yes. Thank you for I'm still in awe of I need to take it in.

1744
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:05,520
This is their craft.

1745
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,040
I believe they said they were a doll design doll design.

1746
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,640
OK, I carry this in a little bag with me on the plane.

1747
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:15,240
Yeah, he was just under the seat in front of me on the plane.

1748
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,040
Like a dog. Yes.

1749
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:20,000
He was. Yeah, I put him in a little carrier.

1750
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,160
I forgot about this.

1751
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,600
I've got something stupider to end on.

1752
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,560
Yes. One of the things they gave us when we checked in was a punch card.

1753
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:32,240
Oh, yeah. Oh, we heard it every location in the hotel.

1754
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,200
You could turn it in for a prize.

1755
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,880
And we did the prize.

1756
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:40,280
Go and do this at like two in the morning after the show.

1757
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,400
We went to the front desk.

1758
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,800
We met another cool guy and I said, what's the prize?

1759
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,160
And he said, you have two options.

1760
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:51,040
Your option is a shot glass or a shot glass, because all they have is shot glasses.

1761
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:56,560
So Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville, nice logo, New York stamp on it.

1762
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,240
Oh, it has New York, at least. Yeah.

1763
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,640
OK, so pretty solid prize.

1764
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:01,960
Pretty solid prize.

1765
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:04,240
But I was like, I'm going to fucking break this.

1766
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,280
So I had to wrap it in so many things and put it in one of my shoes in my bag.

1767
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,880
I was so worried I was going to break it.

1768
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,720
No, he told us he's like, oh, don't worry about it.

1769
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,840
He's like, that's the nice thing.

1770
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,000
If you buy shot glass souvenir, he's like, just put it.

1771
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,400
If you have pair shoes, just put it in your shoes in your luggage.

1772
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,240
And that was a trick.

1773
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,800
So and it worked.

1774
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,120
It's in one piece.

1775
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,120
That's a good tip. Instantly drop it.

1776
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,040
Instantly drop it. Yeah.

1777
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,080
Shot glass.

1778
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:31,000
I guess you use it for mixing drinks, I suppose, to get the right.

1779
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,080
Or the blood of Christ, as it is Easter.

1780
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,680
Are you concerned about?

1781
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:38,520
Yes. Are you saying you think it's weird to have a shot glass at home?

1782
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,880
No, I'm not. I'm just trying to think of like,

1783
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,000
I have a couple, but I yeah, it's for I don't know.

1784
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,040
You don't take shots in your adult years very often.

1785
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,600
No. But if you need

1786
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,400
ounce and a half to two ounces of something, it's a good, easy.

1787
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,320
It's a mix. It's good for mixing.

1788
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,800
You don't take shots in your shot glass.

1789
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,360
You use it to measure out things.

1790
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,280
And it's very. Put your quarters.

1791
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,840
Really nice. Put your quarters in it.

1792
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,920
I love it.

1793
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,320
And I do think it's weird.

1794
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,600
You're rationalizing.

1795
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,240
Jason just showed you a Margaritaville shot glass, the place that you like.

1796
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,120
Margarita, you're doing the math of like, but what would the use

1797
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,520
for a shot glass be?

1798
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,360
No, I'm just thinking along as being an adult human.

1799
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,360
You don't take many shots very often.

1800
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,920
But I guess you should use it for mixing.

1801
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:26,200
You know, if you're having like this 100 percent of the shots, you don't take.

1802
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,800
Shot. Now, I'll do it.

1803
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:28,960
I'll do a shot.

1804
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,080
Easter Sunday. Let's go. Yeah.

1805
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:33,240
If you have like a go in, we're going to have to.

1806
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,760
That's going to be a big pause.

1807
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:37,360
Yeah. Well, we're all going to share the one.

1808
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,240
I think. Yeah.

1809
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,840
I think I'm going to sign this thing going on.

1810
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:43,000
I probably already sound too nasally on this episode.

1811
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,440
I'm cool.

1812
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,000
You're very cool. You're very cool.

1813
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,200
My cool and eternally youthful.

1814
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,280
I'm very young.

1815
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,400
I know that's what you want to hear.

1816
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,360
Sounded so cool and young when you tried to rationalize

1817
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:58,160
what the use of a shot glass might be shot glass used for mixing.

1818
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,640
And Jays are twenty dollars to five dollars.

1819
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,280
That's a reasonable price for a nug I would say.

1820
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,040
What?

1821
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,320
That's the quality of these nugs, please.

1822
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,560
OK, does that does that wrap it up?

1823
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:13,400
That's it. All right.

1824
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,480
I think that's it. So podcast the ride.

1825
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:18,640
Yeah. Thumbs up for the Margretville Resort Times Square.

1826
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:21,520
Yeah. You need somewhere to stay in the middle of time.

1827
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,320
Jason is very, very nice and good to me.

1828
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,840
And he's not mean.

1829
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,120
That's why I've made him sound like five times.

1830
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:32,080
Well, the last episode, the last episode you were on,

1831
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,400
you were like really giving him the biggest.

1832
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,480
I'm not I don't know if I'm not going to say it,

1833
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,880
but I've given him great praise last time.

1834
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,320
That still stands.

1835
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,960
There we go. I well, I was going to. Yeah. Look.

1836
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:45,200
That's all I'll say about that part of the trip.

1837
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:50,120
OK, OK. The big the did the did the did the did the big dick

1838
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:54,120
energy maintain in the was a weird being in a small New York room

1839
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,640
with big big big energy. Great baby.

1840
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,080
Oh, man. Would you not should it?

1841
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:04,680
Would you not shut up to Quasimodo horse cock energy?

1842
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,160
Oh, I mean, he's already above that.

1843
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,480
He's already memorized.

1844
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:11,720
I even in Quasimodo, Frank Bama level,

1845
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:15,200
Tully Mars level. Oh, you know, I don't know.

1846
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,040
Some of the greatest characters of fiction. I'm thinking. Yeah.

1847
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,600
Go back and listen to the old episode.

1848
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,440
We don't know what the hell we've got just said.

1849
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:27,120
No, I look, I because you brought there's I think there's very few

1850
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,040
phrases that like stay in the lexicon for me.

1851
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,800
It takes like a launch queen kind of thing.

1852
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:36,440
Horse cock energy has been in my head ever since.

1853
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,080
Yes, I will be. I will admit. Yes.

1854
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:42,520
And so I thank you for bringing that, of course, to the table,

1855
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:45,280
because I got curious and I looked that up and I was like, that's not

1856
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,560
as with mighty Akron.

1857
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,840
I don't think people are saying big horse cock energy.

1858
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,360
I'm original. That's the original.

1859
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,240
Thank you so much.

1860
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,680
So thank you for the original. You survived podcast.

1861
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,160
The ride. Thank you.

1862
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,400
Through the gift shop with a punch card.

1863
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,640
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1864
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:06,760
If you need styling for any event that you have or personal styling,

1865
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:10,920
I am a stylist and also have some music out there.

1866
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,920
I kind of do a few things and where can they find all of it?

1867
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:17,800
Well, I'm on Instagram.

1868
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,200
Jane Claire official, Jayne.

1869
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,240
I'm on Twitter.

1870
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,960
I think it's Jane Claire eight on TikTok.

1871
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,680
OK, I'm actually doing like OK on TikTok. I'm figuring it out.

1872
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,560
It's weird to be too old for something.

1873
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,760
Yeah, but I've got like 1300 views on a video I posted the other day.

1874
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,320
I was like, that's kind of a lot for like, I don't know.

1875
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,360
That sounds good. I don't know anything about it.

1876
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:42,080
Yeah, I don't know. Follow me. Hit me up.

1877
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,000
I post a lot of videos like juggling island water.

1878
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,080
That's so funny.

1879
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:51,440
Like when you drink the water, then you do the thing

1880
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,120
where you push your hand at them, then you drink another water.

1881
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,400
Yeah, they flip the angle.

1882
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,360
We should have made a TikTok about Margueriteville.

1883
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,960
Oh, about Margueriteville Resort?

1884
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,360
We didn't talk about the freaking gym.

1885
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,360
We didn't talk about the gym. Oh, is there a gym story?

1886
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:09,960
I had a gym story. I went down and used the foam roller for my knee a little.

1887
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,680
Well, holy shit. What a story. What a story.

1888
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,440
Oh, there's a bunch of kids running around.

1889
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,640
It was like empty, right?

1890
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:19,240
And as soon as I go down there, I'm in the elevator with like a mom and two kids.

1891
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:21,320
And I'm like, please, God, no, please, God, no.

1892
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,760
And it's not a very big workout place.

1893
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:24,880
I guess the story's not that interesting.

1894
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,680
It just really bothered me.

1895
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:28,240
And these two kids come in and they're like eight and ten.

1896
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,280
And the mom is just like kind of hanging out.

1897
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,600
And they're like walking around like they're like bros

1898
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:35,200
and try to pick up like 30 pound weights and throwing shit everywhere.

1899
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,840
And I was like, I'm just trying to work out.

1900
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,760
And like these kids are running around.

1901
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,040
And I was like, you've got you've got to be goddamn kidding me.

1902
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,760
Like the exact time I went down there, I was so pissed.

1903
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,400
So the mom was working out and the kids.

1904
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,080
No, she wasn't. She was in like street clothes.

1905
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,040
And then she left them there. She left them there.

1906
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,800
I said, you are kidding me. I am not watching.

1907
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,360
She thought the gym was like a play place.

1908
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,280
Literally, she was like, go.

1909
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,360
And I did look a little like a play place.

1910
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,800
But I yeah, I wouldn't leave kids there.

1911
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,320
The beach on the wall, which was nice.

1912
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:03,040
Yeah, it was a public domain picture of the beach. Yeah.

1913
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,960
The beach.

1914
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,480
What color hair do they have?

1915
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,840
Can we talk to these people?

1916
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,920
Oh, the kids. You run into the.

1917
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,080
All right. If you see a bunch of people running a weed scam,

1918
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,800
you see the mom with the eight year old and the 10 year old, tell them

1919
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,120
gyms are not playgrounds.

1920
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,200
I mean, that's a lot of.

1921
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,400
Well, I had to clean up after them.

1922
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,440
I mean, it wasn't my responsibility, but I did.

1923
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:25,840
They left a 30 pound weight on the ground.

1924
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,560
They left a bunch of mats and rollers and balls out.

1925
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,240
And I was like, guys, like I was just so mad.

1926
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,720
This isn't maybe we can cut this.

1927
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:33,320
And it was.

1928
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,040
Well, it was.

1929
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,880
And it was tough for you to pick up the 30 pound weight

1930
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:36,640
because you're little.

1931
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,000
Because I'm little.

1932
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,280
No, I was just trying to do my fucking like dance like cardio.

1933
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,040
So I'm like grinding and shit.

1934
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,640
And these little kids are behind me trying to pump.

1935
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,760
And I was like, what the hell is going on right now?

1936
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,240
Like, this is the way I kept going like Jason get down here.

1937
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:50,640
But he was what you napping.

1938
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:54,240
Well, Jason, Jason, I was just I was just

1939
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,840
chilly. I was just resting in the room.

1940
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,320
I said I might come down and say hi.

1941
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,240
We had to go to company.

1942
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:03,040
We had to go to a panic attack member.

1943
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,880
I had to take a Xanax.

1944
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,440
Oh, you didn't get the Xanax from some guy on the street, did you?

1945
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,880
I know it was an officially licensed Xanax, I hope.

1946
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,760
Yeah. Oh, no, I that's yeah.

1947
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,240
Yeah, that's real.

1948
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,440
Yeah, that's real.

1949
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:15,880
So the kids made me angry.

1950
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,000
And then I was close on time.

1951
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,200
Cut this story. It's bad.

1952
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,480
I'm embarrassed. I like this story.

1953
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,680
It's not good.

1954
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:23,600
It's not good.

1955
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,800
The kids were pumping iron down there.

1956
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,520
Weird little seriously trying to weird little kids.

1957
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,800
It was weird.

1958
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:34,040
So and then the elevator took so long that by the time Jason was done,

1959
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,440
he was going to meet back up the room.

1960
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,520
I had time to do that and go to the bathroom.

1961
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:38,920
And then the elevator came.

1962
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:41,800
It took straight up ten minutes for the elevator to come to the basement.

1963
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:43,120
Yeah. OK.

1964
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:47,200
The workers also very frustrated with the elevator situations. Yeah.

1965
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:51,360
So elevators on that day, less than great.

1966
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,480
Less than ideal.

1967
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:58,000
But the hotel has no responsibility for the kids unless they let them come in again.

1968
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,400
So keep the kids out.

1969
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,560
No kids. Those kids, not other kids can come.

1970
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:04,400
As long as those kids stay out, though, this hotel is a great experience.

1971
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:07,480
Like if this was an adults only hotel, I think that's the way it would be.

1972
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,000
Like, I think there should be no kids here.

1973
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
At that place, we saw three kids the whole time.

1974
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,200
Yeah. And that's how it should be.

1975
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,040
They were shitheads. One and all. Yeah.

1976
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:19,360
I guess I just think you should be kids shouldn't be pumping iron.

1977
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,560
That's sort of my feeling.

1978
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,840
I don't think well, they end up looking real creepy when all is said and done.

1979
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,280
I don't want to see no kid.

1980
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:28,320
Strong kid. I want to see Buffett, not a buff kid.

1981
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,200
Can't be troll boy.

1982
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,160
Hmm. Yeah.

1983
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:34,040
Well, maybe there's obviously a lot of work to do.

1984
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,280
So they have to get extension cords

1985
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,520
and they have to get the kids out of the weight room.

1986
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,360
Get extension cords and get Joe Merchant.

1987
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:44,000
Get Where's Joe Merchant the book in all the rooms so we can read it.

1988
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,040
Yes.

1989
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,360
It's like a Bible. Yeah, like a Bible.

1990
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,600
Yeah. Get Buffett's Bible.

1991
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,520
Oh, man. Where's Joe Merchant?

1992
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,920
Yeah. All right.

1993
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:52,880
Well, stay it.

1994
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,000
Stay there and tell us what you think

1995
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,200
about it and let us know if there's kids working out.

1996
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,920
Let us know if Jason's thoughts about the towels are right.

1997
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,720
Yeah. Happy Easter.

1998
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,800
He is risen. Happy Easter.
