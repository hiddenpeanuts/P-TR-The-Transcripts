1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Well, back for more, are ya?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Well, you're in luck, cause today's topic is...

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Sorry, what now?

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Well, no, that's gotta be some kind of typographical error.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay, apparently not.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So today's episode's about the hungry bear bathrooms.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:38,120
Okay, have fun, it's Punching Bear Jammer Week on the fucking Ram.

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,680
Welcome back to Podcast the Ride Country Bear Jammer Week Day 4.

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm swinging Scotty Gardner, joined by Big Car Alson.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,280
Howdy there.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,040
And Jughead Jason Bonnet Sheridan, aka Old Sleuthfoot himself.

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,040
What's going on?

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,520
That's right, thanks for coming back, y'all.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:07,580
We're gathering speed, we're gathering names, and we are fresh from our cinematic journey

17
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,360
back to 2002.

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:18,600
And back here on the main feed to address the primary way that the Country Bears characters

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:26,320
live on in Disneyland today, which is, of course, the hungry bear bathrooms.

20
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,840
There was no way we could do Country Bear Jammer Week without this crucial dissection.

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,600
And so, you're welcome, here we are, it's happening.

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,560
Yes, the toilets at the Hungry Bear restaurant, quick service restaurant in Disneyland, are

23
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,440
some of the strongest places you will get to see the characters and see their names

24
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,920
more importantly, I even think.

25
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:00,880
They have taken approximately 24 animatronic characters and willed it down to, I think,

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,400
six in total.

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,200
They're down to just the best six, and it happens to be the six best characters in the

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,200
show.

29
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,480
I never would have picked different ones.

30
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:16,600
And there they are, welcoming you to the men's room and the women's room and the family room.

31
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:22,280
Now, some representation at the restaurant, there's like one picture, there's a lot of

32
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,360
generic bear stuff at the restaurant, although the real heads know that restaurant hasn't

33
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,520
been the same since they got rid of the fried green tomatoes.

34
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,560
You, of course, are taking the words right out of my mouth.

35
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,840
People are going to say, why aren't you just going to review the whole restaurant?

36
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,720
And I think we don't review this restaurant until they bring back this beloved sandwich.

37
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,560
I completely agree with what you're getting at here.

38
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,240
Yeah, it's loaded fries, it's not doing it, it's not doing it for anyone.

39
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,360
Oh yeah, I've seen so many pictures of just bad little squirts on buns.

40
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,360
Yeah, bad little squirts.

41
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,120
I'm disappointed with the bad little squirts.

42
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,360
Can we get a whole Twitter account called bad little squirts about the just embarrassing

43
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,480
like ketchup squirts or different loaded?

44
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,560
Probably, honestly, well, like if yeah, you know what, just respond to our tweet about

45
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,240
this episode to start it.

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,040
If you've been to Disneyland or any theme park and gotten opened up a burger to see

47
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,120
what a bad little squirt you got, because this happened, I'm sure we all have memories

48
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
of this.

49
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,040
This is a lot of what made me mad being in Disneyland Paris was just like, oh my God,

50
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,880
I was just having the greatest food of my life two days ago and now I'm looking at bad

51
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
little squirts.

52
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
Bad little squirt.

53
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,720
Yeah, no, I hear that.

54
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,680
And especially because if you're at the quick service like spot at Disney or Disney World

55
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,640
or Disneyland, the meat isn't good or whatever you have on the sandwich is not of a high

56
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
quality.

57
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,560
So you need a good quality squirt to balance out the maybe like subpar taste of what you're

58
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
eating.

59
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,720
Yes, some Chipotle mayo or cilantro mayo or something like that.

60
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:01,120
Although I had like a Halloween food from that Tomorrowland window that I always say

61
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,960
like it's like dog food.

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,920
And I gave it another chance recently when it was very crowded and it was like pulled

63
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,720
pork on top of waffle fries.

64
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:17,400
And I don't know how they stumbled that hard, but it was like, I was so sad eating.

65
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,520
I was like, why'd you go to the place you described as dog food?

66
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,000
The only thing that still had like mobile order times available like in that hour and

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,880
we were starving and it was like, well, let's I mean how bad and like Jane really, she had

68
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,480
like a fresh veggie wrap.

69
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,320
And then I was like, well, I'll try something like some junk food.

70
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
And I was like, oh, this is miserable.

71
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,760
I like to think it's like Lucy in the football with you where every time you go, maybe now

72
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
it'll be good.

73
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,960
Maybe now I don't do that that much.

74
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
I know.

75
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,320
I thought I'd like to think it's like, yeah, I thought I'd give it another chance.

76
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,960
I thought I'd try something different because I figured like a fried chicken sandwich, like

77
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,120
I was in another place to get our chicken.

78
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
Right.

79
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,080
You know, but yes, all this to say that we will do a full review of the hungry bear restaurant

80
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,680
when this sandwich comes back.

81
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
When?

82
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
Yes.

83
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
Great.

84
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,600
Because as of now, it is just, we basically are talking about the basement of a building

85
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,760
that is otherwise engulfed in bad little squirts.

86
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,240
Bad little squirts for sure.

87
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,800
Maybe the bathrooms are where you end up if you end up with your own bad little squirts

88
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
because of the bad little squirts upstairs.

89
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Exactly.

90
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
And that's what we're going to talk about.

91
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,920
Because yeah, we have thoughts about the dining area, the views you have when you sit in these,

92
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,720
either the bottom floor or the top floor.

93
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Sure.

94
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
The history.

95
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
The history.

96
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,040
The name changed at some point, but that's not what we're-

97
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,440
That's not what we care about today.

98
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
No, that's not.

99
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,400
This is the country bear jamboree week.

100
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,520
And this is just about the toilets.

101
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
Yeah.

102
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,360
Although not even really what it's about is that it's really restroom exteriors.

103
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,840
I guess you're probably right.

104
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,320
I have, but I have information on the actual interior.

105
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,040
I went there, I went down last week to do some reconnaissance.

106
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,680
I did, I just wanted to make sure we knew exactly how many.

107
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,000
I couldn't go in the female bathroom, but I went in the male bathroom and I counted

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
the stalls.

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I counted the urinals.

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, thank God.

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Good, good.

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So we have that type of stuff.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We have technical information.

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Great, good, great.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,440
So because obviously we're mainly here because of the country bear discussion, but like bathrooms

116
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,800
have gone woefully unaddressed.

117
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,800
They've come up here and there, but we know, we hear the swells of anchor about why if

118
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,880
you're going to cover these properties and yet there's so many, many rooms that we've

119
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
never discussed.

120
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
No.

121
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,400
We're wasting our time on what, on the ride with a guy in a boulder.

122
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
That's right.

123
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,320
Where the space trip is, who gives a shit?

124
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,760
Who cares?

125
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,640
Some still have like the crazy sixties interiors.

126
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,160
Like there's one on Main Street, the secret Tiki room was some seemingly have not changed

127
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,080
in decades and are kind of interesting interior design wise.

128
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,920
This seems to have been kept up.

129
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,560
It used to be, I find it a rock solid restroom option at Disneyland.

130
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,200
Yeah, this is a solid, I recently had a, I talked on the show about getting sunscreen

131
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,160
in my eye and it was a ordeal.

132
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,960
It was a multi hour ordeal.

133
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,120
It felt like it might've only been an hour, but I definitely like a bad little squirt.

134
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,560
Now that is a bad little squirt for sure.

135
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,800
I mean, that's actually a kind of a bad little drip.

136
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,640
Oh, you're more of a bad little drip.

137
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,320
It wasn't that you were like looking in the bottle.

138
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,400
Why ain't this thing going?

139
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Yeah.

140
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
No.

141
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Straight into your eye.

142
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,960
Not like that, but yeah, it was a bad little drip for sure that dripped into my eye.

143
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,680
And then yeah, I had to go hungry bear bathrooms were one of the main stops I had where I before

144
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,040
going to see the Disney doctor where I went in and just tried to like douse my head in

145
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,120
water and also was like trying to go in and out.

146
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,680
Cause like there were too many people there and I was embarrassed cause I was just soaking

147
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,160
my whole body in water.

148
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Cause it was a panic move.

149
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,080
Cause I was frantically trying to alleviate the pain.

150
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,560
So you thought you could return to theme parks without incident.

151
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,840
If you didn't hear this episode, this was the, this was his first time there in 15 months

152
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,800
post pandemic and that's what happened.

153
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Uh huh.

154
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Yeah.

155
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,680
So, so I spent a lot of time in a panic state in this bathroom not long ago.

156
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,080
Um, but yeah, so was it tough to go back?

157
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
It was.

158
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,560
Well, I had my journalist hat on this time, so it wasn't actually, I'm such a professional

159
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,240
that it was no problem.

160
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,080
I also, I was there last week as well and I did a little reconnaissance.

161
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:48,120
I was there with my friends, Raja and Jane and they, um, there was the moment of the,

162
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,160
that we're walking to galaxy's edge and we'll get a late night snack.

163
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,480
And I'm like, can we just, uh, one sec, can I just, I gotta go, uh, do a, you gotta go

164
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
to the bathroom.

165
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,480
I do, but not for it's too, uh, it's research about the bathroom.

166
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,840
You know, it's a week.

167
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:09,320
It's a thing that we're, uh, I think I've never seen so crazy requiring a theme park.

168
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,640
Well, it's a long story.

169
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,680
That's why you do what I did and you go to Disneyland alone.

170
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
That's right.

171
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
That's what I did.

172
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,360
Mistake I made having an audience.

173
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
That's right.

174
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,040
Is a notable development of these, but it used to be like right at the, one of the parks,

175
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,560
a few dead ends.

176
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,400
But now it's like a stop on the way to like the one entrance through the woods of galaxy's

177
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,840
edge, or if you're exiting through that, it's, it can be like, Oh, thank God there's a restroom

178
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
coming up.

179
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,440
It's like a gateway to the cosmos is what it is.

180
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Yeah.

181
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Yeah.

182
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
That's a great way to put it.

183
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Yeah.

184
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,160
Um, so it's, it's important, like boy, the prominence went up.

185
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,100
That's like some little, you know, it's like the, the, uh, the, the house from up suddenly

186
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,360
is surrounded by high profile construction.

187
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
That's true.

188
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,480
The neighborhood's changing and the, luckily it didn't, the, the, uh, nobody took the bathrooms

189
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,960
away on a bunch of balloons.

190
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,120
They stayed and they're, they're serving a purpose.

191
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,000
And let's, let's talk about the main, why they're coming up here because these bathrooms

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,720
are a remnant of a time where, uh, much more of the area was devoted to the country bears.

193
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,240
It's not the building that the country bear Jamboree was in, but it's nearby and thus

194
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,720
they are themed to the characters.

195
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,400
So let's talk about character representation on these bathroom doors.

196
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Right.

197
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:40,120
Um, the one we can speak to the most, the men's room is, uh, of course, Gomer's gentlemen's

198
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
lair.

199
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
Of course.

200
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
What do we have to say about this?

201
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,960
It's a very, it's a very main street, a very, uh, turn of the century kind of font.

202
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,880
Um, I, the choice of Gomer, what do we, you know, of all the gentlemen in the show to

203
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,160
choose from, are we disappointed that somebody else isn't?

204
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
Well, yeah.

205
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,880
Gomer is a less flashy choice.

206
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,400
Cause it would make sense more maybe like, you know, Henry or big Al or something.

207
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,040
Like it does seem like that would be the character you would go to.

208
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
So Gomer is kind of a low key choice.

209
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,840
Now you might say that's, you know, that's smart to get Gomer out there a little bit

210
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,560
more since he's not so, um, prom.

211
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,320
People don't think of him maybe as one of the main bears, but I would say to you, they

212
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
use Trixie.

213
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,680
I mean, there's only a few female bears right now that I think about it, but like Trixie

214
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
is a much more.

215
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,840
She's very pop singing role of a very visible bear.

216
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
Right.

217
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,640
So you would think they would try to match the star power of Trixie on the men's bathroom

218
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
sign.

219
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:46,520
I think, um, you know, I was very complimentary of Gomer several days ago in the first episode

220
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,920
I was saying, I think that Gomer can get it.

221
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,600
I think he's a thinker and a tinkerer.

222
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,960
Um, and yes, there's louder country bears, but maybe you want to aspire to be like Gomer

223
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,440
in the way that you use a restroom facility.

224
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,280
You want to just quietly sure do your business, not make a bunch of noise, right?

225
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:12,360
Just get in and out of there with a plan because a wilder character, like a Wendell Wendell

226
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
would win there.

227
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
Yeah.

228
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,900
Tear it up, make a mess, be hooting and hollering.

229
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,520
He would do be hooting and hollering too much.

230
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,560
I, you know, you're right.

231
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,340
So it makes sense.

232
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:25,040
And Trixie seems like she would be very respectful and the ladies parlor or whatever.

233
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,040
Excuse me.

234
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,040
The powder room.

235
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
Yes.

236
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,000
Is when she's on the sign.

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,600
She's very like, um, coy, I would say.

238
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Yeah.

239
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Her eyes are closed.

240
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,240
Um, she, I mean, look, closing your eyes is a flick.

241
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:53,440
It makes sense as a facial pose, you know, mid bathroom business experience.

242
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,440
Yeah.

243
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
Yeah.

244
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
So that makes sense.

245
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,680
So I, I guess they are pictured.

246
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,240
This is a picture of Trixie going to the bathroom.

247
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,280
A picture of Trixie's head while she's going to the bathroom.

248
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
Yes.

249
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
Her head though.

250
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Folks.

251
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Yes.

252
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
Not nothing.

253
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,280
No one start thinking they portrayed something untoward.

254
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Right.

255
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,160
Um, this probably surprises no one.

256
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,360
Uh, powder room is what we call the downstairs bathroom in my house growing up.

257
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,880
Like I think what you call it now, we always said, oh, that, you know, like, oh, the powder

258
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,560
room is out of toilet paper.

259
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,440
Like we need, you know.

260
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,520
And you, okay.

261
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:31,040
So the powder room implying that, um, it's just a quick, because powder is kind of a

262
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,960
quick thing on a film shoot or something.

263
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,800
Let me just give the guy a quick powder.

264
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Okay.

265
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Great.

266
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,080
Uh, it's like for, it's a quick stop by more than it is a full bathroom experience as with

267
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
a shower or a bathtub.

268
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,720
Well, yeah, I think back in the day, ladies would go in and powder their noses is where

269
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,760
I'm assuming that the name came from.

270
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,640
But yeah, I think you call it a half bath now, just basically like a toilet in a sink

271
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
without a shower.

272
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
Yeah.

273
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,240
But powder, that was a, you know, in a classier time when you wouldn't, you didn't want to

274
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,560
say, Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.

275
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,680
Cause that would conjure up images of you urinating or something.

276
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,040
No, you'd say powder room or water closet or WC.

277
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,400
So you could, you could mask people from having to put that image in their head of you going

278
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
to the bathroom.

279
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Yeah.

280
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,000
It was a simpler and a classier time.

281
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,520
Presumably it came from, you know, my parents learned it from one of their parents.

282
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,280
We also, I think like in an improv practice or class or something, I referred to something

283
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,600
as a Hasek once instead of an ottoman.

284
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,960
I mean the same thing, a foot rest.

285
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:37,520
But yeah, I think it's just an older term for the foot rest that goes with the chair.

286
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,600
I was thinking how, because you were saying upstairs, sorry to leave the bathrooms for

287
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,160
a second, but upstairs at the hungry bear, which is not otherwise country bear themed.

288
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,960
There is a big picture of the five bear rugs, the band once you get up to the counter and

289
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:59,360
the sign there, I might not have it in front of me, but it refers to, Oh no, I do have

290
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,360
it.

291
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:06,960
Thanks for buzzing by enjoy your Vittles and Vittles is this kind of old Westie term, but

292
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:12,000
it occurred to me as one of those things where Jason might say, Vittles, no Vittles.

293
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You didn't say Vittles.

294
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,680
You didn't go to get your Vittles.

295
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,560
I think we, okay, we didn't say, so we didn't say Vittles regular.

296
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,440
I think we saw it in like an old movie or an old TV and every now and then we go like,

297
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,280
well Vittles are we had, like we would.

298
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
So you did say Vittles.

299
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,640
He would say Vittles as a child in the family.

300
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,520
I forget the initial content, but I definitely remember maybe it was in the boy scouts or

301
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,640
something, but like Vittles, I know that I knew the term Vittles from very young.

302
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,080
You picked it up from one of the other little rascals.

303
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
Yeah.

304
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,480
Yeah, when we were like, someone mentioned it like, Hey, let's go get some Vittles.

305
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,760
After we look into this tailpipe, of course we'd have to wash our faces off from the soot

306
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
of course.

307
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,600
You would come home with so much soot.

308
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Yeah.

309
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Mischief night.

310
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
You were covered in soot.

311
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Yeah.

312
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,800
I even, what, how do you define Vittles?

313
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,360
It's like sort of girl, but yeah.

314
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,360
So right, well I guess right there, where were we?

315
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,880
The, I would just, well, let's keep, let's make sure we don't leave the signs behind.

316
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
That's really what we're going to go.

317
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
Yeah.

318
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,640
I think is like just pretty thoughtful and just kind of pensive.

319
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
Yeah.

320
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,640
He's happy.

321
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,320
He's not grinning, but he's like, huh, he looks like this is a picture of him in the

322
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,120
moment of realizing that he has to go to the bathroom.

323
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,120
Yeah.

324
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,840
Like he's having a conversation with someone and he's like, Oh, uh-oh.

325
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,480
Maybe it's not a dire situation, but it's definitely like a serious one.

326
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,800
It's like, I got to get there quick, pretty quickly.

327
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,480
Like Tennessee is people underrate Tennessee as a musician.

328
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,520
He's actually like people think he's a joke, but I've played with a lot of guys in my time

329
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,560
and I'll say, Oh, excuse me.

330
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,680
I need to go to the gentleman's lair.

331
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
My gentlemen.

332
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
My gentlemen's lair.

333
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,080
You mind if I go to my gentleman's lair?

334
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,080
Yes.

335
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,080
I think that's correct.

336
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
It does.

337
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,920
Now that brings up another question of like in the Bayer Cannon, did these bathrooms get

338
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
named?

339
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,720
Does like, is that Gomer's place?

340
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,280
Like is that like he takes care of it or he designed it or it was his decision to create

341
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
this bathroom.

342
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
You know what I mean?

343
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,040
Like, is it, is it just, Oh, it's a fun name for them or did the in Canon, do the bears

344
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,040
have something to do with the upkeep or creation of these bathrooms?

345
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,880
So you're like, I mean, what I'm picturing is sort of the, you know, there's a plot on

346
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,000
curb currently of Larry getting to pick what is in his mini fridge.

347
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,080
Like he's a mini bar, mini bar in a hotel.

348
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,360
So it implies that sort of scenario where like, did they give Trixie and Gomer the opportunity

349
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,600
to provide not the edible vitals, but you know, toiletry vitals.

350
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Sure.

351
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,560
Like the toilet-les that might be available.

352
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:09,360
Like it was like, was there maybe a time where you could get, you know, mints or different

353
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,520
types of washes or cloths or whatever?

354
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,280
They certainly don't have those things now.

355
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,920
Lucy's what's that individual cigarettes.

356
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Oh yeah.

357
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
Lucy's quarter for a cigar.

358
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
Yes.

359
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
Yeah.

360
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,400
So I can say we've all, yeah, there was there ever a time in the, in Canon, I don't think

361
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,880
in Disneyland, but where there was a bathroom attendant in a bare bathroom attendant who

362
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,600
would, you know, spray you down with cologne or, you know, you'd tip them.

363
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,400
They have candy bars.

364
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,560
I'm describing, I'm describing like the one time I went to a strip club, I think where

365
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,640
there's like candy bars and you're like, what, what is this set up in here?

366
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,280
Venues in LA.

367
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,680
Like I don't know if that's come back, you know, his concerts have come back, but like

368
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,120
the echo, you know, they would have mints and gum and it's someone.

369
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Yeah.

370
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Yeah.

371
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Cigarettes and stuff.

372
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
Yeah.

373
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,120
The bathroom attendant isn't that uncommon.

374
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
This is the real spots.

375
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,680
Like we probably don't have time to get into this, but that you've been to a strip club

376
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
and I have not.

377
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
Is that true?

378
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
Yeah.

379
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
I've never been to strip club.

380
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
Oh.

381
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,680
Really?

382
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
Yeah.

383
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,680
Jason.

384
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,680
I was with him.

385
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Whoa.

386
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,680
Yeah.

387
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,680
It was yesterday.

388
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,680
Yeah.

389
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,680
It was last night.

390
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
It's Tuesday now and Mondays are.

391
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,720
Mondays are free wing night.

392
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
Yeah.

393
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,920
I know as we record this, I haven't gotten the boost yet, but that's, I feel like you're

394
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,520
using as an excuse to not invite me to stuff.

395
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,720
Well, we just know you didn't know the landscape really well.

396
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,600
So we don't even embarrass us because we're very good at going.

397
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
I'll learn.

398
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
I'll catch up guys.

399
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
I don't know.

400
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,200
I can be rowdy and bawdy.

401
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
I don't know.

402
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
What's where we're.

403
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Why Vegas.

404
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
We're at a party.

405
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Yeah.

406
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Okay.

407
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Yeah.

408
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Yeah.

409
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Yeah.

410
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Fine.

411
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Okay.

412
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
Great.

413
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Yeah.

414
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Very great.

415
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,640
I'm not doing a lot at night.

416
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,400
So I was just sitting around, you know, I'm always around.

417
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
What if I'm here?

418
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,160
All of a sudden you got a text like, you know, that thing we were joking about today, it's

419
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,720
real Jason's we're pulling up in front of your house.

420
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Get in.

421
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,720
Sounds like fun to me.

422
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,880
Uh, no, we was at a bachelor party.

423
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,400
Is it like eight years ago at this point?

424
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,000
Seven years, something seven or eight years ago, we all go to the bouncer and say like,

425
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:32,800
and show them a picture of Trixie and say, is there, do you guys have any like bears?

426
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Lady bears.

427
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,240
This is a weird, like, like, is it all humans here?

428
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
What's the deal with the.

429
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
Yeah.

430
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
Yeah.

431
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
I said, uh, just, just checking.

432
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,240
It's okay.

433
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,200
Well, we had a rat the other day, but that's just a separate issue.

434
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,840
No, but anthropomorphized at all.

435
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,240
It's a little human.

436
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,320
Would they put on a bow and like take off the bow, but not other clothes?

437
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Yeah.

438
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,160
So that sounds up our alley.

439
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,840
I have a burn seed.

440
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,440
It's just too much as I have a burn CD.

441
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,360
Do you take requests and also provided media?

442
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,640
Do you think the other guy, you guys play honky tonk here sometimes.

443
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,760
Is there a fiddle lying around?

444
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,960
I'm happy to, I'm no professional, but I'll try.

445
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,000
I'll try to do it myself.

446
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,320
From strip club discussion to the, the family den, the son bonnets family den.

447
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,560
They get, I don't think I knew now.

448
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,320
I'm glad I didn't know this recon.

449
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
I didn't know this either.

450
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,800
So that I could discover this.

451
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,640
I thought here, I thought it was just men's and women's, but in fact, um, that's good

452
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,520
information for me in the future.

453
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,340
Should I need the family den if I go with my family?

454
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:55,440
But all three son bonnets are, are pictured mid notes seemingly.

455
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,400
So now we know that these three, these three girl bears who get turned down on dates that

456
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,840
they also all go to the bathroom in the same room.

457
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,220
Well that is not that uncommon.

458
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,220
It's not.

459
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,160
Will that women go to the bathroom together?

460
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,360
But in like the same one, like at the same, well, I know I Jason, you're saying like

461
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,360
they'll get up together to go to the bathroom.

462
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:21,360
I don't think then they go to the same room sometimes in like toilets across from each

463
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,360
other.

464
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,360
I think some people do.

465
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,360
I don't know how common it is.

466
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
Yeah.

467
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,080
That also might be a young person's thing.

468
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,920
We're going to the bathroom together in the same conversation or gentlemen.

469
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,360
I feel like guys do it too.

470
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,360
Yeah.

471
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,560
I realized we've never all been to a strip club together.

472
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,560
Now I realized we haven't been to the bathroom together.

473
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,440
We mostly hang out at restaurants where like when we're going in the bathroom each year

474
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,160
and has its own tiny TV playing the game.

475
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,760
So we're focused on the game.

476
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,800
The big game, the big game.

477
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:57,280
But if we found out about a place that has a big TV bigger than what's in the bar and

478
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,000
we can all that we can all watch it from one stall that has three toilets.

479
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,720
Maybe have a little sidebar of like, Hey, you know, I want to have a little more privacy

480
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,280
than the big table watching the big game.

481
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,280
Right.

482
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,240
The big table watching the big game.

483
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
That's right.

484
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Home team versus away.

485
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,520
We invite out like we're going to go.

486
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
You want to go out?

487
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
We invite our significant others.

488
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,040
We're all going to go out to a bar and then we all disappear for 90 minutes.

489
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,960
Leaving them like, um, so do we need to go check?

490
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:35,120
What's a do we, does this wood ranch barbecue have that many?

491
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,520
That's the sports bar.

492
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,320
Does this BJ's have that many options?

493
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,880
Does wood ranch show games?

494
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,920
Wood ranch is a big like watch things on TV.

495
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,920
I think in the bar there's one television.

496
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
BJ's a little more.

497
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Yeah.

498
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
BJ's more Buffalo Wild Wings.

499
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,920
They're showing everything.

500
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
All day.

501
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
Yeah.

502
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Yeah.

503
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,800
So well they're showing the game if people don't request to watch the old footage of

504
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
jamborees.

505
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Yeah.

506
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,800
Past.

507
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,760
But again, you got to bring that separate recorded media.

508
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:13,280
Hey, could you put on that, um, that, uh, YouTube of, uh, some live aid performances?

509
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,920
I think the, I think the restaurant will get a kick out of it.

510
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
I agree.

511
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Yeah.

512
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,760
So, um, the sun bite, the sun bonnets need to adjust their bonnets, make sure they're

513
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,760
all straight.

514
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,840
Make sure the pose line up right at the bottom of the chin.

515
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,200
They can all go do that.

516
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Yep.

517
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,600
Um, and again, just nice to like, I'm just glad everybody's still around because otherwise,

518
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,960
you know, we can't be flying to Florida and Tokyo all the time.

519
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Right.

520
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,960
Only a lot of the time.

521
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
Right.

522
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,960
So you get a little bit.

523
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
Yeah.

524
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,960
And if we want to go see our friends above a door, we can.

525
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
Right.

526
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,880
And there's, this is so low impact right now that there's no reason for them to take the

527
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,480
signs down, which is nice.

528
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
Mm hmm.

529
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,640
You know, so there's like, why would they even just like, they don't need to put Pooh

530
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,900
Bear characters and change everything around.

531
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,600
Like that's who cares?

532
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Yeah.

533
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Yeah.

534
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,760
They can't be Kanga's room.

535
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,760
Right.

536
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,200
They can, like, she doesn't need that.

537
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
We know Kanga.

538
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Yeah.

539
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,760
Kanga's already in merch.

540
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,440
Um, she's like, she's covered.

541
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,560
The Sunbonnets need this.

542
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,240
Trixie needs, Trixie really needs this.

543
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,240
Trixie is sad.

544
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,240
Yes.

545
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,240
Very sad.

546
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,240
Yes.

547
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,240
They're often upset.

548
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,440
So this, this sign is all she's got.

549
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
Right.

550
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
So hopefully it'll be there forever.

551
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,000
Um, you know what I was going to say about GoMer?

552
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:38,760
It's going to be maybe, uh, a more, not restrained, but like, uh, uh, uh, comics, comic of musicians,

553
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
musicians.

554
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,480
It's like if someone, you had someone who's of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, who's your

555
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
favorite member.

556
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,600
It's surely there are people who go like, Oh, well, Graham Nash, you know, so he's not

557
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,840
Henry's not big gal, but it's like, Oh, GoMer.

558
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
Oh, interesting.

559
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
Interesting choice.

560
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,000
It's not solo work, but it's like a choir, like a Leon Russell or something.

561
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,960
You think Graham, Graham Nash is the least one popular one?

562
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
Is it?

563
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,880
Well, Crosby did a lot of solo work, right?

564
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
I see what you're saying.

565
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,600
It would be Stills or Nash, I guess.

566
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,520
I actually don't, I'm not trying to lead you into like, I think you're wrong.

567
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,160
I'm just thinking, I feel like Stills is the least popular.

568
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,040
It could be Stills, but didn't even, he had that stop look.

569
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
What's that sound?

570
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
That's kind of a...

571
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
That's true too.

572
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Yeah, I guess you're right.

573
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
I guess this is Nash.

574
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
There's not a lot of solo Nash.

575
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
But...

576
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,680
There's some solo Nash though.

577
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,600
I guess, yeah, but no, you know, I work with the Hollys too.

578
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
Yeah, right.

579
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,600
I mean, I think you like the Holley, but I don't know.

580
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,880
I don't think that's so crazy.

581
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,480
No, I don't think so either.

582
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,480
I was just thinking about it.

583
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,520
I was thinking in terms of like prominence and significance of musical body of work.

584
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:49,040
Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, Country Bear band and Five Bear Rugs.

585
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,040
The...

586
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,600
We didn't talk about, the Five Bear Rugs are sort of like a...

587
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,280
That's like the band a little bit within like...

588
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
Yeah, right.

589
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
Oh, sure.

590
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,760
They're their own entity.

591
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,880
They're separate stars.

592
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,200
It's a little bit like how the Eagles started backing up Linda Ronstadt and that became

593
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,440
their own thing.

594
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,680
It makes a lot of...

595
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,280
A lot of great musical dynamics are represented in the show, I think.

596
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,280
Got it.

597
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,280
Accurate ones.

598
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,280
So, yeah.

599
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,280
So, the other...

600
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:27,120
Now, I didn't even realize that this was a reference for a long time and it took the

601
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,760
Jambor Week to alert me to who this character was and I could be wrong, but there's the

602
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:40,600
main restroom sign in which a skunk's tail also serves as an arrow to point you to the

603
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,880
restrooms.

604
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,480
I just thought this was a generic skunk or maybe from like more of a fairy tale Disney

605
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,480
movie.

606
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,480
I forgot that this is in fact Randy the Skunk.

607
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,000
We know Randy now from talking about the vacation.

608
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Right.

609
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,880
Yes, I pulled that same picture.

610
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,520
Yeah, I also was like just kind of walked right by that.

611
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,120
And now nobody ever will again.

612
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,640
Next time you're in Disneyland and if people are rushing you over to Rise of the Resistance,

613
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,240
take a moment, take a breather, stop.

614
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,680
Tell them stop walking.

615
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,680
Look up.

616
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,560
That skunk is not a generic skunk.

617
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,840
That's Randy the Skunk.

618
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
That's Randy.

619
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Up, up, up, up, up, up.

620
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,360
Hold on, we gotta make one pit stop and I'm not talking about the bathrooms.

621
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,600
I'm talking about the sign for the bathrooms.

622
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,560
No, don't get a snack.

623
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
Don't get a snack.

624
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,280
Don't waste your, don't waste your goddamn money.

625
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,720
Not here.

626
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,040
I want to hear you say it.

627
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
Say hi, Randy.

628
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
Hi, Randy.

629
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
Hi, Randy.

630
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
All right.

631
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
Okay.

632
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,040
Now we can go on Rise.

633
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,440
If you're in the park while listening to this, make a video of yourself saying hi, Randy

634
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,440
under the sign.

635
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,720
Hi, Randy.

636
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,600
Show us pictures of your little squirts and videos of you saying hi, Randy.

637
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,400
That's your two homework assignments today.

638
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,600
Do not make any videos closer to the rest.

639
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,600
We are not responding, like we are not encouraging that.

640
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
No, no, no.

641
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
Not there.

642
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Not at Disneyland.

643
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,560
This is hella grand.

644
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:08,920
So that covers all of the character representation.

645
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,200
It's so nice to see these friends who don't get to play their music in Disneyland anymore,

646
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,880
but they do get to encourage people to keep their bowels flowing.

647
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
Exactly.

648
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,320
That said, now that we've said the character stuff, what else about the restrooms themselves?

649
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
All right.

650
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,520
Well, there are six stalls.

651
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,400
There are four tall urinals or one small urinal, three regular height sinks.

652
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,520
So that's what Oscar would use, the little bear Oscar.

653
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,520
Right.

654
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,760
And then one small, like a lower height sink.

655
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,200
And I think that's a good mix.

656
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,360
Sometimes like those are never too crowded at any time I've ever been there.

657
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,600
That's a nice amount, I think.

658
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,040
Sometimes there's a few that they're full, but it's never one where like you're waiting

659
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,040
in a long line.

660
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,560
I don't know if you guys disagree.

661
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,560
No, I don't.

662
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,880
I never think it's too crowded, even though that restaurant is pretty busy.

663
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,680
Usually a lot of tons of seating, tons of seating.

664
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,560
And then, you know, a lot of people coming off of Splash Mountain trying to dry off or

665
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:08,840
change and then and now you get people leaving or going to Galaxy's Edge.

666
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,840
Right.

667
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,280
And this is this is another thing to bring up about this place.

668
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:20,280
This is a place that you have avoided in your efforts to change your little socks in the

669
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,160
in the Splash Mountain log.

670
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,440
Because those we pointed out that those bathrooms are right there and you can easily go into

671
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,000
one of the six stalls.

672
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,280
Oh, is it six urinals or how many stalls?

673
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,280
I'm sorry.

674
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,280
Six stalls.

675
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,280
Hold on a second.

676
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
How would that work?

677
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,880
He would sit on the toilet and change his socks.

678
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,880
I would pull my pants down.

679
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,840
No, you don't have to do that.

680
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,600
Well, this was this all came out.

681
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,280
This was in the episode of Mary Holland a long time ago.

682
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,280
Yeah.

683
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
Yeah.

684
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:53,000
If you what we said was what you could do is just sit on any bench and make this change

685
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,560
and nobody would be alarmed.

686
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,720
But if you wanted some privacy in doing this, yes, you could go put the lid down like the

687
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,760
bathrooms are for doing private business.

688
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
That doesn't have to be taking a dump.

689
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,320
You could go in there and change your stand up and do it.

690
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,080
I could stand up and do it.

691
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,680
Yeah, you could absolutely do it standing.

692
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,360
I could also go to the bathroom and while I'm going to the bathroom, I could change

693
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
my socks.

694
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,360
Yes.

695
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:22,360
I mean, you might get a little like I was picturing standing that you're talking more

696
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,720
sitting going to the bathroom.

697
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,240
Yeah, I'm talking about sitting.

698
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
Yeah.

699
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,240
OK.

700
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,240
Yeah.

701
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,560
Because I think standing that would be hard while urinating also lifting your legs up

702
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,080
and changing your shoes.

703
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,080
Yes.

704
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,080
Might not work.

705
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,480
I also think I like how you said my changing my little size.

706
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,120
Changing your little socks in the little log.

707
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,120
Yeah.

708
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,120
Yes, that's true.

709
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,240
I hear log than other.

710
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,400
I had decided to.

711
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,080
Yeah, to do it quickly that way.

712
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,920
I mean, it is look the log position is the perfect way.

713
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
Perfect place.

714
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,560
Like you have so much access to your feet.

715
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,920
It's private, relatively private.

716
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,040
But you have so much access.

717
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,120
You have, I would say, more access to your feet in any other, if anything, that's walls

718
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
restricting you.

719
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,440
That's tiny of access.

720
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,600
I mean, you're right.

721
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,840
You're right.

722
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,720
But you're there's no position log like sitting down position in the bathroom that would look

723
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
right.

724
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
You couldn't get in that position.

725
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
Long the better you need.

726
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,280
Why do you log in a log position?

727
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,360
Because of your feet are so close to your arms and there's barely any reaching that

728
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,360
has to be done.

729
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,240
Oh, I see.

730
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,600
It's like it's more like being in like a lawn chair, like something lower.

731
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
Exactly.

732
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,600
The chairs we're in right now are more similar to toilet height, maybe a little higher.

733
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
Right.

734
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,080
But they're not log like in the sense that it would like half this half the height on

735
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,880
these chairs and they're a little more like the log.

736
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,880
I see.

737
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,640
Oh, you know, that actually helps me understand it a little better that you're lower.

738
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,800
Thus, your yes closer.

739
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,040
It's like right there.

740
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,320
That's why that's why even I think I've done this honestly only twice.

741
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,160
But this is why I had the thought because I was like my hands are right here because

742
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,880
I panic because I forgot the fruit.

743
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,680
Like when I went, oh, last time my socks got soaked, I went, you know what I could do?

744
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,680
I could quickly take them off right now, which I know it sounds weird, but that was just

745
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,040
because it was literally like my hands were like right there.

746
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,200
And I was like, well, it's something I can slip my shoe on.

747
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
I do.

748
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
I see what you're saying.

749
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
You're lower.

750
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
You're lower to the ground.

751
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,480
It's a very easy way to do.

752
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
Yeah.

753
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:28,440
But now that we've realized that these are the main ways that some of your favorite characters

754
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,000
live on, don't you think that it's a slight to go my own them go change your little socks

755
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
in Comers?

756
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,920
I owe the bears that to get to change my little socks, which I now I'm picturing like little

757
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,520
like booties or something that I'm wearing.

758
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
Uh, yes.

759
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,120
In the, in the gentleman's lair.

760
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,160
But yes, it would have to be in a stall because I would get some weird looks if it was anywhere

761
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:56,240
else where you wouldn't want to do it just in the bond, the general bathroom floor between

762
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,480
the journals in the sinks.

763
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,880
That's a no no for sure.

764
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Yeah.

765
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,400
I mean, this is the, the, look, people definitely, I've been called out for, for the, the log

766
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,400
stuff, but changing socks is we is kind of weird to do in public.

767
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
It is kind of weird.

768
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:17,680
Not if you're, if you're at the mall, maybe, but if you are next to the exit of a water

769
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,000
ride, well, the exit of water rides, I guess, okay, maybe it's the exit, maybe it's the

770
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,520
exit area cause people are soaked there so you can just blend in to all the other people.

771
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,520
Yeah.

772
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,640
There's a lot of like landscape, like stone walls, you know, that like sit on and, you

773
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,880
know, I just need to be more prepared in general.

774
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,360
I just need to have a better plan and then maybe it's in Gomer's.

775
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,400
I think that's, if you're after privacy, there's so much more privacy than you're on a ride

776
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:49,280
where there's security cameras watching you at all times.

777
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,840
Maybe the people in the log can't see it, but the employees who are standing and you're

778
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,640
well below them, they can see you.

779
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,920
There's a number of people, there's eyes in the sky watching you change.

780
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,920
I don't know.

781
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,960
Would I be arrested for doing it though?

782
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,720
Would Disney security come over to me?

783
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,720
No, absolutely.

784
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,600
Nothing is going to happen to you, but if you're just saying the I, you're saying the

785
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
I, yeah, yeah.

786
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
The I of right.

787
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Yeah.

788
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
Yeah.

789
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,840
Only you can answer this because it's a problem in your mind.

790
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,840
I see.

791
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,840
And I shouldn't tear it apart.

792
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,000
I already invented what you think is the perfect system for you.

793
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It is.

794
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,480
Look, I probably will never do it again, but it is a great system that works very well

795
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,480
actually.

796
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,800
I do think, but I probably will never do it again.

797
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,960
Don't you think though that maybe if you were, because sometimes we run into listeners in

798
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,080
the park, which is nice.

799
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,560
And if you were like, if we're in the line, right, and then somebody you're paired up

800
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,280
with another group who start to murmur like that's Mike from podcast, the right, and we're

801
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,080
about to get in the log with him.

802
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
He's got to do it, right?

803
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,080
I wonder if he's going to do it.

804
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,080
Yeah.

805
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,080
And then I lean back and.

806
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,080
Say the line, Bart.

807
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
Yes.

808
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,080
Yeah.

809
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
Well, then I guess it would be socks, Mike.

810
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,880
I would honestly have to charge them money for this fan experience.

811
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,920
I would have to, they would be thrilled.

812
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,520
You would lay it on, so you would start doing like a silent movie actor.

813
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,520
Like.

814
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

815
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,880
Like looking inside the sock.

816
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,880
It would be a hole.

817
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,880
Going into it.

818
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,880
Yeah.

819
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,880
Making a little P.U.

820
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,480
Yeah, no, it would be.

821
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,920
I would make a lot of a big meal out of it, basically.

822
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,040
Because it's something to consider, I think, maybe in a, again, if privacy is the issue,

823
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,840
I should not put you in this position, but you sitting down and doing a full, the full

824
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:33,840
Charlie Chaplin version of this at a live show, it wouldn't play for the podcast, right?

825
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,520
But that's a little special treat for if you come in person, you get to see like a five

826
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,120
minute rendition of Mike changes.

827
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,200
Because the real, because I imagine here, here's what I imagine.

828
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
Okay.

829
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,200
This is what you're picturing.

830
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,200
You're picturing like this foot off me, like putting my foot in the air.

831
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,320
And then I make like I go like, la la la la.

832
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,960
And then I like kind of pull the sock off and I'm like examining it under the thing

833
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,840
when it's much more like like I lifted this, you know, we just got to kind of take it off

834
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,480
like this and it's gone.

835
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,600
Like that's it.

836
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,040
It's such a quick motion.

837
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,360
Very discreet.

838
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,400
This is I mean, if Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford were doing this, this would be like

839
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,240
a box office like hit like after, you know, this is a few years after the train coming

840
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
right at the screen.

841
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,760
But they're like, America was like, yes.

842
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,760
Yeah.

843
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,160
Suck boy or sock man.

844
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,560
America is in love with sock boy.

845
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,080
Number one on the box office this weekend, the sock boy.

846
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,200
We're going to number two.

847
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,080
Woman sets a dinner table.

848
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,200
Now if you, I am filming this for potential use on the tour.

849
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,200
Okay, sure.

850
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,520
Like a physical comedy version of this that you might want to.

851
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,880
Oh, you want me to do a full?

852
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,920
Not a full, but just do one little.

853
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:53,440
What's like, if you take it off and then like the entertainer is like,

854
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:08,080
I like Mr. Rogers and throw it over here.

855
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,080
Great.

856
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
That's good.

857
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:16,880
And now to do the test, I go, excuse me.

858
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,240
Do you mind just gesture to your sock?

859
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,240
Oh yes.

860
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
I know what you're saying.

861
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,120
Take like a shoe worn out of my bag and I kind of pry the sock off.

862
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,920
Oh, it almost flails you back.

863
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,720
You're going to fly out of the log.

864
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
Whoa.

865
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,720
Whoa.

866
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,720
I grabbed like a lady's hat and it flies off.

867
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,640
The hat flies off and I have to catch that as well.

868
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,280
And then Jason looks her umphy.

869
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,120
Like what is happening on this ride?

870
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,120
Tsk, tsk.

871
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
This is a hit.

872
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,120
This is very good.

873
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:57,240
Our funny boys and all ships at sea resoundingly applaud the USO gangs sock boy.

874
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,200
World War I is one because of the morale boost that.

875
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:09,640
The Kaiser, the Kaiser cowardly waves a white flag as sock boy triumphantly changes his

876
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,480
knickerbockers.

877
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,760
We rely on comics to poke fun at the human experience.

878
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,080
There's nothing we can all relate to more than needing to change your sock on a log

879
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,640
ride.

880
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,640
Thank you.

881
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,640
Suck boy.

882
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,640
Suck boy makes this okay.

883
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,920
Just be yourself.

884
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
So yeah.

885
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,320
Well, I mean, I don't know what else to say from that.

886
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:42,560
I mean, that's like, you know, we got a physical comedy routine and I don't know, it's part

887
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,600
of the, it's an important part of the sector of the park, I suppose.

888
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Right.

889
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,960
Is, you know, without, with these bathrooms not there, certainly there'd be no choice

890
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,920
but to just do it in the log.

891
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,920
Exactly.

892
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,800
Well, I just have a throwback picture.

893
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,800
Of course in bear country, before they saw flipped to critter country baths had their

894
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,760
own little building labeled baths.

895
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,520
And I mean, this is archived on yesterland.

896
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:13,800
You can kind of see there's little signs and they look pretty similar to the ones at the

897
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,800
hungry bear restaurants.

898
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,200
It's hard to tell if they're the exact same signs.

899
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
Yeah.

900
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,320
But this you would see like right as you're coming into the land.

901
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,760
I do wish it was like a full bath house.

902
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,480
Like it'd be great to just bath house.

903
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,760
Like you could take a full bath at Disneyland.

904
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
That would have been a real thrill.

905
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,640
Was there, was there ever a time where you could take a full bath at Disneyland?

906
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:39,480
No, but at seaside resorts, there would be, there's still like, you know, public bathhouses

907
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
and stuff to change.

908
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,480
Like the Jersey Shore stuff.

909
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,480
You say bath houses, you mean literal bath house.

910
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,480
Like literal shower.

911
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
Like you rent a shower and stuff.

912
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,480
Right.

913
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,480
Jason and I have never been to a bath house together.

914
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,480
We've never been to a bath house.

915
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
I promise you Scott, we have never.

916
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,480
That's for Jason alone.

917
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,480
Jason goes to that alone.

918
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,280
And I'm not being on tour, if you like go to some national parks too, or like Joshua

919
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,240
Tree, like some of the general stores on the outskirts of the park.

920
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,240
You can take a bath in a general store?

921
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,200
You can rent, literally like baths in an adjacent building.

922
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Got it.

923
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,200
And you can rent, you know.

924
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,320
Well, I guess the truck stops and stuff you can take a shower.

925
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,480
There are those places too.

926
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,720
So you'd really want this Disneyland.

927
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,720
Yes he is.

928
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,720
You heard the man.

929
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,720
Well, I don't know.

930
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,720
A big old timey tub.

931
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,720
You could get in with a big wash.

932
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,720
It's a full service resort experience.

933
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,720
Yeah.

934
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,000
And he gets in with a big scrub brush and he gets in like, he either gets nude or gets

935
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,520
in the Scrooge McDuck bathing suit and he goes.

936
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,120
The scratchiest brush.

937
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,120
Yeah.

938
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,880
The most bitter thistles.

939
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,720
You know, if they want frontier land to be more like a frontier mining town, more like

940
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,120
Deadwood, you gotta offer some baths.

941
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,240
The way to get it into Westworld territory.

942
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,240
Yep.

943
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,720
You take a bath there.

944
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,720
Okay.

945
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,040
Well, that's our request, I guess.

946
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,120
It's Hungry Bear bathrooms, but not Hungry Bear bath houses.

947
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,120
Right.

948
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,120
And were this to exist?

949
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,120
Yeah.

950
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,400
And again, I'm not talking about anything untoward.

951
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,200
I'm simply talking about cleaning the filth off your body.

952
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,080
This feels a little untoward.

953
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,080
It feels untoward.

954
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,080
Okay.

955
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,960
I guess if you say it like maybe that was too literal.

956
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,560
That's the new phrase of the show also is untoward.

957
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,560
Untoward.

958
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,680
Bataroon untoward, Hasek, Vittles, you know.

959
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,040
Country Bear Jammer Week vocabulary guide.

960
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,280
But the main vocabulary to remember is hi, Randy.

961
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,280
Go say hi to Randy.

962
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,280
Hi, Randy.

963
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,280
Hi, Randy.

964
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,280
Next time you're passing by.

965
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,120
And I guess that'll do it.

966
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,120
That's this episode.

967
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,120
Yeah.

968
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,960
And we're heading to, unless we decide to add any more, I think now we're heading to

969
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,800
the end of Podcast the Rides Country Bear Jammer Week.

970
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,000
So we're on our way to the finale.

971
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,280
We'll see what surprises are in store.

972
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,800
But for now, you survived this episode about bathrooms.

973
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,040
I hope it didn't fog your glasses too much.

Yes.

And what else?

985
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,320
I guess hashtag bad little squirts.

986
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,760
Let us see a little squirts.

987
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,800
Maybe we'll talk about some of the best ones we see on tomorrow's finale.

988
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,200
Maybe we will.
