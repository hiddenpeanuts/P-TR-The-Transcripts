1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate where we begin our analysis of the Imagineering

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,560
Story and most importantly we begin mining Disney Plus for content. We've been so busy

4
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,040
we haven't gotten to use Disney Plus as an excuse to do a bunch of bullshit. Now we're

5
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,000
gonna do it. I'm Scott Garner, Jason Churin's here.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, I think this mine will lead to a very rich vein that will then, once we have mined

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
it, dried up immediately. Or not, I could be wrong.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hard to say.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah, I'm here. It depends if, I will say there's a low amount of parks content in general.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
There is. Yes.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,640
Per my general interests, I mean now that I've watched all of the Imagineering show

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,720
and I have like three episodes left to The Mandalorian, I was like, well, I don't know

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,000
if I'll log back into that again. Like, I don't know when I'll watch something on there

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
again.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Did anyone do the year? Did anyone pay for a year of Disney Plus?

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No, no, no, no.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Or five years or whatever the hell.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Three, it was three.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I get it for a year for free as a Verizon customer.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,520
Okay, good, good, good. That's good. I'm just month by month in it. I like month by month

22
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,000
in all of these streaming services. It's a little maddening, I guess, but now on iTunes

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
it's all control. You just like click buttons on and off and if there's nothing on HBO now,

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,920
why am I gonna pay for HBO?

25
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,280
There's no new content coming, no like major new content or new shows until fall. I think

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,560
Mandalorian season two will be the next like-

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
Wandavision?

28
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,560
Show.

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
Isn't that coming? Didn't that get bumped up?

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,120
It was, did it get bumped up this year?

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,880
To this year, I think.

32
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,520
Probably the fall though. That was gonna be next year. So yeah, maybe like, you know,

33
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,800
if it's, if I take six months off, that's fine. You save a little money.

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,640
Yeah, I think so. I actually had retired it and I brought it back to rewatch The Imagining

35
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,640
Story, which of course I watched every episode as soon as humanly possible and I really enjoyed

36
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,640
it and we'll talk about stuff that we liked.

37
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,880
I didn't watch six because I don't want to have, see the rise of the resistance.

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,800
Did you not watch any of six?

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
I have no, I have no-

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,600
Carly put the time code up.

41
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Carly Wazil was very-

42
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,720
And I stopped right at that.

43
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,040
Me too. You should do the same. You know what? It's also not that hard to figure out because

44
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,000
they do save it. So you're watching it, they get into Star Wars, they get into Millennium

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,440
Falcon and then it like shows the words rise of the resistance and then you know to shut

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,640
it off. You will not get bum rushed by anything.

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,520
ET says Michael, like he says it to me and to turn off-

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Trouble.

49
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Trouble.

50
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,240
I should say, did we say what we're doing yet?

51
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Yes, we did.

52
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Oh, we did. Okay.

53
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,640
We sure did. But I should say another thing.

54
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Yes, please.

55
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:08,680
Which, so here's an idea. As we said with Disney Plus open and streaming and teaming

56
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:19,480
content, we wanted you guys to customize our Disney Plus viewing experience. Here's, I'm

57
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,640
going to refer to the, I gave this the, what I want to do, a little catchy name. You know,

58
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,360
we talk about rides and how to plus them up, but now it's your chance to plus us up. So

59
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,800
plus us up is what we're going to do where you tell us to watch something on Disney Plus.

60
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,240
We're going to send out a tweet or respond to it, use hashtag plus us up and by popularity

61
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:49,680
or by bizarreness of entry, if we think something is so unique, well, we got to do that. Please

62
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,320
make us watch something on Disney Plus and then we will do a Patreon episode about it.

63
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,600
And that could be anything. If you want, if you just want us to watch, you know, Little

64
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,840
Mermaid and want to know what we really think about it, then great. If you, if it's, if

65
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,480
you want to make us watch an episode of that's so Raven, just some random thing in the Disney

66
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:17,640
channel archives. If you're really dying to hear what we think about Martin Lawrence's

67
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,320
college road trip or the cat from outer space, there's tons of weird shit on there and there

68
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:29,720
might be something odd that we haven't thought of. A Latter-day Simpsons even. Yeah, sure.

69
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:36,640
That is such a weird, like the Latter-day Simpsons is, is this 20 year desert. I don't know most

70
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,360
of what happened and there could be things that it's like completely surprised me. Like

71
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,600
they've been to Iran or something. I don't know. Very possible. They went and met that

72
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:54,080
guy. They went with Rick Steves. Rick Steves showed them the beauty. Rick Steves. How about

73
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,880
it? Huel Hauser must've been on the Simpsons. I think he was. He was. Yeah. Yes, he was.

74
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,920
He put a plane or yeah. Yeah. Because there was a Huel Hauser esque character. Yes. And then in

75
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,600
turn he, I see that's completely possible. Maybe Rick Steves. That's actually a good candidate.

76
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,640
If there's a true, if there's a Simpsons episode that you know about that we don't and that they're

77
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:22,440
like, you guys, you don't know this bizarre thing happened. Um, I, yeah. So the, uh, I don't know,

78
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,200
send us somewhere. Make us, uh, make us watch something. Um, anything you guys are curious

79
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,600
about or any like seeds you want to plant? Well, Mighty Ducks, obviously we've mentioned before.

80
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,360
Yeah. The cartoon. Mighty Ducks. The adventuring cartoon about, uh, uh, uh, ducks who live on a

81
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,600
planet where hockey is very popular and sort of a super team Power Rangers, X-Men esque super team

82
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:51,400
that use puck guns. Yeah. And it's a real Anaheim and Dennis Franz is in it. There's a real like

83
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,040
police chief of Anaheim. Ooh, I forgot about Mighty Ducks and I have flipped through there.

84
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,760
If you want to like make us a Mighty Ducks cocktail, if you're, if you know what's the

85
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,480
good on that show and you want to point us to a specific one or like give us a good gargoyle.

86
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,320
Yeah. Love gargoyles. I never really watched it. Oh, I liked it a lot. People loved it and people

87
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,960
still talk about it. So I would be interested to see if that holds up. I didn't really, although

88
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,800
gargoyles and like Transformers and to his extent, Mighty Ducks would get, give me anxiety

89
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,720
more so that I liked Power Rangers or like, you know, X-Men and Batman were all just doing

90
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,000
their jobs. I did not like the shows where they're like, they have to fight evil so they can get home

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,160
and I'm like, when are they ever going to get home? Why was they live in exile? Like that was too

92
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:46,120
like just existential. I just knew it in the background of like, Oh God, like, like the

93
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,360
Animaniacs just go on adventures. Great. Rocky and Bullwinkle go on adventures. You want to know at

94
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,600
the end of the day, it's all going to be okay, but there's not this acquist they may never fulfill.

95
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,080
I, you know, the X-Men were hated and feared by those they protected, but they had each other in

96
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,960
their hyper secure mansion. Gargoyles had, you know, had each other too. I guess that's true,

97
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,440
but I think if they're fucked in the daytime, they turn to stone when the sun comes up.

98
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,280
But that's just part of their life. I guess so. I'm just saying that I feel like you were

99
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,240
stressed about everything. You shouldn't be stressed about X-Men. Yeah. I say it really,

100
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,880
they had it rough. Yeah, but they had each, they had their, they were, they had their family.

101
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,440
They were, they all had powers and they were all hot. Yeah. Yeah. That's one of my favorite things.

102
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,480
Hot weird people. They were all hot. As Grant Morrison said, hot, weird, weird looking people.

103
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,200
Well, he made them a little, because with the Frank Whiteley art, they were all squiggly.

104
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,320
But yeah, they were just hot. And in the nineties, they were just hot. Jacked. Yeah.

105
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,720
A lot of pouches. They're all a gladiator, like American gladiator. Yes. Oh, they do. Yeah.

106
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,200
The female styles are kind of similar. A lot of big hair. Yes. Yes. Yeah. A lot of big hair.

107
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,040
Were you stressed out by American gladiators?

108
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,840
They don't win the Jouse. They might never get home. I didn't like when people did not complete

109
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:14,200
their tasks. Yeah. Or like got beaned by the tennis balls by like, got shot by a cannon.

110
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,120
So you, because then pyro, if he got beaned, might not go home. He might not make it home.

111
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,320
Well, no, the pyro, no, the gladiators were like the bad guys. Right. The regular,

112
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:31,240
right? No, you kind of had the regular people were challenging the gladiator. Like they had to face

113
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,000
the gladiators. So you were rooting for the regular people. Yes. You're, you were ideally rooting

114
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,760
for the regular. I hate to get off on a sidetrack here. Do we, did we see the Quibi

115
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,080
Legends of the Hidden Temple for adults show? Is it literally legends for the,

116
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,080
it's the, that's what it says. Legends of the Hidden Temple from Nickelodeon. That game show

117
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:54,920
is coming to Quibi, but adults are going to be playing instead of children. This is revolutionary.

118
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,840
Revolutionary. I'm sure people will like leap to see this and not just like watch two minutes and

119
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,360
then leave. You're right about that. I do want to be on it though. Being on it is a whole other

120
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,240
thing. Yeah. Scary though. Cause we've talked about the guards, the guards on Legends of the

121
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:18,840
Hidden Temple scaring all of us. Production shuts down. Yes. Production shuts down. Production shuts

122
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:25,320
down immediately after the first person cold cocks the guard. After a seven foot tall guy,

123
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:32,040
just sucker punches a guard. He just fell. He falls off that massive open set like,

124
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:38,680
yeah. And just barely misses the foam pit. Oh, if he'd just been one foot over. Oh God. The,

125
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,840
the guard. The guards have to wear a headgear and boxing gloves in case it happens from that point

126
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,360
on. The guards also, they're much like the Mandalorian raised that way in a religious

127
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,440
manner and can never remove the helmet. This is the way. This is the way. Yeah. They have

128
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,920
made the Lawrence that helmet. And then maybe will they ever make it home? Not if they get cold

129
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:10,120
cocked. No. So, Hey, yeah. Tell us what you want us to watch in Disney plus, plus us up. We'll send

130
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,200
a tweet and give you a place to respond to that, but also just, you know, send it to us. Hashtag

131
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,800
plus us up. Tell us what you want us to watch. Oh, I have one more example of an oddity. Do you want

132
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:26,040
us to watch adventures in babysitting from 2016? Because the real one isn't available on Disney

133
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:33,480
plus until 2021. And yeah, they made the card to say that that is, but there is a one from a couple

134
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,360
years ago. What are you talking about? Yeah, I don't know what that's some, some deal they had

135
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,240
previously, I guess they maybe thought that that was such a high profile movie. People would be

136
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,960
like furious unless they explained when it was coming. I don't know. That's my speculation.

137
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:55,320
I got to give you credit, Scott. It took me about, it's a very good hashtag and it only took me about

138
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,800
three minutes to figure out why you had chosen it. It was awesome. Disney plus. And I was like, wow,

139
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,040
he's been really optimistic that there's some gold there. And then I'm like, oh, the name of the

140
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,560
streaming. So got it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's not, it doesn't quite, I mean, also I could have

141
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,000
just said, make us watch something on Disney plus. That's what it is. That's really what it is.

142
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You use that hashtag too, but I'm just keeping it tidy. No, I think it's very good. So go ahead

143
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,520
and use that. But for today, we're going to talk about the thing that we, you know, had to watch

144
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:32,280
as soon as Disney plus is available. And that's the Imagineering story. Did you guys dig it in

145
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:39,880
general? Yeah, I mean, I did. I thought that it was, it's nicely put together. And I was impressed at

146
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:47,480
Disney at least like admitting like mistakes a little bit or showing slight. I mean, it's nothing

147
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,400
crazy, crazy, but just sort of like talking about like challenges and like on occasion, making

148
00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:00,200
themselves look a little bit bad or like, yeah, fun necessarily. But like you think of Disney is

149
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:07,160
just like so protective of their image and they were at least like acknowledging failures or when

150
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,920
they may be overstepped or whatever. Yeah. Certain things as the narrative that we've certainly

151
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,720
regarded as the narrative and like here now there's kind of this decay after Disney Paris

152
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,560
and it gets real, real cheapo around Disney studios, Paris and California adventure.

153
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:30,200
Superstar limo as the like nadir is cemented. Yeah. Really put this out there for lay people,

154
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,600
for people who aren't obsessed with this, like us, they really have like, this is the story

155
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,720
and this will forever be kind of the Canon story. It's an interesting story and one where they do

156
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:46,520
admit a bunch of faults. Yeah. There's a, there, there was a couple weird moments, more than a

157
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,840
couple, but less than I thought. Yes. I'll say that I thought Leslie Iwerks overall did a good job.

158
00:12:52,840 --> 00:13:00,120
Yeah. And she has like, she's part of a Disney lineage because her grandfather is a Biwerks who

159
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,320
designed Oswald the lucky rabbit and Mickey Mouse. Kind of a sidelined person Disney,

160
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:11,800
in the Disney story. Kind of screwed over. So it's cool that the family's like still part of it and

161
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:17,320
kind of that she gets to like, sort of like, you know, shine a light on their lineage, including

162
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,760
her father. Don Iwerks. Who's in the documentary. Yeah. And he, I see, I didn't know about him. So

163
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,760
that's good that she's got this platform to talk about it. Who is like, who got special academy

164
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,120
awards due to his contributions to film because circle vision seems very, like very much his

165
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:41,240
doing. Yeah. He seems cool. I, and she's cool. I liked the Pixar story not long ago, which has

166
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,520
been floating around Netflix for a long time and now I think is on Disney plus. I've not gotten to

167
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:52,280
watch her documentary about ILM, but that I bet that's good. She's, these are just like great,

168
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:58,120
clean. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Very accessible too. Like I would think that if you just are

169
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,720
like a casual fan of Disney, very slick, you would go on. Especially very slick. Yeah. I think you

170
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,800
would, it would be an easy watch and you would know what they're talking about. And it's not

171
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:15,000
impenetrable like this podcast. I think under the, the big thing story-wise that was interesting to

172
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,680
me is that Disney is simultaneously the hero and the villain in this because they make

173
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:29,880
Imagineering look like a real underdog, but the people kind of putting the weight on Imagineering

174
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:36,440
is just another branch of Disney. It's just the money men. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Or like executive

175
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:43,800
the taste. Yeah. The man upstairs, but that is, yeah, it is Disney. I, yeah, it's fascinating and

176
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,320
interesting to see both sides of the Eisner coin. That's what I think makes him such a compelling

177
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,360
character. There were the good years and the bad years. And, uh, uh, and where, you know, I've,

178
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,880
I've certainly seen the complaint about I, uh, Iger's, uh, presence in these documents where he's,

179
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:05,800
it's just sort of like, and then in the end, finally the great dependable CEO did everything

180
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:14,440
perfect. What? I mean, I, I, Izer shows up about halfway through and I have to give him credit

181
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:22,200
because he looks like a human being and he stands like a human. He's like laughing in photos. He's

182
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:28,120
like slouchy. It looks casual. His hair is messed up in photos. His hair is messed up. And I mean,

183
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,680
Iger, there's some shots where it's like, man, did you start your undershirt? What is going on?

184
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:38,520
Relax a little. You're on mainstream. You're like, he has the posture of David Copperfield

185
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:44,920
robotically doing his show over and over again. Perhaps wearing a back brace is what we've had.

186
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:51,720
Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Human shoulder, like a rubber, like what? Like a superhero. Yeah. Under his,

187
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:58,760
the George Michael from arrested development muscle. Yes. Yeah. Uh, Iger is the first voice

188
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:04,360
you hear in the, he's the first person. Maybe Angela Bassett narrating before that, but the first

189
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:10,360
interview is Robert Iger, which is a kind of an interesting note to sure start on to have not

190
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,640
an imagineer, but I think we're probably getting to the heart of this is like it was approved by

191
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,960
Iger because they never said anything bad about him. And like, they mean other people in charge

192
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:28,120
look bad. So he's like, yeah, this is good. I like the more of that. The only thing I wanted to say

193
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,240
about the, I don't know a ton about like the making of this thing, except that it's been going

194
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,440
for a long time. Yeah. I think it was supposed to be a feature. I think they were not planning on

195
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:44,760
having it be this long. Yeah. Which, so they were, yeah. Working on it since 2013 sort of with like

196
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:50,760
no exact what it'll be in mind. And then the streaming service becomes clear and that's the

197
00:16:50,760 --> 00:17:00,120
perfect home for it. And apparently the notes from Disney plus in shifting it to that format

198
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:06,760
were about character making, highlighting characters. And I think all of these things

199
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:13,640
that I'm sure we will say we really enjoyed watching Bob Gurr go through the Matterhorn,

200
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,680
watching Tony go through his many rides and how great does he look in this, that episode. It's

201
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,960
just like another one, another one, another one. But I think all of those moments were more recently

202
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:34,040
done. And that's kind of cool that a note that notes can be annoying, but I think that note led

203
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,280
to some of the like real heart of this show and some of the more interesting stuff. Yeah. It's

204
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:45,000
interesting because it seems like from what I read, Disney plus exists because in 2015,

205
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:54,840
the cable revenue dropped. ESPN. ESPN like dropped a lot. Yeah. And Netflix was doing well

206
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:04,040
and HBO go or HBO now. Quibi's on the horizon. Yes. The rumbling. The rumble of the distance.

207
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,400
The Legend of the Hidden Temple on Quibi. When they heard, when it was just Katzenberg,

208
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,680
that's one thing. But when they heard Meg Whitman was involved, like, oh God, oh God,

209
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,240
we need a streaming service stat. The printer lady, the woman who tanked the printer company.

210
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,600
Failed governor candidate. Failed gubernatorial candidate. Is going to make shows for 12 year olds?

211
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:31,640
Hurry. Open a new line of business. Yeah. So I don't know. It's good. I think like imagine

212
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,080
this would be, I think too much for a feature. I think so unless it was like split into two

213
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,360
movies. Yeah. I mean, I can see a super streamlined version with, yeah, without that stuff you're

214
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,840
talking about, which make it even better. But yeah, I think a lot of the imagineers

215
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:54,040
that they highlight come off very endearing. Yeah. Yeah. And I really liked, especially in the first

216
00:18:54,040 --> 00:19:00,840
episode and the second episode too, a lot, it really highlights a lot of the people who are,

217
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,360
there's some people, Bob Gurr, Raleigh, Roley Crump, I'll never get that right,

218
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,760
still with us. But a lot of the people have, Mary Blair, Mark Davis have passed away.

219
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,760
Well, even Marty Sklar, who's interviewed, has passed away. But he's all over this thing.

220
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:22,280
Yeah. They get some great, great stuff with him. So the first episode, still a lot of Walt.

221
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,640
Walt is still alive and a lot of what they're covering because they're covering from the

222
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,560
initial genesis of the idea for Disneyland. And I'll say this, the weirdest part of the series

223
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:40,520
happens to me in the first one, which is the Angela Bassett narration. By the end of World War

224
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:47,960
II, Walt grew tired of fighting labor unions and the rising costs of animation. That is the worst

225
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,480
myth making in this whole documentary because the animator's strike, skip that, that was so odd.

226
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:00,600
And it was funny when the two sentences later she refers to Walt developed eccentric hobbies.

227
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,400
Jason talks about unions and Mike has to turn the volume down.

228
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,120
You were blowing those speakers and levels out.

229
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,120
Sorry. No, it's good. You care.

230
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,800
The animator's strike lasted five weeks. It wasn't that long. It was five weeks.

231
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,320
And this was- Writers haven't had agents for nine months now.

232
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:17,880
For nine. Yeah.

233
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,000
It may never again.

234
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,760
But this first episode, it was a good reminder that there is Walt Disney the man and Walt Disney

235
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:32,040
the character that the company owns because this is Walt Disney the character. They did not feature

236
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:38,200
Walt Disney the man who described the writer's strike as having cleaned house at our studio

237
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,600
of the chip on the shoulder boys and the world owes me a living, lads.

238
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,280
Jesus, really?

239
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,680
Yeah.

240
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,640
Oh no.

241
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:52,200
And also a lot of those people that cleaned house of came back eventually, but he took it

242
00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:01,400
as like hurt feelings. He thought it was a family and never trust an executive who calls

243
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,320
something a family. When the Imagineers describe the environment as familiar,

244
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,040
familial, I believe that.

245
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,680
Yeah.

246
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,920
But when executives say like, we're a family here, they are trying to screw you.

247
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,840
All of this is so complicated. I mean, one of the reasons animation costs so much

248
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:22,920
is because a lot of Disney animators joined the war effort and Disney started making war

249
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,080
film. It was complicated.

250
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,360
That saved the company.

251
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:32,520
That saved the company because he had spent all of the Snow White money building a state of the art

252
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,440
film campus in Burbank.

253
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:47,160
Yeah. I'm very interested in that line about fighting labor unions getting left in the movie.

254
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,080
I don't think that's an accident.

255
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,320
No.

256
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:56,200
That's like in there. If they didn't like that in 2019 or 2020, that would be gone.

257
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:04,280
There's no reason to put it in. There's no reason to even highlight a negative part of

258
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:10,360
Walt's history. They don't need to do it. They don't like to do it. So either it's bizarre.

259
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,760
It's so bizarre. They must just not think that's a bad thing is what I'm saying.

260
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:20,600
At the very least, they must just go, oh, yes, he was fighting with labor unions and that was

261
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,640
being portrayed as if that was one of the great struggles of his life.

262
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,320
That like a noble effort.

263
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,840
They must just think of that.

264
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,640
For five tough weeks until the National Labor Relations Board were like, just sign the

265
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:38,360
fucking contract. It was the FDR's administration, so they were reasonably pro worker.

266
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,240
Yeah.

267
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,400
But it was just bizarre.

268
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,080
It's bizarre on a couple levels.

269
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:44,920
In that.

270
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:52,840
There's a couple of like little reckonings they have to do with, like little nods. They do describe

271
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,200
Song of the South as an old problematic film.

272
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,520
Yes.

273
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,440
And as I think we've said before, EO comes up and they don't say the name.

274
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
They don't say Michael Jackson's name.

275
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:04,680
Right.

276
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,440
Just like, let's get it. They acknowledge it.

277
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:08,680
Right.

278
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,880
First 3D movie.

279
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,920
First 3D movie.

280
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,880
Good done. And also, but also with sort of events rearranged because it was before Star

281
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,960
Tours. It led the way to Star Tours, not the other way around. And they presented as like,

282
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,720
it's the aftermath of Star Tours.

283
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:21,960
Right.

284
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,480
They jump around a little bit.

285
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:29,880
Now, while that's a difficult situation they're in, I think they landed in a good place because

286
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,080
we didn't have to meditate. They didn't have to go on about Michael Jackson being great,

287
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,880
but we also got to see a cool picture of those robots and ID and stuff.

288
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,560
So I got my picture. We didn't praise a bad guy and it's good.

289
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,440
Yeah.

290
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,600
I will say something funny in this early portion, when everyone's skeptical of Walt,

291
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:58,760
is how much it was taken as a given by his friends and family that everyone hates carnivals.

292
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,280
Those places are so dirty and the workers are so unfriendly.

293
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,600
The consensus amongst society in the late 40s, early 50s were like, fuck carnivals.

294
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,640
They all cough up oil on you while you're on the ride.

295
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:20,440
Bumper cars all break your spine. And then the carny spit in your face when you ask them

296
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:20,840
for help.

297
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,600
Just that is kind of portrayed universally as like, no, this sucks.

298
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,720
Yeah. I mean, that's, that is-

299
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,080
It tastes like gas.

300
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,680
In anything, any biography I've read about Walt Disney, it's always like,

301
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:41,160
he hated taking his daughters to the carnival. He wished, like, he was just like disgusted with,

302
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,120
like, just a Ferris wheel and a carousel.

303
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,240
I mean, when you see those Coney Island rides, like the, like just slides that are bumping

304
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:56,440
people in full suits around, like just like maiming people in like full gowns and hats.

305
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:56,920
Yeah.

306
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,840
It doesn't seem like the greatest scene.

307
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,400
I don't disagree. It is just funny. Cause as a kid though, I liked the carnival.

308
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:03,960
I, I-

309
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,440
Sure.

310
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,560
But we don't know carnivals in the 40s.

311
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,280
That's true.

312
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:13,160
Well, but even in the 90s, like you weren't opening your pocketbook for that trip. Like

313
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,680
carnivals have always been inflated in price and stuff to make profit.

314
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,720
I'm just saying like, I guess it was from Walt's perspective.

315
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,840
I like Disneyland. That he kept from carnivals.

316
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,800
He liked one thing.

317
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,760
That he kept off charge.

318
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,680
I'm just saying from a kid's perspective, I knew, I, we knew it was funny. We knew that,

319
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,160
like, it was funny that this thing got set up overnight and that, like, it looked like

320
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,840
shit, but there were rides we liked.

321
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,480
Yeah, sure.

322
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,320
I liked the Tilt-A-Whirl.

323
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,240
You know, it was nice to hear the story. I don't know if you guys have heard the story before,

324
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,760
where Walt goes to the merry-go-round and he's with his two daughters and it's daddy daughter

325
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,160
day.

326
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,560
Right, right.

327
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,320
Again, perfect myth-making. Perfect character development.

328
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:53,800
Yes, yes.

329
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,760
It's the most used footage of all time.

330
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,920
And to that end, while of course these things come up and I roll my eyes because I've seen

331
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:06,520
them a zillion times, I like that episode one is the Walt era and that's it.

332
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,480
Because this is the stuff I, I mean, this is me. I've been watching specials about this

333
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,000
forever and ever my whole life. So I just, I didn't want to rehash all the same things.

334
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,440
I really like that pretty quick. We're off to Tony in the 80s. We're off to the weird decay

335
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,000
and what happened with California Adventure. We're looking at Disney Sea,

336
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,960
looking at the stuff they just did. I like that they like move through time pretty quick.

337
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,240
I didn't think that would be the case. I also didn't think that would be the case. It's like,

338
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,880
I don't want to spoil the movie Executive Decision, but they kill off Steven Seagal

339
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,960
very early in that movie. And it's very surprising because I didn't think he was

340
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,880
going to go that quick because he's a big star. And it's the same thing where Walt dies at the

341
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,760
end of right at the end of the number one of the first one, essentially. And he's out of there.

342
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,600
Genuinely in psycho. What's Kurt Russell going to do when he's on this plane with his crew?

343
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:01,880
Yeah. Kurt Russell also in this show briefly in this. Yeah, I guess that's a thing. My brain

344
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,600
immediately was there's so many streaming services now. I'm like, what is Executive Decision? What

345
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:12,520
is that? I haven't seen it in a while. It's from the like 97. Have you seen it? No, but I immediately

346
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:19,960
it's like terrorists on a plane. I'm sure probably like Air Force One, but they like it's not like,

347
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,280
is it British terrorists? Cause that's okay. You can have British. I don't think it's British.

348
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:32,600
They were really forward thinking by having it be wrong, but I heard I remember. I loved it.

349
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,920
Big reoccurring thing in this series. Every episode does end on a cliffhanger except the

350
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:42,040
last one. Actually, I don't. Well, I won't spoil that. Oh, I don't know how the last one ends.

351
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,440
Oh, it's a cliffhanger for us. For us. Yeah. What's funny is as much as we're complaining about all

352
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,760
this Walt stuff and the myth making or whatever, there'll be a couple of times where I'm still

353
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:56,120
like sucked into like the cartoon version of Walt that I grew up in my mind with. Yeah. That guy is

354
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:02,360
real. I think he's a complicated person. Yeah. I think Steve Jobs complicated man. I am also

355
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:10,760
and I don't, I'm also got this story of like Roy, like Roy, you know, like lethal weapon where

356
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:18,120
Murtaugh wants to retire and or really I find Roy is very endearing. He never gets. He's like,

357
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:23,480
I'm out of here. And then Walt dies and he's like, I won't retire. I must finish my brothers like out

358
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,520
of tribute. Like there's something so moving about it. I don't know what kind of guy Roy was,

359
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:34,760
honestly, but that always gets me. I was like, Oh God, he just wanted to settle down. It was a life

360
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:42,680
of stress for Roy. And then by the story of Roy. Well, I do think, yeah, I was wondering what it

361
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,960
is like to live in the shadow of your sibling. Like I've heard Roy, I feel like rarely got the credit.

362
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,960
I've heard some bad stuff about Roy's kid, Roy, but I don't know much about Roy other than he's

363
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,160
just constantly stressed out. Walt is making like we're doing this and he said, I don't know where

364
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,320
we're going to get the money for this. They're constantly on the brink of bankruptcy. It's a

365
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:11,480
literally like a life of stress because like in my kid brain, Mike Carlson sees a patron.

366
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:18,120
I'm like Roy. Yeah. I'm like the original. So they say the, the Genesis of Disneyland, someone says

367
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:23,240
if it hadn't worked, it would have been the end of the Disney empire. Like they put everything on

368
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:28,600
the line for this. There's a couple versions of that too, even with like movies and you,

369
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,200
yeah, absolutely. They made Snow White and then it was smooth sailing and it was not.

370
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,600
Well, I do wonder what is the point in the company history where you that,

371
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,280
I mean, cause they were having financial issues through the eighties and stuff. When does that

372
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:46,040
start to become not true? Is it after the, the boom of the nineties where it's like, this could be the

373
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,840
end of us. Like, cause that just won't happen now. Well, they've got to be, well, cause the, I mean,

374
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:56,840
the parks obviously struggled through the nineties, but the, but the, but films were taking off,

375
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,360
like then you're in golden era animation that Eisner era it like seemed to like said it,

376
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,920
obviously there was turmoil past that, but it was never like, well, this just won't be a company

377
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:14,680
anymore. There were those rumors of like Comcast buys it and then, and what's the other thing that

378
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,200
they almost lost Pixar. Yes. Yes. So there was that. That was very contentious. But still all of that

379
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,560
isn't like the company doesn't exist. Right. Right. I mean, but there's, it's funny cause like it's

380
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:30,760
now it feels like such an impossibility that it could go away. Yeah. But I mean, stuff like 10

381
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:37,400
years pass and some stuff happened changes. I mean, an aggressive, an unfriendly administration and

382
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,440
an aggressive federal trade commission could break up some of these larger entertainment companies.

383
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:49,160
Hey, let's do it. I mean, let's do it. We would forgo some Disney fun for to make

384
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:56,520
um, companies professionalize a little smoother. Should be broken up. All of them. Anyway,

385
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:02,280
uh, I love, you know, they, they of course more myth making about like the opening day chaos,

386
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:07,400
but I hadn't really heard the stories before of, uh, people kind of fucking each other up to ride

387
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,760
Autopia, like people pulling each other out of cars and then taking the car to drive themselves

388
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:17,720
before Autopia was on a track. Well, there's, there's the guy, there's the stories of the

389
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,600
ladders over the, I don't know how true those are. You, somebody would like charge you a nickel to

390
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,680
climb your ladder to get into Disneyland. Oh yeah. Yeah. I think they talk about that. Well,

391
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,800
there was a counterfeit tickets to the opening day. Then people dispute how much that happened.

392
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:37,080
Yeah. All these, there's another, all these myths about exactly what chaos happened. Yeah. In the

393
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:44,680
first day in weeks. Um, but yeah, they try, they, they, uh, they, uh, address a little bit of it.

394
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,680
All of the costume characters on opening day were people sneaking in. They,

395
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:53,080
Disney had not hired any of those and then it gave them the idea. Right. Let's have like a Mickey

396
00:31:53,080 --> 00:32:01,080
Mouse guy. Three Mickey mouses just walked out. They all look different. Why is that 20 guys dressed

397
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:09,960
like the president? The president walker. Uh, and he had to choose between, uh, drinking water

398
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,800
and toilets. I think I'd heard that drinking water and toilets is very, yeah. Yeah. They do like the,

399
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:22,520
like the cement is cement drying people's like heels getting stuck in cement. That's kind of,

400
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:28,840
uh, renewed in this. Is it Disney world? Is it the magic kingdom? The next step of it where they are

401
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:37,000
using helicopters hovering to dry cement. That's a really good advancement of the cement. This

402
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,760
thing wasn't denying a month ago. Oh yeah. Oh no. Oh no. Flew straight here.

403
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,200
Trying to keep track of what's happening in the world. Every, every time they mentioned a year,

404
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,720
trying to think about what was going on in the world at the time is very interesting through

405
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,560
this documentary. Cause I feel like that's a thing I think about doing the podcast a lot

406
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:04,600
and they tangentially bring it up. Certainly in later episodes. There, uh, yeah, there was one part,

407
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,280
it does feel like, I mean, if it's a documentary about the sixties, you have to have,

408
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,200
but with Vietnam and Watergate and, but I think in this case, they seemed to, I think is it my

409
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,360
memory, right? That they frame Vietnam and Watergate as that's why they needed to get the haunted

410
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:24,360
mansion open ASAP. Cause any sixties documentary, you have to have your little quick helicopter

411
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:34,920
in a wide room. Um, which Joker uses by the way, that song in a movie still, still today.

412
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:41,400
And then we're going to call it wildly, wildly original film anyway. Well, how about credence

413
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:49,240
may pull a credence in there. Um, uh, Bob Gerr, we had said his chunk very endearing, um, where he

414
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:54,360
signs the Matterhorn. I also like him talking about, uh, designing physics, like learning.

415
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,080
He knew how to build vehicles, but then he had to learn trigonometry to figure out the physics of

416
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:06,680
the Matterhorn. That's insane. That would just never happen nowadays. They would, yeah, they would

417
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:14,280
have that person draw up the theoretical design and then have scientists or engineers come in

418
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:20,920
and finish it off. Yes. Yeah. You know, machines, you know, put a hair like weird, uh, the machine

419
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,960
like, uh, uses gravity and that zillions of people get on every day. Uh, Tony Baxter says

420
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,760
at one point in the thing, the, like the, the, all the kooks they hired originally would not be

421
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,800
hired in the current atmosphere because you have to get experts to do things and not this like crazy

422
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:43,560
band of misfits. They were like the original SNL people. Um, just as much cocaine, I'm sure.

423
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:53,560
In 1955, they didn't really go into the substance of future shoes of like who was like, man, we were

424
00:34:53,560 --> 00:35:00,760
staying up all night to complete the tea cup redo. I was going to say there for sure are,

425
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:08,280
uh, like a 90 minute specials on each ride. Like there's, they could, they could easily expand this

426
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,160
whole thing and maybe if the ratings are good, they will. Do you think that might infringe on

427
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,280
what we're doing? Do you think they'll go off on long tangents about McGruff though in the 90

428
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:27,960
minutes? Yeah. That's what you come here for. That's the difference. I think. Yeah. Um, but yeah,

429
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,600
that Matterhorn sequence is really nice. Uh, yeah. Watch it. Just like, you know, it was really cool

430
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:39,080
is watching Bob Gurr like just walk into the Matterhorn with the familiarity of norm walking

431
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:45,720
into cheers. Yeah. Of course I know. Yes. Here's the door and I walk up and there's the, you know,

432
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,200
there's the basketball place and the basketball court we've heard wasn't remarkable and boy,

433
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:56,360
is it not. Yeah, boy. It's just a hoop. It's just a hoop cause I think storage shed up there.

434
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,600
Initially when I heard it was like, there's a basketball court in the Matterhorn and I was like,

435
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:09,000
holy shit, a court. I actually thought that it was like a secret, like pro level place where like

436
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,920
magic would secretly practice. That is actually what I thought when I was, I didn't think that

437
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,320
far into it, but I think I sort of thought, I thought at least it was like a half court

438
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,000
and like had, you know, a real nice floor and lines. And yeah, I actually, yeah, it was a little

439
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,320
misrepresented to that mythology appear. People really built that up. Look either through balls

440
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,880
in a hoop or you read a paperback book and that was your options to entertain yourself in between

441
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,800
your job and your breaks back then. If you were in your mountain climbing. Yeah. And your

442
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,920
mountain climbing. All right. Time to go back to climbing this mountain. So, but I mean, it was

443
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,440
great to see it. I'd still like to go in there. I would still love an invitation. Sure. They also

444
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,000
like, don't shoot a lot of high definition footage of like, this is what the inside of this ride

445
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,920
looks like. That's true too. This is the grease stained dirty inside of the, yeah, really ride.

446
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,840
I know that's super cool. Uh, yeah. And I'd also like to say just all of the like restored film.

447
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,200
There's like, yeah, there's one movie, I forget the name of it, but it's like, it seemed like

448
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:16,760
just a very basic made in 56. We're just going to show Disneyland on nice looking film and it looks

449
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,240
so beautiful. This documentary is full of things that we've seen before, but seeing them cleaned

450
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:26,760
up and color corrected and looking sharp is just as, yeah, for a Disney nerd to look at some, a lot

451
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:32,680
of beautiful Disney footage was great. Yeah. Uh, world's fair in this, in the first chapter

452
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,680
comes to the world's fair stuff. Um, you know what I don't think I, you know what I think I was

453
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:42,360
disconnected from was that that ride that was it called the magic skyway with the Cadillac cars?

454
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:47,560
Yeah. Or it was four Mustangs or Mustang. And I don't think I knew that. I don't think I realized

455
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:53,960
that because, um, okay. So the, now when you go through the, uh, the primeval world, the dinosaurs

456
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,440
and the train at Disneyland, uh, how that was presented in the world's fair was you would drive

457
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,920
Ford Mustangs through a building and go see dinosaurs. I guess I knew that, but it didn't,

458
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,040
it didn't click with me. So watching footage of a bunch of old sixties Fords, that's, it's,

459
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:15,640
that's great. That's a kooky ride. Yeah. Not preserved. Like everything else picked up and

460
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:23,240
brought here the Ford Mustangs, just not the Ford didn't want to keep doing stuff. Just didn't want

461
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:29,480
to keep doing stuff where Disney just didn't want a giant car commercial constantly through his park.

462
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,960
Not told test track. I mean, tower, the four winds also just demolished, not preserved.

463
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,560
Yeah. So not everything, man, but I, I don't, I kind of wish just like you could still ride old

464
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:49,160
six. So today you pitch that ride sixties cars that take you to dinosaurs. It was sure it would

465
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:55,480
be like if they built a ride on the water outside the boathouse in Orlando with those hydro cars.

466
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:01,240
Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah, that's got a retro player. Yeah. Yeah. That'd be cool. Um, another

467
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:08,120
thing that hadn't really clicked with me, uh, is that, um, you, you don't know who came to what

468
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:13,000
department when, and we know about John Hinch and we know that John Hinch was like, uh, sort of the,

469
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,440
the comedy and character guy. Uh, and he, but he was still animating through the fifties. So not

470
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:28,280
till the like early sixties, did he move over to imagineering and, um, I didn't know, we've never

471
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,720
done a jungle cruise episode. So I don't know about different phases of jungle cruise. And I

472
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,280
didn't know that certain scenes were not there. And it seems that you would call funnier scenes

473
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:42,920
were his doing in the early six. Like some of the first things he did were, uh, the, uh, all the,

474
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,080
the, like the, the hunter and all tribes people like on the tone of polio, like,

475
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:57,560
they really credit him. I think Hinch was walking through the trend. I think he might be mixing up.

476
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,520
I think Mark Davis is the humor guy because I thought Hinch was like showing them how to

477
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,320
plow the trenches of jungle cruise. Like I think he was involved pretty early on.

478
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,000
I don't know. I have this all under John Hinch, but I could be wrong. But either way, I guess,

479
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,560
like, I didn't know that there was this, what the other thing is the elephant pool, there was, uh,

480
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:20,840
I think the jungle cruise was a very serious ride and maybe the skippers had started making jokes,

481
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,640
but I didn't know about this level of like early sixties redo where we added some comedy. And

482
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,880
that's kind of, I bet it seems like it was, it was probably an exciting ride when it first opened,

483
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,400
probably kind of dreary to just like, go seriously look at robots and none of it is silly.

484
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,920
Well, the four original lands had direct parallels by like Disney's, Disney's animated

485
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:47,960
films and fantasy land. And then his future films in tomorrow land, his, uh, David Crockett stuff

486
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,880
in frontier land, and then his nature stuff in adventure land. Like it's like a one-to-one

487
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,200
comparison and it's only as like the park developed in the first decade, it kind of

488
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,600
more took on its own identity. Sure. It wasn't just like, yeah, let's look at what you would

489
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:07,880
see on the show, but in physical space for it. Um, but I, yeah, I mean, things like that are

490
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,520
always, we're all good to just like a little reminders of this is why this is what this is.

491
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:18,040
Another big one, I forgot why audio animatronics is audio. You feel like it does phrase as a

492
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:23,240
lifelong Disney nerd, that phrase just rolls off your tongue. I forgot audio was a crucial

493
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:29,640
component and that they're all synced up to audio discs. Is it like, they also refer to scalloped

494
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:36,360
edge discs and that's how all these things move. Uh, like, yeah, these just like bizarre record

495
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:41,160
contraptions and that it's all like beeps and audio signals that make them work. Right. Um,

496
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,960
yeah, I guess, I mean, audio, I just, yeah, audio animatronics, like, oh yeah, they talk.

497
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,480
That's what I always thought. I guess that's what is what it means, but I never,

498
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:55,240
I never remember that it's like, is what it's about. I mean, I don't think it's not discs anymore,

499
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:00,280
right? There's gotta be some sort of digital, but some of them might still go off of how they were

500
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:08,360
probably. Yeah. I can only imagine a pain in the ass. Do I get with analog technology to restore

501
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:15,720
old, yeah, just brutal. Yeah. Cause if you don't have the audio sync, you just have them clicking.

502
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:20,200
You forget how loud the clicks are. I mean, in the Tiki room, you hear the clicks. Sure. Yes.

503
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:26,600
Yeah. But it's the first one. So you forgive it. Um, you hear all the clicks with Marty scar

504
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,920
talking to us in pirates. That's a very charming moment. That's, that's a really nice little scene

505
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:38,760
there. So pirates in this, they do go out of order. Like it is, there's one or two moments where it's

506
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:46,120
like, oh, they kind of break the linear structure in order to get the ending. Sometimes this one,

507
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:51,160
most noticeable cause they talk about pirates and then they talk about Walt's death in reality. I

508
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:57,080
believe six months apart the other way, but frame it as like his last accomplishment. Yes.

509
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:05,960
That and buying the starting the Florida project. Not the film, but the, no, not the years before

510
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:14,360
darling. But yeah, how tidy is that? They get rid of there. We're out of wall. We're out of the stuff

511
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,200
we know really well. And we're looking at, cause, cause the construction of Disney world and

512
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:25,640
everything is really fascinating. Um, just that it's like truly what swamps it all was. And, uh,

513
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:31,640
I bet a lot of people don't know about those tunnels. Um, that's good like stuff for, uh,

514
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,320
to find out about. And then I was trash can't like, not, uh, uh, that there's like trash

515
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:43,160
centers that are all pneumatic tubes that run through. I was, I, I had saw a friend over the

516
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,240
break that I haven't seen in a couple of years and I saw her parents who I haven't seen in

517
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:53,960
15 years, maybe, uh, or maybe like, I don't remember 12. Uh, and I w that was explaining

518
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:00,520
the podcast as you have to do to friends and family sometimes. And, uh, and he, her dad goes,

519
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,680
he goes, you know what I'd like to do with Disneyland? He goes, I want to go in those

520
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,560
tunnels. Yeah. I go, well, the tunnels aren't really, they're more pro like there's a few

521
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,800
things maybe at Disneyland, but it's mostly a Disney world. You're thinking of that a full like

522
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,680
tunnel systems. He's like, oh, okay. So like the tunnels are out there at the very least. I feel

523
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,080
like I I've known about the tunnels for a long time. I feel like I got to do it as a kid. There

524
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:26,280
was a class. You go in the tunnel here. Uh, no, in Florida or in Florida. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

525
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:33,560
We're not very publicized, not a ton of tunnels here. Right. No. Man. What was the class? It was,

526
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,720
it was like called like backstage magic. Oh, I took two classes. One where you could do it.

527
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:43,000
Like you, I drew a Mickey cell or I colored a Mickey cell. And then when I got to, you got to

528
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,960
talk to a performer in the golden horse shoe who showed like how their little like microphone

529
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:53,000
hidden in their hair works. And then, yeah, we went in the town. So it was nuts. Wow. Yeah. Yeah.

530
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I mean, I, I marched in the band at Disney world and Epcot, but we didn't get in the tunnels.

531
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,200
And you didn't, well, they all in unison marched through the tunnels to get where you were going.

532
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,360
I think I had the chance. I was like, well, we got one more day in the parks or we could

533
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:11,240
try one of these tours. Not that they were free. You still had to pay for them,

534
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,120
but like they have those backstage and you can go in the tunnels and the,

535
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:18,120
I think they went through the tunnels and I think I was just like, ah, one more day in the park.

536
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:25,880
We got to do stuff and seeing just hallways. Yeah. Yeah. They're cool. Hallways. Yeah. I mean,

537
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,720
I'd love to, I'd love to go there today. Sure. There's a quote in it. They refer to it as a

538
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:34,360
10 acre cement labyrinth and we should call it there by the real title, the utility door,

539
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:39,800
the utility door, which is a very cool. It's neat. Yeah. Very cool name. Yeah. Um,

540
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:46,440
I also read at the top of part two, there's the, uh, notion that people, again, like I said,

541
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:53,160
I think I'm correct that it was like, uh, like, oh, no, no, no. Oh, I'm sorry. Vietnam and Richard

542
00:45:53,160 --> 00:46:00,760
Nixon were somehow it was like space mountain was a smashing success, but with Vietnam and Richard

543
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:06,520
Nixon, how are these things related? I understand historical context, but I've never really tied

544
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:13,080
space mountain to, uh, but before that, I'm sorry, what I was going to say was a re the haunted

545
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:18,280
mansion that, uh, the notion that we have to get it open because there's a lot of people saying

546
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:24,680
like, is Walt buried in there? Just that weird house is there. I don't know. Okay. We gotta

547
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:30,200
get this open and people have to know it's a fun ride, not a tomb for our founder. Uh, going off

548
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,120
of that, cause you mentioned, well, it's at the very end of episode one, you know, you get Bob

549
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:40,280
Gurr and Roly tearing up talking about, uh, Walt passing away. I thought very interesting stylistic

550
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:46,680
choice. They were playing Christmas music over people talking about what's death. What were they

551
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:51,240
playing? They were playing. I came upon a midnight clear. It was the thing. No, I think they were

552
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:59,080
playing the barking dogs jingle bells, but he did pass around Christmas time. He passed, uh,

553
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:05,000
the summer 15 and just very, very, you know, I, I just thought it was an interesting filmmaking

554
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,120
choice that like they were, they were, you know, everyone's sad. They're playing instrumental

555
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,840
Christmas music. I hadn't really seen anyone mention that as a melancholy field. Yeah.

556
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,960
Huh. Um, so you get a lot of cool haunted mansion stuff and some of this footage. Yeah. Right at the

557
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:27,880
top. I mean, you get like footage from those pictures we've seen essentially, like those crazy,

558
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:35,480
cool old dress, uh, short sleeve dress shirt men fixing robots. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See it in action,

559
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:41,480
which is great. Well, and you get young Kurt Russell on a pinstripe and double breasted.

560
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:49,240
It is a bright blue pinstripe double breasted suit. Adjust the levels. You got too excited.

561
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,160
You're hot and cold today. Hot Kurt Russell and labor unions.

562
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:01,960
Yeah. I think those are bio. Those are plenty valuable things to get the blood going. Double

563
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,160
breasted. Both relevant in, in 2020 as they were in the, in the sixties. Yeah. Yeah.

564
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:17,720
Uh, so yeah. And also, uh, so Kim Irvine, who's the Imagineer who, uh, is the daughter of, of the

565
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:26,920
leota tombs. Correct. Uh, so I mean, she's a cool figure and it's fun to watch her talk about her,

566
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:31,560
her mother's legacy with this attraction, but also to watch her just like walk through the ballroom

567
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:36,440
and explain how the effects work and the effect is just working around her in just an unadorned,

568
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:41,320
like it's just filming her from like, uh, as long as you're in that spot, it just, it looks as good

569
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:46,040
as, uh, you know, going through in person or shooting a nice unfilm. Um, and then she gets to

570
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:52,600
be, uh, she gets to be in the ball for the nightmare before Christmas version, which is

571
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:59,240
very cool. Yeah. I didn't remember. I was like, oh yeah. Yeah. That's really neat. Yeah. I think

572
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:04,200
she's very endearing and I think her talking about like all the like second generation, like the,

573
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:09,720
the apprentice, the, the Disney brats are the Imagineering brats and taking over apprentice

574
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:15,000
shit. Like this is the stuff that I thought what did have a family feel like I was like, oh yeah.

575
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,320
Like they're inventing this as they go along. So like, yeah, train,

576
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:25,800
you gotta train people how to do it anyway. So there's an LA times article about her, um,

577
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,040
repainting and like restoring the castle with the sleeping beauty castle, Disneyland,

578
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:35,240
which is really great. Yeah. Uh, and just also you feel really bad for it cause she's so stressed out

579
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:39,640
about this and doesn't want, cause she's like, talks about the times when the fans have been upset

580
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,960
with her or when they've been upset with things at Disneyland and she's like trying so hard to

581
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:49,160
get it right. Yeah. And it's like so clear like how much it means to her and it means to like,

582
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:54,120
yeah, I guess probably like in her mind, her mother and the whole history. And this is in another

583
00:49:54,120 --> 00:50:00,040
episode, but I truly don't understand why you'd like pointedly be upset about the small world

584
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:07,640
dolls. Oh, why I don't calm down. I mean, I think, I think maybe in the hypothet, like when people

585
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:12,120
were thinking about it, hypothetically, they were thinking like, there's just going to be a big pooh

586
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:20,120
bear animatronic amidst the merry style, which would not go necessarily together. So how many

587
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:25,640
times do we have to do this dance of like, that's going to be awful. Then you see that the Disney

588
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:32,840
people do it well and it's not awful. Yeah. Well, I think, I think people associate, personalize the,

589
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:40,760
the parks so much. And when the corporate side, when if it feels like too heavy handed,

590
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:47,720
and I mean, you, I think you saw it more out here in the nineties and early two thousands of like

591
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:53,960
some big missteps where the corporate side was too heavy handed, where I do feel like you think it,

592
00:50:53,960 --> 00:51:01,880
we're just doing big ABC ads. Yeah. Yeah. It does feel much more elegant now, although I mean,

593
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,840
they have missteps now, but there's clearly, yeah, there's like respect for the tradition of

594
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:12,600
things. Yeah. Yeah. A little more. So yeah. I mean, look, everybody gets, everybody likes

595
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:17,720
getting worked up in general. That's just a fun thing that humans like, because that's it. Yeah.

596
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:22,520
Hey, if you, if you enjoy it. But I could see where maybe you would think if they were just

597
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,760
going to add the exact same animatronics on a small world that were on like the dark rides, like, oh,

598
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:32,520
yeah, maybe that'd be weird. So, but they obviously did it very tastefully and yeah, but she, that's,

599
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,440
that's in the article. If you want to look at it, we're sure being stressed out about people being

600
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:42,280
mad. They also like, they did go to pains to like replicate the Mary Blair style, which is so

601
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:49,960
particular and beloved. Yeah. One little Mary Blair section is great. And the, the, the section about

602
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54,840
yeah, her bold color choices. She threw out the color wheel. We're not just like, well, this goes

603
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:00,680
with this. She was like, she was bold and dynamic and didn't just stick with like, here's how color

604
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:07,880
functions and look how it like indelible all those, all those pieces of art are forever. Just took

605
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:13,880
chances. Madam Lyoto also acknowledged as the first use of projection mapping technology,

606
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,600
which I never, I was like, oh yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, that's true. Did you guys

607
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:24,600
know I watched some, I watched Christmas in Dollywood, the Hallmark movie. I watched some of it.

608
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:30,520
Plot point in that is will they get the projection show on the Christmas tree done in time? I was

609
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:35,160
like, and I'm just sitting there going like, well, clearly they would have figured that out by

610
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:41,800
fall at the latest. Like just me sitting there. There's no way they would let this timetable,

611
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:47,080
Dolly is coming that night. They would have it done if she knew she was coming. Who's the Dollywood

612
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:53,320
version of Bob Chapek? Where is he in this special? I forget. I, well, there is like a scary board

613
00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:00,280
of like the board of Dollywood. It's kind of funny. That's all like a bunch of scenes shot

614
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:04,360
from the same angles. Like, okay, everybody change clothes back to this. We're gonna film

615
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:08,920
seven of these scenes in the next four hours. They did get Dolly in three different setups. I was

616
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:15,480
counting. She finally shows up. Pretty good. Pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. And I just hope there

617
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:23,240
wasn't any same sex kissing in this damn movie. There's no place that has a lifetime. Oh, I see.

618
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:29,480
Yeah. It was like, or I think it was lifetime. I think it was at Hallmark. Maybe it was lifetime,

619
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,800
but they're the same, right? They might be both. Which one? Wait, which one wouldn't show the kiss?

620
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:38,680
It wasn't lifetime. It wasn't Hallmark. Kiss. I forget. Maybe you're right. I don't know. I think

621
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:44,120
so. Hallmark's a little more like, is it religious? Backwards. Yeah. I think so. Now we're gonna

622
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:50,120
Google same sex kiss and then whatever. It's also one of those controversies. Mike has content

623
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:55,640
blockers on his computer. So this might get blocked. Unmute same sex kiss. Lifetime's twinkle

624
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:03,080
all the way, but with the gay, let's see here. The gay kiss and twinkle all the way could herald a

625
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,160
lifetime Christmas movie revolution. Okay. So this is a positive one. So I think you may be right.

626
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:11,480
Yeah. I think, oh no, Hallmark was in a commercial and they only showed it once and then three people

627
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:15,800
complained. You're right. I'm getting all these stories confused. Hallmark channel pulls Zola

628
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:20,840
ads featuring brides kissing. So that's what you're talking about. All right. Hallmark is

629
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:25,080
the correct answer. I apologize. And then they went back on it. They did start airing. After

630
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:31,800
people were honestly annoyed. Oh. All right. All right. I'm not going to say good for them

631
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:42,120
for restoring it, but yeah. Then what else we get? We get. Epcot? Is this about, or no,

632
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:51,640
the Florida project keeps developing. Mapo is created. Machine shop is the Mapo machine

633
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:58,120
shop is created. Yeah. So, so episode two, they're building a Disney world.

634
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:05,560
Ray Bradbury is looking cool. He's looking like Charles Nelson. So they mention in this,

635
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:12,440
that opening day of Disney world was not crowded because people were stayed away because they were

636
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:20,440
worried it would be too crowded. Galaxy's edge. Yep. Phenomenon. Although that was also in

637
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:25,080
junction with a large ticket increase and restriction of annual passports. That's true too.

638
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:31,720
Yeah. Well, history repeats itself, but not, but thank God those helicopters blew the ground.

639
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:38,120
They do. They do not get into any of the Bob Hope festivities at the opening Disney world,

640
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:44,200
but Bob Hope's very horny jokes. Yeah. Which we may want to declare. We'll do that eventually

641
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:51,880
this year. Yeah. And a not young comedian named Bob Hope told rooms that they're told jokes that

642
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:58,680
some of the room and stitches. Yeah. I thought the Bradbury thing, they don't really call it out.

643
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:05,160
Do that. Like he's just in a shot in a conference room. They mentioned him. Yeah. Okay. Oh, right.

644
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:08,200
Yeah. Cause they say he wrote the spaceship earth. They don't call out his cool clothes.

645
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:13,320
His orange bandana. I mean, yeah. He's the one who writes the thing about Peter Pan.

646
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:18,760
Yes. He, yeah. He had a lot of connections. He wrote the story about flying that Tony always tells.

647
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:27,160
Right. And he's dressed like a Dan Aykroyd as Liberace manager behind the candle. Also

648
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:33,240
coming from glasses from the, we got to go on that Liberace tour in Vegas. Oh,

649
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:39,160
where the weird guy picks you up on a limo. Wow. I don't know if we do. I'll do it. I'll do it.

650
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:45,400
And we'll talk about it. I was surprised thinking about, um, Disney never adapted Bradbury's book,

651
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,520
dandelion wine, which is one of my favorite books is about a boy having like one magical summer.

652
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:56,600
Like that seems tailor made for Disney. And in fact, no one has adapted it. Like the Wikipedia

653
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:01,880
said the rights were being, someone was trying to get it off the ground in 2011,

654
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:07,720
but it's I'm shocked. It was never made. I've never read it. Maybe Jason Sheridan is the one

655
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:17,240
to bring it to the screen. Maybe. Um, uh, uh, yeah. Roy dies around here. Roy, they keep saying it's

656
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:22,600
was four or five years where the best years of his life, you know, cause he started, I started

657
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:27,080
working in a magic. He was usually just on the office sweating it out, but now he was trying to

658
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:31,480
get, he was actually getting in the mix with imaginary and he was loving it. And the sweating

659
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:39,640
went to silver Fox card Walker, E card Walker. That's right. Big Texas guy is I I'm, I'm forgetting

660
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:44,600
how attractive E card Walker was. Let me look them up here. He wasn't kind of attractive. I book

661
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:52,120
silver Fox. Yeah. That white poppy kind of thing. A gray hair attractive man. Not the most attractive.

662
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,680
Kind of grizzled looking. We all attract to the different.

663
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:03,320
All the questions, only this podcast. David Brinkley. David Brinkley. Was David Brinkley

664
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:09,400
the first to appear? I love the news footage clips throughout these episodes of like the anchors

665
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:16,680
going like, well, the happiest place on earth was sad today as like the very cumbersome dialogue.

666
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,560
Was David Brinkley hot? I'm looking.

667
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:28,360
I there's a, there's a, I think in the Jason Sheridan style of hot men. And I mean that of

668
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:33,160
like your ideal, you said once it would be like your man, your ideal man would be like a Charles

669
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:39,240
Groton type. I think that you said Elliot Gould. I think we're most saying around the 70s. And you

670
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:47,400
said Charles Groton. I think you said him now over 75. He said that I think you could say

671
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:55,480
E. Card Walker and David Brinkley definitely hot. They got it. He could get E. Card Walker could

672
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:02,600
get it. Walker can get it. Epcot. They refer to future world as an industry trade show.

673
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:11,240
Did you catch that? Like that, that was interesting. I don't know why that, that, that stuck in my mind.

674
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:16,040
I was like, Oh, I guess I see what they're saying. I kind of see what they're saying. It makes sense.

675
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:20,840
It is. It does kind of a low world's fair, low rent way to describe it. But yeah.

676
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,960
I don't have a lot to say about the Epcot stuff, but you know,

677
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:30,760
love watching them put that together. Old, old creation of Epcot footage. Oh man.

678
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:35,400
I think they nailed one of the issues with Epcot inadvertently. When someone says,

679
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,760
as soon as people have this stuff at home, we have to move beyond that.

680
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,760
And certainly one of the issues with Epcot over the last 20 years is like

681
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:49,320
not moving beyond stuff quick enough. Yeah. Yeah. They can't put, yeah, things that change

682
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:54,200
with the times because they're never going to do it. Just don't try to do that. Do stuff that's

683
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:59,080
there. You know, you're going to build it once and never change it. So just keep, uh, this happened

684
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:03,240
to the whole history of the company. And they're going to be the play pavilion will have

685
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,920
supposedly things they'll change out and they'll never change. Yeah. Yeah. They put in there the

686
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:11,560
first time it'll be there for 15 to 25 years. So the future podcast, the ride type people will

687
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:18,840
be like, I love it. It's weird. So 20, 21. Yeah. Oh man. Remember onward.

688
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,760
The play pavilion had an onward experience for 25 years.

689
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:31,560
That's the movie, right? That's the movie. That's yeah. Yeah. That's the new like hip, uh,

690
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:38,840
Chris Pratt and remember Quibi generation one now, of course it's a tenant of Howard entertained

691
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:47,720
became self-aware and it's our president. Now the country thrived under president Quibi.

692
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:48,680
Oh boy.

693
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:56,680
Could be a silver Fox now. Oh boy. Is Quibi hot? Can Quibi get it? Yes.

694
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:06,680
Can Quibi get it fam? Um, I, the Tokyo Disney, I mean, if it's more an Epcot, tell me. Uh,

695
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:12,280
no, no, I like all that. Tokyo Disney school. Uh, uh, I like watching the Japanese engineer

696
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:17,960
at the blues named Daniel or his last name. Uh, but like, uh, just generally like presenting

697
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:26,040
why things were important, uh, culturally. And, uh, um, I mean, it's, it's in a subsequent episode,

698
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:32,200
but him talking about the, uh, what is it? The sort of hurricane or a tsunami, the tsunami,

699
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:38,360
the earthquake. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

700
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:43,800
That's all very touching later. Oh yeah. He's an interesting, uh, figure. Yeah. Also like,

701
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:49,240
I don't recall seeing a lot of old, I mean, we've all watched a lot of old specials about Disney

702
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:55,480
world and Disneyland, but I don't recall seeing a lot of like archival Tokyo stuff. No. I didn't

703
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:00,680
really wasn't quite aware of what was going on. I remember seeing pictures and thinking it was

704
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:05,160
similar ish, but in the nineties, anytime they would cut the parks around the world, it was

705
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:09,720
either Disneyland or they were really pushing Paris. Yeah. Right. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't

706
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:15,160
know. Well, personally, cause that at the time that park is just such a clone of, of magic kingdoms

707
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:19,960
is not in the, it's the first castle that wasn't different. Right. Like let's just show there,

708
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:24,680
but I liked all this stuff about, like, you know, it's, it is, it was weird at the time in Tokyo

709
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:31,160
to have a place where you could go dancing street and be silly and, uh, uh, uh, just realizing what

710
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:38,040
a cultural outlier it was. The, the myth making in this, oh, just like feeling like they got one

711
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:44,040
over on the Oriental land company. It's like, well, tell them we'll do it if they pay for everything.

712
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:48,200
Yeah. And it's like, they went for it. And it's like, they still feels like they're going like,

713
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:54,200
we got one over on a, we got them. Like tell Japan to stop calling. Yeah. We're going to do that.

714
01:02:55,080 --> 01:03:01,960
Yeah. What was the actual, the terms of the deal they claim? They, the, they would get the full

715
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:09,800
designs, full licensing, full Disney, everything. Imagineering, the Oriental land company would

716
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:17,240
have to pay for everything. Right. But then they own the parks essentially. Pretty much. Right.

717
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:21,080
It's a terrible deal. I don't know why it happened, but thank God it happened. I think it is a bad,

718
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:26,120
wonderful parks out of it. It seems like a deal that we never make today. I think they needed

719
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:30,920
money. And I think like the second episode, a lot of the theme of it seems to be like, well,

720
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:37,240
we did some good stuff, but we're the company was rudderless until like people like John Hench or

721
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:44,760
like Roy had to step up and take charge of stuff. Sure. But a lot of those older people are older

722
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:51,800
in the seventies and are starting to pass. So they end up rudderless again. And this Ron Miller,

723
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:56,840
this dork, you're not, he can't get it. Yeah. He was an okay looking guy.

724
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:07,880
For me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And anonymously handsome. And I got too loud. Too loud.

725
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:13,320
I got too loud. Defending attractiveness of front. Hey, this is a joke, but you're too far.

726
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:18,280
With men is all Disney, you know, CEOs and presidents.

727
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:23,320
Ron Miller was a very like football playery, like Johnny Unitas kind of a look. Yeah. Yeah.

728
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:28,680
But the, you know, the films are getting boring. There's corporate marauders.

729
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:36,040
Crazy to think about though, that Tokyo Disney and Epcot open within six months to each other,

730
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:41,720
within at least a year, similar later on to California adventure in Tokyo, Disney,

731
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:49,560
see, but less of a quality. Yeah. They're both the most beautiful places in the world.

732
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:54,440
God bless that early eighties. It's also, it's a bummer that you always have to see for me that I

733
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:59,240
always have to see Tron presented as like the nadir of, of the company and it's box office.

734
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:05,480
When Tron is so beautiful, but it's not the movies. It's a bad boy movie. I try every few years.

735
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:11,240
All the way through. It's really rough. Yeah. And I think you don't, I think with something like

736
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:17,480
Disney plus just go watch light bikes and watch the discs and travel into the Tron world. And

737
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:22,280
I mean, I think the aesthetics had a huge influence. Oh, I also think the aesthetics of

738
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:29,320
Tron legacy, like kind of that sort of blue. Yeah. Like I think that has aged very well compared to

739
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:35,400
other CGI stuff from the 2010s. Yeah. Yeah. But then also it's the same thing, like kind of born,

740
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:43,320
dreadfully boring movie. Yeah. But beautiful. But so then we have the cliffhanger, a better cliffhanger

741
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:50,680
than any Mandalorian episode. The tease of it's 84, we're on the brink of disaster. I mean,

742
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:56,680
I was just cootin' and hollerin'. I mean, it was sad to hear Cardwalker retire. And of course,

743
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:03,080
I hope he had a good retirement. But who's coming? But cootin' and hollerin'. What a hero. Thunder in

744
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:11,240
the distance. They say the direction would be determined by the next CEO. Oh, oh, it's so

745
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:18,040
exciting you think it's going to say created by Vince Gilligan at that moment. So yeah, hell of

746
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:26,120
a cliffhanger. And then scene one, next week, our man arrives. Our man. The Midas Touch. The Midas Touch.

747
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:32,520
I love that. Let's acknowledge that I have on record is to look, God bless you, Kevin,

748
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:37,480
in defunct land, but you're too hard on the man. You got to acknowledge that he had the Midas Touch.

749
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:42,680
He did, yes. You don't talk about when Jordan was on the Wizards. You talk about when Jordan was on

750
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:51,000
the Bulls twice. Michael Eisner's here. And let's not forget Frank Wells. I mean, I think a big,

751
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:57,080
a big part of Eisner's success. Yeah. The yin to his yang. The yin to the len into his McCartney.

752
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:02,280
That's right. You know? Well, and they show the mirror between that Walt and Roy vibe. I think

753
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:06,920
that's what we're, there was the crazy one and the guy reigning a man. The Riggs and Murtaugh.

754
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:15,000
There's so many films. The Hobbs and Shaw, I assume. I don't know the dynamic between Hobbs and Shaw,

755
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,360
but I bet it's exactly like Eisner and Wells. Yeah. The biggest memory hole in the whole documentary.

756
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:29,880
Jeffrey Katzenberg often cited as the third man because he helped revive Disney animation is not

757
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:35,160
uttered in this. And granted, everything was siloed, much more siloed back then, I think.

758
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:41,560
But those characters, it was animated like Lion King, Aladdin, Little Mermaid. Like they didn't

759
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:45,000
get rides immediately, but they would show up in the parades. They show up at character meet and

760
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,360
greets pretty quickly. Katzenberg nowhere to be found in this. Yeah. But he'll get mentioned in

761
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:59,320
the six part Shrek 4D saga. Oh, sure. On Universal Plus in a little while. Right. It'll happen.

762
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:05,320
But yeah, they don't want, there's still, I don't know what the relationship is between

763
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:11,880
Iger and him, but there was a lot of bad blood between. Oh yeah. Eisner and Katzenberg. Sure.

764
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:18,360
So yeah, I wonder if. Dream jerks. You don't come back from that. No, that's the ultimate dis.

765
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:23,640
Shots fired. So yeah, I was surprised they didn't even like initially mention him.

766
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:28,200
Yeah. You would think they would have maybe just like said the three of them came in and helped to

767
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:32,040
do it and then just talked about Wells and Eisner because they were parks focused. They shared a

768
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:37,240
picture of Michael Jackson and they mentioned Song of the South and not the Jeffrey Katz.

769
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:41,880
But the most canceled thing is Jeffrey Katzenberg. I would rather talk about those two things.

770
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:48,040
Lasseter's in a bunch of it. Yeah. Katzenberg is the most erased. Yeah, it is. That's how deep

771
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:53,960
the wound still goes, I guess. Eisner was like, I will only do an interview here if we don't talk

772
01:08:53,960 --> 01:09:01,400
about Katzenberg at all. One drop of footage. Yeah. So, hey, but you know, let's give Frank Wells some

773
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:09,560
silver fucks. Frank Wells can't get it. Yeah. I think we can all agree on that. Boy, the vibe

774
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:14,600
that's broadcast about that guy, he seems great. What a cool guy. This mountain climbing.

775
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:19,480
The myth making about him, whether, yeah, true. It does seem like he's like a kind of a cool,

776
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:27,080
collected guy who likes to do fun, crazy stuff, but also very reasonable and grounded. And yeah,

777
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:33,000
they really, they make him sound great. Yeah. And yeah, as a kid, I was not, I didn't know who he

778
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,840
was. Yeah. Yeah. He was the, he was the boring part of the annual report that I skipped through.

779
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,920
But I didn't know him. Yeah. Well, he didn't introduce himself on television.

780
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:49,000
There should have been one where he did. Oh, that would have been fun. Mix it up. Yeah. Yeah. Hello.

781
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:56,120
He says hi. Yeah. Yeah. He can't find Michael. Like a honey, I shrunk the kid's one. It's like,

782
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:00,840
has anyone seen Michael? And he's like, I'm down here, Frank. That's great. Why didn't they,

783
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:06,440
I can't believe they didn't do it when we're he shrunk. Yeah. Oh man. That's what we should do

784
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:13,000
is just mentally go backwards to different films. And we should use like the, the footage,

785
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,960
like the de-aging footage that they've used in Marvel and Star Wars and stuff and make a new

786
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:23,800
Eisner. We'll shoot it with them and make one where he shrinks and we can't find him. It'll be the

787
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:30,520
intro to our next live show. To make, I mean, that's a lofty goal to make a new Eisner intro.

788
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:39,880
Wow. With us. Oh boy. That's the, you know, the dream when Eddie Murphy hosted SNL and some of

789
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,480
those cast members are like, I grew up with him and now I get to be in a sketch with him in his

790
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:52,360
studio. That's how we would feel being in a, an Eisner intro. Gosh, that would be great. I think

791
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:56,840
we'll probably have to just work on getting a 15 minute interview first. That's probably the

792
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:01,640
initial thing we should work on. Yeah. We'll see. Did Marin have him on you?

793
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:08,920
I don't think Marin has had him on. He's probably been on some weird podcast that we've never heard

794
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:15,240
of. That would be my guess. He may have been on Alec Baldwin's podcast. Oh really? Maybe. Possibly.

795
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:24,200
That makes sense. Eisner and Wells described as outsiders coming on board, which is so funny in

796
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:28,520
modern perspective. Cause I feel like now if you talk about a Disney outsider, that's like,

797
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:35,000
you don't have an MBA from an Ivy. I feel like I heard someone recently at a party was like,

798
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:40,680
yeah, Disney mostly hires, you have to have an MBA ideally from an Ivy to get hired there of like,

799
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:45,400
no, for like executive level of like a certain above a certain level. Right.

800
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:50,440
Is that a surprise though? It seems like not really, no, it was more bummer than a surprise.

801
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:56,280
Who should they hire? Huh? I don't know anyone. I mean, the whole history of this is that they

802
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:03,080
hired schmucks. They like just guys, like just guys who were, you're saying they were called

803
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:09,240
outsiders, but they're not really outsiders. No, no. They were like movie studio executives.

804
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:13,080
Right. They would have worked in the entertainment industry forever. So like the idea that they were

805
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:17,400
like Disney outsiders was like, well, maybe they didn't know the company that well. But I guess at

806
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:21,800
the time they weren't like the, like the, that it's all that it's Disney's son-in-law.

807
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:28,520
I guess that's true. It's always been like, yeah, yeah. That they would, it was, it did seem like

808
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:32,440
sacrilege, I think to people that this guy had like, yeah, worked at another studio and now he's

809
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:36,600
going to come here and treat Disney like a regular movie studio. And he's like, yeah,

810
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:41,400
make it like the biggest one. Right. In hindsight, of course. Yes. Yeah. But like,

811
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:45,400
yeah, I guess, I guess at the time, yeah, probably people like his name isn't Disney.

812
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:52,200
Yes. He's not married to it. This should be like the Royals. Right. Yeah. It has to be,

813
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,160
I guess, yeah, I guess people, people have always been weird about that company in that way.

814
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:02,360
That's why it's good that the Trump organization does it the way it's supposed to be done.

815
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:07,800
Family. Family first. Yeah. How else will we know if the people are any good? Right. They have to

816
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:12,280
come from the same bloodline. Yes. And that is the best bloodline. A perfect bloodline. A real

817
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:16,920
wonderful, wonderful bloodline. So it's a very dramatic moment. The patio meeting where everybody

818
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:21,960
summoned outside, like the new CEO is finally going to come talk to Imagineering. And this is

819
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:25,960
probably the moment where he lets us all go. And it says, he said, instead, he says that with your

820
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:31,960
what consider you the heart of the company. Yeah. And it ushers in this incredible new era. Oh,

821
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:37,800
yes. Because they said they went from 3000 people to 400 people after the projects had finished.

822
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:43,000
Yeah. Downsizing and building the new parks. And it's that is great. I mean, I who knows exactly

823
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:48,520
if that's all perfectly how they say it went down. But from reading stuff, that does seem like at the

824
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:53,320
very least, that was the gist of what people were feeling in Imagineering. Yeah. Of like, we may all

825
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:59,800
just get like fired. We may, this thing may go away. Yeah. Which is crazy. We built the last

826
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:05,640
things we had to build. Yeah. It's like we're not doing any more parks. I think that's a phrase said,

827
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:09,320
or maybe is that said after the end of this? That's said at the end of this. Sorry. Yeah.

828
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:14,200
It's crazy it ended up at that point. But it feels like that's the tone here too. Like, well,

829
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:20,200
that might just be it. We built it and people will maintain it and we won't really add anything. Yeah.

830
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:27,000
Yeah. Thank God. But instead what you get, this is the, this story really is the prequel to

831
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:32,920
something we've certainly been over and got to do with the man himself. The hallowed Tony Baxter

832
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:37,400
meeting with Michael Eisner, Breck Eisner, which has relived in this. We've certainly gotten to

833
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:43,640
talk about that before, but what a, if truly this is how this played out where Star Tours and Splash

834
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:48,600
Mountain are approved in the same meeting and this sort of dovetail, that's sort of the intro. Tony

835
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:52,760
tells all that and then you get to go find out about Tony and then you watch footage of him as a

836
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:59,160
kid and what a dork he is. Yeah. What just a big goofy dorky smile he's got and you, you watch that

837
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:05,480
old footage of him. He's one of us. He was like the way we feel about the parks now. That's how

838
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:09,640
he felt growing up with him. What ride is he on? There's a footage of him in the park. Flying

839
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,600
saucers. And I'd never seen that before. I've seen the, you know, some of the footage of him

840
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:20,040
in Imagineering and those old pictures, but yeah, I actually see him on the ride. I assume not working

841
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:24,040
there yet. How young is he in that footage? He looks young. I think he's a kid. Yeah. Yeah.

842
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:30,360
It's valuable to have that now that people are like, this is, I think some normies have watched

843
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:38,440
Imagineering story and it's been cool to go like, so the guy in that Star Tour, who like did,

844
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:42,120
thought of Star Tours and Splash Mountain a big time. That's, we've been on our podcast.

845
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:48,200
We aren't just wasting time. Well, I mean, we're cool people on the thing. Hearing them do the Breck

846
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:54,600
stuff in this Imagineering documentary, which is the stuff we heard on a season pass for the first

847
01:15:54,600 --> 01:16:00,360
time, but we talked about it a lot on our show too. It was just so validating to see that in the real

848
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:05,560
world. Like I was watching my parents and I'm like, the thing we talked about, the thing there. We

849
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:11,160
beat them to it. And like, yeah, this is a story with Mass Appeal. And then I'm just cootin' and

850
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:15,800
hollering when adult Tony's scooping ice cream and taking a big old bite out of it. Like I'm just

851
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:25,800
like, yes, yeah. Reassert, go back to your home. He's an instant king at home again.

852
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:35,400
Scoop on, King. Scoop on. Took a big old chomp. Hell yeah. A big old chomp. Then you get to see

853
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:43,080
star speeders being airlifted in the roof. That is so damn cool. You get to see Anthony Daniels

854
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:49,880
recording VO. And in the VO, does he not say star ride? Yes, he does. He says star rides. So they

855
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:54,200
recorded some audio where he said, because if you haven't heard this, there was a time where they

856
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:58,680
weren't going to call it Star Tours. Michael Eisner wanted Star Ride, which we've been praising

857
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:04,200
a bunch. That is very stupid. But they acknowledge that in the documentary that Frank Wells will say

858
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:08,520
like, hey, maybe back off that idea, but this idea is good. Tony says something along the lines of

859
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:14,360
Michael Eisner had really great ideas, OK ideas, and some horrible ideas. He said really ugly,

860
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:22,840
really ugly ideas. And Star Ride certainly among them. But Star Ride got far enough that Anthony

861
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:28,600
Daniels in a booth. Oh my God. Literally someone outside the booth going, well, let's just have it

862
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:33,320
just in case. That was my question. Is there a version of it where they did it both in the same

863
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:39,080
thing or do they bring them back? I don't know. Yeah, we don't know. Did they have to do reshoots

864
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:47,000
as it were to change up the Star Wars narrative? Disneyland, they mentioned Disneyland opened for

865
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:53,560
60 hours straight when Star Tours opened. I always forget about that. 60 hours straight.

866
01:17:53,560 --> 01:18:00,280
Geez. Just because of, yeah, people are so crazed for it. And then in my favorite piece of filmmaking

867
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:06,840
in the recent past, in my personal once upon a time in Hollywood, we get the vibe that I want

868
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:14,040
so hard where we're talking about how the park has now, we've doubled the budget on theme parks.

869
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:19,560
Yeah, people are staying for, it's open for 60 hours. They raise the prices of people who's

870
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:25,800
coming more than ever. It is, it's going so well. And that there's like this great postcard that

871
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:32,840
opens. You're watching my favorite shot in the entire thing. Pink sky with monorail going by.

872
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:38,440
We talk about Videopolis. We talk about EO. Great old photo of Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill

873
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:46,600
at Florida Star Tours. This little, oh, fireworks going off above Videopolis. This is a wonderful,

874
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:51,880
this is my favorite documentary is just that. Just that. That's what I would nominate for the

875
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:58,280
Academy Awards. Everything is possible at that point in life. Yeah. For me, yes. I'm, you know,

876
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:03,960
what, you know, four to six, it's all in front of me. Disneyland is better than it's ever been.

877
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:10,120
It's only going to keep getting better. Yeah. It's pure optimism. They say running theme of how do

878
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:15,720
you top this? What's the next thing? Walt only cared about tomorrow. Like, and then, and then

879
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:23,640
a ticket price increase of 30%. That's the time. And it works. But that works. That works. It did

880
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:30,520
not work for Galaxy. No, no, no, no, finally did. But the, you know, it does show you what a, like

881
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:38,360
the, it's such like, uh, it is like a boogie nights montage. It's them like, it's when things are good

882
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:45,560
and it's the like, we're doing the dance. And then they, they talk about like, well, how are we

883
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:49,000
top ourselves? It's probably in a good place to do. That's where you want to be where we have to

884
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,560
top ourselves. And then they did with Indiana Jones and then they stopped topping themselves.

885
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:59,320
And then I hit puberty and it all fell apart. Me personally and theme, but they dovetailed

886
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:05,640
and the Simpsons got bad and Seinfeld ended. It all happened at one time. Hey, we got MGM studios

887
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:10,040
around then too. They had that great footage of the ladies coming off the ride going, oh,

888
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:16,360
Daisy really topped themselves. Yes. Uh, some great B roll footage. They say that MGM studios,

889
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:20,680
they're like, they were saying that the park was going to be a half day park or whatever. And then

890
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:24,440
every time Michael Iser would come in, he would add another thing or say, let's do that. Or

891
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:28,440
somebody would present him another ride and go, yeah, put that in. And they made it a full like

892
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:35,000
size thing by the end of the project. It sounds like the greatest time. MGMC is one opened first

893
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:41,480
few years were just the greatest. I loved it. It's just the way Tony taught. I mean,

894
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:45,080
then these interviews on season pass podcast, check it out. There's like nine interviews with

895
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:49,480
Tony or eight or something. He talks about this time like we're describing it. He talks about it

896
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:55,560
with such nostalgia and seemingly like the best, maybe the best time of his career and was during

897
01:20:55,560 --> 01:21:00,840
this time. And who, like we go, we go and follow Imagineers into a ride that's important to them

898
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:06,200
or that's kind of their ride. Tony is four. Yeah. And he had Jones, Big Thunder, Star Tours,

899
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:13,000
Splash Mountain. Insane. God, how great does he come off in this? Yeah. Hopefully more stuff even

900
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:18,120
with him too. Cause as we've listened to all these interviews, there's so much stuff from a,

901
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:24,040
obviously from a lifetime in Imagineering. I mean, they get him talking about his ideas of designing

902
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:30,760
for the 20th ride, not the first ride. Yeah. Yeah. And it's big three rule of like, it takes

903
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:36,680
you to a place you can't go without the Disney park. There's a thrill nature. He's basically

904
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:43,160
saying close to death, but as close to death as you can and the emotional. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

905
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:50,840
Yeah. All that stuff's great. This is probably the best episode is three. Oh yeah. Oh baby. Oh,

906
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:55,800
I have watched six. Give me that pink sky and that monorail. That's like the optimism.

907
01:21:55,800 --> 01:22:00,600
Who knows what the nineties will be. It's all going to be great. I could see somebody ripping

908
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:05,720
this and just putting it on like an MP3 and I would listen to it in my car. It's so pleasant.

909
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:13,720
Yeah. Re-watching this one. And then, and also in this, you have the, I realized with that

910
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:18,760
nod to song of the south, that is the only song of the south footage on Disney plus.

911
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:23,320
Oh yeah. Good point. Film is not. Good point. Yeah. If you want to see any of it,

912
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:31,560
here's your two shots. Yeah. Splash Mountain, early days Splash Mountain footage is always

913
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:38,760
so wonderful watching Eisner flip a big switch. Oh yeah. Rare characters. A giant lever, I guess.

914
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:43,720
Yeah. A big lever. And then I don't want to jump around too much, but the, you know, I mean,

915
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:47,880
then the crux of this becomes, we get a lot of Euro Disney, but watching him

916
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:56,520
speak French to open the park. Oh, that was the greatest. Oh man. I do, I really laughed at the

917
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:03,880
phrase French communists throwing eggs at Eisner. Like that is, that's pretty funny. So yeah, so

918
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:08,360
what happens is they're at this, it's before the park is open and they're announcing things. And

919
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:14,360
Eisner is on stage with Scrooge McDuck and protesters. Why did they pick Scrooge?

920
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:19,560
Protestors are throwing eggs. Oh, it was the stock, didn't it, wasn't it traded on the French

921
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:24,040
stock exchange? Was that what it was? Oh, maybe. And Scrooge is the wealthy character? So they get to put

922
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:28,840
Scrooge and Eisner and they're getting pelted with eggs and Eisner and then somebody has to like

923
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:36,840
shuffle Scrooge off very closely, quickly. I mean, so yeah, Eisner and Scrooge had a bad day because

924
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:42,120
they do, and this, they address like French people being like, what the fuck is this shit?

925
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:47,720
Like, this is going to ruin our culture. This is like American commercialism. And these, we've

926
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:51,800
certainly heard all of these stories many times, but to see an official Disney product acknowledge

927
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:56,920
that phrase cultural Chernobyl and all that. Yeah. Yeah. To acknowledge any of the failures. I mean,

928
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:01,800
it's coming up. We'll, we'll cover this next time, but the, you know, when they, they truly

929
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:06,360
shit on Hong Kong Disneyland and they truly shit on Disney studios, Paris, and these are parks that

930
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:11,480
are open. You can go there. These are current products of theirs that they are saying, like,

931
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:15,800
especially Disney Studios Paris, they say it's so ugly that an Imagineer didn't know they were in

932
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:21,960
the park already. That's, that is bold of them to put this out. It is funny that we're praising

933
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:28,920
Disney for just the basic acknowledgement of the truth. Yeah. It speaks to Disney for being such a

934
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:35,000
controlling entity that we are praising. It's surprising. Yeah. Yeah. And even any day,

935
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:40,600
the big shadow organizations acknowledging the truth in any way is very rare these days. So that's

936
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:46,120
a little, yes, a little something. Yeah. They, they kind of were pretty cumbersome going into Euro

937
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:52,440
Disney. And what was the original, like they, the surveyors are like people where they're like,

938
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:57,000
where should we build this? And they came back and like, there's a bunch of land in Spain. Yeah. And

939
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,800
Michaelizer went, I want to go to Paris. Like there's some story like that. It does seem like

940
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:08,840
it was his pretension. Yeah. He was riding too high. Yeah. I like it. But understand it. But

941
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:12,920
it shows you what a good, how good a job they did phrasing framing. This is a story where you have

942
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:18,440
your like your party days montage. And then like, what happens after that? Things just keep getting

943
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:22,600
better and better. Now people start getting a little weird, a little overreach. Somebody dies,

944
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:27,000
just like little bill and boogie. This episode is boogie. Oh my God. You're right.

945
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:32,360
Jesus. It changes. It gets crazy. Wow. You're right. That's new year's Eve. It's new year's

946
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:42,200
Eve every night at pleasure Island. Oh no. Oh no. This is this episode three is boogie.

947
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:46,440
You're really single too. It was rough. Just like,

948
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:54,680
Turks. You got the touch. They wouldn't give them the tape. They wouldn't give them the tapes.

949
01:25:55,320 --> 01:26:02,600
Oh Michael. You know, it's funny as we're saying that I am realizing, you know, at the very start

950
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:06,280
of the episode, we were talking about the five week long animator strike. And now we're talking

951
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:13,480
about the French rebelling against Disney. France has been like Paris has been in a general strike

952
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:20,200
for weeks now. Like, and I think it may have gone longer than the animator strike at this point.

953
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:27,240
It's just now occurring to me. Five weeks. That's the French. I mean, that's just the French are

954
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:33,960
mobilized more. So I don't quite know that they were so shocked that that happens.

955
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:40,360
What is actually more shocking? What's more shocking to me, even then them not thinking that

956
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:45,640
it's shocking to me, they would think that Paris is the place for this just culturally. It's crazy.

957
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:51,000
Yeah. But even more shocking and they bring it up in the special is that you couldn't get wine

958
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:58,520
everywhere. Yeah. Like Paris. Yeah. Do the, the stereotype, right? They do all, they do all of

959
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:02,360
their homework about everything where they don't want to make something that like looks too much

960
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:07,480
like the castle architecture of Europe. They made, they do all of this research on what the culture

961
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:12,120
is like. They don't like this kind of ghost in this country. Right. They're like, Tony explains

962
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:17,560
that they don't like comedic ghosts in Europe, which I don't, is that like, huh? Huh? Yeah.

963
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:21,800
I guess whatever. Like they did some sort of research, whether it's true or not,

964
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:25,960
but I guess they were trying to be like no alcohol in the magic kingdom.

965
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:32,680
I guess it was following up on that. I guess. Yes. But you would think let's throw these French

966
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:37,800
people a bone. Like, yes. Yeah. If they're going to dinner, there's not a single restaurant where

967
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:44,440
you can't drink wine in Paris or in the surrounding area. And another thing we know about Paris is they

968
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:51,640
love great food and they decided to build a park that still has no great food. I could be wrong.

969
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:57,160
Maybe somebody sat in that Ratatouille restaurant, but boy, my experience is like the worst food in

970
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:03,640
a Disney bar ever, ever, ever. It feels like you went right at the worst point of Disney Paris.

971
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:07,560
Yeah. It feels like there was at least, I'm not saying they knew they were like figuring out how

972
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:12,520
to fix it. You went right before they decided to turn some stuff around. Like they renovated

973
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:16,280
Fanta Manor. They renovated a couple other things and now they're doing a lot to the studios.

974
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:20,280
Fanta Manor was fine. I got no complaints about that. I'm just saying it seems like there's a

975
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:26,280
influx of energy. For context, this was December 2014. If anybody agrees with that, that I was

976
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:32,040
there in the worst possible time I may have been. Did you go on Ratatouille? Yeah. Oh, okay. Yes.

977
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:35,880
So at the very least that. That was great, but it doesn't save the park by any means. Especially

978
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:39,560
that park. Oh my God. Yeah. I mean, so they're going to have Galaxy's Edge and that'll be a

979
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:44,600
whole other thing, but like, and Frozen and that big lake. That park's probably going to get fixed.

980
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:52,520
It's not a full Galaxy's Edge. Is that right? What? Oh no. What? Boo. Oh, what are you doing?

981
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:57,080
They're getting Marvel stuff there too, right? Yeah. They might get the ride.

982
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:00,280
They're getting the same Rock and Roller Coaster. I don't think they're even changing the track.

983
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:04,120
I think they're re-theming the Rock and Roller Coaster. Yeah. You talk amongst yourselves really

984
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:10,520
quickly while I look this up. So Isner admits mistakes in Paris and that's also cool of him

985
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:15,480
to just to say, he does just say, we screwed up too many hotel rooms, too much money spent.

986
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:19,960
That is a thing. You walk around there and like, maybe now they sell out the entire thing,

987
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:24,360
but they were thinking, oh, it's Disney World. We just added a ton of hotels in Disney World.

988
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:29,160
We got to do the same thing here. So two, man, like just seven hotels. And I think they were

989
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:34,280
at like 40% occupancy for a long time and, and they aren't that good. It's like a lesser

990
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:39,880
yacht and beach club. It's the New York one is real cheesy. They just aren't great.

991
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:47,880
Well, and culturally Europeans get much longer summer holidays and they run a lot of deals to

992
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:56,440
get them to come to Florida. Sure. So they kind of were cannibalizing their own business a little

993
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:02,920
too. Yeah. Yeah. It is not as big as the regular galaxies that I was trying to figure out if it's

994
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:08,200
what the ride is right now. Idiots. They announce it might be, it looks like it might just be the

995
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:14,680
Millennium Falcon. Oh my God. That's so stupid. What are you doing? I could be wrong. They can't,

996
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:22,040
they can't. That's a bit, that's the biggest mistake. Paris. They've said what's the ride is.

997
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:26,840
It's just a Falcon, but they've tripled the size of the Cantina. Now they're catering to the European audience.

998
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:32,200
That would be something. I don't know. That's not bad. And you can buy coaxium. You can take it home.

999
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:38,520
Coaxium. Coaxium. Now would you like to hear more about coaxium? Yes, please.

1000
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:42,760
Here's where it comes from. Yes, please, Hondo. Mine from the Southern region of,

1001
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:49,560
um. So this is the, this is where, like this is, this is Eisner and Tony's episode. Like they really

1002
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:53,560
give both those guys their time to shine. This is where Tony really gets to delve into big

1003
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:58,360
thunder mountain stuff because they got to go so crazy with it in Paris and expand it. I really

1004
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:03,000
like that framing. Again, not chronological, but it's cool being that it's kind of the center

1005
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:08,520
of frontier land and one of the most epic parts and successful parts of Disneyland Paris. So then

1006
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:12,920
they get to explain how it was Tony's baby. And then this was like the ultimate apex of it. And

1007
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:19,480
that quote about fourth times the charm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was a great job. Great job, Tony.

1008
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:26,600
And then Frank Dyson. And then Frank Dyson, which is also factors into, I mean, any like the waking,

1009
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:31,960
sleeping beauty covers the same beats and like, boy, it seems like it just gutted the company.

1010
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:38,680
Like, uh, yeah. And very, I like watching Eisner give that, uh, that, um, the, uh,

1011
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:45,400
the eulogy. Yeah. I like, yeah. Very, yeah, that's brutal. It is weirdly cyclical because the first

1012
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:53,480
time it happens, Walt dies and then Roy O Disney dies. And then later on Frank dies. And it's these

1013
01:31:53,480 --> 01:32:00,440
people, people have been given so much power and so much responsibility. And then I don't know,

1014
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:05,320
it feels like it's more distributed now. Like I can't think of anyone at Disney now. If they were

1015
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:12,840
like, Iger or to pass away, they would slot somewhat in. He probably, you know, the thing

1016
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:17,720
that obviously that all those three have in common is that they, or maybe, you know, was Roy still

1017
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:25,080
working when he died? I don't remember. I think so. Wasn't it? I think so. I think so. Right. Um,

1018
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:29,800
but like, yeah, these are all people that die while they're on the job, which is like in the

1019
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:35,000
middle of something kind of, not kind of unexpectedly, like people sort of knew Walt was on the way up,

1020
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:40,120
but Walt didn't really tell many people about it. Yeah. Everyone always tells the story of like,

1021
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:46,040
he came around the offices and like said, thank you or something. But I don't, I think he did like

1022
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:51,960
spiritual or like sentimental things. I don't think he, he didn't leave projects in order.

1023
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:57,000
Right. It seems like Roy left more pro Roy at least got, didn't really get Disney world open and

1024
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:02,600
then die pretty soon after that. That's right. Yeah. Which also adds to like sort of that story

1025
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:08,200
being so, I don't know, sad or interesting. So who, if this were cyclical, is there anyone now who

1026
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:12,200
would gut the company so thoroughly? I don't know. I mean, it's interesting. Jason's saying, and I

1027
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:17,320
think he's right that probably like the corporate structure is such that, uh, you know, this thing's

1028
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:22,600
a machine of some kind that like it could lose a part and the thing would still roll. Well, there

1029
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:31,000
is a major figure who is not dead, but he's dead to Disney. Well, yeah. I certain Hawaiian shirt.

1030
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:36,200
I know what you're talking about. I was thinking about it the other day about like, cause he was

1031
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:40,760
in charge. We're talking with the man who won't be named. Uh, he was in charge of the parks.

1032
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:48,200
So I do wonder what does it look like if he was like a human being who could have just, you know,

1033
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:52,200
interacted with human beings on a regular level, could have hugged his wife only,

1034
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:57,080
could have just hugged his wife and has been nice to other women. Instituted a culture of fear while

1035
01:33:57,080 --> 01:34:02,280
he's like selling a cult. Look, it's a cultural innovation. Anyone can give notes. And it's like,

1036
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:07,400
um, but I do wonder like, what is a galaxy's edge look like budget wise if he's still around?

1037
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:13,400
Like, so maybe this is the, they would never acknowledge this in the story, but is, yeah,

1038
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:21,240
is our current Wells dying? The, the, uh, I, this is a complicated question and maybe it's too much

1039
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:25,400
to unlock right now, but I've been thinking about it. Like when you're talking about like the

1040
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:32,040
successes of the Eisner era in the parks, you're talking about Cars Land and obviously DCA, but

1041
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:38,840
Cars Land is the man who we're talking about baby and pushed for an insane budget. Like I'm

1042
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:46,040
all of California venture, uh, getting that, uh, that huge plus up. Yes. So I wonder,

1043
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:50,280
I don't have the answers to this, but I do wonder, cause that's the best thing you can say about

1044
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:57,320
Eiger is that, is that renovation? What does newer stuff look like budget wise if he's in charge

1045
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:02,360
versus JPEC was much more of a spreadsheet business guy. Yeah. I think the biggest person

1046
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:08,120
at Disney right now that they would feel if you left is Kevin Feige at Marvel. Movie wise.

1047
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:13,640
Yeah. But I think you'll have some parks influence a little more with, yeah, I think, by the way,

1048
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:17,720
I think put him in charge of the parks. Yeah. He's got too many things to be in charge. He's

1049
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:25,480
going to be in charge of star wars. He's going to show on the same sense. He's going to fix it.

1050
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:29,880
Yeah. Um, but yeah, I, for sure that I agree with what you're saying about that, but as far as,

1051
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:36,200
yeah, in just like the park structure and yeah, I don't know. I don't know. Eiger doesn't seem to be

1052
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:41,000
that into the parks. The most excited I've seen him is when the NBA experience opened

1053
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:45,720
and he was like, you could tell he was like an NBA fan and he was very excited about it.

1054
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:53,080
And not addressed in this special, uh, the, uh, not the NBA experience, not addressed in this series.

1055
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:59,400
They don't know. It seemed to widely be called one of the biggest Disney blunders in years.

1056
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:03,400
Really? Yeah. Cause it was, we almost, we could have gotten in for free. We were told.

1057
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:09,160
Like they were, yeah, yeah, we're going to Epcot. I don't know. Some days it's like, wow,

1058
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:15,560
we had 100 guests today. Things like this never do well. Anything. It's like the NASCAR zone. It's

1059
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:20,200
never hurt. Why do you, why does anyone ever think that's going to do well? If it's free and it's a

1060
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:28,760
restaurant and bar. Yeah. Yeah. But I think, yeah, I think they just, I don't know. It's still open,

1061
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:33,320
but I don't, unless something's changed, but like last we checked a month or two ago, it was like,

1062
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:38,600
the employees were just sadly dribbling a basketball all day, not talking to anyone.

1063
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:46,200
Yeah. So, but I, yeah, it's interesting. It's interesting to think about this type of thing.

1064
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:51,800
Cause it is, again, we were saying like these companies feel like, well now like Disney can

1065
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:55,880
never go away, but it is like, you could install a couple of different people in different roles and

1066
01:36:55,880 --> 01:37:02,200
they could totally ruin it. It could happen. Like it's not out of the question that, that stuff

1067
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:06,840
can really drastically change in the course of a few years. What we're seeing with the country,

1068
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:12,120
how you install the wrong people and maybe it won't be around for, things aren't set for.

1069
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:17,880
So yeah, we'll, we'll see. I mean, everything on the horizon for the most part looks good

1070
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:24,040
for the parks, I would say. Yeah. Yeah. But we'll see. I mean, I don't like, well, I think people

1071
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:29,240
would agree. It's weird that like Eiger is the hero of this thing. He has overseen a good era.

1072
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:33,720
I think they're giving him too much credit in this thing, but you know, he's approved spending

1073
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:40,120
in parks. He's, he's, he's such a good, he's such a good businessman. So it's like,

1074
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:46,280
Eisner feels more hands on with all of this stuff. It's not that he had the best ideas,

1075
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:51,400
but it did feel like he was working where it's like Eiger buys star Wars. He buys Marvel,

1076
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:57,160
who is, which is already cooking. He bought, he like, he, he fixed the Pixar. He installs

1077
01:37:57,160 --> 01:38:01,640
the Pixar people who seem to have been in a better groove than their own animation. And they

1078
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:09,000
are overseeing all the movies too. Yeah. And then, yeah. So he's like saying, here's what your ride

1079
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:14,040
should be called or, yeah, he's not getting in the mix there, but at the very least he's just like,

1080
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:21,320
well, we'll see that's doing well by it. Yeah. So it is a benign figure that is approving money

1081
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:27,080
that goes to things that we like. He is sort of ensuring the future of the company, but not doing

1082
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:33,560
it internally. He's not having it grow from the inside. He's attaching external things to it,

1083
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:40,040
which to be fair to him is the, what's, what's going on with every company. Yeah. It is like

1084
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:45,880
some other giant telecom would have bought Marvel or star Wars. Like that would have happened. So

1085
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:51,480
you can't be mad at him completely for being a creature of that, but it does feel a little less

1086
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:55,960
homegrown, which I know is also like, who gives a shit? What does that matter?

1087
01:38:56,440 --> 01:39:00,120
Especially as we talk about an episode where it's like we put star Wars in the park and it was

1088
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:07,320
great and everybody loved it. But it does feel like Eisner, it would, yeah, the, there is a feeling

1089
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:12,360
of it coming from inside as opposed to outside. There is a feeling I have about it and I don't

1090
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:19,640
know if that's fake or I don't know what that is. I mean, I think this chapter seems to be like the,

1091
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:26,600
the like nitrous hitting the engine for Imagineering, like really hitting a stride,

1092
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:33,400
couple generations in people doing it, who grew up with it, passionate, the passion is there and the

1093
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:39,240
money is there and the follow through is there. Yeah. And I think I would be interested to know

1094
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:44,520
what people now in Imagineering are saying, cause they have so many projects. They are pumping tons

1095
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:49,080
of money into Florida. Like they're doing Marvel stuff. They're doing stuff in Tokyo. They're

1096
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:54,600
building a couple of different. Hong Kong, they're changing the castle. Yeah. So I wonder if it's a

1097
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:59,320
feeling now where it is like that again, where everyone does feel like it's busy and you can get

1098
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:04,360
stuff approved or is it just still, is it still kind of a little restrictive in the sense that

1099
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:09,080
it's all movies? I wonder, I don't know. Yeah. Is that IP thing a problem or I don't know,

1100
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:13,960
but I give them toy, it gets money and toys to play with. Yeah. Yeah. At the very least stuff is

1101
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:22,920
going on there and it was not the case a decade ago. Yeah. Well, I mean the sort of the cliffhanger

1102
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:30,120
of this part three is kind of that, like after the failure of Paris initially, we got to like

1103
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:36,040
get things back on track and there's weird, like maybe theming is out the door. Maybe we don't do

1104
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:42,920
parks anymore. We don't do parks anymore. It's a, that's a heavy one, but you know, hey, we know

1105
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:47,800
what happened to things picked up and we get a lot of fun in part four because part four is

1106
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:56,040
our beloved superstar limo. Yeah. And a different superstar imagineer or T5. Four. No, he's four.

1107
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:01,880
He shows up in a couple, I think. I guess he's in four and five. Yeah. Has some very successful

1108
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:08,600
endeavors. Yeah. So yeah, so that's a tease now for next, what are we doing this next month?

1109
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:14,120
I guess maybe. Yeah, I think so. Coming soon. Yeah. Second half of Imagineering Story. So you

1110
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:21,480
survived some of what has been the one of the lesser comedic episodes of Podcasts, right?

1111
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:26,040
We were just, there was a lot of analysis and stuff. Old man getting it. That was funny, right?

1112
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:29,480
Yeah. Oh, that's funny. I think there were funny things. I would say like,

1113
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:33,960
sometimes we get a little analytical, but that's what we're allowed to do. I like that. People

1114
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:39,400
asked for this. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. This is your fault. No, I had a great time. No,

1115
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:44,120
I'm saying it's a thing that's on the table that we can do. We don't have to be, you know, Mr. Bit.

1116
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:54,680
All the damn time. It's exhausting. Yeah. But so, hey, plus us up as I said a while ago,

1117
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:58,760
hashtag plus us up. Tell us something you want us to watch on Disney Plus. But in the meantime,

1118
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:02,760
we're going to do a part two of this. We'll talk about episodes four, five and six of Imagineering

1119
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:08,760
Story. It's stuff we liked and we're really, we're going to have a lot of fun, right? Yeah.

1120
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:14,920
Right. Yeah. Okay. Well, then that'll do it. And I'm like looking for one more thing, but I don't

1121
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:21,960
know if I have it. Tell us which CEO you think can get it. Not just CEOs, but presidents, higher up

1122
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:28,440
figures in general. Yeah. Yeah. Like vice or higher, I'd say. Right. And David newscasters,

1123
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:35,720
like David Brinkley, reporters, Peter Jennings. Do we like, and what is the hottest age Charles

1124
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:42,200
Groton was ever at? Is it this age or is it when he was younger? It is probably, I would guess

1125
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:47,880
probably like modern life or real life. What is it called? The Brooks movie. Yeah. Real life.

1126
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:51,880
Modern romance. Yeah. That's why I was transposing. That's what you're talking about. No real life.

1127
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:56,600
You're like, yeah, he's not in. He's not in. That's Albert Brooks. But yeah. Okay. You have

1128
01:42:56,600 --> 01:43:02,440
your assignments. Get to work. Chop chop. Bye.
