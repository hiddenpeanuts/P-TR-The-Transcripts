1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
joints

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,120
Born with Northfort

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,860
Upbeat music

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,720
Started with a complete blues

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,920
Upbeat music

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:32,160
Alright, nice leisurely Club 3 beginning. None of that pressure, you know?

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,720
We get to just like ease into the pool here. Yeah, I like it. This is none of the pressure of having to remember your guys names

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,080
We can just start and it's no one needs to know our names

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:49,900
Just like just easing into it like we're all just unclothed easing into a jacuzzi together to hang for two hours

10
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,240
We are recording this at the Los Angeles Los Angeles famous we spa

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,780
The spa in Koreatown would someone I think suggested we do as an episode topic

12
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,560
I was confused by that suggestion. Yes a spa is a as a themed experience

13
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,040
It is a themed experience. I think there's some tropical ish rooms

14
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:19,080
Yeah, I know I think that's actually a good idea. I don't want to do it maybe right now, but eventually I mean

15
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,520
I'm not just the bar with themed car washes of what yeah

16
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,440
Yeah, I don't you'd answered it with their tropical stuff

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:26,680
Yeah

18
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,800
Cuz I when I I was in a I went and got a massage years ago with the Planet Hollywood

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,680
casino in

20
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,560
Las Vegas and I remember going into sort of the room with the showers and everything and it felt like I was like

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,000
It was with my friend Luke I was like it feels like we're on planet like Vulcan

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,920
We're in like some kind of like futuristic kind of otherworldly place in here. I really like this. So okay

23
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,600
Yeah, I think I place making and yeah, so what you're saying is partial nudity feels alien to you

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
Full nudity feels

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,300
Yeah, I was like look at all the dicks around here. This feels like planet Vulcan. This is like the Vulcan

26
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:09,420
This was a spa not just some particular this wasn't some this wasn't a Star Trek convention after hours

27
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,060
And this was in the Las Vegas Star Trek convention at like 11 p.m

28
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,060
One of the bunch of guys naked wearing the Spock ears

29
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,180
And some some people who decorated their penises the way that they think maybe

30
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:28,840
Like a Klingons penis would look right what does Klingon circumcision would look like with the war blade that they do it

31
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,840
It's not it's a ritual that we all know

32
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,840
Sure, right

33
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,720
Yeah, yeah

34
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,120
Well, well, okay

35
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,280
Well, there's an idea right there because we have to talk about I don't mean to start these episodes and immediately go to what we're

36
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,120
Doing in the future. No

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,100
Yes, how do you decorate your penis properly at a Star Trek convention is a viable topic?

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,720
But to talk about a couple other

39
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,220
Topics that came up in this month's poll. There's one I want to say really fast

40
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,980
I'm really excited that people want to hear me do the universal tour

41
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:15,200
I'm very flattered by that, but I will just say there's bigger plans for the tour down the road

42
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,820
This has been talked about for a while. I don't know when it's gonna happen. I don't know. That's the next year thing

43
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,060
So don't worry. That's that's coming. We don't got a club three it but there is another

44
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,500
thing and

45
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,180
Before we get to Disney dollars, which is which is today Disney dollars was the winner

46
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,220
But we established the rule that the runner-up

47
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,860
Lives to fight another day that they're up in the next round and I just want to say a quick word about

48
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,460
Let me read the full

49
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,460
suggestion from Shane Cannon

50
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,160
Show your penises to each other at Los Angeles is famous. We spa

51
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,420
All right, thank you Shane for that thought and yeah, we're absolutely down and

52
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,780
showing if you want

53
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,620
No, no, no, that's not wait a minute. We're reading the wrong Shane Cannon

54
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:05,060
Suggested this please discuss the failed Canadian Garfield restaurant

55
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:13,160
Garfield eats the failed Canadian Scooby-Doo frozen food brand Scooby-Doo eats and the founder of both of them

56
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:21,060
Archetypal guy quote-unquote and noted hyper narcissist Nathan Masri now

57
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,800
It was too much to put that all I don't know. Maybe we could have put that full text into the poll

58
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,680
I'm not sure but I just left it at failed Canadian restaurant

59
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,040
Garfield eats

60
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
never has a

61
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,800
Suggestion called to me so strongly. This is a this is a true siren song

62
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,880
I'd go across the ocean to to discover to learn more about

63
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,760
Garfield this were this really this just this just hit me

64
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,080
I don't know how you guys feel but I wanted to take a second to vouch for

65
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,860
And and look I'll just say I and endorse the idea

66
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,680
Failed Canadian restaurant Garfield eats the reason it's so attractive now on its own Garfield eats Scooby-Doo eats, whatever that sounds great

67
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,480
We would love to look into that when you add in a guy a new guy

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Guy using the term guy

69
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,760
Happy makes me so happy to cake. Yeah, so that's why yeah, it sounds so intriguing

70
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,200
We are dying to learn about guys

71
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,400
Yeah

72
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,120
Dying to go into spas and dying to learn about guys

73
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,640
Yeah, and then he that he kept going is what I like. I think there was a minute where I'm I'm loving the polls

74
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,200
I'm fascinated by the moment. I start to watch them and like, okay, this one's breaking ahead

75
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,400
But these two are neck and neck like this

76
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,480
Failed Canadian restaurant Garfield eats was neck and neck with the Universal Studios GameCube game where you have to pick up trash

77
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
And I love both of these

78
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:53,140
I know I didn't want to be fighting for one over the other but then Shane gets in the comments and starts

79
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,840
Campaigning further and I'm gonna read his full quote

80
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:05,320
But just to again just be I in to further his campaign because this I saw it turn literally he wrote this and then there

81
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,000
Were more votes after it sure way out of the pack

82
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,400
People listen to me. This guy is fucking insane Nathan Masri

83
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,320
He's at fashion cafe levels of insane if not more this story's got everything copyright disputes

84
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Bizarre original characters weird one-off attempts at doing a reality TV thing insane corporate

85
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,880
terminology self-help books

86
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,880
Entergaging digital content that is some of the corporate terminology

87
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,480
He invented the acquibius term of entergaging Wow the deification of Jim Davis

88
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,440
Garfield creator very intense anti-boomer sentiment and more so please please please vote

89
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:56,520
Garfield my gosh, what a list got more tantalizing than lasagna is the Garfield. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No that sells it pretty well

90
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,240
Yeah, yeah, so we're not gonna tell you what to do

91
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,680
No, you got a pretty big Disney theme park

92
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,680
Pretty pretty bit. It's kind of like a blockbuster like with Netflix

93
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,840
You know surprise it's the Super Bowl and when the game's over you get a new Cloverfield movie on Netflix

94
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,320
You know, I think that's how that release panned out. I may be conflating

95
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,820
I think you're right. I think it was a new color when there's just a big

96
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,760
unavoidable thing in culture like the gray man when there's something that each and every one of us is talking about that's

97
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,920
Dominating every conversation we're having like the gray man is right

98
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,040
Yeah, we run into on the street with our family and friends our parents the milkman

99
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah, the milkman as well tips his cap. We're all little red notice boys

100
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,520
And now we're all little gray men boys and where the boys go now. Where do we go? I think maybe we go to

101
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,680
Orange, I mean I guess we're red. We were little and now we're orange

102
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,840
I guess we backtrack and we've become spider head boys, you know

103
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:07,200
You guys know spider head spider head is the big budget blockbuster starring Miles Teller

104
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,480
Yeah, and the Hemsworth that play store

105
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,960
It's based on a yes. This is the came from the director of

106
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,060
Mission of top Tom Capric that came out right after and yet. No one was talking about that

107
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,440
Yeah based on a George Saunders short story

108
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:28,360
I think from right around when he went one of MacArthur genius grant acclaimed author George Saunders and it just

109
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:35,480
Dropped right as Maverick was in the middle of like demolishing the box office and I have not heard any

110
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,160
Mention of it Wow. Well people are look we we flew with miles

111
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,240
we watched him make the offer we watched him and

112
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Very accurate Al Pacino

113
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,680
Go through all the steps of making the godfather. So maybe people just ready

114
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,960
I can't believe I'm saying this

115
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,440
Maybe people are ready for a little miles break and I just mean for like three weeks

116
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,400
Like it was just weird to do with that. Sure. Yeah, absolutely

117
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,040
We'll be back. Yeah, you know, hey, that'll be one of the topics next time to just talk about Miles Teller

118
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,880
No notes. You don't get notes

119
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:13,360
You just get to just talk on the top of your heart about your love of Miles Teller free associate

120
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,560
Anyway, are we just like condemning other topics? Yes to the yes. This is oh boy

121
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,360
It is this that maybe this is collusion is this what would you call it? What is I don't think we said any rules

122
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,760
I don't think there's a constitution that we have to abide by no. No, I think we're okay

123
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,300
I think we're not breaking any I don't think so, but do maybe people want to try maybe that will like

124
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Turn against it fight

125
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,480
Again, like maybe people want to try to take it down to slay the beast, right?

126
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,520
I mean, maybe I can just yeah, I mean obviously I threw out the idea that Liberace puppet

127
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
ventriloquist performance

128
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:58,340
Yeah, throw that in so stuff so so yeah, I don't know maybe either people could rally around this or people would feel like you

129
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,040
Can't tell us what to do and then they'll vote that we need to review

130
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,680
Everclear songs from an American movie part two or something. I don't know

131
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,880
That seems like the strategy is gonna be such a grand swell for Everclear songs from American movie party. Yeah

132
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,840
we will see

133
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,120
but I just I just wanted to give that some some time and

134
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,160
And boy, I don't know I when there's a guy calling to you there's a guy

135
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so leave your comments below what you want to hear if you want to try to if we want to try to take on

136
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,960
Garfield eats. Mm-hmm

137
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:38,460
But I don't know babe best of luck to you're gonna be you could be the spider head going up against the top gun

138
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,400
It's gonna be like a midnight and like a patreon club 3 subscriber

139
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,520
Well, their phone will ring and it'll be an unknown number and it'll be a muffled voice

140
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,720
And go look I just need you to do the right thing here

141
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,840
I need you to vote for the right thing and like Scott is that you and then the hang up and then that'll happen with

142
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,400
Everyone and I know we're very loyal. I know we're very smart

143
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,560
50 extra looking for all I'm looking for is

144
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,560
200 extra votes for Garfield eats and if it doesn't work, you know what you're gonna do you have to send Rudy out

145
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,280
And he'll find him

146
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Crack team that's right

147
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,320
It's done somehow and if not, we'll get our revenge in four years

148
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,240
Damn it you pay him and Rudy will go and try to get people to vote for Garfield

149
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,680
He doesn't give a shit as long as he's good thinks he's getting money. Oh, that's true. Yes

150
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,620
All right, if somebody sends this to Rudy Giuliani, yeah

151
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:40,180
Your starting rate will be three thousand dollars an hour right money that you will definitely receive and Rudy if you don't take it

152
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,820
You know Robert Davi will that's true

153
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:48,280
What did Robert Davi do for I don't know. He's just kind of a Trump guy. Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, he's a sleaze

154
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,480
I didn't but I was like, babe. Was he actually deployed along with the sit down?

155
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:59,540
I don't even really believe it. Yeah, I don't he might have been working pro bono, you know trying to get in the yeah

156
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,340
Well for you working for exposure

157
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:07,540
He's working for exposure to get in the like whatever the Hollywood version of like pure flicks. Whatever you call their

158
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,260
the Kirk Cameron movies

159
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,040
The Gina Carano ex-kirk Cameron movies

160
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:20,320
He'd be in as the king of the heavies if he's already doing stuff like that. I forgot. What is he famous for him again?

161
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:26,540
Why do we know Robert Davi like old like he was just I think he was a supporting actor in some movies

162
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,900
There's like a big one. It's like under siege or something like that big action. I don't remember

163
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,000
Has a license to kill. Yeah

164
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Okay

165
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:44,080
Records probably goonies. Yeah, that's what I yeah because he did a he did a funnier die video and part of the

166
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,520
stipulation was that he

167
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,120
Get to it some like turn to camera and say and buy my album Davi does Sinatra

168
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,720
Always in die hard. No first I heard. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's like a number one. I think

169
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:06,240
I believe that's either funnier and I'm remembering season music if you can believe that something that a very Trumpy guy is also

170
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,240
Is it?

171
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,000
Okay, threat Trump fan and creep. Can you do you believe it's possible?

172
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I hard believe

173
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,720
Okay, we are here to talk about the today's time. Let's focus on today's topic

174
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,240
Which was which one after the previous round?

175
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,040
It came back and got it

176
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:32,640
Suggestion from JF co the original crypto Disney dollars company script

177
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,800
Corporate script as Wikipedia points out. This is company money

178
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,320
Yeah, yes. This is a private company in the world making their own money

179
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,160
For you the the consumer to spend because there's another I think there's a tie

180
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,760
I don't know the ins and outs of script. I remember this idea existing at school

181
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,320
But there's like script that you give to your employees

182
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:02,960
Yes, that's now what's happening here because we are the customers and we can choose to get their script the

183
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,560
like like

184
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,720
miners

185
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:15,100
Mining companies would pay their you know, it's kind of stranded in homestead like kind of can't leave the wilderness

186
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:21,240
miners in company script that you could use at the company store. Oh

187
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,960
I see so it's like if Amazon paid in Amazon bucks their employees which we're not that far off, you know

188
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:36,040
No, well, wasn't this the Elon Musk's revolutionary plan is that you get you go to Mars and you get paid in Mars bucks

189
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,580
Well, I yes you get paid a Mars bucks and you work off your trip to Mars. Yes

190
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,080
Yeah, everyone on Mars is an indentured servant. Mm-hmm

191
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,280
Yeah to their well-toned boss God Elon Musk

192
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,080
Yeah, he had the many secret babies

193
00:14:52,560 --> 00:15:00,000
That's most either people reinventing the concept of buses or reinventing like slavery

194
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,400
Mm-hmm. They all figure it out. They'll crack it. He had to bring it into the 21st century, right?

195
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,640
Yeah, just with a spacey futuristic twist and it made sense that they would be the whitest man

196
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,080
The you know, the literal whitest man you've ever seen a white South African who could have foreseen

197
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Who could have foreseen that coming?

198
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,060
Look, this is not malicious like that. I don't know think Disney dollars

199
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,720
I was like I was waiting for in look I'm we're gonna learn about Disney dollars

200
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,460
I think I was waiting for the malicious turn and I don't think I found it other than it's like a way for Disney to

201
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,440
Make lots of money by making money literally

202
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But that's isn't this what they do?

203
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,420
All the time and now they do it in these ways that are dull and not ways where you get

204
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:57,240
Fun looking money. I think it looks fun, right? I always liked it. Oh, I loved it. I definitely had some Disney dollars

205
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
It was a fun like little souvenir

206
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:07,240
It was a fun like way of like, okay, you have five Disney dollars to use on souvenirs. Like how are you gonna use it?

207
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,480
It was a good it's a good little

208
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
practice money

209
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:18,960
Situation for kids. Yeah, and I would always say I mean I definitely have some at my mom's house of the the blue and pink

210
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,320
$1 one the early generation ones

211
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,840
But I researching this I saw somewhere I was like I had no idea about some of these designs

212
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,520
Well, yeah, I was shocked as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they went into what 2014

213
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,320
2016 Wow. Yeah, that's pretty far. So that's time to incorporate

214
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,020
Lots of characters into the fold. Oh, yeah does not have to stay at Mickey goofy many

215
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:51,200
No, a lot how many friends started to appear? Yeah, it could be Iron Man at that point and all his his friends

216
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:57,360
And I found a page there is still a page on the Disney World website of how to use Disney dollars

217
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
Because while they do not print them anymore

218
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,860
They still accept them as legal tender at the domestic parks in America

219
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,580
Okay, Disney Cruise Line some locations at Castaway Key

220
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,260
You can be a swimmer. You're on the private island

221
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:19,720
You're swimming around and you can have Disney dollars with you to bartender and Disney dollars and Castaway Key

222
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,300
That is my one one of my questions I had was there a high roller

223
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:30,820
You know people if they're playing blackjack or or poker and they they throw a chip when they're leaving for to tip the dealer

224
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,420
You always got to tip your dealer. Yeah, we're there where their Disney lounge lizards

225
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:42,300
Who would like tip the bartender and Disney? I'm sure there's no way there weren't right? Yeah, no way there weren't

226
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:50,860
I don't not good. That's not good. Now. We're in this now. We're in this I mean, I think well you could you could redeem the dollars at least

227
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,300
Seemingly pretty easily for regular American currency

228
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:02,860
Yes, I think you I think completely the the extent of your Disney dollar day could be hey

229
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,700
I have these can I get money for them? Yeah, so you could do that

230
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:12,860
But it's just with the somebody you're tipping you're just adding another step they have to do but maybe they had it in the register

231
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:18,240
I don't know that's so maybe they don't make the exchange themselves. So who knows? Yes, but yes, there's got to be like

232
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,220
Weirdo Disney people that keep the keep a keep a Mickey for yourself

233
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,220
Did anyone bribe someone with Disney dollars now that's a question

234
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:36,980
Oh boy, like can you get us to the front of this? Can you get us the front of phantasmag? If you know what I'm saying?

235
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,620
There's a Captain Jack Sparrow in it for you

236
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,340
Or there's a pirate skull whatever it was. There's like a skull logo

237
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:51,400
Disney dollar. Did you see those the pirates? Yeah, the movie one. Yeah, I read the movie parts of the Caribbean

238
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,620
Yeah, a Disney dollar. Yeah, I bet somebody did

239
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,900
Try to bribe someone with that before did anyone I know this is a thing in Vegas

240
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,540
I've never tried it. I want to try it. Do you know about the $20 trick?

241
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,580
when you put the $20 in like your

242
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,540
Slide use a slide trick. We're trying to bribe somebody right? It's even easier

243
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,660
It's when they say can I just need to when you're checking into hotel?

244
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,580
Yeah, they say I need to see an ID and your credit card

245
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,340
You put the 20 between them and you ask are there any upgrades available?

246
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,380
Okay, but there's mixed reviews some people

247
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,860
Works others say like if you're staying at like win or

248
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,700
Win or encore or like a Bellagio or something

249
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,580
There's high role like those are high-end places. You might have to try a 50 or a hundred

250
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,480
Too rich for my blood, but I do want to try you've never tried the 20 trick

251
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,060
No, I want to I do want I want to and I wonder if people try it at Disney

252
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:58,360
I've never tried it Disney, but I did try to tip the person was really nice who checked me in when I stayed at

253
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,660
pop century and

254
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,740
They were with the college program and I asked them about it and I tried say I said thank you

255
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,060
And I tried to tip them they're like, oh front desk. We can't take tips

256
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,940
I was like, come on. You're in the college for come on. I know they don't pay you a lot like I and she's like no

257
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,500
I'm sorry. I can't interesting. So that 21

258
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,740
$20 a trick won't work probably Disney. Yeah, I don't know about that

259
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,020
But if you're gonna do you're gonna try this and they you're going to Vegas. I am going to Vegas

260
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:30,780
I am going to try it. What tell right? Huh? What hotel? I don't know when this episode is coming out. That's after that

261
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
park MGM

262
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,020
Make sure it goes out tonight now. Yeah, I'm gonna put this episode

263
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,600
No, it's not not the month yet. It's not the right month yet. You're fine

264
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,160
Are you seeing so so in or get in a car get to Vegas and this is your chance to see Jason

265
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,880
Yeah, are you seeing soul sonic? What are you doing? What are you doing there? Sole son? Oh the

266
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Yeah, yeah

267
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,400
It's great. Yeah, I bet it is great. I think it's 250 at least you're in for 250 if you want to sit anywhere good

268
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
But it's probably awesome. Oh sure

269
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,200
So try the tree this is wild. Not bad. Yeah, we'll try that night. No, but it'll be in September

270
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,240
Yeah, the Aerosmith will be back

271
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
So, okay to try the 20 trick

272
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,320
Yeah, see if you can get into our show back

273
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,160
I I have heard people say like if they're not down for it

274
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:27,480
They'll just say thank you, but I there's nothing available right now and give you the 20 back. Okay. Yeah

275
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,680
I think it would be really funny if they kept the 20

276
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,640
Said there's nothing available. I would be laughing the whole trip

277
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,560
Yeah, sure not like

278
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,320
Furious months later, I'll be furious

279
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,320
It's like gambling you know, you only gamble with money you're willing to lose sure, you know, of course, yeah, yeah

280
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,000
But this money this not this

281
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,240
Sort of fake money except not I guess it's not I mean like that

282
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,440
I mean, I think that the thing that makes this stand apart

283
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:15,800
Where it's not just a fancy way of doing gift cards is that the legal tender nature of it?

284
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,360
Yeah

285
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:22,400
And it is that they went all these steps to make it like real money to print it in a fancy

286
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:29,360
Manner that there are the security measures. Yeah, they really did this up like cereal numbers

287
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,540
What yeah serial numbers here on the various raised the paper is raised

288
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:39,660
So it's like you can tell if it's fake or not I recall the the texture of it

289
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:44,140
I remember it feeling you know, it's yeah, it's elevated. It's better

290
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:50,280
It's better than just a piece of paper. Oh, yeah was I don't I think my this is my memory of it

291
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:56,260
That I always wanted Disney dollars, but my mom was like why we just use our money. Let's use our money

292
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,960
Very good question. You're like extremely good quiz like we don't want to get stuck with a bunch of Disney dollars

293
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,120
So I was just like, oh, come on. I want fun money. I want characters

294
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,820
I know I don't want yeah fucking presidents who gives a shit but Mickey. Yeah, Mickey on my money makes sense

295
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,080
but but the more I think about it like

296
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:20,300
When you had it, do you remember like where you know money is dirty and gross was who are Disney dollars

297
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,300
Do you remember were they like fresh crisp or were they like?

298
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:29,740
Oh, yeah, this has been in somebody's pocket for six months. Maybe they didn't I don't think they were giving them out as chain

299
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,260
I think they maybe had one turn around the horn. Okay, cuz I wasn't sure about that up

300
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,220
I just don't remember seeing a dirty Disney dog

301
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,980
It makes sense that they didn't give you a dirty Disney dollar

302
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,440
But I don't think that yeah, I don't think they're handing you and the one and two and three

303
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,840
But I didn't see it when I was was looking through this stuff

304
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,840
I was like, I'm not sure cuz I

305
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,820
Imagine yes, they would be like if some Disney dollar looked like it had been to the mill like there no way

306
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,820
They're handing out to a guest. Yeah

307
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:05,020
No, I think they're keeping it crisp it's like the parks themselves like they've always got a look spick and span right?

308
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,820
Make sense. Yeah, you don't want you don't want to start getting it's like phone numbers

309
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,460
Written on it and like, you know

310
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:20,380
Crude objects or body parts pointed into our favorite characters. No, that's true. No, we don't want that mommy my my

311
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,860
Disney dollar says

312
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,220
Clinton crime family on it. What does that mean?

313
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,620
Yeah, no, so so I don't know I

314
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,020
Wonder I'm sure they would have to yeah, Disney would have to take a dirty Disney dollar

315
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:41,080
But they would not ever hand up a dirty thing. So and they're brighter. They're brighter than dollars

316
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,820
They were also slightly larger than us

317
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:50,540
Okay, more difficult to fit in your wallet. Yes. I kind of remember that I remember the envelopes

318
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:57,180
I remember the envelopes are very reminiscent of the old Disney store with kind of the like the very like 80s pink stripes

319
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,340
Yeah, and I remember them existing. There's you ever seen an original in there. Oh, there's the envelope

320
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:08,500
Yeah, someone is selling on eBay this one which comes with the envelope and this I had never seen before this is a

321
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,620
2000 it's got the 2000 Epcot ball on it. Okay. Yeah, they would do like anniversary

322
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,420
Batches, which I know I don't remember seeing any of these like these other ones. I just remember

323
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:26,440
Classics. Yeah. Well, it's if this was happening now

324
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,000
Jason I think especially would be on the blogs being like, oh my god

325
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,840
Did you see what they're putting out like you got to see this like lightning McQueen has his own Disney dollar

326
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,520
We got to go down and get the new dollar. Yes

327
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,560
Yeah, if it was happening now, even though it was happening while we were still obsessed with other stuff

328
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,880
But we just weren't it wasn't on our radar. It didn't occur to me. I think that it was still going

329
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:57,320
In the 2010s and it also didn't occur to me that like it was over until they're like yes done

330
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:04,960
We're not doing it anymore. I do think if he wants a cheap win a cheap pop Bob Bob

331
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,360
Chay Peck if Bob Chay Peck was like we're bringing back Disney dollars. I think people would go like yes

332
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:17,660
I think so. I think yeah, even though it's just a literal like financial exchange. Yeah

333
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,660
It's something about I don't know it's just more friendly and

334
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,820
Silly than a lot of the other stuff lately

335
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:30,620
The one dollar bill has the big red panda from turning red and the five dollar bill has Grogu baby Yoda

336
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,240
And people are just like oh my god

337
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:41,740
I'm carrying a wallet. I'm using cash again and then ten dollars has George Clooney from Tomorrowland on it. Oh, yeah

338
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,560
beloved three beloved characters what else would it

339
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,200
Starts in May 1987 we start with Mickey on the one goofy on the five

340
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,120
1990 mini joins on the ten and I think other denominations

341
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,200
Showed up after so maybe talk about the the starting

342
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,240
Of it. J.C. You were alluding to there's there's a couple versions of the story of why they started doing this

343
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,400
Yeah, you were saying one of them. I

344
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:18,280
The name I kept coming across was Harry Bryce who was credited as the silhouette cutter on Main Street and

345
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:26,240
He went to a Disney Anna convention, you know collectibles and tchotchkes and stuff

346
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,540
And he was like man people are spending money hand over fist on this stuff

347
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,740
What if they just what if we had what if Disney just had their own money?

348
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:43,100
Mm-hmm people would probably and he is probably it this story is probably, you know apocryphal

349
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:48,940
But like he is right and I'm sure there was the thought of and then people are gonna collect those dollars

350
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:56,680
In addition to using them as dollars and he's right because I have been to there's a Disney on a convention every now

351
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:03,460
And then I'd like the Anaheim Wyndham and there are vendors gone to that. I went to one of these a few years ago

352
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,800
I haven't been back but I get their postcards every few months

353
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,780
and

354
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:14,980
One or two of the vendors just has binders and binders of brochures napkins Disney dollars

355
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:20,860
There's like all paper product vendors. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well and then just also as far as

356
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,480
the idea of gift cards alone

357
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:30,980
Gift cards are I believe a very big moneymaker because there's some percentage of gift cards that just go unused

358
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,280
So it's a really good way for businesses to make money in general because if you

359
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,820
Force people to have to spend the money at a business

360
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,860
Oftentimes people will forget or they will lose the gift card and I don't know what the percentage is

361
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:50,640
But it's a very good moneymaker for for a lot of businesses because they will not have to redeem all of the money

362
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,720
That people are putting into their gift cards

363
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,760
I saw a number a guess from a Disney executive about how much money there is in unspent

364
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,320
Disney dollars

365
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,700
Disney dollars that were never put back into so that are sitting somebody's drawer

366
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,320
20% I don't think or not a percentage just a number

367
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:18,080
How much money did Disney make on Disney dollars that were never given back to them one million dollars?

368
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,960
25 million dollars two hundred

369
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
Two hundred

370
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,320
Millions and millions of bill of literal bills. Yeah. Yeah, we probably had it seems very positive

371
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,200
I thought before this I should probably go check my my childhood bedroom

372
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:39,940
Yeah, because some of the intent of it was like I'm not gonna sell this and this is like

373
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,280
If we keep it crisp, that'll look nice later

374
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,640
I feel like there was the intent to oh, let's see if it accrues value

375
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,640
Which I they have but not to like I still don't know how you're like

376
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,000
I don't but there are probably people who've made good money

377
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:03,360
Well, if you the Disney dollar collecting if you look on eBay, I feel like it's like maybe three times

378
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,920
What the currency says around that?

379
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:12,520
I think even well, I mean I kept seeing like there's depending on what it is for sure

380
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,040
So the the 2001 that comes with an envelope

381
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,080
I think that was going for like 30 bucks on eBay. They go for even more on

382
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,120
Hold on. I gotta find these website names. They're so good

383
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:28,280
Those are like Disney collectible specific. No, no the bank note collecting websites

384
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:35,360
So they go for even more on bank note world calm and they're really high on boolean sharks

385
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:44,360
And I gotta say once I started digging in it reminded me I love little peaks into niche areas of

386
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,280
collecting

387
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:52,040
That I I I just get the gist of it and it's like there is a whole other world

388
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,160
He little terminology little terminology

389
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,680
Damages and little like nicknames for things and it's joyless

390
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,840
It's not they have not had fun doing this for decades some of them

391
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,840
But some of them are probably slogging through it. Yeah

392
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
Yeah

393
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,240
The what is it their departure website our departure board calm?

394
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,320
I think is the website I found and they talk about like you want to buy a bank note album

395
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,440
Okay, and you'll either get like a three slot

396
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,800
Pages or two slot pages now that Disney dollars are a little bigger

397
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,260
So you probably want a two slot page and you don't want steer clear of PVC

398
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,940
Polyvinyl chloride because it can degrade the notes the album below is made of

399
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:45,740
Museum quality PVC free acid free material and you got a new mess. It's a new miss brand

400
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,960
So, you know, you're not willing to pay for new miss then don't then stay out of the game

401
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,500
Yeah, just throw it in a garbage can light it on fire. You know, why bother?

402
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,140
Do you have one of those in your bag here that you're gonna show us?

403
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:03,260
I started I was gonna say and they couldn't bring a new miss out in the elements. Yeah, you're right

404
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,260
That's to the human

405
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:12,280
Yeah, you want to keep that room completely perfectly climate controlled. Yeah. Yeah, give it its own room get it

406
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:19,660
Yeah rent an apartment with a bedroom that you only put your new missus in no PVC a mile mile nearer

407
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,660
That's restraining order against

408
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,460
Absolutely

409
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:30,020
Yeah, no, it's this very specific word, but it's I clearly like patience required to

410
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,940
Get it up to the point where it's making you

411
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,780
Because that this is one of the things I wanted to I was wondering about is this initiative this premise from

412
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:43,320
JF co who suggested the original crypto is there is there any truth to this?

413
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,860
How does it compare contrast to crypto now?

414
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,460
Here we have it

415
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:54,060
There is a very literal people have it as a crew like I kept it and then in the years since now

416
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:58,720
I'm able to sell it for this on eBay. So there's growth there. So here's what it is

417
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,280
Here's what I would say comparing it to even of any currency

418
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,880
The big thing with Bitcoin that people say is good is that there's a finite amount

419
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,600
You can never print you can never make more

420
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,240
so

421
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,880
Mm-hmm

422
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,460
so it will accrue value because because the like, you know when inflation happens stuff oftentimes is because

423
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,480
We've printed a lot of money in like American currency

424
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:28,700
so I feel like Disney dollars became more like Bitcoin once they stopped making them because there is a finite amount now that's

425
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,160
processed like

426
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,200
So the real they made that shift exactly

427
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,520
Yeah

428
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,640
So now it is a little bit more like that when there is a fun unless they start printing again

429
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,620
Which I guess always possible right now. There is a certain fixed supply now. We don't know what it is

430
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:48,480
I'd be interested to know how many dollars exactly were printed. Do we know that I don't okay?

431
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:55,440
Somebody might and if somebody should know it if they go through the records, but so again, I cite our departure board.com

432
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,440
As a full list of Disney dollars that are like the letter are

433
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,920
Our departure board

434
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,720
Pirates oh

435
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:14,320
You are departure board. They have a list. I don't know if it's I'm sure it's not everyone in circulation

436
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,120
I think it's all the serial now all the varieties. Yeah, and you can have that document for 750

437
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,840
Seven dollars fifty cents. Oh, okay, and it says all the varieties that have ever been made

438
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,740
I believe that's what it is, but it doesn't say how many of each have been made or does it?

439
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:32,460
Well, if it's got the serial number ranges, I guess you could then

440
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,160
Do the math. Oh

441
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,160
I see. Yes, that's you're right. If it does have the serial number we could figure it out

442
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,600
We have to get our hands on this document those go from zero zero one two

443
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
Yeah

444
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:52,220
Number things I know okay, so there's this the serial numbers sequence of numbers

445
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,920
There is a letter at the beginning and at the end the one at the end doesn't seem to mean anything

446
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,240
the

447
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,320
Prefix which is the letter at the beginning?

448
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,780
Tells you where this dollar is made for

449
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,040
ABE was for Disneyland D F is for Disney World

450
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
T was for the Disney Store

451
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,440
This is similar to if you look at a dollar bill

452
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:22,360
There's a letter on the serial number that tells you what meant that dollar bill comes from there's like a dozen

453
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,440
Or no, I think there's seven or eight big mints across the country

454
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,520
So on the letters the letters on a dollar bill go through like a through

455
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,520
Whatever it is J or K. Maybe it's 12 so you can get a full set of like eleven dollars

456
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,560
One from each of the mints does that make sense?

457
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,880
If you're a money collector you look at the serial numbers and you can tell like oh I want to have

458
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah, something from this bill for me a year from every mint. Yes, uh-huh, right and then you put it in your thing

459
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
What is it called?

460
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,240
banknote no, but the book the book the

461
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,200
Was it cold? Oh

462
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:07,640
Forgot already new miss new miss. Thank you. Okay. I need to write these things new man for future

463
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:14,800
Everything new miss the phrase I was trying to remember was philatist which is stamp collector stamp collecting

464
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Wait is a philatist philatist

465
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,040
Ph it does sound probably saying it wrong

466
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,880
Phil at e li st

467
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,640
Mm-hmm

468
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,840
Philat I mean, how would you sure are we sure on that pronunciation?

469
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,560
I was reading the dictionary calm

470
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,880
the

471
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,880
phonetic

472
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,440
The philatist. Yes, that's not can that be real Israel? I mean, I know that's the word

473
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,120
fully

474
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,920
flately lately specialty in flately. Yeah

475
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
for lately for lately

476
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,720
Wow

477
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,720
Yeah, how else are you gonna pronounce that word?

478
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,240
I had like two losses a little kid where I went maybe I'll collect stamps

479
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
I am going to be a flattest mother

480
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,640
They put out the Elvis stamp and I was like, maybe I'll collect stamps. I just started taking them off

481
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,880
Letters that had been sent like birthday cards

482
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,760
Only like a quarter of them were new stamps and then a bunch of them were just to use stamps

483
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:28,560
I was like, yeah, I think I'm done with this and then every few years I'm like, oh, I gotta get the Pixar stamps

484
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,480
I gotta get the Bugs Bunny stamps and then they sit on my desk and then I go like why I need to use

485
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,160
Stan I need to mail thing like I'm not gonna save the wall

486
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,960
You've made attempts at being a philatist. Yeah, but then it's like well, I gotta pay my tax

487
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,460
So Bugs Bunny and the mermaid Bugs Bunny is going to the government. So he drafted in. Yeah

488
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,480
latest I mean for a for a

489
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,680
Hobby that you would get made fun of for for it to have that name is pretty insane

490
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:03,680
A hobby that you would get picked on for being like a nerd is pretty crazy that that's that's the word to describe

491
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,540
Yeah, that's one you only use among, you know fellow travelers

492
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:12,400
So, you know, that's you don't use that you don't tell your kids at school that you know

493
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,960
Are we we're missing an L guys, isn't it?

494
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,560
philatelist

495
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,560
Philly which I think helps it

496
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:25,060
Philatelist is what I'm seeing unless that's a different. Okay. I guess yeah, here we go

497
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:30,900
I think that I think the L does a lot of heavy lifting. We're not it. We're not in the fellatio realm

498
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,620
Of course it has an L

499
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,980
That's madness

500
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,240
Do it how to pronounce sing on and it's

501
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,340
From it we just wasted

502
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:53,100
Philatelist here's the thing from the latest to philatelist in the course of a few minutes

503
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,180
My god, I love this

504
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,940
No, did you wait a minute? Did you have the L in your notes or to bail?

505
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:06,280
No, I mean I was looking at the like upside down letters spaced out

506
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,860
Pronunciation and I just kind of was a typeface. Yeah

507
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,820
Yeah, that list is in there philatelist

508
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,860
Yeah, philatelist now here's a quick now

509
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:21,020
We say a lot the people are screaming into their phones the right thing on this now

510
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:27,700
I would be shocked if there's more than one person listen when I look at the philatest philatelist it says for lately

511
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,380
so

512
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,980
Dam collectively, so it's philatelie. So that's where I thought

513
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:41,700
So it's fuzz. It's a pH. So I don't think we're not even pH is fair. Yeah, it's pernet

514
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:48,860
Yeah out loud. It works better than written. Yeah, I'm looking I'm staring at the written word philatelist and I see no issues here

515
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:55,100
No, you're right now that when I'm looking at the actual word, it's not that's if I scroll lower. Yeah. Yeah, you're correct

516
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,560
I don't think we're gonna have stamp collectors mad at us

517
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:03,580
I think we're gonna have trivia experts mad at us to like know this term because it was his jeopardy answer

518
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:07,260
It was a bar trivia scrabble. Oh scrabble is a good one

519
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:12,800
A lot of points on that only you don't if you won a game with philatelist that might be the only way

520
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,620
This is in your head. I've looked up philatelists

521
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:22,220
And I don't think that's actually a word so we'll be okay. All right

522
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,980
There's something that says diary of a voracious philatist

523
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,460
But I'm not

524
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,820
A film

525
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,860
What media are we talking? It's a live journal I think oh

526
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:41,020
Jesus that could go any direction. I'm not gonna read it. I don't want to just think this is called three

527
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,480
I understand but then that club random, okay, we're not gonna get that saucy

528
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
But

529
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:56,800
Let's how let's let's get back into the realm of dry and talk about an old man who used to run the

530
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,960
Disney Jack, no, not Jack

531
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:08,680
Here we go an hour but now we're gaining steam where they were going down the roller coaster Jack Lindquist everyone's saying this was a

532
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,760
I always liked the vibe of this guy

533
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:18,840
This is like this seems like a nice old man who was the it wasn't always old I guess but he was part of Disneyland

534
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:23,280
From like just a few months in he was working for another company

535
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,780
And then he visited Disneyland while I was getting built and he said he fell in love with the place

536
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,520
So then somebody from Disney called him asking for somebody who's good at marketing and he said what about me?

537
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,800
And he was there just a few months later

538
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,360
And then that led to a career that ended in him being the president of Disneyland the first

539
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,540
President of Disneyland there was no such thing as this. He's like kind of like that winky old man

540
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,240
Does he do what I'm saying? Like he kind of has that little wink charm

541
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,440
Does it make sense? I need a little more context. Are you saying?

542
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:59,520
Winking or a wink Martindale? No, not wink Martindale. I'm saying like, you know kind of that like I'm an older man

543
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,360
Hey, how are you doing there slugger winking when you say that?

544
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:09,360
Yeah, wink mean he's a folksy kind of guy. There's nothing malicious about no. No, I think it's a pure

545
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:14,480
It's a way it's like a sparkle in his eye. He's like an old st. Nick like

546
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,440
He has a st. Nick

547
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,200
We're saying refresh my memory

548
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:28,760
When we did the Toontown episode was he the one at the ground break the older guy at the groundbreaking saying this is a very exciting

549
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,440
Endeavor yes. Yeah

550
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,320
You seem to think someone was weird about I think you didn't like him is what I remember

551
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,400
Oh, it was weird about that speech

552
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:44,920
I forget there was something about the speech that might have bumped for me and I but I don't remember what it was now

553
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,720
Mm-hmm. I think maybe it was

554
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
the like

555
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,720
Background guys the guys dressed as like costume construction guys and like

556
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,040
They were sweeping or they did his intro really weird. I don't know if it was him

557
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,040
I think so. I think that's right. He would have been open. He like is he still there, you know

558
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,440
They look like probably retired right before Indiana Jones open

559
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,920
But he was there when they started building it was pushing ties nerd

560
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,280
You got to do a second park and was still alive

561
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,400
To say and then that led to California adventure, which I didn't think was very good

562
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,200
Yeah, then he's been said but I liked the you know when then cars land and they figured it out

563
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,240
But he was still as there's a lot of the old Disney hands we're gonna run for a while. Yeah, sure

564
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,760
Yeah, he got out cut out on top. I feel like feeling period

565
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:43,160
He didn't like yes, unlike, you know people in the Senate. He enjoyed some retirement

566
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,160
He didn't just like well, yeah, like drive his brain into them into mush and oh, yeah better

567
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,000
Like what if I leave when I'm happy and everybody's happy to see me?

568
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,800
Your golden years like chewing down warm corner bakery salads like

569
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,640
What a way to go

570
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:08,800
This guy brought a lot of things to the park grad nights. He's attributed to having invented

571
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,080
Wait, did I not say this is Disney dollars are associated with him?

572
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:17,920
This is like we considered one of their things that he yeah, there was some brought some there was some I was a video

573
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:23,320
Which video does so but like this I've heard that the guy talked about that story about the silhouette painter

574
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,540
But also then like some people think it was just Jack who did it. It was Jack's idea

575
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:31,880
I really listen to the recall on or this part was intense on Mouse Planet where

576
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,720
The writer and his Jim Cork has said

577
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:40,400
He says he thought of it not the silhouette guy and this wouldn't this is not a man who I think would lie

578
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,560
He's a straight shooter and I take him at his work. So they're calling out maybe silhouette guys alive

579
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,220
So so I don't be a liar quirk is still he digs deep

580
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:54,600
I mean he seats has done a lot of Disney history stuff. He came up on the contemporary episode. Mm-hmm

581
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,600
Mm-hmm. So he might know I

582
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:02,660
If you looked him in the eye with Santa lie to you would old st. Nick tell you a fib

583
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:07,220
I don't think so. I don't know somebody who's winking all the time. That's fine. That's true

584
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:13,560
I'm waiting for me in a lot of things. I suppose not sure like oh, yeah, I invented did he Disney dollars wink

585
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,600
I

586
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,020
Guess that's a different right there all those winks. Yeah

587
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:24,160
He invent, you know, he did like any of those anniversaries the 30th and 35th where they're given cars away

588
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,400
That was all this doing they didn't really celebrate anniversaries. That was something that occurred to him

589
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,940
Why don't we we need little reasons to like that's such a funny thing that they didn't and that's the one guy thought of it

590
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:42,060
Yeah, now everybody does that every place every part excuse any yes. Yeah. Yeah feels like something

591
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:45,900
Alright, right. He even was like he said like people don't really celebrate 30th

592
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:51,900
Anniversaries and whatever who cares. Let's try it and we're great. All those were really fun. Yeah

593
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:58,820
Disney dollar anniversary anniversary Disney dollars specifically. Oh, that's right. It all tied together because he did

594
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:02,980
Yeah, here's a print for the 35th or for the 50th or whatever. Yeah

595
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:07,780
Another weird thing I found out about Jacqueline quest is from theme park insider

596
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,460
something that he was doing in the 70s was

597
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:16,060
spearheading the initiative to get different countries to participate in

598
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:22,100
World showcase to have a little pavilion version of the country in Epcot and

599
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:27,260
The interviewer asked what was your favorite thing you got to do as part of that and he said well

600
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:31,180
I'd have to be when I spent those five weeks in Iran. I

601
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,720
When I spent so much time with the Shah with the Shah of Iran

602
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,080
meaning Muhammad Reza who was the

603
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,680
The last Shah of Iran because when so Jacqueline quest is hanging out with him

604
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:50,120
And they're talking business about the little theme park that maybe they'll do and then a year later

605
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,480
He is deposed in this huge crazy

606
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,280
Revolution. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah the shop famously a brutal man

607
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,720
famously brutal ruler installed by the

608
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,600
United States

609
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,640
intelligence agencies helping along

610
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,320
He I think are

611
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:15,600
Probably when jet when old Jack is talking to him about and then there'll be maybe a boat ride about the history of

612
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,160
Persia and the heat they had that ball ago interesting. I like that

613
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,840
Maybe I don't want to get wet. This is happening and he has like

614
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,440
50,000 prisoners of war like political prisoners

615
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:34,100
He's torturing also as in this year because it's okay. So all these meetings are a year with a year to go

616
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,300
Before he's

617
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,300
Exiled and then he dies a year later

618
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:45,800
Cancer is ravaging is by horrible horrible cancer is ravaging his body and he's still taking the time to like

619
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:52,020
Maybe a restaurant would you know, we're gonna have a Ben Franklin animatronic. You should see it sometime

620
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:58,140
His idea is kind of cross-boundary, you know borders and you know, it's styles of government

621
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,900
Everyone could learn a thing from mr. Franklin

622
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,940
It's called future worlds and you'll be able to see it

623
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:11,140
Yeah, okay. Well, what sorts of hats do you like here where I could see our way into putting Donald in one?

624
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,100
Sounds good. Hang on. I'm being called to the other room

625
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:22,740
Grenades who is this ayatollah character?

626
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,940
Jack

627
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:29,640
The ayatollah is asking for me one second

628
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,780
I have been putting off this call for weeks

629
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,040
Jack's just like sitting there like not paying attention. What's going on the back room?

630
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,360
You eating it like a Mickey ice cream bar and like just like smiling

631
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,580
Exit from

632
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:52,460
Iran was very much like Argo sort of situation, but it was more mr. McGooey

633
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:58,440
Yeah, I was just enjoying it's like I really come come to like rosewater and in food

634
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:05,100
For those usual sounds on the plane and it was like it's like the entire city is exploding behind. Yeah

635
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:13,820
Great big beautiful tomorrow. I love that song. Don't you? Yeah, then weeks later what happened in Iran?

636
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:18,460
I guess we won't be putting that in the ride. Oh good golly. I had no idea

637
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:22,140
That was the nicest looking hotel we had drawn up shame

638
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,580
You know that too. He's trying to figure out the Persian Hotel. Oh, yeah

639
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:37,100
Really weird so look Jack was was everywhere and coming up with great ideas and hanging with great people

640
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:43,360
And that kind of came he traveled so much and he said I was flying back from a trip to Europe

641
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:49,760
And I was going through my change and there's there's Franks and Deutschmarks and pounds and I thought you know some of these countries

642
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:55,900
We just visited they you know, we do more people per year than their population. So why can't we have a currency?

643
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:02,260
It is it is right it is funny it is also like we are

644
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,280
Very powerful and we should have our own money there is that's also part of it

645
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,720
I suppose it's that you could now it's this is the other if now shape back did it

646
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,680
Then like the the Santa's faction would all be so enraged

647
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,220
Oh, yeah, yeah as if this hadn't happened in the 80s. All right, right

648
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:22,400
This would be used as the sign of their out of their mind

649
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:30,480
Well, you know, they'll be saying, you know, this is the great reset Disney is gonna accelerate the great resets of the word New World Order and

650
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,480
That's what is the great reset

651
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,360
Believe it's like where you like everyone's currency goes to see I could I really actually don't know

652
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:46,760
but it's like a full reset of the like worldwide economy and and global politics and yes, it's sort of a I

653
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:52,720
Guess it's a fringe idea, but I wouldn't be shocked if it was like 15% of people in America are worried about it

654
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:59,580
Yeah, I mean there's also along the same lines. I bet some of the same there's some crossover with the people who

655
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,460
Do you guys know about the denar the Iraqi denar?

656
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,380
So this was this was a currency in Iraq

657
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,820
and

658
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:15,460
It essentially became worthless after Saddam, I think was deposed

659
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,580
and

660
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:23,300
Or maybe it's the current currency in Iraq. I forget very low exchange rate, but

661
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:29,780
People were buying it up in droves because they thought Donald Trump was going to

662
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:38,140
Go like one Iraqi denars now worth one US dollar so they would have stacks and stacks of denars. Oh

663
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,180
That would were worth people were doing this

664
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:49,580
Trump judge Trump people like the same people Americans are buying people who are complaining about the gold standard

665
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,660
Okay, and just tweeting at Donald Trump every day. Mr. Trump, please

666
00:51:54,740 --> 00:52:00,260
RV I feel like they would say RV the denar and that was some term of like reset it

667
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,060
Reset and make it worthwhile

668
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:07,980
It's some of them may have been soldiers in Iraq and just got out with a lot of denars and they're like I know

669
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,340
They've got a lot of work. It's like Confederate money. It's worthless

670
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:17,880
Yeah, it says Donald Trump supporters think the president will make them rich if they buy Iraqi money. Yes, 2018

671
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,400
So, you know

672
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,240
So there's a couple yeah a couple things going on. So yeah, if Disney all of a sudden today did their own currency

673
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,320
Yeah, they would think that they were like this is part of it. This is book and speed. Yeah

674
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:36,920
This is money for pedophiles only or something. This is pedophile money that if we don't have the you need the right kind of

675
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,480
Blacklight you bright you get through if you get a lot like you have to switch it between

676
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:46,460
Three different types of black light really fast and then you'll see like the secret symbols

677
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:51,560
Right the American dollar and the American dollar will be worthless in five years

678
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:58,960
But the the money with Mickey will be that will be the one that will be the world currency in five to ten years

679
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:06,500
It's a Disney dollars. So we'll have to go to their parks and yeah learn their agenda. Yeah, they're fascist pedophile agenda, right?

680
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:11,300
Yes, that's right. It's both of those things. Yep. Same time. So yeah

681
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,480
Yeah, it would be interesting if they try if they did it

682
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,200
They bring it back because people yeah people will go nuts

683
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:23,480
But I honestly the stuff we're saying there will be article people will be Alex Jones will be saying the things we're saying about

684
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,760
Disney dollars. Yeah, that's not crazy

685
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,440
That will go on

686
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:34,740
The the way that Disney dollars arrived on scene

687
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:39,240
There is some like odd kind of real-world intensity

688
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,080
To it. Yeah, anybody see the video Scrooge maybe

689
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:52,840
Yes, because this is important the Disney dollars are signed by the treasurer Scrooge McDuck. Yes, that's so everyone

690
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:58,040
No matter what character is on it. Scrooge McDuck is considered the official Disney. Yes

691
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,520
And so and Tinkerbell usually is on the front

692
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:07,520
Uh-huh kind of like, you know symbols their symbols on our US dollars Tinkerbell is the symbol

693
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,360
If Mickey even Mickey's not on it

694
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:16,240
There's some sort of character or landmark on it and there's a Scrooge McDuck signature, which is pretty funny

695
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,600
That's a pretty good detail. Yeah. Yeah, I do like that

696
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,720
And not only that but on this particular day on the launch in May 1987

697
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,920
He showed up in person

698
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,560
In duck to make the first handoff

699
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,400
Earlier today an armored truck arrived

700
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:40,640
Scrooge McDuck McDuck is the Disney dollar treasurer and after he made the drop-off

701
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,800
The Magic Kingdom money became available to every Disneyland guest

702
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:50,740
including Tom DeArcey who came to Disneyland all the way from Pennsylvania to buy over

703
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,440
$2,000 worth of Disney dollars

704
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,520
This guy's getting huge stack

705
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:02,400
But the point that why I wanted to show that and I'll post that somewhere is that that it's a that an armature that a Brinks

706
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,320
Truck arrives pulls up into the end of the hub or not the whole whatever the plaza

707
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:16,760
Scrooge McDuck gets out has a big sack and just kind of smacks it onto a ticket counter

708
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:22,560
really aggressively and follows that up with just kind of like a smack of the just pounds the

709
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:28,920
Really like aggro a real aggro move from this old duck. Yes. It's very

710
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:36,380
Violent I love any especially funny because he's four feet tall. He's very barely gets above that counter

711
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,540
And he's a giant old duck. Yes

712
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:44,680
And then there's a man who appears to have backpacks from Pennsylvania like that's a hiking backpack

713
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,320
Yeah, he's got a he's got a funny vibe. Yeah, he looks like when Mark Parosh was the yo-yo guy

714
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,680
Talking about yes for any old backpack. Yeah

715
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,080
stack of

716
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,080
Two grants somebody I think bought

717
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:03,960
Ten grand the first day some people were saying this is my kids college fun

718
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:08,400
This is like there were there were high you know for what which you never I don't know

719
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:14,280
Maybe if they held out and are these the people who were making these eBay transactions or these

720
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:21,440
Our financial ladder I forget the name forgetting all the specifics if you can imagine I would yeah

721
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,880
I would love to hear their plan at the time because obviously like I

722
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:33,840
When you go to the airport or when you fly overseas, there's always you know conversion rates between currencies between so like were they hoping?

723
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:38,840
That that would have what something would happen. We're like Disney dollars would decouple from the US dollar

724
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,200
Like what was their long-term plan here for this being?

725
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,540
What's the man in that like the dollar would have to weaken?

726
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:54,560
Yeah, the Disney dollar is so strong right then you just you say you can live like a king, right?

727
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:58,240
But I don't think in America. It's possible. I don't think that's possible unless

728
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:06,320
Disney was using Disney dollars for everything they were doing they were paying the government and Disney dot like yeah

729
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:12,680
You would have to be yes all of their money would have to be and you couldn't like cuz you all the exchanges happen in

730
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:17,200
Disneyland or Disney Disney stores so you would have to

731
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:23,040
Like they you have to be like the cashier is like crying or don't make me hand you this cat

732
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:29,300
We can't afford this. Yeah, so we're just we're hemorrhaging money if uh, uh, yeah

733
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:33,000
Cuz I would know to go back to the crypto Disney dollars when they were printing them

734
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I think were pegged to the that's the phrase pegged to the US dollar

735
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,840
So if the US dollar appreciated or depreciated Disney dollars would go up or down

736
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,980
So I think the only time that they would have ever

737
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:51,960
Gained value would be now when they were years ago when they stopped printing them when it's speculators when now space

738
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,560
Are selling them on the secondary market?

739
00:57:55,080 --> 00:58:01,840
Right and it's mostly for kitschy weirdos who want to do that. I guess but

740
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,320
Money isn't real anyway

741
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:10,480
So you're saying not just not since they got rid of the gold standard. That's a good gold standard. That's right

742
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,040
Well, so I don't know how it worked out for the ten grand

743
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:20,400
I don't see they they they made more than two million dollars worth in the in the first round

744
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:26,400
The the first run the first run of it was it was a guy who just bought

745
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,520
$75 worth a

746
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:34,600
Buena Park hairdresser and he left with and Mickey came out and shook his hand and I mean that makes it work

747
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,240
He's and he got a plaque and the first Disney dollar was

748
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:42,200
Embedded in it. So I think he won because he spent less money

749
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:48,840
It's not like they gave the plaque to the ten grand guy spent 75 bucks and he got to meet Mickey and get a plaque

750
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:54,320
That's pretty good. Yeah, it's pretty good. I I'm realizing a flaw as we talked about

751
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:00,200
Change that if you have a $10 Disney dollar and you bought a $5 toy

752
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,200
Or let's say a five

753
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,000
That cost five dollars and sixty cents with tax

754
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,800
You are getting coins back

755
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:18,400
Yeah, American currency are getting probably American regular currency. I guess you could get four Disney dollars and forty cents

756
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,440
That's probably if you wanted it, they probably give you the option

757
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,440
Depending on if they had the the change

758
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,840
This is something that occurred to me as a weakness in this whole thing. This is fun

759
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,680
We got ones and fives and then tens and twenties. Where are the coins?

760
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:37,720
Where the Disney we like our tokens we we liked the coin from

761
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:43,840
Zalem from a lead of battle. Oh, yeah. Remember the coin from Zalem. Yeah

762
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,920
I still have my coin yet. It's worth the money. Yes

763
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:52,740
I probably had anybody with 80 bucks. I think she's really at least a year or two ago

764
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,920
Who's the kings of silly money now?

765
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:01,560
It should have been coins though, obviously like well and I maybe this is this might be worth a little thought

766
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,920
If these are just equivalent is it penny nickel?

767
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,560
dime well, so

768
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:15,260
Here's what I was they supposedly they were floating the idea of doing three dollar bills and seven dollar bills initially

769
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:22,280
Yes, I love that. That's so funny. It's so funny and they should have done it because well why though because of

770
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,280
character yeah little pigs

771
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:31,240
Seven chores Wow, right. Yes, so but if you start

772
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:38,360
That I think that's so fun that it's these insane amounts, but I started going like, okay if I alright

773
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:42,600
I'm gonna exchange I have $60 and I want

774
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,400
Sevens how?

775
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:50,960
Like you're in the you're in a theme park in the heat. You're trying to divide seven into

776
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:55,440
60 or whatever it is. Uh-huh. That's a brain breaker

777
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:03,160
Yeah, it's not it's not as that the five C ones fives and tens simple it's very simple easier to yes even numbers

778
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,160
I think that being said

779
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,440
Everybody has to learn a little advanced math for the sake of fun

780
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,940
Yeah, you know, that's your belief in Jenna. That's because that's why you like

781
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:17,880
Everything that Disney World is instituted because it requires advanced math

782
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:25,140
To get on a ride. Well, yeah, I don't like the thing that's been happening apparently where you have to what is it?

783
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,800
Like stay up till midnight and then get up at six o'clock

784
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:34,560
To like complete like whatever the reservations you need the next day. Whatever it is

785
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,960
Has it gotten worse? What are you talking about?

786
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,800
You're now locked into you have to stay up insanely late and get up insanely early

787
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:48,280
I pray if you want to get like your full like to get to be able to like get the fastpass or to get the

788
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:52,320
The genie plus what's the midnight? What do you get it?

789
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,000
I'm trying to remember there is some if you want to get I should look it up

790
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,140
But it's like look it up because when I was down there it was just setting my alarm for like

791
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:06,900
655 to just constantly refresh an app first off get off the Wi-Fi to refresh an app

792
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:14,200
It's so funny because that I'm like I must be crazy, right? It can't still be this bad and then trying it

793
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:20,720
I'm like, okay the Wi-Fi still this bad and all of the blogs of like how to do this thing get off any Wi-Fi

794
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:27,640
Use why do not be on Disney Wi-Fi, but do be on the app. Yeah, do keep refreshing

795
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:35,440
This is madness. How have we ended up here and that it's just like, okay, there's a new ride if you think okay

796
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,800
I'll just wait for it. Not an option fuck off

797
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:44,720
Buy it or you had to be really good at refreshing our notoriously bad software apps

798
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,880
It's just I saw somebody

799
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:54,880
Saying like I don't know if I agree with Scott and reheam that he's recently saying how Universal's winning the war and I don't

800
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,700
Know if that's across the board, you know

801
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:03,280
Universal Hollywood has its issues and lacks of magic here and there despite having the definitive greatest ride in the world

802
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,720
but I'm more mean the like

803
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:10,480
For I cannot wait to stay at Universal Orlando

804
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:17,000
Next time there is a Florida trip and not deal with any of this fucking horse shit. This is insane

805
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,240
What are you taught every new detail that gets added is crazier and crazy

806
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:26,960
So it looks even so relaxing and there's so many rides, you know, I got to do any of this and universal

807
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,360
Yes, okay. Here's what it is

808
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:34,360
So at midnight is when you can then purchase the genie plus for the next day, but you cannot start reserving

809
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:41,440
Reservations until 7 a.m. So you're if you want to do it all you're at you're fucked because

810
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,920
You have to sleep for six hours on your vacation

811
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:52,200
So wait, so can you you can't buy individual lightning lights at midnight you say you are buying Disney plus for the park

812
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:59,420
Jeannie plus yes, so it's like 1201 or whenever it rolls or 12 o'clock you that's when Jeannie plus and Jeannie plus does run out

813
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,360
Apparently, okay. That's why you have to do it at midnight

814
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:08,440
Oh god, but you can't make your first reservation of the day until well, but it is it's hotel guests

815
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:11,640
I think it's seven and regular guests at night something like that

816
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:16,580
That's why it's like they're forcing you to like get six hours of sleep or seven hours of sleep

817
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:22,200
Which is just a very bad system on a vacation on your

818
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,680
I mean you're in a hotel and now you have to yeah

819
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:33,200
Get up early and ostensibly you have entered this property past giant sign some of which I know they're deconstructing and rebuilding

820
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,180
That say the word resort on them

821
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:40,480
Which I have mentioned this before that does have certain

822
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,500
Connotations to it what that dude's gonna be pleasure

823
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:54,000
Relaxation I don't forget that some of the hotels take like an hour to get to

824
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:59,840
Via complicated transportation means so let's add that to it as well, right?

825
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:06,180
Yeah, but again the math of universal it's like, okay, we got three hotels that are more expensive granted, but

826
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:11,420
You could just show your room key at the park and walk on any ride basically. Yes

827
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:16,360
Yeah, it's working if it's working a lot and a lot of the rides have been so good lately

828
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,760
Yes, like the best so

829
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:24,060
Yeah, yeah, and you might not be able to do that at the brand new rides

830
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:30,440
You'll just have to wait in line, but then it's equal. It's an equalizer. Everyone just has to wait in line. Mm-hmm. You know, yeah

831
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,480
Insane

832
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,800
Here's one thing that universal didn't do

833
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:42,280
Better is the money I didn't know until today that there was a time when they tried

834
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,840
It starts it starts off bad Disney dollars. Oh neat alliteration

835
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:53,280
Universal dollars does those don't you didn't do anything there. You try to make that fun in any way

836
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I don't know what you call them

837
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:01,400
Yeah bucks. Well bucks. Yeah, it's dollars or bucks, right? You're only the two options

838
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,720
Well, I got one now. I got one for modern minion money

839
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,120
No, that's great

840
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:12,840
It's all the difference Bob and right right right. Oh, that's great. Yeah, that is good

841
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:16,740
Yeah, although I get maybe you need more distinctly different characters

842
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:21,560
too because you'd be confused by you'd have to branch out to the girls and grew and

843
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:27,920
That would help. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I need grew to be okay. Okay, but minion money is very good. Yeah, minion money is good

844
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,720
Yeah, but this was there was McDonald land bucks

845
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:37,880
You know there was a lot there were a lot of places doing stuff similar to this yeah, yeah

846
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,440
This definitely existed out there

847
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:45,560
I think Disney did it the best with the like high quality of printing and that it was really committed to the Universal ones seem

848
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:51,520
Just like yeah coupons essentially. That's what McDonald no recollection. I didn't need I've been the idea zero

849
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:56,200
This was like early 2000s. It seems like other parks didn't start doing this still a little bit later

850
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:02,520
Can anyone guess a character who was on the Universal money in the early 2000s

851
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:11,240
Let's think about their well of IP. That's some of the other it's like Mickey and Donald and goofy and then a universal you got

852
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:17,560
Woody woodpecker. Yes, what he would put Woody woodpecker is their Mickey

853
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:22,800
That's their one. I guess a lot of ways we find that Woody woodpecker is their Mickey

854
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:29,780
Can you really say universal is winning in general when that is what's happened a character who who's only

855
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:35,360
Presence in the last 60 years has been an unpleasant straight to Netflix movie

856
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,440
Well, I I did watch that video series

857
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:43,680
Recently and it did shock me that Woody woodpecker's kid zone

858
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:50,640
Was a late 90s edition because that's when they're like, this is our guy. This is gonna be our Mickey Mouse

859
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:57,320
There were probably yeah, there must have been big animated movie plans that build on when would epic universe

860
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:01,340
When will the Woody woodpecker mega land to be built? That's my question

861
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:04,800
Is that in the first four or we have to wait for the expansion for that?

862
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,680
He's were will find a world to his birdhouse

863
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:14,360
Detail do people this people we met do people like Woody woodpecker that much

864
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:19,880
No, have you ever met anyone? No, not when chilly Willie is on the table

865
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:25,480
I do like chilly Willie. I don't agree with that. But I was never like a kid is

866
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:31,340
Like yeah, Woody woodpecker. He's annoying. Yeah, he's awful

867
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:38,400
But yeah, does anyone like him out there somebody go? Oh, yeah, that's that was my favorite character as a kid say what you haven't seen

868
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:43,840
You haven't seen the other good Woody woodpecker novels that were written in 1951

869
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,020
Okay on the inside universal

870
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:52,620
Message board someone says I still have my mummy returns five dollar universal

871
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:58,100
That's pretty good like rotting mummy. Yeah, is there an islands of adventure currency?

872
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:04,100
Like is there anything that has like the the light tower or anything? It's all general resort. I believe

873
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,640
Which they like I they don't even own that no

874
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:13,740
Using to zone by Warner Brothers. You don't even think of scooby-doo being in the parks

875
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:16,140
You know what I

876
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:25,140
Mickey and boop is there any mini and maybe the answer for them is teaming up with a half interest in these two characters

877
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:30,220
Maybe nobody really cares about boop. People really care about woody people care about boop

878
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:37,600
I'm not sure why exactly but people fucking go nuts for boop. The people do love boop $10 $10 Spider-Man bill

879
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:42,980
Oh, that's pretty good. You should get that. Yeah, you should buy that but boop. Yeah, we should do a full boop

880
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:47,700
Episode cuz I honestly I don't I don't know a lot about but I don't know anything about boop

881
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:54,700
I don't know why but she's around super popular still to this day and I'm always shocked at how popular it's a license like any

882
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:59,100
if you if you would go to like a souvenir shop or like

883
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:02,060
Like a mall like go to the Grove

884
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:07,420
Go to the Grove and go to one of those like just kind of souvenir shops and boop is everywhere every way

885
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:10,700
Yeah, and but especially like towns that have like

886
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:17,700
Small malls and then there's just a store selling Elvis and I love Lucy lunchboxes

887
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:22,900
You're gonna get some boop there. Yeah, she's every she's everywhere and it's for some reason still selling

888
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:27,220
I think if you watch the Charles Fleischer cartoons, they're weird. I have

889
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:35,080
Great, but I was so strange. We should what we should do some boop. Yeah, we'll do it. Let's try to figure out why I mean

890
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:38,700
There's a why and a lot. Yeah, almost all the universal main states

891
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:44,420
We got a kind of an angle why we should do Woody too, but I'm less interested in that. Yeah, that sounds annoying

892
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:48,020
It sounds we don't have to do it. Yeah, do it don't don't

893
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:51,020
Don't tell us they're on

894
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:58,200
Woody when Garfield eats the main thing we know about Woody is the ha ha ha ha ha ha like the noise the noise

895
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:05,300
Yeah, of course would I don't think I was about to say people willingly watch this I don't think they did I think was a short

896
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,740
Before other stuff they're probably like god dammit of all the characters

897
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:14,120
I'm gonna go to try to force some pee out and I hope that this cartoon is over before the movie

898
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:20,260
I came here to see I mean I kind of like I think the the walk around costume solid like walk around Woody

899
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:23,260
That was kind of without his personality. It's fine. Yeah

900
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,180
Visually, yeah

901
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,060
but as far as

902
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:31,360
I'm trying to think if there's a cartoon that I like less that I watched as a kid or just like again

903
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:35,840
Woody was like on and I would see it and I wouldn't have said like oh I hate this but I'm trying to think

904
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,840
Of anything that I thought like found more unpleasant

905
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:42,840
Boop bucks if they called them boop box is good. Sure. That's true

906
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:49,280
But then you're a little then you're limited and like so that's so wait what it's but it's I can spend this anywhere

907
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:55,080
I could but yeah, it's boop bucks. What about Lucille ball and calm ball bucks ball bucks pretty good

908
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,820
Ten dollar. Yeah mummy returns for ten dollars

909
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:04,980
Jurassic Park gets ten and ten note. Yeah dinosaur burst and dinosaur that's

910
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:11,300
That's what I thought I had a dollar bill. I thought that was normal and then a tiny t-rex

911
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:14,260
ripped through the paper

912
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:17,260
Jurassic points that doesn't sound as good. No

913
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:19,980
That's I'm trying to think. Yeah, I don't know

914
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:22,580
Fred Mertz money

915
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:28,300
Ethel Mertz money. No, they don't have Fred and Ethel in the parks, which I've written written letters about but

916
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:34,720
They still haven't they haven't done there are no yeah, there is no Fred Mertz no walk around Fred Mertz

917
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,300
No walk around like you with a cane

918
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,820
JK Simmons

919
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:45,740
Oh, is it Mertz or is it the JK Simmons Mertz? Well, it's Frawley. He's Frawley. He's Frawley

920
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:50,380
They can all they can both coexist. I guess that's all is a different Captain America's right different

921
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:52,380
Yeah, the people are gonna want to see both

922
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,500
Encourages you to stick around all day, of course

923
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:59,300
Anyway, they they messed up that's not good

924
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:04,060
But you know what is good and and I'm gonna go ahead and say well

925
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:09,740
No, I don't want to say did you guys run into the other theme park that did this that had money?

926
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:12,780
No, I don't think I did Dolly dollars

927
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:16,540
All right, that's pretty Hollywood

928
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:22,560
I don't mean to shit on the topic that we're doing and that was chosen for us

929
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,660
But Dolly dollars are better. Look at these

930
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:33,720
Glamorous person who has ever been on money. Look at all the the gold and the frills

931
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:40,200
Look at the beautiful like it's her it's her on the front. You get to see every type of wig and every area

932
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:45,240
Oh, yeah, oh my god treasurer Dolly Parton. She's all of it

933
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,360
There's only one character at Dollywood

934
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:54,080
So she just has to be everything and then here's a count country fair on the back and here's Dollywood

935
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,600
Boulevard and oh it just gets me guy

936
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:00,640
We got to figure out how to get down there that'll really be the great colors great colors

937
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:05,480
So they're so vibrant the hair is better in each one than the previous

938
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,340
Each wig better than the last. Yes. Yeah

939
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:15,120
These these are joy. I don't know if they're still doing these good question. Yeah wonder

940
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Yeah, Dollywood rules

941
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,320
why in the Disney has to

942
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:28,080
Desperately invent all of these these lame excuses for characters when Dollywood had it is just they retired at one

943
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,880
There's a 2010 Dolly dollar

944
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:35,080
So yeah, they're recently at least

945
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:43,560
Huh? Yeah. Wow, these are years like decades of them at least these Universal Studios dollars are going for a lot on eBay

946
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:48,240
So these are we maybe we're the fools. Maybe these are all doing great

947
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:52,340
I mean, this was a great thing to invest in and we all messed up or wait a minute

948
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:54,700
We were children our parents messed up

949
01:14:54,700 --> 01:15:02,520
That's their parents should have been like these people there on the first day when Scrooge pounded his money bag into the onto the counter

950
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:09,680
My boy, I'm gonna next time I see my parents. I'm gonna say why didn't you spend ten thousand dollars on Disney dollars in?

951
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:15,140
1987 yeah, I could have a life then I went to the I gotta say though

952
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:17,380
I went to Universal Studios a good amount in the early

953
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:24,560
2000s and I have only the famous recollection not even of doll of these images

954
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:31,300
No, these aren't for this didn't take at all. Yeah, usually there was always standee signs of like

955
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:36,460
Your photos get all your photos in one place or like there was always the

956
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:42,260
Fucking internet cap like print out all your photos of the day on a CD and take that home with you

957
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:49,460
Universal's just getting around to some of the good ideas that Disney did 30 years ago as much as Merch is concerned and obviously back then

958
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:52,140
Anything that we're gonna do is half-assed by and large

959
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:57,820
So that means in 30 years Universal Orlando is gonna be perfect super

960
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:02,820
Unpleasant complicated. No, I'm so they're gonna be the whole thing. They're gonna figure out a way like alright

961
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:08,860
So you go to bed at 2 15 wake up at 2 30 we're doing it prison style and we make you do it

962
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:11,660
We start banging on the doors get up get up

963
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:16,540
Do you want to go on men and black alien attack or not? Uh-huh. Yes, they'll catch up then

964
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:21,180
I feel like I did see like there's a survey going around among annual pass holders

965
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:25,620
Would you like to reserve the day you're coming to Universal and everyone's like fuck you? No

966
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:27,660
Good yeah off

967
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:30,440
There is the rumor is that there's an original

968
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:35,900
Universal Hollywood horror Halloween horror nights maze called prison this year

969
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:44,140
Yeah, yeah once that's also the weekend is getting his own maze. I'm so excited about this

970
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:49,060
Weekend music blasting loud in a horror maze. This is awesome. I'm so excited

971
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:54,860
I'm sure they're in the liner notes or something. There's an explanation with the bandage gimmick. I've no idea what it is

972
01:16:55,420 --> 01:17:01,260
See in the maze. Yeah, we'll learn you said you're going to this year. I mean, we'll see we'll see wait a minute

973
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:03,260
I don't sound like doing it

974
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:09,220
Wait, what is this? What are the quote? What are the what are you gonna decide? You know what this time?

975
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:11,220
We cannot make that judgment

976
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:18,660
We're talking by the way here we're about a month out from haunt season, so you're gonna decide quickly

977
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:21,340
Oh, yeah, because that you have to reserve in advance

978
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:27,840
This is the opening day the opening day of of Hollywood Halloween horror nights here is the 8th of September

979
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:32,460
Hmm or the 6th you got to be sure but you got to make these decisions

980
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:38,060
I'm gonna make mine right now. Am I gonna go? No, it's easy done. You never promised that you never you never

981
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:41,540
Simple but frightfest maybe

982
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:49,260
I hated six flags in the regular day so much

983
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:53,060
Oh

984
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:57,720
Or not. If you want to go to nuts, we'll go to nuts. Not nuts is the best one

985
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:04,340
Not says the coolest seemingly but hornets awesome to most passionate. Yes, you got you got a variety

986
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:09,820
I've said this before but you get you get those teams. You're right. You've got a lot of been locked down

987
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:13,380
There's a lot of sliders at knots though. So you don't like those

988
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,380
Can we just talk about

989
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:21,500
Disney dollars we came across that we liked that's a good get out of here

990
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:26,980
I gotta say I do appreciate I think this was a pretty canny move

991
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:33,860
They made a $50 note. There was only two thousand of them made and they only sold them on one day

992
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:37,580
1955 you can see 1955 to

993
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:39,380
2005

994
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:44,980
50th anniversary of Disneyland. Okay, I think that's pretty smart. Mm-hmm thinking

995
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:50,460
Yeah, is that like when you when we're saying this these are the ones we would have wanted if we were into this

996
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:57,620
Like what what struck your yeah, like here's a $5 with goofy on the front

997
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:02,280
And I think it's the Liberty Bell riverboat on the back

998
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:09,260
Yeah, I used this I looked at the serial number and saw it was for Disney World

999
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:14,260
So I don't think it's the Mark Twain use the Shazam that you have for river boats

1000
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:22,700
Look the first angel investors seed money is not coming in

1001
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:28,940
There is not interest in don't need this apparently. Mm-hmm. Yeah, there's a lot of good

1002
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:32,380
There's like them. There's the space Mountain one. That's that's on one of the first

1003
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:39,380
Images there was a little run towards the end looks like 2014. There was the Mountain series

1004
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:45,780
Yeah, where it's the the ride on the front and Mickey riding it on the bat, those are pretty sharp

1005
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:50,740
I think by the way the style of all of these I mean my favorite is just the classic

1006
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:53,740
basic Mickey wave in and it's a really

1007
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:58,820
picturesque castle as is the the Liberty Bell the steamboat on the back I

1008
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:02,060
the riverboat rather on the back the

1009
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:08,060
I don't know. I the basic style of them stayed pretty great

1010
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:13,900
Yeah, goofy the goofy $5 bill is funny because he's like snooty. He's like got his nose turned up

1011
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:19,360
Which is not a choice. Yeah, not how Mickey and Minnie are they're like their normal happy selves

1012
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:24,740
But goofy looks like he's like full of me stuck up or something. Yeah, here's a mixy Mickey 60th

1013
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:26,940
65th

1014
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:28,380
birthday

1015
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:35,020
It's a Disneyland one because it's got the a and here's his house and the weird car. Mmm, the weird car. Yeah

1016
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:41,900
Bulbas car with eyes the cars alive. We don't know its name. Mm-hmm. It's uh, what there's so many

1017
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:46,060
There's like big. Yeah, you were saying there's the other rides. There's big thunder and yeah

1018
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:52,780
That's a very Fleischer studios thing like an inanimate object with eyes and it's a lot like I feel like every guy

1019
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:59,100
Mickey's on the ride in these he's not it's not like a ride car with eyes that I'm looking at. Yes

1020
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,820
Yeah, this face man one. He's just in the space mountain

1021
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:07,220
But yeah, there's so many there were some opening California adventure

1022
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:12,840
Ones which I don't always love that DCA 1.0 aesthetic, but I kind of like it

1023
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:20,060
Mixed with the stately aesthetic of currency like here's I do really like Mickey

1024
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:25,960
Climbing the the mountain like like with the bear mountain behind with grizzly peak behind him

1025
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:29,760
Seeing that bright yellow kind of annoying original logo

1026
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:35,960
On a dollar bill I sort of like well, there's the Disneyland. Oh, no, sorry. It's just a regular resort

1027
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:41,780
But I was gonna say these are I guess from around the same time, but it's got Mickey and Minnie with sunglasses on

1028
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:48,120
Yeah, like tourists. Yeah vacationing Mickey and Minnie, but it is the Disney. Sorry. It's a Disneyland resort, but it's got the bear

1029
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:53,540
It's the it's the castle and then the bear. Yeah, so obviously California venture was there at that point

1030
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:57,140
Is the bear still are they still pushing the bear?

1031
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:04,700
Is the we were all we talked about on the grizzly river rapids we were all kind of confused about the

1032
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:10,380
Years, yeah, which is great. I really think it's cool, but we all didn't quite know what it was

1033
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:17,140
Yeah, we had questions icon if you grew up out here and you're looking at the state flag with the cool bear on it

1034
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:20,620
Maybe you'd make the can I'm a you're more thing about? Yeah, that's true

1035
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:27,060
But it is yeah, there's just so many Disney dollars that they made

1036
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:31,980
Well, you got a Pirates of the Caribbean one and maybe here's a quick

1037
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:35,020
souvenir smackdown

1038
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:37,020
What do you think is the top?

1039
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:43,360
This is the on stranger tides bill a one dollar on stranger tides bill

1040
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:47,740
It's got the skull keep in mind. It's got the skull and

1041
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:54,700
Swords and then the ship the black pearl the black would not cherish this want this

1042
01:22:55,420 --> 01:23:00,540
What do you think the top version is going for on eBay and these have not sold yet

1043
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:05,300
This is the what somebody's trying to get somebody's trying to get I know if they're more rare

1044
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:11,700
And this is like a you know tie-in to a movie. So there probably was not as many made. It's just

1045
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:16,860
Regular Mickey or regular goofy. Mm-hmm. So that might put it in more rare. So

1046
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:22,900
I like I said, I think the millennial one with the Millennium logo and the Epcot

1047
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:28,940
You know the wand and the 2000 that was going for 30 with an envelope

1048
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:34,860
I'm gonna say like 75 for this one. Mm-hmm to 50

1049
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:37,620
Again, this is the top right the most

1050
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:40,020
Okay

1051
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:42,900
$10,000. Okay. Okay most expensive

1052
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:48,260
That somebody thinks they could get he's saying what was yours to 50 and 10,000

1053
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:54,100
You're saying 10,000 now I am yeah cuz he said that's the that's the highest one somebody's trying to ask somebody's asking for

1054
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,940
I'm gonna go lower. I'll say 1000

1055
01:23:57,620 --> 01:23:59,620
somebody's trying to get

1056
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:03,260
$500,000 for

Stranger Tide go to sold and or click on sold and completed on the left and see what it is selling for

That'll show you what the recent stuff is sold for basically

1060
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:26,980
Okay, if you see sold I'd have sold or completed and then it'll show you what's what the actual total people

1061
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:29,820
I'm not as eBay if I'm not seeing that on here

1062
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:35,860
Disney doll see if my before my phone dies here. I'll look for it strange. Did you look up stranger tides Disney dollars?

1063
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:40,860
I think I think it's just Disney dollars and most expensive. I see Disney

1064
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:45,940
I'm gonna look up stranger tides and they have an IC the listing you're talking about for five hundred thousand dollars

1065
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:53,220
And completed sold let's see here in edge keep it's the user elite coin one Disney dollar

1066
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:57,360
Has sold with the logo for 1499

1067
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,540
before that

1068
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,060
One

1069
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:06,100
Let's see. Was there something spot? Yeah, it doesn't it seems like all these are like 50 or lower

1070
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:12,660
This is you try to find the biggest rube paper money guarantee. It looks like it's been assessed

1071
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:15,820
It looks like it's it says exceptional paper quality

1072
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:22,520
So they're there. Yeah, that's gonna get you up into the 300 thousand dollars produced. They are out of production, but still accepted

1073
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:27,540
Elite coinage company is proud to offer the largest selection of certified Disney dollars

1074
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,300
Yes, because there's graded and ungraded Disney dollars

1075
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:36,580
This is like comic books in the sense that certain comic books are more once they've been graded by the official

1076
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:40,880
I forget the company that does it that grades them. So if you have an action comics, that's like a

1077
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,360
9.2 that's gonna be a lot more money than action comics

1078
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:51,220
4.9. Yeah, you slab it you put in a giant plastic case so no one can touch it

1079
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:56,560
Okay, and those are worth more just like the guys have here the two most reputable

1080
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:59,800
reputable Disney dollar grading companies in the world are

1081
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:04,760
PMG and legacy grading previously known as PC GS

1082
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:10,320
So if you got some Disney dollars and you want to get a grade it you got to give it to one of these companies

1083
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:14,560
I'm sure the people at Bank Note world or billion shark a bullion sharks

1084
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:20,360
But keep it keep in mind that PN PNC and the I don't know what you said

1085
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:24,840
Well, they've changed names, but I mean the quality the quality work is still there

1086
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:28,000
I just want to know where a philatist goes to get their stamps assessed. I

1087
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,960
Mean there's all again. These are whole other worlds

1088
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:36,240
I know we have just we haven't even cracked the book on we're just seeing the cover

1089
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:41,000
Burgeoning philatist and I'm wondering should I be putting my stamps in a new miss?

1090
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:48,920
Yeah, I guess great question, thank you for coming to the seminar you'd be tough to go wrong with the new miss

1091
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:54,400
You know, it's a great starting. I use them quite a bit. They're very standard, you know

1092
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:58,200
I oh wait one more that the let the bill

1093
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:03,640
The I as I was saying I find a lot of these aesthetically pleasant and I miss seeing them out in the wild

1094
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:10,920
It's only one there's only one that where they fucked up and it's this an area where they fucked up putting this anywhere

1095
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:15,280
Chicken little get the fuck out and I hate you chicken little

1096
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:18,840
Look bad at this movie. Am I being harsh?

1097
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:26,640
This movie looks like shit everything they ever put up in the parks that big balloon that looked like shit chicken little you met Disney

1098
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:32,060
You fucked up over and over again. I get it. I keep swearing chicken little makes me angry

1099
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:39,220
You've seen a little character. No, I've never seen it. Oh well now folks the sky is falling I guess

1100
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:46,060
What am I am I gonna watch it and fall in love with with little you know?

1101
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:53,740
All that stuff it's so much weight is on dizzy plus now and I got a I've been meaning to watch bolt chicken

1102
01:27:53,740 --> 01:28:00,660
Little brother bear home on the range like I just there is a to you want to I'm just so curious

1103
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:02,860
I want you I want you to watch it

1104
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:08,780
The only thing the thing I like about chicken little is that there is an original bare naked lady song on the soundtrack

1105
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:11,820
Okay, called one little slip. I've never seen the movie

1106
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:15,300
Mm-hmm, but the song is like kind of a ripoff of it's all been done

1107
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:18,420
They kind of like did the same they just maybe turned in a demo

1108
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:21,860
I think the Disney were like give us a new it's all been done and they did

1109
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:28,040
Yeah, it's like Mickey Mouse Minnie Mouse for sparks. They're like, yeah, we'll just fuck it. Hey, no get out of here

1110
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:32,400
That one those are both great. I just mean the thought process we tied the band

1111
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:41,000
Cynically thought of but they still have a good thing. No, it's got a web address. It says summer 2005 on it

1112
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:47,280
www.disney.com slash chicken little hit your web address out of here

1113
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:52,240
I don't am I wrong everyone that bit there was a big inflatable chicken little thing somewhere

1114
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:58,780
A couple of right there was a dog in the pole big chicken little hitting the pole change my mind

1115
01:28:58,780 --> 01:29:04,080
I'm sure you little chicken have the new have like everything now the cycles of nostalgia

1116
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:10,080
Are happened so quickly has the chicken little nostalgia come yet online. Have we seen it?

1117
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:14,760
I think we're gonna find out and either it'll be one person or it'll be

1118
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:21,240
Definite. Yeah, I don't know. We're in where am I one little slip fans at the bare naked ladies song

1119
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,480
Maybe they remember it for that reason too

1120
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:30,920
I don't know. Well Zach Braff's the main voice. I see her to guess that this movie will change my life. I swear

1121
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:33,220
I think that's fair. Yeah

1122
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,160
so

1123
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:39,640
Besides the chicken little buck besides the

1124
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:45,800
Flawless except for chicken little in your eyes. Yeah, otherwise they did great idle. These are nice

1125
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,800
I think maybe they could do it again

1126
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:55,680
You know, what's interesting is that these were they stopped making them Disney dollars died just a few months after their creator

1127
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:57,800
Jack Lindquist died and

1128
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:05,080
Mouse planet said it was nice that the father of Disney dollars died before he saw his creation eliminated

1129
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:07,520
Was it? Yeah, that's I'm like

1130
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,840
if I invented some fake money and

1131
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:17,080
I could get six more months on this earth, but I had to learn that they stopped making my fake money

1132
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:22,360
I think I'd vote for the the more time months. Yeah, I think that's right on store

1133
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:29,640
Yeah, I think that's right. I mean who knows maybe that was like every morning Jack would go like my is my money still around

1134
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:34,320
And they go yes, Jack. I'm already so maybe it was important to him. Maybe I'm crazy

1135
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:39,560
You need to go. Okay, and he give you the wink and then he'd go down about his day

1136
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:44,520
But I don't know any winked his final wink right and there or did he did he up to heaven?

1137
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:48,200
Did he find out like there was like oh, yeah, they're thinking about getting rid of the dollars and goes

1138
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:53,440
Oh, no, and that was it and when your wife dies and then you go, right? It's like

1139
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:58,200
Padme a Queen Amidala dies of the broken heart at the end of Revenge of the Sith

1140
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:03,140
She couldn't go on because of what happened Anakin they could now do

1141
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:09,580
Star Wars money and that's you know, that's great. They have all that like they you're supposed to do that double speak in the gift shops

1142
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:14,380
And yet they don't they don't have is you're walking around with Star Wars money

1143
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:17,180
Well, they did though they and I they have the gift certificate

1144
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:20,960
There was a little piece of metal a gift certificate like opening day or the first couple months you could have bought

1145
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:23,700
That was like worth I forget if it was a specific

1146
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:28,560
Denomination or if it was you could just add it like I think you had to add a yeah

1147
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:31,140
I don't know it almost bring this back kind of yeah

1148
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:36,140
But there wasn't a full like system like credits and you couldn't play the Lando card game or anything

1149
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:43,700
You could flip one of those bad boys on eBay easy, right? Oh, yeah, those are sold out those are sold out quickly

1150
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:49,060
I believe at least I don't know forks. I don't you write the for the spork things were selling they don't do those anymore

1151
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:53,200
But yeah, they should have done a full credit system. They should have gone all the way

1152
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:55,900
That would have been awesome and confusing and

1153
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:01,860
Extremely quickly. All right, never mind

1154
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:07,340
And they shouldn't bring it back cuz everyone will be think it's a conspiracy and that's true resetting there

1155
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:14,260
Okay, so you know what? Does he actually does he know is perfect. It happened and it's gone dad dad trying to use Star Wars credits

1156
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:21,540
To buy overnight oats and he's mad because it's cold. He's like when is opium cold

1157
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:23,980
look

1158
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:25,980
digital Disney dollars

1159
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:33,540
Mm-hmm crypto Disney dollars and if Disney dollars have they gotten into that that game?

1160
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:38,820
Yeah, no, but don't view you're crazy. I don't think there are people right now working on it

1161
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:41,740
I believe Marvel had some truly atrocious golden

1162
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:47,300
Things. Oh NFTs you mean or yeah. No there everyone's figuring it out

1163
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:53,220
I just tried to do like hey, it's an NFT of amazing fantasy 15 and it's like come on man

1164
01:32:53,260 --> 01:33:00,740
That's like free on it. Come on. Well, that's a whole thing. Yeah, but but Disney I would be I would I would bet they're investigating

1165
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:07,020
Yeah, I mean probably this digital Disney dollars at the very least with the metaverse

1166
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:11,140
Wasn't that a thing that well I Iger's on his own track with that

1167
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:16,600
But I feel like before he fully left Disney's like gotta look into the metaverse. Iger is looking into the metaverse

1168
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:18,420
He invested in Funko

1169
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:22,820
He's done a lot John Stewart is try to get him to start his own news network

1170
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:25,380
There's a lot going on with mr. Iger

1171
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:28,420
Yeah, metaverse metaverse possible. I mean there's

1172
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:33,740
it'll be it'll be interesting to see what they try on all these avenues because I feel like they're

1173
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:38,780
Traditionally kind of a conservative company and they will get into it later

1174
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:43,900
There's a question. Let's go back to this crypto point. Yeah, if you had ten thousand dollars

1175
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:47,220
Do you put it into Bitcoin or do you put it into?

1176
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:48,700
I

1177
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:52,620
Guess now Disney chicken little bucks. Do you buy nothing?

1178
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:58,860
Do you buy as many chicken little bucks as you can for ten thousand dollars? Yeah, why not today now?

1179
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:02,020
Okay. Yes, what I would say to that. Uh-huh. I would say

1180
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:08,180
The probably Bitcoin is the answer but I would say look into

1181
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:15,980
How many chicken little bucks were made? Okay, that's what to figure out how scarce chicken little bucks are

1182
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:22,420
I think it's probably not so desirable because of the property is not so desirable property is not desirable

1183
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:27,980
But the rare ones either like certainly the misprinted ones are very

1184
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:33,860
Expensive, but I think like the shorter run smaller run

1185
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:39,100
Disney dollars are the ones that really sell yes exactly. So

1186
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:42,460
It depends it depends what what they're going for

1187
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:45,780
Well some money they are in the range of

1188
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:51,660
$500 so that's how much they've accrued in what 17 years

1189
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:56,580
So by that logic if it goes from one if these trends continue

1190
01:34:57,060 --> 01:35:03,720
We could we could probably do a full. Okay, I see a pre-owned it looks kind of dirty this Disney dollar this chicken little Disney dollar

1191
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:07,860
$15 I think it's a buy it now. It's probably more I do it

1192
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:12,860
And then you can best offer it because you can wash currency there there are well, yeah

1193
01:35:12,860 --> 01:35:16,460
You get another business and you wash it that way. No, I mean like

1194
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:24,780
Okay, yes, I think you can wash currency. Yeah, I do wonder yes was their money laundering done with Disney dollars

1195
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:28,780
Well, did they how did anyone get that did a stripper get tipped with Disney dollars?

1196
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:35,380
This is a question I had to is anyone ever made in Orlando. Of course they did. Did people make I'm living

1197
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:41,180
I'm on vacation. I'm on top of the world. Yes, I'm making it rain Goofy's there's no doubt it happened

1198
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:45,380
It didn't happen. Did anyone do the you know Snow White?

1199
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:48,420
Railroad

1200
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:53,180
Okay, with it, yeah, Michael Eisner did

1201
