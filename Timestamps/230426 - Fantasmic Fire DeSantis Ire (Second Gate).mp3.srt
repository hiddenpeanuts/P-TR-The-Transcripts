1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:26,760
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate, where today we delve into the dark side of Mickey's

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,000
imagination.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,800
Yeah, is it going to be twisted, do you think?

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Twisted and imagined?

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
Yeah, kind of.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
Look, we saw.

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
We saw what happened.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,800
Yeah, that's true.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,200
You mess with the Mick, you go to Fire Town.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,080
You mess with Mick and you burn.

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,280
You understand the rules of this?

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,480
I've got a twisted, beautiful mind.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,920
My twisted, beautiful, dark fantasy.

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,880
Jason Sheridan.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,360
But also awesome.

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,400
Yes, yes, absolutely.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,600
As long as you're not suffering the half a dozen people suffering from smoke inhalation,

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,800
which sucks and is very unpleasant, it's kind of awesome if you're far away watching.

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,880
Yeah, yes.

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:21,600
Thank God in this situation for the moat between the fire and the park guests who do not get

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,880
lit on fire.

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,000
I was thinking when you say awesome, I was thinking how Mike and I did an episode a while

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,280
back about the most the rockinest moments in theme park history.

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,840
And this is different than that.

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,400
But I think that this fire is the most metal moment in theme park history.

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Oh, without a doubt.

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,440
A big dragon lighting on fire and fully emulating.

30
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,800
Like a three story dragon made of metal, like looking like it's made of almost metal too.

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Yeah, absolutely.

32
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Uh huh.

33
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Yeah.

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
So this is yeah, this is cool.

35
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,560
And it kind of happening in a logical way.

36
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,720
There's sort of a and when you think about like, you know, I'm mixing mythology, but

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,600
Mickey's sort of in wizard mode, right?

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,320
In the sorcerer's apprentice.

39
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,440
So you're getting closer to like Tolkien territory.

40
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,640
I feel like where it's like, oh yeah, like Sauron, like right?

41
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
That's the name of the dragon.

42
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, now you're a bet.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,600
Look, I was named the authors as far as I can go.

44
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Jason Sauron.

45
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,480
Is that the dragon in Jason?

46
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,480
Who's the name?

47
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,480
The dragon?

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
The bad guy?

49
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,080
No, so runs the big eye that they keep.

50
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
Oh, man.

51
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,440
Oh, I'm editing this part out.

52
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,800
I don't really got I didn't see you.

53
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
If you said sorry, I didn't say yes.

54
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
The dragon.

55
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Yeah.

56
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
That's right.

57
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
The destruction of smog.

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Yeah, I guess.

59
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,240
I know only of dragon heart.

60
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,840
And of course, the dragons that eat ash.

61
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Of course.

62
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,640
Yeah, Lord of the Rings, all that stuff is a little bit lost on me.

63
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,840
And I know it should be in like adjacent to my interests.

64
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,400
And I guess it kind of is, but I haven't gotten there yet.

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,960
Yeah.

66
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,900
Do you think that it had an adverse effect on me that the only time that I've seen the

67
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,800
first one was in high school on a wheeled in TV, a four by three TV.

68
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Really?

69
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,480
I've seen it several steps, so I didn't see it in the theater.

70
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
I still haven't.

71
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,520
I haven't watched it on a nice TV.

72
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,160
I've only seen it decades ago on a four by three with that aspect ratio.

73
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,560
So the bars are the thickest bars.

74
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
The worst sound.

75
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,120
This is this is I think a bad like I realize listener what I am copying to.

76
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,600
I know these are good films.

77
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Yeah.

78
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,840
And I know that is not the way to watch.

79
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,600
But maybe if the first one didn't land with me, maybe it was because of the faraway four

80
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
by three TV.

81
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,320
And you've only seen the first one.

82
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
Yeah.

83
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
Yeah.

84
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,200
Not not on a you saw it on a on a movie screen.

85
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,640
Yeah, I saw them all on a movie screen.

86
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,480
The first three actually haven't watched The Hobbit.

87
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,960
So I've seen all six at the movies.

88
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:07,800
It is kind of my they were my family's like Christmas vacation, like Christmas break movies.

89
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,200
So I look at them very fondly because of that.

90
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,120
But in terms of like, but you didn't know that what is happening?

91
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
No, I didn't.

92
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,400
Right off the top of your head.

93
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,720
I had to think for a second because there's the nasty wizard to just like Gandalf's polar

94
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
opposite.

95
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,200
Now, Dr. Sauron is Malcolm McDowell in Star Trek Generations.

96
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
I know all about him.

97
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,360
OK, I know he kills areas.

98
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,720
He kills William Shatner.

99
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
He kills Captain Kirk.

100
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,360
Well, and so on is the dinosaur mutant hybrid in the X-Men from the Savage Land.

101
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
Yeah.

102
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Of course.

103
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:49,120
And Sauron is the ride where you get on a you fly around and look at balloons.

104
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,520
Yeah, that your mom's like.

105
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
Canyons.

106
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,360
Yeah, Sauron over California.

107
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,520
Sauron over California, which they should do an overlay once the X-Men come to the parks.

108
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,080
Of that not of that you're on a dragon.

109
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
It should be an X-Men.

110
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,520
Yeah, it should be X.

111
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,160
Yeah, because he's like he has wings.

112
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
This is him.

113
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,160
Oh, so that would work then.

114
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Right.

115
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,640
You know, that's look, it's a fun idea, but we have to like contractually bake that into

116
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
that.

117
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,720
That is that is a month to tops.

118
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,600
You're in and out because they we know what's happening to California Adventure.

119
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,520
It is becoming nothing but Marvel bit by bit.

120
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
Right.

121
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
That's true.

122
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,800
If they let it spread over there, that's like a fire like we're talking about today.

123
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,960
That fire, that blaze is going to spread all the way through Grizzly River.

124
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
Suddenly everything.

125
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,480
I don't know what do you in your head?

126
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,080
You have a what what does the Redwood area become as a Marvel?

127
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,800
How do they quickly Marvel overlay that?

128
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,400
Jason, this is a great question, isn't it?

129
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,880
That's a really great question.

130
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,880
That could easily flip to the Savage Land, I think.

131
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,120
Yeah, it's not quite the same.

132
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,520
Savage Land is sort of like a secret jungle, like tropical jungle in like Antarctica or

133
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,520
no.

134
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,520
Yeah.

135
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,520
Yeah.

136
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

137
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
Oh, I got.

138
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,520
Oh, you mean down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

139
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,280
So, yeah, you could you could retrofit that.

140
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,040
The peaks are like a little more snow covered.

141
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,520
And then as you get down, down, down, it's they can retrofit it to be like a tropical

142
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
jungle.

143
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,520
Just vines, a lot of vines.

144
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,200
A lot of vines is really what will happen.

145
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,480
We're just saying just go to hell.

146
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Cannery Row, Redwood Forest.

147
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
We don't want that.

148
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
You know?

149
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
No, we're already.

150
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:35,280
I mean, technically with the Big Hero 6 overlay, that is that whole area is now becoming that's

151
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,400
technically Marvel.

152
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,520
You're right.

153
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,640
I actually don't even think about it like I don't mind that one.

154
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,640
I want like Marvel should kick out as much in the Hollywood area as possible.

155
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:51,800
We need to contain the blaze over there to put up a moat, you know, metaphorically speaking,

156
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,880
to make sure it doesn't just become Disney's Marvel adventure.

157
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
That's true.

158
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
But we'll see.

159
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,880
I don't know.

160
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
Might be too.

161
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
The spread.

162
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,400
It might be too much of an uncontrollable spread, as they would say, in firefighting.

163
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Yeah.

164
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,080
Well, we will try to contain this one better than the one was.

165
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,480
I mean, it was look, it was kind of good.

166
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,120
Ultimately, there was only one victim of what we're talking about today, which if you don't

167
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,280
know, and I imagine you do, the dragon caught on fire at the end of Phantasmagorgy.

168
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,800
And boy is it no more.

169
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:30,820
It is an absolutely decimated giant animatronic, which you hate to see it, but I don't know.

170
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,040
You don't totally hate to see it.

171
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
It was kind of interesting.

172
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,160
Yeah, it was kind of cool, especially the person who, and who knows if they heard about

173
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,240
this slowly happening, and I think the timing would be too difficult, but the person who

174
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,320
is videotaping going over the drop on Splash Mountain and caught it as they went down the

175
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,280
hill was, that was metal.

176
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
That was really something.

177
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,440
That's what really made me like, oh, we got to talk about this a little bit.

178
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
Can you imagine it?

179
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,800
Like the luckiest, I mean, in a way, the luckiest people, but I know that in the moment they

180
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,360
were, as it started, because if you watch the entire video, they see fire off in the

181
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,480
distance, they just see black smoke in the distance and they don't know if the black

182
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,240
smoke is on Splash Mountain.

183
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,800
They were like, maybe the upkeep hasn't been so good since we're wrapping up Splash Mountain.

184
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,000
So maybe the ride is on fire and the log is slowly heading straight into the blaze.

185
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,840
It's possible they thought like, oh, Disney closed Splash Mountain and they're decimating

186
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,160
it already and they forgot they put a bunch of people on it and this is how they're doing

187
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
it.

188
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,600
It was supposed to start at 2 a.m., but they read something wrong.

189
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,280
It was happening right at midnight or even they were getting a jump on it even.

190
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Right.

191
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,720
And they're doing the classic theme park burning it down for insurance money.

192
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,520
So if you're a theme park goer, you know this trick.

193
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,240
This is a classic theme park trick.

194
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,480
And it's happening right before our very eyes in this case.

195
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,840
You don't know where it's coming from.

196
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:59,840
I really like the tweet that Scott Gustin linked to where someone caught a picture of it before

197
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,680
caught on fire and you can see the fluid dripping from the map.

198
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,720
You can see stuff leaking from the head of the dragon.

199
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,480
I don't know what is that fluid that lights on fire?

200
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Is it gasoline?

201
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,280
I don't think it's just gasoline.

202
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
It's not just gasoline.

203
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,720
It's just some sort of flammable liquid.

204
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,360
They got a crack, a thousand lighters open and just dump them.

205
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,240
A little bit you get in there.

206
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,400
It's laborious, but it gets the job done.

207
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Yeah.

208
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
Icky.

209
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:37,960
You know, if you were in the audience for this and you don't know Fantasmic very well.

210
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,240
Of course the frequent park goers, the magic key holders knew that something was wrong

211
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,400
right away.

212
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,800
But if this is your first time at Disneyland and you're watching the show, which you are

213
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,520
in the middle of a dragon fight and it's an amazing Dre.

214
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,040
This is one of the great figures.

215
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,120
It was, I guess, one of the great figures.

216
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,880
And you don't know what's supposed to be happening.

217
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,080
So now there's like bile oozing from the map.

218
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,800
Maybe you think that's part of it.

219
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,320
Like, whoa, it not only shoots fire, it has slime too.

220
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
Yeah.

221
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:17,160
And maybe they just trash an animatronic after it's done because they burned this thing up.

222
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,440
But maybe that's what they do.

223
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,480
Disney's a very wealthy company.

224
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,280
Until there was an announcement, hey, everybody clear out of here.

225
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,880
I could see for a while just thinking, wow, this is incredible.

226
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,080
So this thing must be made out of flash paper.

227
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:43,400
This is what you make a wall out of in a quiet riot video so that it can burn really fast

228
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,600
and then they can enter the room and bother the nerdy kid who's trying to do his homework.

229
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Right.

230
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,760
I would wonder, surveying people who watched it, how many of them thought, oh yeah, this

231
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,040
is what happens, I guess.

232
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,360
Because it sort of is what happens.

233
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
Yeah.

234
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,520
And this is the funniest thing about it, that it wasn't when the dragon came out.

235
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:13,880
It is, narratively, from what I can tell, Mickey is trying to fight the dragon and then

236
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,320
the moment where Mickey gets the upper hand and then shoots fireworks into the dragon's

237
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,280
head, that's kind of exactly when the fire started.

238
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,920
And it overlaps with Maleficent screaming bloody murder.

239
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,840
So it is like at the death moment.

240
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:37,200
So again, if you've never seen it, maybe this dragon just fully is toast.

241
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,160
Yeah, it is, as they say, good show.

242
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,280
You can hear the audience, too, when it really catches the whole thing.

243
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,560
Here people go like, whoa!

244
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,560
Yes, yeah.

245
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,680
And I think that's a whoa of that's not supposed to happen, but you can also hear some excitement.

246
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,280
It's like something like, oh!

247
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:06,040
I mean, I think in a way, anyone who was there got the best phantasmic performance of all

248
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
time.

249
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,480
Yeah, well, it was unique, it was very special.

250
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,800
I mean, there's been times, was it phantasmic where Mickey slipped a couple months ago,

251
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
maybe?

252
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,200
Whoever was playing Mickey slipped.

253
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,840
Maybe I'm thinking of a different show.

254
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,000
But there'll be little things that go wrong in the show from time to time, as live theater,

255
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
that's what happens, that's what we're doing here.

256
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,640
And it's an elevated version.

257
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,760
It's like Spider-Man turned off the dark and they have to do it a couple times a night.

258
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,120
Oh shit, the flash bomb went off already, we gotta stop recording.

259
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,200
The room's on fire.

260
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,280
But in the same way of Spider-Man turned off the dark where you could see one of the performers

261
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,480
fall and break a leg.

262
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
This is a better version.

263
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,800
This is a no one got hurt version of it, thankfully.

264
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,400
And you got a unique experience.

265
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:59,840
Yeah, and Disney showing their hand really quickly, showing their cards, because like

266
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:07,320
within a day, day and a half, there was scaffolding and workers and construction repairing that

267
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,360
And it's like, oh, okay, so you can move fast on construction.

268
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,480
So you can move fast with contractors.

269
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,960
Got it, got it.

270
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
Cover your tracks.

271
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,400
Yeah, this tree house has been closed for years.

272
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Yeah, really.

273
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,760
The tree house, it's not Swiss Family, but it's inspired by Swiss Family, but it's a

274
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,240
new thing, you know?

275
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,160
So it was an electrifying announcement that we've all been thinking about ever since.

276
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:39,240
I can't wait to see the new, but old, but wall thing.

277
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,680
Yeah, yes.

278
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,680
And that, yeah, it closed, it feels like a decade ago at this point.

279
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,960
Do we think there's any chance this is burned down for insurance money?

280
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,360
This is a good question.

281
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,000
Do we think there's any chance of it?

282
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,040
I don't think so.

283
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,120
I don't think so just because of the proximity of the Mickey performer.

284
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,640
It seems too dangerous for them to do that.

285
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,600
It seems like also it would have been like, oh yeah, it caught fire backstage.

286
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,120
That we're claiming it.

287
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,240
Unless the Mickey is just like, hey, we think Mickey's going to make it out of there.

288
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,560
Look, if there's collateral damage in these things, then there is.

289
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,880
But also, look, we need a new dragon.

290
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:24,480
Look, this one's, it's been accident prone, this dragon from the, not this kind of accident,

291
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,040
not this very disastrous situation.

292
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,680
But it didn't work a lot in the early days.

293
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:41,080
Nicknamed Murphy ultimately due to the Murphy's Law situation.

294
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,520
If anything can go wrong, will go wrong.

295
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,280
And so maybe they've never been happy with how this thing performed.

296
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:56,240
So there's one way to toast it, get a better dragon, get dragon Mach 3 going.

297
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,440
And get an insurance company to pay for it.

298
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,360
Which also begs the question, what insurance company insures rides?

299
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,120
Who is insuring rides?

300
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
That isn't Disney?

301
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,120
Yeah.

302
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,120
Do you know what I'm saying?

303
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,200
There's got to be some, there's an entity that does it.

304
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,720
Yeah, just like big movie productions are insured for a lot of money just in case someone

305
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
gets.

306
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,920
Is it, you know what I'm saying?

307
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,920
Don't know.

308
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:30,480
Is it Lloyd's of London who famously insured Tina Turner's legs?

309
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
I don't know.

310
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,200
Like there's always that stupid story about some celebrity.

311
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Was it Sid Sharice?

312
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,640
Did she have insured legs as well?

313
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,040
She supposedly had the insured legs for $90.

314
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,980
How many celebrities' legs have been insured over the years?

315
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,560
Which is not just some sort of PR thing to put out.

316
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,360
To say like, look at those gams.

317
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You need to promote your clients' gams.

318
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Mickey Rooney's legs.

319
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,440
Not because they were long and picturesque, but because they were little and adorable.

320
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
That's right.

321
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,720
That's his bread and butter.

322
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
That's right.

323
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
You got to get his gams out there.

324
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,440
You got to insure the mixed legs.

325
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,800
You got to get my gams insured.

326
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,120
Judy Garland, furious at the rate Mickey Rooney got to insure his legs.

327
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,520
Oh yeah, sure.

328
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,880
So yeah, that's a good question that we should look into or somebody will tell us.

329
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,520
When I say look into, I mean someone will tweet it at us, the answer of what company

330
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,480
insures these things because it's got to be somebody.

331
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:36,320
You know how all these companies sprung up for TV and movie productions doing quick turnaround

332
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,800
time COVID testing because of union regulations and stuff.

333
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,840
And I learned the phrase enterprise COVID testing.

334
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,120
Enterprise is like a business term.

335
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,520
So who does enterprise insurance for Rye?

336
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,800
Who does big business?

337
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,800
And it's probably like a bank or an insurance company that we have either never heard of

338
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,120
or it's like, oh, it's Bank of America.

339
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
Yeah.

340
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,720
It's either a secret company that we don't know that's like part of, maybe it's part

341
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,520
of Bank of America or something.

342
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,960
One of Disney's long time partners since the Walt days.

343
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,640
I don't know.

344
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,600
If they're as good as all of the very trustworthy COVID test companies out there, sprung up

345
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,760
and saved this country from ruin, then I'm sure we can trust them as well.

346
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,600
The one COVID testing company that was just doing like tests that didn't work for months

347
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
on productions.

348
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
Yeah.

349
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,040
Oh, the one set that I was on in the whole time was that one, the one that faked the

350
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
tests.

351
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
The fake the tests.

352
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,400
It was all on the back of fake tests.

353
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Oh goody.

354
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,680
Yeah, good to know.

355
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,840
I had a very early on when productions were just coming back.

356
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,060
It's someone tell me like, oh, don't worry.

357
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,840
This is such a short term shoot.

358
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,640
LA County regulations say we don't have to test because it's so short.

359
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,400
And I was like, that's going to change real soon.

360
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
That's going to change.

361
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,080
And sure enough, it did change pretty quickly.

362
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
Don't worry.

363
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
We aren't testing.

364
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,340
Yeah.

365
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,440
Why are you worrying, Jason?

366
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,760
Yeah.

367
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:14,320
When you bring up burning for the insurance money, look, this whole premise really goes

368
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,120
back to the King Kong fire in 2008.

369
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:29,720
And it's almost the only equivalent situation I feel of a big iconic animatronic that burnt

370
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,680
down in a way that the conspiracist might say is shady.

371
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Yeah.

372
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,240
in the effort to make a new thing happen.

373
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,400
But that one just happened in cloak of night.

374
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,240
You know, that happened at 430 in the morning.

375
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,260
We have no footage of King Kong burning up.

376
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:54,600
This thing, we have 200 angles of the dragon burning alive right in front of us.

377
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Immediately.

378
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
This is great.

379
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,800
On a Saturday night, this is like this is prime time, prime phantasmic.

380
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,400
I think Jenny Nicholson was posting about like thanks to TikTok and I guess other social

381
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,800
media at large, you can get any angle you want.

382
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:15,000
And then if you keep following the videos, eventually you'll get like my boyfriend is

383
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,160
the firefighter who put it out and he said it was awesome.

384
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
That's you know what?

385
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,960
Again, also with the hindsight of nobody was hurt.

386
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:31,880
And now the Anaheim fire department that is like probably sometimes doing kind of boring

387
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
functional things.

388
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,400
I have a firefighter in the family.

389
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,560
I hear it's a lot of like I go rescue people from a small elevator that has been updated.

390
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,400
There's a ton of that boring elevator rescues.

391
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,200
But like, okay, what do I have to do today?

392
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,880
I have to fight a fire against a dragon.

393
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,680
Fight Maleficent, one of the most iconic villains of all time.

394
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,880
I have to be I have to be Mickey at the end of phantasmic.

395
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,760
If you are a firefighter who likes Disney and likes phantasmic and then I am Mickey,

396
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
but it's real.

397
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
Right.

398
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
Right.

399
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,760
Well, there's I saw one clip where like as it was burning, the first person out there

400
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:12,560
with like a very powerful fire extinguisher, you know, those kinds that shoot like a stream

401
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,560
of water or, you know, stuff to put fires out.

402
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,600
It looked like it flared up a little when they did.

403
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:27,000
It looked like it got more fire and you were shooting gasoline accidentally.

404
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,480
It was a fire extinguisher filled with gasoline.

405
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,320
It could be the sort of thing where like, oh, if you have a grease fire in the kitchen,

406
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,560
you need to throw salt or baking soda on it, not water, because it'll it'll flare up if

407
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,760
you throw water on it.

408
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:46,160
So you think that the dragon fire was more like a grease fire and like a stove.

409
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,040
In some way, in some way.

410
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,480
Don't quote me on this and also don't quote me on what exactly you're supposed to throw

411
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,480
on a grease fire.

412
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,280
I think it was like a flower on it or something.

413
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,800
Quick, the kitchen's on fire.

414
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,480
Where have I heard grease fires talked about lately?

415
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,720
Cue I guess the ride.

416
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,680
Those guys are accurate about everything they say.

417
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,880
I believe they got all the facts right about Lord of the Rings.

418
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,400
OK, so what do we do?

419
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Lots of salt.

420
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
Go.

421
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,240
Jason said you have to get a backpack full of kerosene and shoot it at the fire.

422
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,400
That's what I remember.

423
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,800
Such as if Frank Marshall spoke at an event or not.

424
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,400
We can trust them in this situation.

425
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Do not call 911.

426
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,360
Yeah, don't you remember, Mike?

427
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,480
He said the thing about the toadstool kitchen, it shared a kitchen with the Panda Express

428
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,560
on the core lot of Universal.

429
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,160
Cooking safety tips.

430
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,200
Never use flour or water to extinguish a cooking fire.

431
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Don't use flour.

432
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,000
I just told him to use flour.

433
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,840
Flour is combustible and water can spread the fire.

434
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
What the fuck?

435
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,840
What should we be using?

436
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,840
My mom told me flour.

437
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,840
I swear to God.

438
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,240
Stop the podcast at exactly 20 minutes in.

439
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,800
Our kitchen is on fire.

440
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:53,360
OK, going off of the last information that the last podcast I listened to said, grab

441
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,080
that flour.

442
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,000
The first results are turn the heat off.

443
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Use a lid.

444
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,360
Wait, wait, a lid isn't going to put the fire out.

445
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,320
If it's in a pot or a pan that you can throw a lid on top of that stops the air flow.

446
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,080
We're talking like a grease fire.

447
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,440
It's got to be a bigger, bigger amount of stuff.

448
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,840
If it's smaller, manage well, pour baking soda or salt baking soda.

449
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Mother the fire.

450
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
Yeah.

451
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:26,080
And if it is big and unmanageable and the size of a dragon, get the nearest lid sized

452
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,440
building fixture in your theme park.

453
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,280
In this case, see if there is a space mountain available.

454
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,000
Pry the lid of the building off, crane it over, put it on top of the burning dragon.

455
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,040
I think it's that like thing you pull off of a fancy dish.

456
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

457
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,040
A fancy food dish or something.

458
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,080
I have a nice little tray.

459
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,080
Right.

460
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,080
Wow.

461
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,720
OK, baking soda, not flour.

462
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
Maybe they was baking.

463
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Maybe I forgot.

464
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:57,360
That's too close, by the way, as far as like you're going to forget.

465
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,680
Baking soda is like a miracle substance.

466
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,200
You can use as an an acid if you have a stomach ache and a glass of warm water.

467
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,600
You can use it to remove scents, of course, in your fridge, but from water bottles and

468
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,960
stuff, it helps clean those.

469
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
Yes, I know that.

470
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,800
It's a lot of uses.

471
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,000
Check it out, folks.

472
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Baking soda.

473
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
This is Jason's.

474
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,480
I don't know if this is an Annie Rooney or a Larry King.

475
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,480
This is more a Larry King.

476
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,880
Annie Rooney occasionally was positive.

477
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,440
Yeah, mainly a crank, mainly a complainer.

478
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,440
Wow.

479
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Wow.

480
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,720
Now, it also strikes me as odd that you're fuzzing up any of your mom's fire based information

481
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,040
Given that I would have thought that she would have given you really specific instructions

482
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:45,720
on what to do if your Ghostbusters tissue beds caught fire in the middle of the night,

483
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,280
a very high risk.

484
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,840
Maybe that's where I should have put flour, not a grease fire on the stove.

485
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:58,320
You put flour if your Kenner Ghostbusters firehouse catches fire because of napkins

486
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
that are sitting in it.

487
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,040
It's the only kind of fire that flour can put out.

488
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,840
Yeah, maybe that is what I'm mixing up.

489
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,840
It has to be Kenner Ghostbusters.

490
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
Yeah, yeah, that's probably what I'm thinking.

491
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,120
Off brand, a new, like a NECA Ghostbuster, not happening.

492
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,440
It's got only Kenner materials or such that flour counteracts it.

493
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
Yep, yep, yep.

494
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
That's for sure.

495
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,480
So, hmm, all right, well, I've learned.

496
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,240
There's videos from after that.

497
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,720
You might have been referring to some of this stuff, Jason, where this will mean nothing

498
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,440
to the listeners, but just for like, this is like, all right, they have started, they

499
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,360
are not pretending that it's not a problem now.

500
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,760
They're trying to get people to clear out, but people are staying behind to film the

501
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
fire.

502
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,880
This extra burst that happens.

503
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Oh, spectacular.

504
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:45,400
Just this extra major big round fireball out of its mouth.

505
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,560
Yeah, everybody cheering it on.

506
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,240
And then similar to what you were saying, just like a straight rocket.

507
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
This is insane.

508
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,240
Like, it shoots out.

509
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,640
I mean, it's what happens in the show.

510
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,240
Like a kind of a beautiful looking really straight line of fire.

511
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,480
It looks another piece of the insanity is that this is it is a head designed to shoot

512
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
pyro.

513
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,600
Yeah, it looks like a like something in burnt like Burning Man or something.

514
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,120
When you see those photos out in the desert with some sort of giant like on fire sculpture.

515
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:22,160
Yeah, or like a wicker man, like a wicker man or something like it's very visually stark.

516
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:29,240
It took me 15 seconds to find someone saying it was satanic on Twitter.

517
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:36,600
Just type in, you know, I think I typed in I really wanted to see what would happen if

518
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:44,400
I googled phantasmag dragon woke and it was all it was all like tweets.

519
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,240
People go like, oh, that woke me up.

520
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,320
You know, like because it was happening.

521
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,240
And like midnight, but then there was one tweet of like it is not even hidden anymore.

522
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,440
Disney is out in the open with Satanism.

523
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,080
And it's just like, yeah, man, the thing, the character from the movie from nearly 100

524
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
years ago.

525
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,480
Yeah, it's finally out in the open.

526
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,480
That's right.

527
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,160
Well, there is look.

528
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,800
Chernobog is in the sequence.

529
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,800
You know, that is that is true.

530
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,560
Yeah, they showed their satanic cards in 1940 when they made that movie about how Chernobog

531
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,640
is great and should be worshipped.

532
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Yeah, yeah.

533
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,920
That's right. We'll never forget that.

534
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,920
I think the now I'm disappointed what you what you didn't find, Jason, what somebody

535
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,960
should have tweeted is you you go woke, you go up in smoke.

536
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,960
That is nobody did it.

537
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,400
Yeah, I don't think wordplay is the go woke or broke strong suit.

538
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,280
Well, they all every one of these awful things gets one catchy one and then never again,

539
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,320
like Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.

540
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,840
They never had nobody ever had a rewrite on that or a bunch of right.

541
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,560
They left that in the dust.

542
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,280
No, and they want and we're good.

543
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,200
Reality does not have to come into play anymore because all this stuff about like, well,

544
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,000
Bud Light, you're going to go broke and all the stock tickers are like, their profit

545
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,600
appears to be four percent up, I think, because it's spring and people are having

546
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,600
parties, graduation parties or family get togethers because the weather got nice.

547
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,960
I yeah, that well, this is I mean, it ties into the other thing we're talking about,

548
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,760
but like the the way people just see what they want to see and everybody who wanted

549
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,680
to have that feeling of like, well, I saw one video of a truck backing over some Bud

550
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,400
Light, I guess that is incontrovertible proof that Bud Light has gone broke.

551
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,160
Yeah. Yeah.

552
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,440
Happens if you go woke.

553
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,040
Right. I saw it. I saw the truck with my own eyes.

554
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,800
Bud Light's pretty much done.

555
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,000
I don't think we're ever going to see it in a store again.

556
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,720
And then the rest of your life, you just pass by that aisle quickly like, nope, don't

557
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,120
you didn't see that. You didn't see that straight to a different one.

558
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,680
Keystone, Keystone for me.

559
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,520
Yeah. Well, it's a choose.

560
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,640
Everything is choose your own reality at this point.

561
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,040
And I guess it'll be that way forever.

562
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,720
You can now get yelled at by people with Twitter blue.

563
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,200
They're the first replies you can see.

564
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,400
And they will yell at you for having an echo chamber for some reason, for using a

565
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,760
social media site to follow your friends and people you're interested in.

566
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,280
Like, yeah, man, I'm not going online to follow things I find unpleasant.

567
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,000
Actually, that's mainly why I go online to check out unpleasant stuff and I get

568
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,800
upset. Yeah, that's why a lot of us do it.

569
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,840
Let's be honest. Yeah.

570
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,920
Look, they find a way to get it to us, even though we all got on Twitter and were

571
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,760
just like, oh, look, David Wayne's on here.

572
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,920
I like what hot American.

573
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,880
This seems like a fun place to be.

574
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,520
I'll see his jokes and it'll be a great two decades at this place.

575
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,760
But to it is now a conveyor belt that feeds you all the most horrifying thoughts and

576
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,640
worst opinions you've ever seen.

577
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,680
Yeah. And thousands of them every day.

578
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:03,160
But it also feeds us every possible angle of dragon fires, which is neat.

579
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,960
And I think I mean, I think you're right.

580
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,040
I think Splash Mountain tops it.

581
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,720
That is the coolest going down this drop.

582
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,760
But then, oh, my God, and a true horrible fire in Disneyland that they don't have

583
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,320
all the information on that they're like they might know that it has something to

584
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,520
do with Fantasmic. But they also don't know if that's like Club 33 is gone.

585
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:26,760
Oh, sure. My question is, was anyone able to be like standing in the back?

586
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:32,760
Fantasmic catches on fire and they hoof it to Splash Mountain to do the ride

587
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,400
through to get the view.

588
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,840
I think it's like skinnier teeth.

589
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,440
You could maybe do it because it was a colder night.

590
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,640
And so the line at the end of the night, probably not huge for Splash Mountain.

591
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:49,360
Well, we've talked before about how you try to time certain rides with the fireworks.

592
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,880
Yes. So if it's like PeopleMover in Florida, if it's Big Thunder, Big Thunder

593
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,440
Disneyland during fireworks, awesome.

594
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,800
Really good. Same with PeopleMover.

595
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,560
So I would imagine if there's a big thing that's lit up in the sky, you want to get

596
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,480
to the highest point possible.

597
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,640
It is also the furthest point in a way.

598
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,040
Well, if I go up high, I'll probably be safe from it.

599
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,000
That's true.

600
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,920
Unless the dragon are at that moment perfectly like the little pyro mechanism aimed

601
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,080
right at the top of Splash Mountain.

602
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,480
Right.

603
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,160
Which maybe that was part of the plan too.

604
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,200
Maybe they're like, we need to get this overlay done quicker.

605
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,720
Right.

606
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,920
We get this fire can selectively knock out elements of Splash Mountain and the work

607
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,560
is done for us.

608
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,000
Right.

609
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,880
Do you think was there, I didn't see any, but there were, were there any videos at

610
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,360
the top of the guardians tower?

611
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,360
There had to be.

612
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,120
Oh, would it read?

613
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,200
I bet it would.

614
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,640
I mean, there was black smoke billowing up.

615
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,600
All right.

616
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,200
If anybody's really been digging in, I would like to see that angle.

617
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,600
Yeah.

618
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,400
But did they know what they were looking for?

619
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Did they even know that it's in their footage?

620
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,360
You know, and you really only got like a second.

621
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,080
You're right.

622
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,640
That's, that'd be a spectacular view.

623
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,480
I just don't know if anybody was, was ready on the draw.

624
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,640
Rocket didn't point it out or anything.

625
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,640
Hey, look, my buddy, the dragons are shit.

626
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,400
What is that?

627
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,640
Is that a solar flare?

628
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,400
There's smoke coming out of, coming out of Disneyland.

629
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,720
Oh no, the eternal's are at it again.

630
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,360
I think Danos did it.

631
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,040
I think the X-Men villain pyro is at it again.

632
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,160
Look out for the new pyro overlay coming soon to a silly symphony swing.

633
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,720
What's this a pyro overlay?

634
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,560
What's this?

635
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,200
They're slowly starting to work X-Men back into the fold.

636
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,840
And this is the first way they're doing it.

637
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,080
They're doing a very covert way.

638
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,440
Pyro, famously one of the evil brotherhood of evil mutants,

639
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,120
a Magneto's group of bad guys.

640
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,840
Kind of has had a redemption arc the last few years.

641
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,440
Okay.

642
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,880
I'm not familiar with his redemption arc, but I know he's in the movies.

643
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,720
He is in the movies.

644
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,640
He's that kid with the lighter in the movies and the singer movies.

645
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,080
Oh, have you ever seen this in the X-Men's?

646
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,600
No.

647
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,560
I've never seen any X-Men.

648
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,080
Wait, no, I saw three, I believe.

649
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
You saw The Last Stand?

650
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
I saw Ratner, yeah.

651
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,080
Yeah, you saw the Ratner.

652
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,880
Last Stand, not as bad as people say it is.

653
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,960
There's still some okay stuff in there, but it is not.

654
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:11,600
Yeah.

655
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,400
X2's better.

656
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,600
Just as long as, I'm just glad that all of the early ones were directed by Kreeps.

657
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,400
Well, that's a...

658
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,280
I'm glad they didn't hand the baton immediately to a non-Kreep.

659
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,480
That's a different story.

660
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,760
Yeah, yeah, no, Ratner.

661
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,000
Ratner took over for Singer.

662
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,120
And then Singer came back.

663
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,360
So yeah, it's a whole...

664
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:38,560
It's like Maleficent took over for Chernobog.

665
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:38,960
Right.

666
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,040
And then Chernobog came back.

667
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,880
That is the moment in Phantasmac of all of the like, ah, ha, ha, ha,

668
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,560
ah, and it goes from Ursula to Jafar or whatever.

669
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,440
That is like, that's the director's meeting where Singer briefed Ratner.

670
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,440
Uh-huh.

671
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,600
Matthew Vaughn just like, I don't, I'm standing aside.

672
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,160
I don't want any part of this.

673
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,400
I'm going to try to not meet any of these people.

674
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,240
He got it back in fighting shape.

675
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,520
And then it's like, good news, the Kreep is back.

676
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,480
He left, yeah.

677
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,720
He was going to do the second, but then he left and that's when Singer came back.

678
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:10,960
Yeah.

679
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,280
So...

680
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,520
Singer returns.

681
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,480
Singer returns.

682
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,080
We'll see.

683
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,080
The really quick.

684
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,720
The other, I mean, and the way I got to see the information, this

685
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,560
information initially was like, they have stopped the show.

686
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
They've made the announcement.

687
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,120
And the just the first video I saw, they have tried to just get things back to

688
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,600
Frontierland normal, which means the dragon is burning and the music

689
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,200
in the background is dunka dunka dunka dunka dunka dunka dunka dunka dunka dunkawie.

690
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,400
Incredible.

691
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,760
Like, I don't, like, I don't know what else they're supposed to do.

692
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,280
Like, you know, and you want to keep people calm and get, you know, eerie

693
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,960
silence would be weird as well.

694
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,320
Yeah.

695
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,240
But it does also start to be funny.

696
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,560
That's like, something is happening that we cannot cover up in any way.

697
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,160
What do we do?

698
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,440
Uh, pump in the most Benny Hill-esque music we can find.

699
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,280
Well, this is also like an impossible situation because it's like, you know,

700
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,320
um, for, for like fire drills or evacuations, you prepare for every weird.

701
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,440
Thing, but this one is really weird where it's like, oh my God, we have a ton

702
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:17,400
of people around the rivers America, but they're pretty far away from it.

703
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:23,160
And, uh, there's no immediate danger, but we don't want guests to get smoke

704
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:27,720
inhalation, uh, and we don't want the fire to jump, but it's not going to

705
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,000
damage any rides cause this island is kind of isolated.

706
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,760
Uh, yeah, what do we do?

707
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,200
I guess we just kind of like, oh, come on, put the band, put the happy banjo.

708
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,200
I mean, they don't have like a more of a, like a deliverance banjo soundtrack

709
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,800
that they can play at a moment's notice.

710
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,440
I would assume.

711
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,200
Well, isn't that kind of like the pirates?

712
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,160
Uh, it is like creepy.

713
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,080
That's yeah.

714
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,720
That would have helped play creepy.

715
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,160
Don't play fun banjo music, play creepy banjo.

716
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,720
Do you think the deliverance is it Dan, is that that's not from deliverance?

717
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,360
Is that the first time there's that an old song?

718
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,640
Yeah, I think that's an old song.

719
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,680
What is that called the deliverance song?

720
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,760
Is that, is that dueling banjos?

721
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,520
Yeah, I guess it is dueling banjos.

722
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:17,240
So is that pirates is from dueling banjos probably then that little like banjo sound.

723
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,480
Maybe that's what I'm getting at here.

724
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,800
I think it's a different melody.

725
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,400
Isn't it like a prelude of pirates life for me?

726
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,720
Well, but is it inspired by it?

727
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,360
I mean, I'm asking a lot of questions today based on the timeline.

728
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,360
It is not inspired by deliverance.

729
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,800
It, the, it may also automatically come on.

730
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,000
It, are you sure it's pirates not inspired by deliverance?

731
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,680
I do believe, I don't think that the Disney people saw the film deliverance and said,

732
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,760
we got to get in on that.

733
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,000
Okay.

734
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,680
Dueling banjos is from 1954.

735
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,320
Okay.

736
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,160
So yeah.

737
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,240
Pirates also, if in addition to that, they, they, that movie also invented the song and

738
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:59,160
the song stayed the most famous banjo song in spite of the,

739
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,520
yeah, that what happens in deliverance.

740
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,320
The idiocy context.

741
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,080
Pirates also opens years before deliverance is released.

742
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,800
I am aware.

743
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,640
I at least know that.

744
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,480
I showed a lot of ignorance today, but I didn't know that.

745
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,960
I did know the timeline on that.

746
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,720
But it would be funny to take like a dueling banjos, say you, you, you compose

747
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,760
dueling banjos and you're like, oh man, everybody fucking loves my song.

748
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,520
This is great.

749
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,240
Oh, wow.

750
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,520
It's going to be used in a big movie.

751
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,880
Oh, awesome.

752
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,600
Yeah, it's great.

753
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,080
That's going to be so, wait, is it what, what happens in the movie?

754
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,280
What's going to be associated with my song for the rest of the song's life on earth?

755
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,360
Jesus Christ.

756
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,280
Yeah.

757
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,120
Is there a worse version of that?

758
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,640
I don't know.

759
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,960
Or like has to be.

760
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,680
Well, maybe that song from the silence of the lambs.

761
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,680
Uh, what does that call it?

762
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,000
Good, goodbye horses.

763
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,040
Although I don't know that only helps the popularity of my horses.

764
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,680
Stuck in the middle with you, I feel like is associated with a man cutting

765
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,600
another man's ear off with a razor.

766
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,040
Fun.

767
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,840
That's fun compared to deliverance.

768
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,480
Good for them.

769
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,200
I know even like any, like any Tarantino as just juxtapositions are still.

770
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:05,840
Right.

771
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,600
There's no, it's still played.

772
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,320
I mean, it's, it's like, it's you wincing watching it, but still it's not nearly as.

773
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:18,920
I think, um, deliverance got so big, so quickly as a weird reference point and

774
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,800
like a gag, uh, a weird gag, uh, yeah, it probably took on a life.

775
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,120
It's owned pretty quickly.

776
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:26,480
Right.

777
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,880
I'm just saying if you're, but if you're Arthur guitar, boogie Smith, who

778
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,800
composed dueling banjos, it's amazing.

779
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,320
What do you think?

780
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,520
First time you brought up Arthur guitar, boogie Smith.

781
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,760
It should have come up in six years.

782
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,000
Banjo guy has a guitar in his name.

783
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,800
Yeah.

784
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,880
Guitar boogie was his nickname.

785
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,360
Wow.

786
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,160
Arthur guitar, boogie Smith.

787
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,840
Confusing.

788
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,880
The only other thing would have been if like, if somehow, if Bernard

789
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:58,240
Herman made the psycho score independently, did not intend for it to be scary.

790
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,480
I may, I made a five, made a fun, nice piece of music.

791
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:01,800
People.

792
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,040
Yeah.

793
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:09,680
Teenagers used to dance to it in the early 40s or the jaws theme.

794
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,640
Yeah, they're both yes.

795
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,080
Herman and Williams both horrified.

796
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,960
But you didn't tell me you were going to do that with it.

797
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,720
Kids are doing the, uh, whatever it wouldn't be called the jaws theme at that

798
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:29,320
point, like underwater swim, it's the hottest dance craze and all the schools.

799
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,760
It was meant to be faster and then Spielberg slowed it way down.

800
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,240
He did it at half speed.

801
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,200
That's how it sounds.

802
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,640
Jaws theme.

803
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,840
Yeah, that's fine.

804
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,480
That's peppy.

805
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,400
Yeah, that's great.

806
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,400
All right.

807
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,240
Well, let's, you know, make sure that the composer's intent is clear.

808
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:46,680
Yeah.

809
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,920
Using pieces of music.

810
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,960
Um, yeah, look, this, this all nuts.

811
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,120
And it also comes on, this is much less tragic because it worked out, but this

812
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,520
dragon's fluid is not the only fluid that's been leaking lately because

813
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,880
sunny eclipse, our pal, sunny eclipse, uh, has been leaking fluid as well.

814
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,200
Yeah.

815
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,520
Yeah.

816
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,640
He had a tough day.

817
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,120
Yeah.

818
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,560
Smoke, smoke rising up from him.

819
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,640
Weird dripping off the keyboard off the org at Astro Oregon.

820
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,040
Yeah.

821
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:21,200
And I believe it was just, uh, taken out for repair work at the start of the year

822
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,080
and put back.

823
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,000
Yeah.

824
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,480
Yeah.

825
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,440
It hasn't been that long.

826
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,200
Everybody, there's a lot of concern about it.

827
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:33,720
It feels like we're, we're sort of in a Betty white kind of situation now with

828
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,760
sunny eclipse where like any, if you see it, not that you see sunny eclipse

829
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,760
trending, maybe on Archwood, our Twitter, but you know, if you see the name,

830
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
you're like, Oh, what happened?

831
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,320
Like I do have that.

832
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,280
Uh, and then you're like, Oh, thank God.

833
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,600
No, city eclipse is just trending because everybody's happy about sunny.

834
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,600
Well, don't scare me like that.

835
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,240
Denzel relieved gif.

836
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,880
The, the PTR curse though.

837
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,560
Will it, will it apply to sunny eclipse?

838
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,720
That's why I wanted to name an already deceased person and bring somebody else

839
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,200
down.

840
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,160
Oh God.

841
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,840
Now I'm worried that something's going to happen to Brett Radner.

842
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,560
Oh, I did a lot of this out.

843
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,880
So yeah, I'll edit that out too.

844
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,840
I love the, um, uh, the funny thing about the sunny eclipse is apparently when he

845
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,840
email functions, he slumps over his keyboard.

846
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,160
He looks like he had a heart attack or he dies.

847
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,360
They, it's like a realistic dying mechanism built into sunny eclipse.

848
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,400
Somehow it's like an animatronic of like a drunk rap at like Peter Lawford has

849
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,160
collapsed.

850
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,880
You would think the robot would just stop and you'd be like, Oh, it froze.

851
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,480
It's a robot.

852
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,720
It wouldn't slump over.

853
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,920
Like it had a heart attack.

854
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,480
It's like sunny eclipse might as well be like clutching his chest all over as he

855
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,600
leaks like some sort of fluid.

856
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,120
What a great way to, you know, because look, he's, he's a lounge lizard, kind of

857
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,880
a literal lizard.

858
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,480
He's lizard.

859
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:57,840
Yes.

860
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,560
Yeah, for sure.

861
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,440
And, uh, I think that kind of person, it's, it's like the Nikki Rourke, the

862
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,720
wrestler, you know, that's like, you want to go out, you're going to go out

863
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,960
doing what you do.

864
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,520
Um, you know, like I'm not, I'm, he's, I think somebody like that is going to be

865
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,040
doing shows till they're 97.

866
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,320
Like I, I'm going to slump over on the keyboard and that's how I go out.

867
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,240
Randy the Ram wants to die in the ring.

868
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,800
Just as sunny eclipse wants to die on stage at cosmic rays, starlight cafe.

869
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,440
Yeah.

870
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,600
Died dripping fluid.

871
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,640
It does not go anywhere near the free toppings bar several feet away.

872
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:34,920
Yeah.

873
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,600
You would never want to interrupt the flow of the toppings bar.

874
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,040
Yeah.

875
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,000
And Jason, that's Jason would Jason is.

876
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,800
Well, I gotta check now that you say that I don't know the status of the toppings

877
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,760
bar because it was still decommissioned when I was there at the end of 2021, but

878
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,920
maybe it's come back by this.

879
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,760
Am I wrong that you say cosmic rays you like still because of the toppings bar?

880
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,400
Did I make that up?

881
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,000
Well, I think it's like five episodes ago.

882
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,520
Well, just said the toppings bar, uh, just because it's a solid place to like load

883
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,600
up a theme park cheeseburger and also like, Oh, if you want chicken, figures and

884
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,480
fries, pretty reliable.

885
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:09,880
Yeah.

886
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,440
But when I was younger, we've done this dance.

887
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:13,840
All right.

888
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,120
All right.

889
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,600
Times that we've done this dance.

890
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,720
You and I, sorry.

891
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,360
We were in United forever.

892
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,680
That's you and Jason about the toppings bar.

893
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,360
Fight forever.

894
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,120
But it's about me explaining like, look, thank you, Steph, really good

895
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,560
cheesecake, cheese steaks.

896
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,240
And we were not adventurous eaters.

897
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,800
Most places you can only get one tomato on a burger here.

898
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,120
You can get three or four.

899
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,000
Who's, who's Batman in this?

900
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,280
Somebody needs to say one of the things they're saying in Bale Batman voice.

901
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,040
Jason is bad.

902
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,400
What's one of your toppings arguments?

903
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,640
They'll chase me.

904
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:54,440
They'll chase me and I'll run because the hero, the Euro city deserves.

905
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:54,600
Yeah.

906
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,960
But put like a, you have to talk about like tomato lettuce though.

907
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,480
Yeah.

908
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:57,920
Okay.

909
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:58,960
Yeah.

910
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,680
Sauteed onions and mushrooms.

911
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:02,720
They have that.

912
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,080
It's kind of the great elevate.

913
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,360
Yeah.

914
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:04,720
They did.

915
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:04,960
Yeah.

916
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,280
That was hard.

917
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,280
That's what, well, that's what he's saying about the toppings.

918
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,480
The bar is low in a theme park.

919
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,480
Anything that tastes like cooked food seems extraordinary.

920
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,560
That's a, Bale seems a little Harrison Ford.

921
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,200
Ask me like an 80 year old Harrison Ford.

922
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:23,400
All right.

923
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,600
Now do it as Harrison Ford talking to Kalista.

924
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,320
Why the toppings bar is so good.

925
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,080
It's cosmic rays.

926
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:28,520
If you will.

927
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:28,840
Okay.

928
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,560
Where is she?

929
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,280
Well, Hey, no, that's the wrong.

930
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:32,600
What?

931
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,120
What do you mean?

932
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,200
By she, he means the big, the big slice of tomato.

933
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,920
He had his eye on our Halloween costume is Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo.

934
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,960
It's not going to make sense if I show up first to Scrappy without a Scooby.

935
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,040
All right.

936
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,600
That's good.

937
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,600
We're going to be Batman and the Joker.

938
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,760
My voice is kind of, I'm almost there.

939
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,560
Kalista.

940
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,320
I've been working on my, my Batman.

941
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,720
Hey, can you pick up a bottle of wine for the party on the way home?

942
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,640
I don't want to get stuck at seven 11 getting cupcake.

943
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,880
Well, you know, let's, let's fit in a little bit of this.

944
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,360
I I'm almost like loathe too, but I here's, let me, okay.

945
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,320
The other, the other topical thing.

946
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,800
Well, hold on just real quick before the topic thing.

947
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,760
This is not the first time Maleficent dragon caught in fire.

948
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,080
Yeah.

949
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:22,440
Good point.

950
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:22,680
Yeah.

951
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,880
The parade in Florida, the plate, the parade dragon that is very like metal

952
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,440
steampunk Maleficent dragon caught in fire a few years ago.

953
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,160
Yes.

954
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,520
These exact thing happened.

955
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,720
Exactly the same thing basically happened.

956
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,400
It was not as it's not as tall of a structure, but it was moving

957
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,680
and it was closer to people.

958
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,560
Closer to crowds.

959
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,520
So it was definitely more dangerous that it happened because there were more

960
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,600
people around, but I think that's back now.

961
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,520
They brought it back.

962
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,160
I think it's back.

963
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:49,440
Yeah.

964
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,640
Um, I watched that footage.

965
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,560
They, they did not clear people at all.

966
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,560
No, it was a mess.

967
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,280
It was right there.

968
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,240
It was a mess.

969
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:55,480
Yeah.

970
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:01,520
And that was a crazy fire and it's very similar to then now like chunks of fire.

971
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,000
That's right.

972
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,640
Chunks.

973
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,200
Yeah.

974
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:03,560
Yeah.

975
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,680
For the main fire.

976
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,560
And it's amazing.

977
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,400
The breeze didn't blow it right into the.

978
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,120
No, it's amazing that the thing didn't like short and just start

979
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,760
torching people on the sidewalks.

980
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:13,480
Really?

981
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,560
In both cases.

982
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:14,840
Yes.

983
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:19,080
You would imagine like if something gave and the angle changed on the dragon's

984
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,880
mouth, then suddenly we got fireballs right into people's faces.

985
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,320
Yeah.

986
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,800
So it is like, there's a, there's an issue with the Maleficent dragons.

987
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,920
I guess it's just cause they shoot fire.

988
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,760
Most things don't shoot fire in the park.

989
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:33,440
Yeah.

990
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:38,680
Um, well then what's the, do we, we want to keep it though?

991
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,640
We don't lose like does the danger and begin this has been Disney's

992
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,160
ruling is like, oh yeah, we're not going to do similar effects to this for a

993
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,640
little while until we can figure out what's going on.

994
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,320
Yeah.

995
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:49,720
Right.

996
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:54,760
Um, but do we, is this too dangerous to, can we not have Maleficent like

997
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,560
Maleficent's have caught on fire on two coasts now?

998
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,400
Uh, well, look, there's a lot of things.

999
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:01,760
Yeah.

1000
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,800
What's the risk reward here?

1001
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:10,640
Um, I guess maybe if, if guests are closer by, could you pull off that kind

1002
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,920
of recent trick they do with fire, which is just like steam and a light

1003
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:19,360
hitting it the right way, it's not as impressive and it doesn't make people

1004
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,960
like hotter.

1005
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:21,800
Yeah.

1006
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,160
That's the thing with fire is like when you use fire in a theme park show, you

1007
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:29,120
go, oh my God, and your body temperature shoots up what feels like 20 degrees.

1008
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,720
It doesn't really, but you feel like you're getting scalded.

1009
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:39,000
Is this also just like stuff has, it's kept up by like the least amount of work

1010
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,600
they have to do, the least amount of money and time for safety, like.

1011
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,360
Well, that's yeah, it's a big corporation.

1012
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,680
That is of course what's going on.

1013
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,680
Where's like the realest.

1014
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,560
That this week is that it was shooting for another 4,000 layoffs by Thursday.

1015
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:58,440
I do think that the fire guy quit in advance or they got laid off in advance.

1016
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,080
So maybe they had like a new fire person working for cheap or something.

1017
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:02,960
Yeah.

1018
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,280
Maybe.

1019
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,240
Yeah.

1020
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,160
He knew what was coming.

1021
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:05,680
Right.

1022
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,240
Or there's like 500 fire people and they all got laid off.

1023
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,320
Yeah, maybe too many cooks.

1024
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,440
Oh, too many.

1025
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,920
Oh, no, you're blaming the workers.

1026
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,400
Jason blames the workers for the fire disasters.

1027
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,560
Fire safety, fat cats, you know?

1028
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:18,920
Yeah.

1029
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,200
Yeah.

1030
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:19,560
Too many.

1031
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,480
It's you're like Elon with Twitter.

1032
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,360
You just got it rid of.

1033
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,280
It's better to cut the staff.

1034
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,960
I'm always saying I'm like Elon with Twitter in so many ways.

1035
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,600
So finally too many cooks.

1036
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,480
That's wonderful.

1037
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,160
So yeah, I don't know.

1038
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:40,000
Maybe, maybe the parade dragon shouldn't shoot fire at the audience.

1039
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,480
That one in light of seems a little seems like more dangerous.

1040
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,480
Maybe we need to change this system.

1041
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,760
But I feel like, you know, if you, if you do have a moat there, light

1042
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,280
things on fire more often.

1043
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:53,640
Yeah.

1044
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,040
And I, you know what?

1045
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,200
Hey, let's just go for broke.

1046
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:01,000
When phantasmic comes back, what could be a, how do you top the dragon

1047
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,400
lighting up our big finale?

1048
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,800
Mark Twain lights on fire.

1049
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,120
Hey now.

1050
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,120
Jason, what have Mark Twain wanted to see?

1051
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,840
I just wanted to see if you're, if it made his temperature shoot up.

1052
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,240
Well, okay.

1053
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:12,920
So, okay.

1054
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,800
This is the scene.

1055
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:19,600
Uh, they turn the happy banjo music to the deliverance of dueling banjos

1056
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,440
in frontier land and, and just around the corner, you see a

1057
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,560
completely engulfed in flame Mark Twain.

1058
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,560
But again, they're just going to let it run its course.

1059
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,680
That has been proven to be the most safe.

1060
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,160
If they yell run, they'll have a stampede on their hands.

1061
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,280
You know, they just got to let it get back to dry dock, you know?

1062
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:39,800
You're, yeah.

1063
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,320
You're saying they're not going to do anything.

1064
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,960
They're just going to let the Mark Twain burn.

1065
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,960
I think if you can get, if the Mark Twain can, if we can make a replica

1066
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,080
out of pops popsicle sticks and do it every day.

1067
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,520
Oh yeah.

1068
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,440
It could be trouble given the, uh, the size scale.

1069
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:56,760
Yeah.

1070
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,760
But yeah, we could, I mean, you're talking about like a country bears,

1071
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:06,760
uh, model system, uh, uh, where they keep destroying the models.

1072
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,680
Oh, in the movie, in the movie.

1073
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:08,920
Yeah.

1074
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,160
Yeah.

1075
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:09,960
Oh, that's right.

1076
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,520
Christopher Walken scene.

1077
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,040
Oh, right.

1078
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,400
All right.

1079
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,400
I can't believe you brought up the deep.

1080
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,680
You hate that.

1081
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:15,440
Yeah.

1082
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,280
Yes, you're right.

1083
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:17,640
Yeah.

1084
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,640
But it's tougher because it would be, it would have to be the

1085
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,080
size of the actual Mark Twain.

1086
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:21,360
Yeah.

1087
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,360
But I like this though.

1088
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,120
I would like an easily kindle a bowl.

1089
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:25,720
Yeah.

1090
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,760
Um, Mark Twain to go up every day.

1091
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,960
I'm, I'm also remembering a thing that Jane showed me that I never knew before.

1092
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:37,160
And I'm forgetting the exact parameters of it, but at phantasmac in Florida,

1093
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,360
there's some point in the riverboat where all of the characters, I think, go

1094
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:49,320
inside because there's a pyro going off, but because the aerial is too difficult

1095
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,440
to get in and out, they just throw a fireproof tarp over them.

1096
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,040
Yeah.

1097
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:54,440
Yeah.

1098
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,160
I think you could see a video where that goes.

1099
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,160
You can see, I saw it.

1100
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:03,120
It is very funny to just see a human get like a blanket, like, all right, don't move.

1101
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,480
Like in that, yeah, Ariel in that moment is like somebody with no legs.

1102
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,920
Like we have to quickly.

1103
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,600
Very much so.

1104
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,360
Yeah.

1105
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,160
Yeah.

1106
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,600
So.

1107
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,560
Lieutenant Dan.

1108
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,560
Lot in common.

1109
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,480
Lieutenant Dan and Ariel.

1110
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,120
Very similar.

1111
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:18,440
Yeah.

1112
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,520
They, they hang out by the sea.

1113
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:21,760
Yeah.

1114
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:26,360
Just before we go out here, let's just, let's switch from, uh, from phantasmic to

1115
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,080
DeSantis-mic.

1116
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,280
Um, that's right.

1117
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,520
It's DeSantis-mic.

1118
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,880
Uh, a much better, uh, nighttime spectacular.

1119
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:40,440
Um, I feel like we have not talked a lot about the DeSantis situation.

1120
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:46,160
I don't think we ever referred to this, this last, uh, step of it where he was

1121
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,120
going to dismantle Reedy Creek.

1122
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:49,560
Yeah.

1123
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:54,080
There was a minute there where really felt like he had the upper hand.

1124
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:54,480
Yes.

1125
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:58,520
Uh, like he does have this thing, you know, via government that he can

1126
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:04,280
dangle over Disney for sort of, but not really, and very slowly opposing

1127
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,200
their homophobic legislation.

1128
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:06,600
Right.

1129
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:11,360
Uh, um, so like, all right, well now you lose all of your special privileges.

1130
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:16,480
I don't think we've said on the show this thing of how to say how Disney then just

1131
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:24,760
like, utterly outfoxed one of the great outfoxings in history of like in public,

1132
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,760
in public.

1133
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,080
Yeah.

1134
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:26,400
Yeah.

1135
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,920
Just like, okay, so we're going to have those, uh, what's some nonsense?

1136
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,440
Well, we have those powers, uh, into infinity plus one.

1137
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:34,760
All right.

1138
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,080
Great.

1139
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:40,480
Uh, so a public hearing that anyone could watch via webcam, uh, we have the power

1140
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,800
into infinity plus one, uh, and just anything to Santa's does is nullified.

1141
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,560
Um, incredible.

1142
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,560
First of all, just that, uh, you know, kudos to Disney.

1143
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,680
The legal way of the Santa's is such a villain, such a true villain that like

1144
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:02,920
you rooting for Disney to have ultimate control over like its own state is like

1145
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,960
something that probably shouldn't be happening.

1146
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,240
And if you really look at like Reedy Creek, you're like, it's a little weird.

1147
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,200
It's kind of weird.

1148
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:09,760
They just come.

1149
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,200
Yeah.

1150
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,600
We, when we discussed all of this in the founding of Disney world for the 50th

1151
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:19,240
and that they can build a nuclear plant, it would strike anybody as strange.

1152
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:19,560
Yeah.

1153
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,960
And the idea that you would take a look at that.

1154
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:22,720
Sure.

1155
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,280
I get that.

1156
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:23,560
Right.

1157
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,680
But the Santa's is such a vile shit head.

1158
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:28,760
He is.

1159
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,840
And I, yeah, Disney's asserting like ultimate control over this land.

1160
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,240
Yeah.

1161
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:34,840
Hell yeah.

1162
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,120
It's like rooting for him again.

1163
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,800
You know, because we'll be, we will serve though.

1164
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,720
We celebrate their attractions every week.

1165
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:44,720
You know, we'll also like, uh, call them out for, for shady dealings and whatever.

1166
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,160
And it's kind of fun to go.

1167
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,080
I feel like everybody is like, hooray Disney.

1168
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:49,480
Yeah.

1169
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,040
It's very complicated.

1170
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,160
Like, yeah, I think I sent you guys like a tweet where someone was like, why are

1171
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:01,720
all these headlines is Disney lays off 4,000 people, not Disney lays off 4,000

1172
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,600
people after record profits acquired.

1173
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,720
And yeah, sure.

1174
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,320
It's true.

1175
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:06,360
It's true.

1176
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,640
And every push pull like, it's like, oh, well that sucks.

1177
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,960
But also like, Ooh, I like that.

1178
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,800
They stumped that weird meatball man.

1179
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,240
Meatball run.

1180
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,160
Meatball run.

1181
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,480
Trump's nickname for him.

1182
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,520
The clip, the clip that's been going around of him in Japan.

1183
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,160
I don't want to say, I don't want to hype it up too much of like, it's

1184
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,440
the Howard Dean scream, but it's pretty close.

1185
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,000
Like it looks pretty, he does his little head wobble.

1186
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,920
He's got his mouth open in a real way.

1187
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:31,960
And he talks like this.

1188
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,960
And he looks like shit.

1189
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,280
I'm Ron DeSantis.

1190
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:38,840
As long as you know, I'm not a candidate, so we'll have to revisit that.

1191
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:39,560
Yeah.

1192
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,400
And he's bobblehead.

1193
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,480
I, he looks, I don't, you, I don't think you guys have watched it.

1194
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:50,200
He in that clip specifically is Homelander from the boys.

1195
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:55,480
There's a, Homelander is basically like the evil Superman of the boys.

1196
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,400
And he's played by this guy, Anthony star who does such a good job.

1197
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,120
He's like, when he's not talking, he's just vacant.

1198
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,160
There's a vacant eerie stare he's got.

1199
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,560
And then when he's talking, there's like this bizarre, like surreal quality to his

1200
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,680
face, like he's being puppeted or something.

1201
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,920
And it is DeSantis.

1202
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,040
Oh my goodness.

1203
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,600
This is this whole notion.

1204
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:22,160
I think we all had a moment where we were getting a little worried that like, okay,

1205
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,080
maybe Trump is a little bit diffused at this moment.

1206
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:29,080
This was a long time ago where he obviously now is charging ahead.

1207
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,920
Half speed Trump is charging.

1208
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,280
Yeah.

1209
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,600
He has low energy.

1210
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,240
Low energy Trump is charging Trump.

1211
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,040
Ironically, not low energy job.

1212
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:38,240
Yeah.

1213
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,360
He's still just handily.

1214
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,160
But when you hear that, like, but there's this new, there's this young gun and he's

1215
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,680
like, boy, you know, this is, this guy's a tough customer, man.

1216
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:53,040
This guy's John Wayne and he, he, you know, he, he held it down in Florida.

1217
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,840
He didn't bow at any of these masks and the vaccines.

1218
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,920
And, uh, I think we actually, you know, the fight's not over.

1219
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,040
We got somebody to worry about in, uh, in 2024.

1220
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,920
Cut to one piece of footage of him.

1221
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:10,920
Well, uh, I mean, but what I would say to that, I just to, you know, maybe, uh, uh,

1222
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:18,280
like this guy, there's no, this is the most charmless, lifeless, like pale, uh,

1223
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,400
shitty round man.

1224
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,880
You've like, there's just, he's got wig hair.

1225
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,640
Full jab, full jab story.

1226
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,440
Art like a ladder, more annoying jab.

1227
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,360
And he also keeps doing the Trump thing where he says we're going to do this.

1228
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,800
And then people are undercut because he, he said a thing about like, well, maybe

1229
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,000
we'll tax Disney world hotel rooms more and put up tolls toll booths.

1230
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:43,120
And, uh, that I think came up on the Disney dish and they said they were

1231
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:47,600
contacted by a representative from the Tallahassee GOP who was like, no, that

1232
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,680
all tests really badly and it'll be used against him.

1233
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,760
And, uh, so it's like, he's got people working against it.

1234
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,760
By the way, if you work for the Tallahassee GOP and you're listening to

1235
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,720
this show, don't fuck off.

1236
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,960
You freak nasty little toad.

1237
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,920
Do we have any listeners?

1238
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,680
Do we have any listeners employed by the Republican party?

1239
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,360
Like I work for them.

1240
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,680
But, but specifically the Tallahassee GOP.

1241
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,200
I wonder, honey, um, maybe don't listen to the second gate today.

1242
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:16,960
Why?

1243
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,000
What did they say?

1244
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,440
I want to hear it.

1245
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,960
It's what did my favorite host Jason say?

1246
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,840
He's the one I hate.

1247
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,560
Jason's a spook plug.

1248
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,040
I hate Scott and Mike with their liberal views, but Jason has good, good, uh,

1249
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,480
opinions on the toppings bar and cosmic rays.

1250
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,000
I'm, I'm lockstep with him all the way there.

1251
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:40,680
It's just a beleaguered IT guy who just constantly debugging a million

1252
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:47,000
windows PCs by like all of the aging reptiles in Florida who have no idea

1253
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,640
how to use a computer or phone.

1254
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,640
I'm fiscally conservative.

1255
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,160
That's why I'm at the Tallahassee GOP, Jason.

1256
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,760
But I'm liberal at the toppings bar.

1257
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,080
So we know where to find you to give you a wedgie.

1258
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,200
15 pieces of iceberg lettuce, Jason.

1259
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,160
They can as many as you want and they won't say nothing.

1260
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,560
Iceberg too spicy.

1261
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,360
What icebergs too spicy.

1262
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,680
What lettuce?

1263
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,240
The lettuce.

1264
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,840
Say it's too spicy for this man.

1265
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:15,760
Oh, I see.

1266
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,120
I see.

1267
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,480
That's literally spicy.

1268
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:17,880
I see.

1269
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,280
I see.

1270
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:18,640
I see.

1271
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:18,920
I see.

1272
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:19,440
Gotcha.

1273
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,600
Uh, um, yes.

1274
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,680
Exotic ingredients.

1275
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,040
Um, really quick.

1276
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,040
I'm gonna play this clip.

1277
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:28,880
This is why I've wanted to, we haven't like been dying to talk to Santas, but

1278
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,840
until this thing happened and I, but which I've been thinking about ever since

1279
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:38,040
it's and, and let's do, you might've seen it, but this is his recent, this

1280
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:42,720
recent, basically what happened is, uh, thoroughly outfoxed by Disney.

1281
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Um, they, they continue to essentially have all the power and really Creek.

1282
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,400
And, but he responds like, well, you ain't seen nothing yet though.

1283
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,560
This rodeo ain't, it's not your daddy's rodeo.

1284
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,280
And then like, okay, so what is he?

1285
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:57,560
All right.

1286
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,480
Ron's coming back with the big guns.

1287
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:03,800
How's he going to prove that he actually has the upper hand, even though Disney, I

1288
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:09,200
think did one more thing that still diffuses it all that's on the table right

1289
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,960
now, maybe is like, well, it's possible that Disney will no longer have to pay

1290
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,680
for monorail rides.

1291
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,080
Oh, what's the word?

1292
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,200
Oh, yeah.

1293
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:19,880
Yeah.

1294
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:20,080
Yeah.

1295
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:20,560
Checks.

1296
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,080
Checks.

1297
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:21,440
Okay.

1298
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:21,960
Well, great.

1299
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,520
So all right.

1300
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,640
Big, big victory.

1301
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,920
More in the woke agenda.

1302
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:25,400
Yeah.

1303
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,400
He doesn't pay for their own monorail inspections anymore.

1304
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,000
Right.

1305
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,080
It did it, Ron.

1306
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,360
Also, the funny thing is like, don't say gay past that's past.

1307
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:40,560
So what does he like the, he won in that case and that's months back in the rear

1308
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:45,720
view, but we, but like, but I still don't, I don't love that there's, you know, I,

1309
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,760
there was a gay kiss in light year.

1310
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,720
I heard, I didn't see it, but I heard it.

1311
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:54,240
So we need to keep, if we regulate their monorails, that'll show them for the gay

1312
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:54,760
kiss.

1313
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:59,120
I mean, you really see how full of shit some of these people are because it's

1314
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,040
like the fiscally conservative thing.

1315
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,960
It's like, it's not good to be in a totally adversarial relationship with the

1316
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:10,120
second largest employer of the state you are governor of.

1317
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:14,680
It's something like the largest employer in Florida is the state of Florida.

1318
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,320
The second largest is the Walt Disney company.

1319
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,480
That is what everyone is like.

1320
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:25,480
Now this is exceedingly clear to Donald Trump, the guy who is going to, if you

1321
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,120
want to see it, if you want to see a metaphor of what Trump is going to do to

1322
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:33,240
DeSantis, if he even enters the primary at this point, please see any of the

1323
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,960
photos of Mickey lighting the Maleficent dragon on fire.

1324
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,120
This is an exact, this is exactly what Trump will do.

1325
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,680
And he'll do the same thing if Tucker Carlson tries to enter the race.

1326
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,360
This is the longest shot I have read online, but people go like,

1327
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,080
enter that he would either, he's either going to become Alex Jones or try to run

1328
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,840
for president, but he's such a dweeb.

1329
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:56,600
He's a nerd.

1330
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,480
He's a freak.

1331
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,560
In addition to everything else.

1332
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:04,440
Look, I hate to compare these two, but Mickey has the magic.

1333
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,720
He has the most magic and so does Donald Trump.

1334
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:08,800
Still at this point.

1335
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,600
It's evil magic.

1336
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,360
Yeah, it's evil.

1337
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,200
But there's nobody else says remotely the magic.

1338
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:18,560
Uh, um, so anyways, um, the, all right, just this, this, this press conference

1339
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:23,040
moment, one of the things they tried to do was, was put restrictive covenants on

1340
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,920
the land that the district owns.

1341
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,680
If you look at this whole special district, Walt Disney corporation obviously

1342
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:34,120
owns a lot of it, but the district owns other land, you know, quite frankly, I

1343
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,080
wasn't even thinking about that land.

1344
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:40,040
Uh, this was not something that was really important one way or another.

1345
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:44,000
We just wanted them to live on the same rules, pay the debt, pay the taxes,

1346
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,240
new little mermaid.

1347
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,400
You know, that's all we wanted.

1348
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,560
That's all we wanted from them.

1349
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,000
We know you were not thinking correct.

1350
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:55,560
Like that has not been in doubt Ron in that sentence right there.

1351
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:55,880
Yeah.

1352
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,560
Your sentence went too far.

1353
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:02,120
The men standing around him appear to be falling asleep, standing up like a horse.

1354
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,640
He's not entertaining the people he came with.

1355
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:07,960
Yeah.

1356
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,920
Um,

1357
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,160
what should we do with this land?

1358
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,880
And so, you know, it's like, okay, I mean, people have said, you know, maybe,

1359
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:23,440
maybe have another, maybe create a state park, maybe try to do more amusement

1360
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,240
parks.

1361
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,680
Uh, someone even said like, maybe you need another state prison.

1362
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,280
Who knows?

1363
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:32,120
I mean, I just think that the possibilities are endless.

1364
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:36,920
And so that is, you know, the easy breezy confidence of this man who's

1365
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:42,200
entering the public stage, you know, and maybe we could, uh, uh, I want, uh,

1366
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,440
and, uh, what we could do.

1367
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,840
He has the, his energy in this is like, um, a kid who has to stand up to a

1368
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:54,480
bully and he saw a movie once where somebody stood up to the bully with

1369
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,520
their wits.

1370
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:55,960
Yeah.

1371
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,160
He's like, okay, that's what I'm doing on the playground tomorrow.

1372
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,320
And he walks up and he thinks he's got all the confidence in the world.

1373
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,800
And then it comes time to do his yo mama joke or whatever, and actually

1374
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:10,960
looks at the size of the bully and suddenly eyes are darting everywhere.

1375
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:18,320
Uh, well, you know, we w what I'm looking into might be that your mama is in fact,

1376
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:24,640
uh, uh, so big that when she sits around the house, uh, that she's been said to,

1377
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:28,200
uh, literally sit around the house and that's what, that's how we're looking

1378
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,000
into that clock.

1379
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,720
The media has put in a coma for a week.

1380
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,800
He's just sucker, bully just throws a chair at him.

1381
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,240
Entire school cheers bully.

1382
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:40,560
Yeah.

1383
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,360
Principal applauds him.

1384
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:47,640
Class president handed to presidency handed to him immediately.

1385
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:48,280
Yeah.

1386
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:51,240
Look, even principals think some kids are dweebs.

1387
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,240
He, I, he also, I think he thinks he's doing kind of like, uh, like a mobster,

1388
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,360
like, uh, you know, you got a theme park right there.

1389
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,280
It would be a shame if something happened to it.

1390
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:07,000
Oh, we, we rolled in and we built whatever, like he's thinks he's doing a little

1391
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:15,080
intimidation there, uh, and he's not, we could build another theme park there.

1392
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:15,640
Okay.

1393
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:16,120
Yeah.

1394
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,400
We could build a present there too.

1395
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,120
Also.

1396
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:18,920
Okay.

1397
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,760
I mean, the prisoners aren't going to be loose in the, in Disney world.

1398
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,120
Well, this is what, and this is why I wanted to bring this up is just to like,

1399
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:30,120
okay, look, I'm obviously aware of the reality of this, which is this is something

1400
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:35,120
he said one time only the 20 people at the molten core of his base will think

1401
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,960
that he ever did it or intends to do it.

1402
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:43,800
He, this guy is such a do nothing dipshit, but like, let's say that this

1403
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:48,360
actually is a plan and he wants to see, he's going to put a prison on Disney

1404
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,040
world property.

1405
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,960
What is he, how does he see this going?

1406
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:57,280
Like in his head, is it that like, or, or let me even know.

1407
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:57,800
Okay.

1408
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,080
Again, in his head, he knows he's not doing jack shit, but.

1409
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:05,520
Like the, the, the dumbest, most brain fog to Santa's fan.

1410
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:09,640
Did they think that like, okay, well yeah, there's going to be a castle and that

1411
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,040
there's the Disney castle, right?

1412
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:16,400
And then right behind it, Ron has figured out how to build a bit like a prison

1413
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,960
from a 1940s movie and there will be prisoners leaning out of the bars and

1414
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,920
rattling a can and bothering the kids.

1415
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,040
And then the parents are going to think twice about going there from now on

1416
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,920
showing their, their move, their kids light year movies with kisses.

1417
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,320
But, and there's going to be a dog with a key and that the prisoners can get that

1418
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:39,600
dog key, you know what I actually went to Disney world recently and I saw Ron's

1419
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:43,400
prison it's there it's in, it's in one of the rides and he's got three people

1420
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,400
locked up already, probably due to woke mind crimes.

1421
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,680
And unless they get that dog to come over, I think they're going to stay there

1422
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:50,480
for many years.

1423
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,560
So Ron's doing it.

1424
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:52,960
This whole thing.

1425
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,720
I, I didn't, I had not seen the clip that it came from before.

1426
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,760
I did not realize it was a zinger that does not land because,

1427
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:06,520
well, a zinger has to be indicates that it's sort of like pointed and sharp.

1428
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:11,880
He thinks it's going to be a slam dunk and it's more of a jeb please clap sort

1429
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:17,040
of moment, but click bait websites made this sound like he had a full pitch.

1430
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,240
He had a full plan.

1431
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:23,120
Well, that's what that's, that's my question is like, you know, in, where, in

1432
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,840
a world where we ignore a lot of stuff, what's the plan?

1433
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,200
We're going to imagine here.

1434
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,280
DeSantis is Disney prison is what you're saying.

1435
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,160
Yeah, I think so.

1436
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:30,720
Yeah.

1437
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,280
Well, how plausibly like, where does it go?

1438
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,640
Well, here's what I would pitch is that like Dom Sawyer Island becomes Alcatraz.

1439
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,240
So you build the prison in the magic kingdom.

1440
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:47,240
I think he might be so, I mean, he's dumb, a dumb religious fascist, like bad,

1441
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,720
like it's he's actually, he's done some bets.

1442
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,560
I don't want to completely make him seem incompetent because he's got it.

1443
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,360
He's got to go.

1444
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,640
Um, but I don't, I think he had his mind.

1445
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:00,600
He's thinking like, Oh, like, Oh, let me step back.

1446
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,360
He got married at Disney world.

1447
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:02,880
Oh yeah.

1448
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:03,480
Yes.

1449
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,040
Which is something we should point out as well.

1450
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,120
And he like Floridian, he claims all of my wife wanted to do it.

1451
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,480
And it's like, you're a Disney fan.

1452
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,280
You piece of shit.

1453
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,320
It was really my wife's thing.

1454
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:17,800
I didn't, I, um, yes, I, I did go in for the planning meeting at

1455
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,440
Franck's wedding chapel.

1456
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:24,120
I did sit with my wife in Franck, but I don't like father of the bride.

1457
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,160
And I don't care for Martin short.

1458
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,040
And frankly, Clifford is, is creepy to me.

1459
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:31,920
That's not the kind of thing I like, but I appreciate that.

1460
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,280
Frank didn't put his sexual out.

1461
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,520
Didn't tell me what his sexuality was.

1462
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:40,280
When back in the days of Franck, it was implied there.

1463
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:44,800
Why didn't have to read an article about how Franck is openly gay.

1464
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:50,640
I could, you could, I could imagine Franck having a beautiful wife when he went

1465
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,160
home from dealing with the banks family.

1466
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,920
And I, and that's the agenda.

1467
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,320
The agenda is ruin the father of the bride franchise forever.

1468
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,840
Uh, yeah, this is all true.

1469
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,280
This all has to be very true.

1470
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:07,840
Uh, so I think he's a secret Disney fan.

1471
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,000
Uh, thinks never.

1472
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,280
Yeah.

1473
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,240
He's a fucking shit.

1474
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,040
You do not get mad.

1475
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:17,800
So I put up with it, but you're at the grand Floridia, like the fanciest,

1476
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:22,160
frilliest, you're getting married and inside Mary Poppins.

1477
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,000
Thousands and thousands of dollars for that wedding.

1478
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,440
Yes.

1479
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,920
He made me tens of thousands of dollars.

1480
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,360
So yeah, I think he, he probably considers himself like, well, I've been on these

1481
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:35,680
rides, I could, uh, I could make a ride or a prison.

1482
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,760
And so he's imagining, yeah, like Alcatraz in the middle of Tom Sawers

1483
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:43,640
Island or like, uh, turning I'm trying to think what famous prison is Alcatraz

1484
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,520
the most famous prison, I assume.

1485
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,120
Yeah.

1486
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,520
Uh, uh, sing sing.

1487
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:48,680
Oh yeah.

1488
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,120
Oh, I remember that one.

1489
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:50,720
Sing sing.

1490
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:51,760
Folsom prison.

1491
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:55,600
You know, nice little theme park you got here.

1492
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:59,640
Be a shame if some of my prisoner buddies were running around there.

1493
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,640
Uh, so yeah, I think he thinks that it's, as you're saying, it's going to be, uh,

1494
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:09,200
uh, erected in a park or visible, at least visible.

1495
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,600
And I want to say, think about it.

1496
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,800
I mean, he's, he's not thinking that hard about it, but that's what

1497
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,520
his, that's what he's suggesting.

1498
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,880
Is that it's going to ruin Disney somehow because it's a big prison.

1499
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,760
I got, I got a little worried because I was looking on Google maps and right

1500
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:29,520
near Disney's Hollywood studios, I saw this kind of like unfriendly boxy building

1501
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,880
that looks like it has no windows and really cramped quarters and I thought

1502
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,000
maybe he built it already.

1503
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,480
And then I realized that's just Galactic Starcruiser.

1504
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,840
Well, it looks like the prison, the prison on Andor, Andor, whatever the show.

1505
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,480
Uh, you know, that note.

1506
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,080
So I think, yeah, maybe it's already, maybe it's just a bigger version of that.

1507
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,280
The Galactic Starcruiser.

1508
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:50,640
Yeah.

1509
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,000
Oh yeah.

1510
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,440
Yeah, true.

1511
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:51,720
Yeah.

1512
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:55,560
Like what, you know, and I'm not opposed to theming theming is not the problem.

1513
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:58,200
No, I love the, I love the star Wars universe.

1514
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:03,560
I get swept up into a world of sci-fi magic when I wa I can't wait to see

1515
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,320
my friend Grogu every week.

1516
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:07,960
So it's fine.

1517
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,480
No, the prison will have theme will reach out to the imagineers for, uh, for LCD

1518
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:17,880
screens and, uh, there'll be an animatronic warden here.

1519
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,400
Here's my bitch and every other cell contains an animatronic

1520
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,280
Beagle boy from DuckTales.

1521
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,000
My favorite show was DuckTales.

1522
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,480
Ron, Ron, seems like you know a lot about this.

1523
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,000
44 years old and I love Disney Afternoon.

1524
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,960
I love, I love two things.

1525
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,240
I love rifles.

1526
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:40,960
I love just blast in a case of Bud Light with my rifles.

1527
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,640
And I love the adventures with the DuckTales game.

1528
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,720
And when we walked down the aisle to the gummy bears theme song, we both burst

1529
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,600
into tears at our wedding.

1530
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:57,440
When I gave my, when I told my wife that she is dashing and daring and courageous

1531
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,600
and caring, much like the titular bears, we both just wept and wept.

1532
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:02,960
Yeah.

1533
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,680
And yeah, the Beagle boy.

1534
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,520
Look, I know, I know a little, I don't, this, they went woke.

1535
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,520
The gummy bears weren't woke.

1536
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,240
That's what's important about it.

1537
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:18,400
They were, I think that there were chemicals in the berry juice that were, that

1538
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:22,080
were turning some of the bears to an alternate lifestyle.

1539
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:25,840
And frankly, you know, that's just one of the things I want to be looking into.

1540
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:29,320
He says with fake Trump hands flapping and flapping.

1541
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,880
And when I become, when I become president, we're going to go back and add a wife for

1542
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:38,760
Goofy on Goof Troop, because quite frankly, Goofy being a single dad, asked a few

1543
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,960
questions that I was uncomfortable with.

1544
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,960
There's too many single parents.

1545
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:46,960
I understand that they're widows, but it leaves the viewer, it leaves impressionable

1546
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:51,920
kids to imagine what if pre death they had been in a gay marriage.

1547
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,040
They didn't explain it.

1548
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:57,400
Goof Troop did not start on episode one explaining that Goofy's wife was dead.

1549
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,800
We needed to see a corpse to know exactly what had happened.

1550
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,600
I've worked up a drawing.

1551
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,080
I've prepared to give this to Disney.

1552
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:11,640
And if, and if, unless they insert this, this photo of Disney's wife's, Goofy's

1553
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,840
wife's corpse into the beginning of every Goof Troop, then frankly, we're going to have

1554
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,320
to look at those monorail rules.

1555
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:23,080
You know what? And on the same recut of Goof Troop they can do, they can make that Roxanne

1556
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:25,080
character less gorgeous.

1557
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,480
Too distracting.

1558
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,080
You have to go either way.

1559
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:34,360
Either she has to be a homely dog that just looks like a, because I don't want to be

1560
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,760
attracted to a dog.

1561
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:40,320
It has to be an attractive woman or a real mug of a dog.

1562
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:43,080
And the in-between always made me uncomfortable.

1563
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:49,240
Any number of millennial boys and girls had some sort of awakening with this Roxanne

1564
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:53,200
character. And we need them asleep and stupid.

1565
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,960
So they eventually vote for me.

1566
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,440
Bonkers made cops look too silly.

1567
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,480
Cops aren't silly.

1568
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:05,920
And one thing everyone says about America, cops need to be respected more.

1569
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,800
We need more cops and we need more prisons.

1570
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:13,120
Bonkers is not going to be working in the Disney prison.

1571
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,920
Marsupialami's tail is far too long.

1572
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,400
Was Bonkers a cop?

1573
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,600
Yeah, Bonkers was a mug.

1574
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,600
Bonkers was a pig.

1575
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:28,320
That summer, the BLM summer, the disrespect we saw grew out of these Bonkers,

1576
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:33,040
adult children who thought that all police officers got into hijinks.

1577
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,040
I demand a hijink freak.

1578
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,640
And now that we've taken over Reedy Creek, Disney basically, they're going to

1579
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,080
have to make 70 episodes of a serious Bonkers.

1580
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,600
That's how those rules work.

1581
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,080
I'm sorry, maybe you didn't look into the legislation.

1582
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:49,360
You didn't look at the fine print carefully enough, Mr. Eiger.

1583
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,240
When I'm president, I'm showrunning a new Bonkers.

1584
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:56,720
I will be the showrunner and the commander in chief at the same time.

1585
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:00,960
And I will be guiding Bonkers into a much more gritty, serious direction.

1586
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:06,880
And also I will appoint Gargoyle's villain, David Zanatos, to my cabinet.

1587
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,680
He's a businessman that knows how to get things done.

1588
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:12,160
Great David Zanatos poll, Michael.

1589
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:14,480
Well, we just brought him up with the frags.

1590
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,000
Yeah, I know it's still.

1591
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,600
Oh, wait, no, that's coming out later.

1592
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,640
So never mind.

1593
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,640
You'll hear more about Zanatos soon.

1594
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,640
Call forward, like a rest of development.

1595
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:23,680
That's fine to do.

1596
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:28,320
But the ultimate call forward, Mike, you just made me excited to vote for Ron.

1597
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,440
Well, when you were Zanatos, it was in the cabinet.

1598
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:38,160
When he if, you know, if he ends up in the on the final presidential candidate,

1599
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:43,280
I can't imagine what Trump will do to get in the way or to, I don't know,

1600
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:48,000
make him stammer for 10 minutes straight at the first debate they ever get in

1601
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,320
because he uses one and bear a slightly.

1602
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:50,960
Yeah, yeah.

1603
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:55,520
Nickname, you know, unless that happens, I'm all for the gargoyles.

1604
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:00,080
The Santas Zanatos 2024.

1605
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,760

Santa Zanatos.

1617

Are you sure it's not with an X?

1618
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:35,600
Oh, did I say Z?

1619
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,080
Yeah, you're right.

1620
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:36,880
It is an X.

1621
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:37,760
Look, I'm a little tired.

1622
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:38,000
Yeah.

1623
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,920
Well, we begin with some errors and we end with some errors.

1624
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,520
I made so many errors in this episode.

1625
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:42,960
Really embarrassed.

1626
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:43,360
I'll let it out.

1627
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:43,840
I'll cut them off.

1628
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,120
Yeah, please do.
