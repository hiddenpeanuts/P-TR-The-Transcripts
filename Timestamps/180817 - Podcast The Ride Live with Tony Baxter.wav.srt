00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Warning! The following live podcast takes place inside a closed mall store in the San Fernando Valley.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Full of old Dumbo's, Doom Buggies, and Skyway buckets.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We'll talk to the owner of these items, Richard Kraft, and find out which of these ride vehicles he slept in.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The first few rows should be considered a splash zone, as you will likely get drenched by tears wept by three nerds as they meet their hero,

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Imagineering legend Tony Baxter!

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Please be aware we cannot begin until you turn to the left side of your seat and tug on the dirty yellow strap.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Please be seated.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Live from the Abandoned Sports Authority in beautiful Sherman Oaks, California, it's podcast The Ride!

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hello!

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Whoa!

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Wow!

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is crazy!

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh my god, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Podcast The Ride Live!

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hi there! I know this is probably your first live podcast recording and it's ours too.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, now we're going to have a lot of fun, it's going to be a party.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Imagine this is the 1980s and you're all cool teens and this is Videopolis, baby!

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay? So it's very exciting, we've got a lot of fun stuff planned.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Sure do, let's say our names, I'm Scott Gardner.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hello.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Scott.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Sir.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
My name is Mike Carlson. Thank you.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's almost everyone, right? That's the equation.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I guess we are missing someone.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We could just leave him back there and then he doesn't get to do this unless he's officially invited up here.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That'd be funny and he'd be very mad.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Certainly would. So let's not let that happen.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I mean, we thought that he deserves an extra big entrance because he's preparing for a very important upcoming job that he'll have in about 20 years or so.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes, he's in the middle of a hungry campaign for the highest office in Disneyland.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Okay? This is a man who believes that everyone should be treated equal and that all treats should be enjoyed.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome the future mayor of Disneyland, Jason Sheridan.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Now is the time, now is the best time, now is the best time of the year.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Life is a prize, live every minute, open your eyes and watch how you win it.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
How are you gentlemen?

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We're excellent. Jason, meet your constituents.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I mean, thank you all so much for coming out.

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Thank you for your support in 20, 30 years when I'm in my ripe old age, staring death in the eye, preparing to take on the role of mayor in Disneyland.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Wow, what an inspiring speech.

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This is very fitting because we're only blocks away from where I first crashed for a couple months when I moved to Los Angeles.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's right off of Woodman. Like Walt Disney getting off that train to California.

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I stepped out of a dirty green Saturn Ion, which has only gotten dirtier, and stepped into the dream, the Hollywood dream.

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He's a real man of the people, folks.

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah. I will run that Saturn into the ground before I get a new car.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And then it's going to be part of theme park history. They're going to sell it here at the Van Eeden Galleries.

46
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh, that'd be great.

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We're making history here tonight. This is totally insane for us. We do this thing in a living room with a damn dog running around.

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Last one of these we did, I choked on dog hair a little bit on the microphone and I had to stop talking.

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Here we're in a room of 300 people at the most prestigious venue possible.

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I mean, that's from Disneyland Gallery, but in a broader sense, the Westfield Fashion Square, which if you know me personally,

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and you know how I feel about malls in the Valley, this is essentially my Carnegie Hall. It's a really big deal for me.

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:35,000
My only regret is that they did not orient the stage so that the giant painting that says Team Sports back on that wall was not directly behind us mocking us for a quarter and a half.

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
For never playing sports in our real life.

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah. Is that what dramatic irony is? Would that be dramatic irony?

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sure you can call it that if you want.

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
All right.

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But thank you guys for coming. I mean, it's for being here. It's insane.

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:01,000
People came from far and wide. We just talked to a gentleman from Australia. Is anybody from a farther place than Australia?

59
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Thousand Oaks?

60
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Shout out to Thousand Oaks too. Any Valley villagers in the house?

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh boy. I mean, yeah. It's just really nice to have concrete proof that we do have an audience, that anyone listens to this. I feel good about that.

62
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There's so many friends here. There's so many past guests of the show here. My parents are here.

63
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah!

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'd say wave, except I can see nothing. So I won't... Oh, wait. Hey, yeah, you did poke through. Thank you.

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:42,000
My parents, the people who, depending on how you slice it, either made me this way or didn't do enough to stop me from being this way.

66
00:06:42,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I also want to say to them really fast, you remember those years from approximately age nine to, let's say, 19, where I wasn't super social and I mostly just rambled on about stuff I saw on mouseplanet.com

67
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and Laughing Place and Teacup Town, all the great theme park websites. Well, now, here in front of you, incontrovertible proof, it took a couple of decades, but I made two friends.

68
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Two friends.

69
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You know, this is true. I was talking to my mother yesterday and she said, you know, because my mom knows Jason, but my mom's never met Scott, and she goes,

70
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:35,000
you guys are such nice boys. And she's like, I have never met Scott, but I can tell.

71
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So, a mother just knows. I just wanted to praise your family for that, for raising you to be a very nice boy.

72
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yes, indeed. Yeah. No rules broken by me. That's why I'm not going to take any of the sporting goods stuff that's left back here. It's not mine.

73
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah. Does anyone want some dirty industrial shelves because we have a surplus of dirty industrial shelves.

74
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So, this is a very special night for us for a lot of reasons, but there's one pretty big thing for us, which is, you know, the dream, the golden dream of any podcaster is to get a sponsor.

75
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And for tonight, we finally have one who made this whole thing possible. We have a sponsor tonight. Yeah. Tonight we are sponsored, we're proud to say, by the good people at ExxonMobil. Indeed.

76
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah, we want to thank ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil, accident free since the accident sign broke.

77
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You know, Exxon has made a lot of great things possible in this world. In 1982, they helped Disney create their greatest attraction of all time.

78
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And by greatest, I mean longest. And we're going to perform a little song in tribute to Exxon right now.

79
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Feel the flow. Here we go. Through the universe of energy. See it glow. It's the universe of energy.

80
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Come through time. Send the course. Sail the winds. Tap the source. From the seas to the skies. There's a force beyond our eyes. Jason!

81
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Feel the flow. Here we go. Through the universe of energy. Feel it grow. See it glow. It's the universe of energy.

82
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Of energy. Thank you.

83
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Thanks so much. Thanks ExxonMobil. And now I think we have a duty to meet the people, not only crazy enough to have us come in their space and ruin it with terrible singing,

84
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:30,000
but also the people crazy enough to put this entire event on. Because if you don't know it, everything that you saw downstairs, everybody gets to see the exhibit downstairs before the show began.

85
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Pretty incredible. And it's all from the collection of the same man, this guy and his son put on this incredible event.

86
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:59,000
We're going to ask him a little bit about how this all came together. Please welcome Richard and Nicholas Kraft.

87
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh yeah, join in! Oh great. Whoa. We don't have a song. Feel free, tune up if you need to. Okay. Whoa, yeah, just flick those mics on whatever.

88
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You'll hand it back to us. Hello everyone, thank you for coming. These are the people who made this whole thing possible and congrats on the success of this so far.

89
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's the talk of Instagram, it's the talk of the theme park nerd, it's the number one Disney attraction in Sherman Oaks.

90
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We bested the Disney store over in the Westfield Mall. Yeah. By the way, we are technically not part of the Westfield Mall. We're Westfold Mall adjacent.

91
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:58,000
We don't want to get sued by Westfield. No, that's ugly. Yeah, I also think I parked in the Westfield and I'm worried now that I'll be towed. So I might, give me a sec, hang on.

92
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Now I'll stay here because we need to find out what happened here, how this all came together. You clearly have spent a lifetime collecting this insanity.

93
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Tell us a little bit about your collection. Okay, so the collection started 25 years ago. Prior to that I was just another kid who went to Disneyland once a year.

94
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I was very lucky. Grew up in Bakersfield, which made me very unlucky. But, yeah, really give Bakersfield what for. Oh yeah.

95
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I mean, in some ways there's no spot on earth that's more the opposite of Disneyland. Okay. So, they, but my parents realized this.

96
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So they would save up their money, they were school teachers, and we'd go to Disneyland once a year. I had an older brother who had a Crohn's disease.

97
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So we had to do two things to go to Disneyland. First, we needed the money. Second, he needed to feel well. So a trip to Disneyland was extraordinary.

98
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It was like the best day imaginable times a million. And in between trips we had the attraction poster on our bedroom wall.

99
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And we would plot and plan for the next trip how we were going to allocate our tickets from the ticket book.

100
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Because it never occurred to us you could buy extra tickets. So if you had three e-tickets, you're just going to go on three e-rides.

101
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And we also treated it like a military operation. So we'd plot what path we would take.

102
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I want to ask the audience, by a show of screams, because I can't see any of you, how many of you enter on the left tunnel and how many on the right tunnel?

103
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So, scream if you're a left tunnel person. And how many of you are a right tunnel person? That's hard to determine.

104
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
How many people go both ways? I'm a both ways guy.

105
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Go in and then back out and then in again?

106
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Sometimes.

107
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So, this is everyone's story by the way. I went to Disneyland once a year. People were wondering, but I didn't then buy all of Disney. Something happened.

108
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Something did happen. It involved death. My brother died 25 years ago and I was a bit despondent as one would be when someone dies.

109
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And I didn't know how to feel better so I instinctively went to Disneyland. And I recognized, oh I'm walking on the same sidewalk we walked on and I'm smelling the smell of the water at Pirates of the Caribbean.

110
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And tasting a Dole Whip before it was trendy. And the sound of the Swiss Apolka playing out of the tree house before the Swiss Family Robinson's were evicted.

111
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And all of these sights and sounds and tastes, oh just the feel of lacquered handrails brought back a million memories.

112
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So, a few weeks later I heard there was going to be a Disneyland auction and there was going to be attraction posters.

113
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And I always loved the Autopia poster the best of all. Like this hearty father with his son and everybody's in a really good mood and they're kind of retrofuturistic.

114
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So I got that and I'm a bit obsessive. So one poster became every poster minus one. I never ever got Casa de Frito.

115
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I want to hear your sadness over this. Yeah, it is heavy. And I used to justify, oh I don't want it, it's ugly.

116
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That is the worst sour grape or sour Frito story ever told. And so then I somehow realized you could get ride vehicles.

117
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And I sort of became known as the guy. So a lot of black market people would call me in the middle of the night, I've got six sets of Small World figures.

118
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It was like a hostage situation. I literally met those figures in a deserted Fry's parking lot and they were in the back of a truck.

119
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's all come full circle. Now we're at an abandoned sporting goods store. They've returned home sort of.

120
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But I have been to Fry's and I can say I've never been to a sporting goods store.

121
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yes, this is...

122
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I am glad that you chose to meet, although it was closed, in the parking lot of the thematic electronics store.

123
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Oh my God. Well, Nicky and I always say, what if a flying saucer actually did crash in a building and we're all just thinking, oh isn't that clever?

124
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We've all been laughing at the pain of many people.

125
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Also, who's like, best buyer Fry's and the owner of Fry's is like, we got to do something. Should we offer lower prices? Should we do some sales?

126
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No, let's just theme. And they're all themed differently. The Woodland Hills is like Alice in Wonderland, is that correct?

127
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That's not as cool as the B-movie sci-fi in Burbank.

128
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Well, that's the Disney Sea, I think.

129
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yes. And the DCA is definitely the...

130
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The Mills?

131
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yes. And it's the wrong Alice. If it was a Disney themed Alice, it would be awesome. But it's based like there was a book before the movie.

132
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What?

133
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Wait, so it's just like a nightmare Edward Gorey, Alice in Wonderland electronics store?

134
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Absolutely joyless. I mean, when I want to buy a D-cell battery, I want happiness.

135
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So, death posters collecting 25 years ago. And I'm really blessed. There's two things in life I'm extremely passionate about.

136
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:56,000
One's Disneyland and the other is film and Broadway music. And I get to combine both of them because what I do for a living is represent as a talent agent, film and Broadway composers, including three Disney legends who I collect.

137
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I want to put them in Lucite cases because I have Richard Sherman of the Sherman Brothers.

138
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That's a one of two. That comes in a set of two.

139
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And Danny Elfman from Nightmare Before Christmas. Danny's my first client. We've been together like over 30 years. And then I acquired for my collection Alan Menken.

140
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Who will be doing a charity concert on this very stage because as his agent, I said I finally... He did some prestigious things. There's just a big event for him at Carnegie Hall.

141
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But I said you've never played a sports authority.

142
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Wait, I think we beat him. We did the first musical performance.

143
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Well, that's how we sold him.

144
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yeah, I always wanted to.

145
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So August 24th, Alan Menken on this stage with a piano, singing songs, telling stories, and 100% of the profits go to charity, which brings to why this exists.

146
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
We don't need you guys, by the way. He's just going to go. You guys can like it. You're fine.

147
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So we grew up. He grew up with all the collectibles. Like he had the Tiki Bird over his bed.

148
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Naturally, as one would.

149
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But we did not know it worked.

150
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It came mounted on the sign that's hanging there and we just thought it was a nice theming for the sign.

151
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And then when you turned it over to Mike Van Eten of Van Eten Galleries, he said, wow, you have an original Jose the Tiki Bird?

152
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
We said, no. He said, yes, you do.

153
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Yeah.

154
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And you were skeptical. I'm a little happy that I didn't know it worked. That would have been a horror.

155
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Like you would have snuck into my room at night, you know, and like turned him on and like it's a having been here for a week, hearing that song over and over.

156
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Great song. Great showing brother song. It is a ride of racial stereotypes.

157
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What?

158
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So it's very uncomfortable. Yeah, it's very uncomfortable to just hear these racial stereotypes.

159
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Extremely progressive. Nothing that wouldn't. It's weird in 2018.

160
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There's no way that's a white guy doing the voice.

161
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah.

162
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
OK. Speaking of, you'll notice every attraction poster, the people are white.

163
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I did notice that.

164
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Except for some reason Matterhorn. We think it's because most of the poster is white. So they would have blended in. So they are black people.

165
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
They are black people. And it predated Cool Runnings is what we kind of realized.

166
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I think someone saw that poster and said, there's a movie.

167
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Disney gets their ideas from everywhere.

168
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:56,000
We want to show you something really fast. We're not, you know, we don't have as podcasters, we don't have the discretionary funds to buy thousands and thousands of items.

169
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But we are amateur theme park speculators. And we look at some of the stuff on the podcast once in a while.

170
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And a long time ago, we found a little piece of art that we wanted to have you as an expert. We wanted to have you appraise it a little bit.

171
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Sure.

172
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And just kind of.

173
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
There's nothing like visuals on a podcast.

174
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it'll be on the Twitter.

175
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That'll be on.

176
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The podcast, the ride. But we'll describe what we see. And we've talked about this before.

177
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah. So yeah, like this says like it's an original piece of promo art from Disneyland. So some people might know where we're going with this.

178
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Here is the photo in question.

179
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Oh, for those listening, for everyone at home and all our ships at sea, you're looking you're looking at a painting of Winnie the Pooh and his common law wife.

180
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
They are in front of the castle at Disneyland, and they seem very much in love.

181
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Winnie is about to motorboat her. He is going in. He's going for a jungle cruise.

182
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I was going to go with the proper boat joke.

183
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,000
So like price wise, if you were still collecting, like what do you think something like this might cost, might run?

184
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Well, this crosses into two categories. So things become more valuable if two different types of collectors are going after it.

185
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So this is both people who love Disney, three Disneyland, Pooh and erotic art.

186
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The furry community is going to go crazy for that.

187
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
They're going to have to outbid the polyamorous community.

188
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
What is this look in his eyes?

189
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's called love, Nicky.

190
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
That is not love. That is like, you know what I'm about to do.

191
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's that Nala face. It's the Nala.

192
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Is she, I'm sorry, is she pinching his nipple?

193
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
She is pinching his nipple, yes.

194
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Wow.

195
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It also looks like SNL cast member Jan Hooks.

196
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yes.

197
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh yeah.

198
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I don't, I.

199
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I actually think I saw them on YouPorn actually.

200
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Oh no.

201
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Under the rare category Poo Cocky.

202
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Really going for it.

203
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Running an exhibit that says family friendly all over it.

204
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Only Scott told his family he was going to be on good behavior tonight.

205
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
The rest of us did not make that promise.

206
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Cover your ears guys.

207
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So things are being discussed.

208
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
So price wise, what do we think?

209
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
On eBay, on eBay.

210
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What do you think it is on eBay and what would you pay?

211
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I want to show you how an auction works.

212
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Sure.

213
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
What's the starting bid, Nicky?

214
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
$250.

215
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
$250, $250. Can I hear a three?

216
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Oh that's a $300 piece, absolutely.

217
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
$350.

218
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
This joke's going to get funnier and funnier.

219
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm going to guess, now do you have a real number?

220
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
The next slide is the eBay page itself.

221
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Where would you, Richard, what would you be willing to pay or what would you?

222
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Personally, I don't collect.

223
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
He has standards, please.

224
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Some standards.

225
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You lie very well.

226
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Very good joke.

227
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
My heart is no longer like this.

228
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Have you guys seen Melting Face Snow White downstairs?

229
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I am in love.

230
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It may be the only thing I bid on to get back.

231
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So she means nothing to me.

232
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It hasn't gone yet.

233
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I think you can take it back, right?

234
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
No, I wouldn't do that.

235
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
That's a slippery slope.

236
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm going to say, I love a good guessing game.

237
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
That's a $3,500 piece of art right there.

238
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Wow.

239
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
What's eBay have it at?

240
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
eBay has it at $300.

241
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Oh, that's a steal.

242
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Wait, and you can pay monthly.

243
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Wait, why is it for $22 of shipping?

244
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
How big is this?

245
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
$22 in shipping, wow.

246
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
When we do a Patreon, we're going to lose somebody who thinks this is a better deal.

247
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Much better monthly installment plan.

248
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yes, or you can make an offer.

249
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Has anyone done that?

250
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Do you want me to make your offer?

251
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I'll make an offer right now.

252
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Wait, I'll buy it right now, okay?

253
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh, you want me to do it?

254
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Okay, so make an offer and see if they get back in time.

255
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Offer them $263.

256
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You were going lower?

257
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yeah, that's how you make the offer.

258
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Oh, then I don't.

259
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:45,000
You can buy it now for $300, but I'm about to offer $263, and they're definitely going to go for it.

260
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
You're hooked up to do this, Mike?

261
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I don't know, we'll see.

262
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I feel like we can't.

263
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
We don't really need to pause in real time.

264
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
This will be a cliffhanger at the end of the episode.

265
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
We'll let you know, and if we get it, we'll all split it collectively.

266
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yes.

267
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
$350.

268
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
No, I'm planning to pay over 12 months.

269
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
We have to have it on the installment plan.

270
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Okay, what else we got?

271
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
That's it, and I feel like we should bring up the man of the hour.

272
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Absolutely.

273
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
If there's anything else you'd like to say about your event here, or any way people can participate, or anything you want them to check out in the future.

274
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Buy, buy, buy. Everything must go. It's a fire sale.

275
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I actually have, before you bring them out, I have a Tony Baxter story.

276
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

277
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Please.

278
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So, one day somebody sells me a metal plaque from the front of Tomorrowland, the dedication plaque that's in the rock.

279
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And it was like, okay, this is really cool.

280
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And so I purchased it, and two weeks later Tony came to visit me in my office.

281
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
He looks over, he goes, that was stolen out of my office three weeks ago.

282
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Tony.

283
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It's like all the gentlemen I bought it from, and said I'm not going to ask questions, I want a refund, and this needs to go back to where it came from.

284
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So I went back and then I think Tony sold it.

285
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
No, I honestly don't know what happened.

286
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But by far the best Tony Baxter story is the night Tony Baxter and I went to a deserted floor of the Sheraton Universal to meet Michael Jackson.

287
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah.

288
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
The air went out of the room.

289
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
My God.

290
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So Tony could tell the story up to the point that I joined it, but he had had multiple meetings with Michael who wanted to hire him.

291
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And what he wanted after that was unclear.

292
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So he brought me in because I'm a talent agent and thought maybe I could negotiate or move the conversation further.

293
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So it's just three chairs, Michael Jackson, Tony and myself, and I start asking questions.

294
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I go, so do you want to hire Tony to work for you or start a new company like Imagineering, that kind of a thing?

295
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Can you give me the year here by the way?

296
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
He can.

297
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'm not, it was before he died.

298
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
But what if it was after?

299
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:23,000
All I know is, I can tell you if anyone's a Michael Jackson fan, after we left the meeting, I said, what was that hanging from Michael Jackson's nose?

300
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And we realized it was his nose.

301
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So it was that era.

302
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
That era.

303
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
That's how you tell time in Michael Jackson.

304
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So I asked if it should be him or are they forming a company?

305
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And Michael Jackson said, that's a really good idea.

306
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So then I said, is he building theme parks or is this for hotels?

307
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
That's a really good idea.

308
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So I went through a list about seven things and always got the same response, complimenting me on my really good ideas.

309
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And I finally thought I'd break the ice a little.

310
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
This wasn't going well.

311
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
So I said, so tell me about the first time you went to Disneyland.

312
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And he goes, I worked there when I was five years old, which kind of made me sad.

313
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
No one's first experience at Disneyland should be working.

314
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And then I got a little cocky and I said, oh, by the way, I own a Dumbo.

315
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And it was the only time in the meeting he looked at me like, I'm Michael Jackson.

316
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Do you think I'm impressed by this?

317
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So needless to say, nothing came from this meeting except for a great memory and a way to segue to bringing out the man himself.

318
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Of course.

319
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
The man himself.

320
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
OK, well, wait, are we doing a switch off?

321
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I think we're doing a switch off.

322
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Richard, Nicholas, thank you so much.

323
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah, thank you very much.

324
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Thanks for having us.

325
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And thanks for doing.

326
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Thanks for putting on this wonderful event and for giving us the opportunity to do what we get to do right now.

327
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Let me show you something really fast.

328
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
This is a magazine that my mom got me a subscription to in 1995.

329
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I was 10 years old.

330
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
She knew that I was more interested in theme park stuff than the average kid.

331
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And she and she got me this this magazine, the E ticket.

332
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Anybody get the ticket?

333
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Does anybody go back that far with this was a wonderful like the fanzine with really cool pictures and interviews with Imagineers.

334
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And I loved all of it.

335
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:49,000
But the second one that I ever got absolutely blew my mind because it had this extremely cool interview with this Imagineer who was so thoughtful and just spoke in such detail about all the all the care that was put into all of the rides that were blowing my little kid mind from the 70s and the 80s.

336
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And the 90s.

337
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
When I learned about this guy, that's when I became an incurable theme park nerd for life.

338
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And that's the person we get to bring out right now.

339
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
In case you don't know that this this man worked on.

340
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Let's list them and list his greatest hits.

341
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Really thunder Mountain Railroad.

342
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Journey into imagination.

343
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Splash Mountain.

344
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Disneyland Paris.

345
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Star tours.

346
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Indiana Jones.

347
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
What else we got?

348
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I mean, there's tons more there.

349
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
We'll talk about it, though.

350
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is like the Mick Jagger of theme park design.

351
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
OK, when he comes out here, give him a Mick Jagger like welcome and uproarious applause for Mr.

352
00:31:44,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Tony Baxter.

353
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Well, Tony, just to start us off, you know, we want to thank you for all of your wonderful contributions to Disney and the themed entertainment world at large.

354
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
But I especially want to thank you for your most important work.

355
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Your time on Main Street as an ice cream scooper is this.

356
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yeah, this is working.

357
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Those were like the most fun, really.

358
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Yeah, you come in and you got to be kind of talking with a guest and looking at all the action.

359
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And for one year, I actually got to hang around Walt Disney being there and he would come in like very early in the morning, you know, and drive the truck that you see right downstairs, drive that around the park.

360
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Everyone thought he was kind of crazy. But later I found out his brother was a truck driver and Walt really admired and wished he could do something simple like that.

361
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But he could only do it before Disneyland opened.

362
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And that was the cool thing about setting up the ice cream window that early in the morning. I got to see it.

363
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I mean, that's amazing.

364
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I do want to just toss you.

365
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Now, you was fun, you know, you mean, well, you've done by saying things that we feel so earnestly about you have you have shut down all of our snark brains.

366
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
We're supposed to be. Yeah, we're supposed to be funny like snark and sarcastic comedians.

367
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
But we're like, oh, wow. I think I'm back on track. I think I'm back on track.

368
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I just want to toss you some quick hardballs. Cup or cone?

369
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Nothing quick with me.

370
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Okay. Do you prefer cup or cone? Cone.

371
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Favorite flavor? Chocolate chip. Oh, me too. Great.

372
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Actually, I got to qualify that it's mint chocolate chip. Oh, very popular.

373
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
That is now Jason's favorite.

374
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Preferred toppings? Toppings?

375
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
The kind of chocolate that hardens that you used to get at Frosty Freeze. Oh, that's great. Yeah. Yeah.

376
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And do you have any brand loyalties for ice cream? Any fun? Yes. Thrifty, because if you go. Yeah.

377
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,000
If you go in there and ask for medieval madness, it's actually the nougat taste from inside a Three Musketeers bar. Awesome.

378
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Oh. Really awesome. Wow. That's an amazing tip.

379
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:37,000
All right. Really, it's good. That's all of my questions. Gentlemen, if you'd like to take it from here.

380
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You wanted to know about Disney, right? At some point. Yeah.

381
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Well, so, all right. So you're one of the people who achieved the dream of, you know, starting doing, you know, just like smaller jobs at Disneyland.

382
00:34:51,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And you worked your way all the way up to Imagineering. We know about the time at Carnation. Any other rides you worked on?

383
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Oh, yeah. I mean, I dreamed of getting out of Carnation to do the rides. But really, I mean, working in the food service, you didn't have the responsibility of people's lives, you know, that you do when you're working a ride.

384
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:23,000
All of a sudden they hand you this controller and like if someone's clothing snags in that grill down there, you better shut it off right away before it pulls their clothes off or something like that.

385
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You know, and you go, oh, OK. Or in the submarine ride, if somebody panics and they run for the hatches, it's going under the waterfall.

386
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
That's a bad thing. You know, so all of a sudden, the dream idea of how much fun it would be to work those rides.

387
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And it was. But you really can let your guard down. You had to really. Sure. Is there one you'd be like too afraid to to work on if given if you were assigned?

388
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Yeah. Well, not afraid. But I'm not. Believe it or not, I'm talking pretty glibly now. But the thought of working the jungle cruise scared me to death. And I never did. I never did.

389
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:08,000
How come? I don't know. I can do memorization like for centuries, man had but his own two eyes to explore the universe within a single snowflake. Now the mighty microscope. Yeah, I can do that by heart.

390
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:18,000
But jungle, not a word. Oh, wow. Gotcha. Now you well, that's it. You worked at Adventures Through Interspace. Yeah. For a whole summer, I saw everything.

391
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Geez. And then, you know, not to jump around too much, but you were you're running that ride. And then a couple of decades later, you are replacing that ride. Yeah.

392
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:44,000
With a with a with a little attraction called Star Tours. Yeah. And you can believe all the people that rode in about their life being changed by interspace or their life being created in interspace or a lot of things like that.

393
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:52,000
You know, made it very difficult to take it out. Yeah, those things have a high back. They kind of like high whatever's going on.

394
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Like like now, like in this era, like people online get very upset if Tower of Terror gets turned into Guardians of the Galaxy. But like, was it the same way back then where people were upset?

395
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It was actually worse because we had never gone to the outside for this overused word that you hear every day now. I.P. Two letters actually. I.P. And so everything had been Disney, Disney, Disney, Disney.

396
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And we were all sort of faced with the fact that the last really stunning animated film had been like Jungle Book back in Walt's time.

397
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And the rest were pleasant, but they were more for kids. And so that that thing where it really bridged like Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast and the Latin, you know, young people went and date people go on dates, everything that hadn't that hadn't happened yet.

398
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So, you know, you looked at who is really where the population, the young people of 1978 to 1985. That was all Lucas Spielberg stuff.

399
00:37:47,000 --> 00:38:01,000
You know, so I drew the long straw, I guess, a short straw. And I said, someone's got to go over to the studio and tell them Disneyland is going to be hurting if this generation of kids doesn't see the things they grew up with, all the action toys, all that stuff.

400
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So Ron was good. This is Ron Miller, who is a son-in-law to Walt said, well, why don't we have a meeting up at the Silverado Vineyards and I'll have George Lucas come over and we'll talk about it.

401
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Well, if you can imagine being a kid from Orange County works scooping ice cream. And I'm now at the Silverado Vineyards and a BMW comes up with George Lucas in it.

402
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Diane is Disney is serving the potato salad and says, oh, there's plenty more where that came from. So don't be bashful.

403
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And I'm sitting there going, does it get any better?

404
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Wow.

405
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:51,000
That brings up a question, you know, not to fawn over you too much, but I would say you are the most influential voice of the latter 20th century when it comes to the theme design and entertainment.

406
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Do you think Michael Iser's son, Breck Iser is number two?

407
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Pause please. No, no, you know, it's it really is a team effort, you know, so like, I think you got to you got to think of the leadership as people and their success or failure is how well they're able like a director of music or anything else to inspire a whole group of people to take the ball and run with it further.

408
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Because I mean, you can have millions. Everybody has dreams of rides. You guys never ideas have ideas for new rides or anything.

409
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I don't know.

410
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's really assembling the incredible range of people that can make good ideas or bad ideas come true.

411
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Yeah.

412
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Well, you, Jason, you were I think what you're driving.

413
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Yeah, I derailed it that time. See, I can do it too.

414
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Is your number one. Does that make Michael Iser's son Breck Eisner number two?

415
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Because it seemed like I mean the stories are that like he would rubber stamp a lot of those rides.

416
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Well, I was very lucky. I mean, you got to realize Michael was really the first 10 years of Michael Eisner with Franks Wells best 10 years I've ever worked at Disney.

417
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Really. These two guys were hands on. They were in our face every week. And when Michael came over the first day, he said, I don't know anything about this business.

418
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:26,000
So I brought my 14 year old here, Breck, and he's going to tell me whether the ideas that you're going to show us are any good or not.

419
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So your first thought is my career depends on a 14 year old.

420
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And then think about this. What is our audience at Disneyland? You know, and I'm about to pitch Star Wars as a ride and I'm about to talk about Splash Mountain.

421
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So to give my brain some recovery time to think about how do I pitch Splash Mountain, Bear Rabbit, Bear Bear, all of that. That's not 14 year old fodder.

422
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So I went with Star Wars and I talked the whole thing through and the end of it.

423
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Now, I gave it in a way that a 14 year old would like it rather than my normal pitch that's for executives, you know, where everything has got to be.

424
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:11,000
This has a throughput over 1600 an hour and at that rate we'll do 24,000 in a day if we're operating from eight in the morning until midnight.

425
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:18,000
No, it was like, this is so cool. And you know how it felt when you were going down in the trench and the pilots going to go, I've always wanted to do this.

426
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And then down there you go and you feel the whole thing. And Breck says, wow, dad, that's he that's incredible. We've got to do that.

427
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
So Michael says, OK, we're doing that. What else do you have?

428
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And then I went, OK, how do I pitch lovable Bear Rabbit and silly old Bear Bear to a 14 year old?

429
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Well, you do the tallest, steepest drop that's ever been imagined and then hidden in the dark, something no one's done before.

430
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:51,000
We go down a dip and then unlike boats anywhere, the boats go back up and like a roller coaster and we get done with the whole thing.

431
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And he goes, Dad, that's even better than Star Wars. So it was OK, we're doing that.

432
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And Michael says, so that'll be open the Star Wars one next year and then splash after that.

433
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And then management came in and gave him a dose of reality.

434
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
But in an ideal world, those happen like they open the same day or something like if there was limitless money.

435
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:24,000
You would love that. But when he found out, no, it would take three years for Star Wars and five years for then, he said he looked at Frank and said, who's the hottest person in Hollywood today?

436
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Frank says Michael Jackson goes, get Michael. Let's get who's the best director? Coppola. Get Coppola. Bring George in to produce it.

437
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And then he looked at all of us and he said, you can't tell me we won't have a movie out there in a year because I make movies.

438
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Wow. Wow. Wow.

439
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I was going to say if you followed Francis Ford Coppola's career in the 80s, it was just him making a movie, going bankrupt, making a movie, going bankrupt.

440
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
That's true. It is true.

441
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Do you have did you what did you did you do stuff on Captain EO as well?

442
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Like did you did you advise on it or did you have any? That's where I met Michael Jackson.

443
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
We actually created three scenarios. One was a science fiction that became Captain EO.

444
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Another was a fairy tale. And I think the third one was kind of an Indiana Jones like adventure thing.

445
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And Michael just sort of right away said, I want to do a space film. I want to be Luke Skywalker.

446
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And that's that's how that happened. And my life was changed forever.

447
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I just remember we filmed that at Culver Studios over in Culver City.

448
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And Michael, to get himself up out of a very he's very calm in real life was.

449
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And when we were on the set, he would turn the sound up to like deafening loud, deafening.

450
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And then he would just become a different person under that.

451
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
But I'm really shocked that he never had a hearing problem. I'm sure he would have if he lived.

452
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Actually, do you now do you dispute anything about Richard's story about you and Michael Jackson or do you have anything anything else?

453
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
No, but he only told you the end of the story. You got 30 minutes to go into the.

454
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,000
No, I mean, I remember sitting with him eating bubble gum and he had one of those 120 packs of double bubble.

455
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And he had called me normal. Go on. Yeah, he called me.

456
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,000
But he was really I said it's very important that to do this work, to kind of be in this industry and look at Richard.

457
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
He'd probably agree. You have to maintain some of your 12 year old self.

458
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
And Michael was kind of cheated out of a childhood. So as an adult, he was trying to recapture that.

459
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
So he's eating the bubble gum while he's having me go through four cassettes and I boombox.

460
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,000
He was recording everything to know about building an Indiana Jones ride, you know, and it would get to the end.

461
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,000
He goes, stop, stop. And then he'd put Tony Baxter side one and then turn it over and OK, we're ready to go.

462
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
But he only chewed the gum until the sweet went out. Then he'd wrap it in the comic.

463
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I used to do that. Yeah.

464
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Now, that's crazy.

465
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So well, you know what we haven't talked about? You know, you talk about getting IP into the into the parks, but you created one of the most beloved original Disney attractions.

466
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
That was not previously in a movie or TV show. And we're talking about figment and absolutely.

467
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Yeah. And for those of you who have only been down to Epcot since 2000 and ridden the sham of an attraction that's there.

468
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Oh, wow. We weren't going to go that far. But now that we know that, I think even the company knows that.

469
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So, you know, I don't know. But, you know, it was a beautiful attraction that talked about this process that every single person does.

470
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And that's they gather input. You're gathering it right now. You're storing it some way or another.

471
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And you will use it to combine with all the things you know to create new things. And it was a very inclusive thing.

472
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:02,000
The Sherman Brothers captured that thought with a one little bark song. And the only thing that was missing was the name of our dragon, which you've probably all heard the story.

473
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,000
But I was home one night and we Dream Finder came out of just quickly. He's a guy that finds dreams. So he's the dream fight.

474
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:18,000
The dragon. What is that going to be? And one night I was watching Magnum P.I. and Magnum had put a goat in the garden, which ate all of the plants in the foliage.

475
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:28,000
And the old butler came in mad as hell and said, What is going on out there? And Magnum, to calm him down, just said, Oh, it must be a figment of your imagination.

476
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And the butler looked at him and said, Figments don't eat grass. And I just sat there for a minute and went, Well, what do they look like and what do they eat?

477
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And then it just popped. It said, you know, isn't it obvious? So the next day I grabbed a little carved figure.

478
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
We had the model and I put it on the desk in front of our whole team. And I said, Meet Figment.

479
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And everybody looked at me and said, How did we know? I mean, that is it's so obvious. And what's cool about it.

480
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:03,000
You can try this on your phone when this is over, write in the word figment, Google the word figment and then push images.

481
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And every single image for pages and pages is figment. Now, that's an English word has been around for 500 years.

482
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And now we own it. That's what I call. I call that valuable mental real estate.

483
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Is there like when I was a child and we share this and I think everyone in the audience, when we were children and we went on this ride, Figment felt like he was your best friend.

484
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Maybe no, no one feels that. So I like you're thinking of Figment. Do you have a fondness for him in that way?

485
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Or do you identify with him? Like when you were creating him, was it like I want to make some like the perfect best friend for I guess me is really what I'm asking.

486
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Like what was your thought? And like is he what qualities will he have? Like like what was an overall like kind of philosophy?

487
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:04,000
You were the perfect age audience for it. You know, we had very serious people that had passed the gates of childhood and sort of given up that 12 year old.

488
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
They would go, I don't get it. I don't get it. The movie I love is big.

489
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:23,000
And you can watch this dynamic between Tom Hanks, who's an adult with a 12 year old mind, giving a prayer in a presentation where this guy is talking about facts and figures and extending the penetration of this product to the 14 year old level and all that.

490
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And Tom is playing with it and going, you know, and raises his hand. Yes. Well, I don't get it.

491
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
What's fun about turning a building into a robot and the guy goes, didn't you read your charts and all that?

492
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
So, you know, the dilemma was children just caught it right away.

493
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And the dynamic of Dreamfinder being kind of a Santa Claus or a knowledge figure who's lovable and benign and this child who just is drinking it all up.

494
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And after like two minutes of one thing, he's on to something else. And it was an extraordinary combination of two perfectly balanced comedians.

495
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I think the problem now is you've got two wacky people. You've got Eric Idle and Figment. So they don't you can't play off.

496
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:15,000
It's not like Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy or Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis or Figment and Dreamfinder. It's Figment and Figment.

497
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:22,000
You know, so it was a perfect combination and you can't believe the letters we still get.

498
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:32,000
And it's your age group that's kept it alive. So keep those letters coming because Marvel took a gamble and did 15 episodes and they were hugely successful.

499
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
They went hard bound, which doesn't often happen with a stand on.

500
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
They are like you're saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The comics really. Has anybody read it? Yeah, it's cool.

501
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I did have a question about that. So like Figment, Dreamfinder, everyone knows. Hold on. This will work.

502
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:55,000
We have audio visual. We do if it would work. Except your laptop setup. While Mike's figuring that out.

503
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:03,000
So you mentioned the sham version. So what happened? Like why did that change happen?

504
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Me? What happened? Oh, it's one of those scenarios. I see. No, I mean it was very clear that it was to be an inclusive thing.

505
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I mean so many kids grow up with their parents saying what's wrong with you? Aren't you imaginative?

506
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
You've got to work, you know, come up with some idea to do on your own.

507
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Well, so if that's drummed into everyone and if you if the goal of high school is to beat the 12 year old out of you and make you a productive adult without childlike thoughts.

508
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I mean, I don't know what I would have done to create all the things I've created if I couldn't imagine what it would be like to be, as you said, that kid going on that ride and having the appeal and the emotional connection to the characters in the scenes involved.

509
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:54,000
So, you know, this is a danger we have in our school system. So the the new one, I think, sort of reflects a more adult attitude.

510
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And if you can explain to me what an upside down toilet on the ceiling and learning how a skunk smells improve your imagination, it would help me a lot because I, for one, can't figure it out.

511
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Comedy was very interesting in the 90s. I guess that's all I can.

512
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,000
So, so yeah, so Dream Finder, this is this is what he top out appeared on the ride. And then this is so.

513
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So in his original incarnation, he was a sort of jolly Santa Claus. I was wondering, how do you feel about the change they made to the Marvel comics to make him a whole lot sexier?

514
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Like, look, like, look at the look at this man.

515
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
This is a very handsome man. And it's just, I mean, I think it's good. I just, how did you feel?

516
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Have you ever interviewed anyone from People magazine about what covers sell best?

517
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
That's a good point. That's a good point.

518
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:57,000
The stories are sweet and charming inside. See, they made Eric Idle's Dr. Nigel Channing a super hunk.

519
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Maybe that would help. More appealing on on some level.

520
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
But I think, you know, the idea of the stories was kind of going back to the origin stories.

521
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
But I would love to see a figment animated feature film, the figment movie.

522
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
We all want it.

523
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
This all we want this. There's a streaming service coming out and this is a perfect place for a TV show about figment.

524
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
So somebody out there to make this happen.

525
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
So maybe there's someone from Disney out there who can.

526
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I mean, literally, if you had the IP where you push a word on Google and every image of it, the Disney company owns, why wouldn't you do something with it?

527
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I don't get that.

528
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
It's funny. This might be a place where Breck Eisner could help again.

529
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Because do you all know? I don't know if we've ever brought this up on the podcast. Breck Eisner went on to direct the movie The Last Witch Hunter starring Vin Diesel.

530
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:52,000
And he's currently an executive producer on The Expanse, the next season coming soon to Amazon.

531
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
This would be perfect.

532
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
You have a phone there that you're looking all this stuff up.

533
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Not for that part yet. You had Breck Fax.

534
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
We have it all committed to memory, Breck's career.

535
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
So can I ask about here? We're talking about stuff in Epcot Center.

536
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:18,000
And then we in here in California almost got a West Coast version of Epcot Center called Westcott.

537
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,000
And and you were I don't know your position, but you were sort of supervising that that project.

538
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Yeah, we had we were actually kind of pitting Long Beach against Anaheim.

539
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So we developed the Disney Sea project, which sort of saw the light of day because most of it you can visit over in Tokyo.

540
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
So Tokyo Disney Sea became the outgrowth of Long Beach Disney Sea.

541
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
How many days would you recommend?

542
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:50,000
OK. All right. So this is a running feature on the show.

543
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Just to explain it real quick, not take up too much time where the three of us.

544
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
No idea.

545
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
The three of us are split. We've never been to Tokyo. Mike's going in September.

546
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
We're going in September. I said so there was a night at my birthday and we had a couple of drinks, nothing crazy.

547
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
And I said my girlfriend, Lindsay and I are going to Tokyo and we're going to stay three days.

548
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And Scott got very riled up and he said, no, two days is right.

549
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
And I said, well, that's just one extra day. And he was like, no, why do you have to go an extra day?

550
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And I was like and then we got into kind of an argument about it.

551
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And then we talked to Jason and Jason said four days, four days, which I need to explore the hotel.

552
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
And then you got to walk around and appreciate the design.

553
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I've been beaten down on this point and I'm willing to accept whatever.

554
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
But but your official answer for a Tokyo Disney.

555
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:44,000
My official answer without a guide and without extreme amount of fast passes, I would say four days.

556
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
All right. Oh, my God.

557
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Get out of here. Get out of here. Oh, Jason always wins.

558
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Officially shamed. I know all of that. That's what it takes.

559
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
That has nothing to do with Westcott. No, it doesn't.

560
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:13,000
We got way off the point. No. What I what I wanted to say about Westcott, because, you know, we we can't we can't talk about every facet of it.

561
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:25,000
But if you could tell us what is the single thing that your ideal version of Westcott might have had that would make us the most jealous that we don't get to experience it?

562
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Well, I mean, we had the longest ride that had ever been done, a 45 minute cruise called World Cruise.

563
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Imagine 40 pirates of the Caribbean with dips, all kinds of audio metronix and five stations in the four corners of the world as well as future world.

564
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:51,000
And so you'd learn about each quarter of the world and then you'd have a chance to disembark or stay on through the whole thing or ride it all day like the train around Disneyland.

565
00:55:51,000 --> 00:56:00,000
But knowing that we didn't want to make it boring, we put we made sure we had a thrill part and some audio metronix in each of the four or five segments.

566
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So that was pretty cool. The other part you can kind of get a feeling for, which was going to be the four corners of the world had four mega hotels that actually formed the berm.

567
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Because we're so landlocked there that we built up these fairly large hotels that were all themed and kind of cascaded down to kind of the look that you have in World Showcase around the front end of it.

568
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:31,000
So people are living kind of up in the back and playing in swimming pools on the roofs of the mid level area and then on down into the day to day park visitors in the front.

569
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:46,000
And while we didn't do that, I think someone in Las Vegas thought it was a pretty cool idea because about half of it, if you drive down the strip now, is kind of like very different from the Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin Vegas of the past.

570
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And a lot of that happened just after we kind of put the thing to bed.

571
00:56:51,000 --> 00:57:04,000
That's wild. Oh, you don't go ahead. I was just going to say that's that is the one thing that I would I would I don't know what I would sell or what organ I would give up to have Westcott exist.

572
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I am so I see that picture with the golden sphere and it's that that is what dreams are made of.

573
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:24,000
That's all I really I heard a rumor and tell me if I'm wrong. Was there also talk of putting an adventurers club in downtown Disney out here.

574
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Got me on that one. I know I don't know anything about it. Interesting.

575
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I have another question where I'm hoping you can provoke some some jealousy in us. I am curious if you with with your status at this point in time with the with the Walt Disney Company.

576
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:56,000
If you went to Disneyland right now after this, what is the place that you would have access to that we would we would be the most jealous that you could walk in there.

577
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:06,000
The 33 Club. Yeah. You know what's good about it. You don't have to wait to eat now with a new lounge.

578
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:15,000
You can go in and sit down and have a nice meal. Not the full on one that's in the main dining room, but a hamburger and stuff like that.

579
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Just waiting for you in a nice air conditioned space. That's very, very cool.

580
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Geez, I'm jealous. Yep. Mission accomplished. Is is I have like some just like like logistical questions like you've worked for Disney so long.

581
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:37,000
If you want to go to say Disney Sea or obviously go back to Disneyland Paris. Is there a you don't have like an annual pass.

582
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Right. Are you kidding you. Disney Company. We're talking about you make like a call right. Make really good friends that invite me on their trips to go over to those places to be their tour guide.

583
00:58:48,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Oh, really. Really. Yeah, I did that to see all three. I'd been to Tokyo, but to get into Hong Kong and Shanghai, someone said, I can't imagine anyone better to be able to go around and talk philosophy and all that stuff.

584
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:10,000
So I said, I'm your man. You know, and so that was I really saw those two parks. It was great. Great opportunity.

585
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:21,000
So you kept your Rolodex but had to give back your badge and gun. No, hey, you never give back your badge. I think somewhere in the my my cards are in the car.

586
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:29,000
But no, I still can get in here. You know that doesn't go away. Sure. Sure. Sure.

587
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Real quick. Talk quick about Splash Mountain and our friend Scott here has a situation with Splash Mountain. I don't want to embarrass him, but he's talked about on the podcast. So it's like common knowledge.

588
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:55,000
He hasn't been on Splash Mountain in how many years. It's something like 1718 something like that. Look, I don't I don't love a steep drop.

589
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:01,000
So you wouldn't be friends with Brack then? No, I couldn't.

590
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Boy, would I have blown it if I had pitched to you.

591
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
You would have been responsible for Splash Mountain not existing if you were Michael Eisner's son, Scott.

592
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:18,000
What if it was just a gentle bayou trip where nothing went wrong?

593
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:28,000
But can you offer Scott some encouragement? He has to go back on Splash Mountain. It's a wonderful ride. Where that it is. I watch the videos.

594
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:34,000
That's I can't think of any ride more comfortable on a day like today than Splash Mountain.

595
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,000
And the whole idea is, yes, you're going to be apprehensive for a full 10 minutes.

596
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:51,000
But then after you drop, you've got three minutes of pure pleasure with a song zippity doo dah playing in your ears.

597
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Well, you got to go on it now. Come on. Yeah, I think so. That's that's enough encouragement.

598
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
It's a will. I immediately turn on it when we actually. Nope, not doing it.

599
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Are there Tony? Are there any rides or like types of rides that you won't go on ever?

600
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Uh huh. OK. Teacups. Oh, really? Really?

601
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I like to spin it to where I don't think you can anymore.

602
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
They kind of put brakes on them. But when I was a kid, you could spin it.

603
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:25,000
And the effect you got was it was tipping over. It was so fast it felt like instead of going like this, it was starting to go like that.

604
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
And the whole world was going by. I can't do that anymore.

605
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Even I went on in Credit Coast to the other night and the last time for me to for it.

606
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:40,000
It sort of settles into a ring thing at the end of the ride after you've done all the fun parts.

607
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I don't mind loops or anything, but it then goes into this.

608
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,000
And when I came into the end of that beads of sweat, you know, and I know, no, no, no, no.

609
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
But a giant sensations. You were freaked out by the the Skyway bucket.

610
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
You got sense memory even sitting in the Skyway.

611
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:03,000
When I was yes, we were sitting in the Skyway bucket downstairs and I remembered it's not the same when I was in when I was a child.

612
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
But that terrified me when I was five.

613
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Uh huh. So don't say I don't know person on the stage.

614
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:17,000
That's weird because, you know, for little kids, I mean, they're not even fully developed two and three year olds.

615
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:28,000
The fascination of changing their point of view from like close up to being above looking down was always like it was really fun to ride with them because they were just they didn't know how to comprehend it.

616
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
You know, right. So I was you were too old at five.

617
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I loved it. I loved it. I'm like a goat. I like to be on the highest possible elevation, which is funny because one of your you were sad to lose the goats at Disneyland, which is like, oh yeah, let's not even get into that.

618
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,000
That's true. Like when the goats went away because they got rid of Big Thunder Ranch, the Big Thunder.

619
01:02:51,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Okay, go Jason would always love because the goats would run toward the end of the end of the day and they would run them backstage. And that was the thing that Jason was most upset when they were talking about Star Wars land being built is that the goats were going away.

620
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And that is a true story. There's no joke to it.

621
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
You made a ride with a goat in it.

622
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:27,000
But you know what, the goat has been usurped from its prime prime place because everybody at that moment has two seconds exactly to study the new developments in Galaxy's Edge.

623
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,000
And you look the other way, which gives you an entirely different effect than looking in towards the goat.

624
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Wow. So in 10 years, people will be given the goat his due once again.

625
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I guess so.

626
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:50,000
No, so I mean I was I was curious about that. We saw an old video on YouTube where you're talking about how people think that Disneyland doesn't have is small and doesn't have a lot of room for expansion.

627
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:59,000
But in 1984, you're saying, well, there's that corner up there above frontier land and when you know that's a prime piece of real estate to do something.

628
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Something's happening there now. Pretty big project.

629
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
And you were one of the people primarily responsible for getting Star Wars into the parks.

630
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
How do you feel? However, are you excited about Galaxy's Edge?

631
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Yeah, I mean, who wouldn't be? And it's starting to look fantastic, except one of the views looks just like the Big Thunder Mountain in Florida.

632
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
So I hope they keep it gray. So it doesn't. Which one is Big Thunder?

633
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Anyway, yeah, I know it's amazing. I mean, because I told you my story about being up there and George drove up in a little BMW. Hi, guys.

634
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Eating potato salad and I'm sitting there. And if you'd ever thought that day, I mean, you know, we faced about a year of real public backlash about bringing, you know, somebody else's mythology.

635
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Disney's always been Disneyland, Disneyland, not Lucas Land or anything like that.

636
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:03,000
But, you know, unfortunately, all the people that make movies, whether they make them for Disney or for 20th Century Fox or whatever, are their own directors, their own producers.

637
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
And so that the day of Walt Disney being the creator is kind of over.

638
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:15,000
So you've got, you know, hopefully we can have them made under our banner. But at the time we weren't. So we had to go to the outside.

639
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:24,000
So if you had told me then that we were going to own the Lucas film as well as Marvel, as well as Pixar, no way would you believe that.

640
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:31,000
You know, it just couldn't go now. Fox, I guess. So Spider-Man, welcome, you know.

641
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Anyway, you know, it's all good. I think, you know, the question is, you know, I think the attractions are going to be great.

642
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:45,000
The area looks terrific already. You can kind of see. And but there is still a lot of room at Disneyland that people don't know about.

643
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I was in a presentation just yesterday looking at things that people would not really know we still have available.

644
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:00,000
So don't think it's all done. You know, wow, wow, that's a crazy tease. Yeah.

645
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Where would it go? Is it underground?

646
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Back to Big Thunder. Big Thunder, I realized a couple of years is like my low key favorite ride.

647
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I didn't realize it, but like I go on it every time. I love it.

648
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:20,000
And I was realizing like that there are no human audio animatronics on it. So there's animals and stuff.

649
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:28,000
And I feel like it's a different experience than going on Automanchon or Pirates because it's like you're not observing as much as you're experiencing.

650
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I was wondering like, was that by design or were there ever plans to like put a robot old prospector at the end of it?

651
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Well, you know, it's funny because Mark Davis, who is the genius behind like Pirates and Haunted Mansion figures,

652
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:48,000
and as well as some of the greatest films you've ever done, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, he tended towards that.

653
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:59,000
So when Walt died, you got Mark Davis attractions that were characterized by being nothing but figures like a country bear jamboree and America's sayings.

654
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:11,000
And Claude, who was my mentor, was a background painter. He did Pinocchio and Lady and the Tramp and many of the films that we love dearly for the environments as well as the characters.

655
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:18,000
And I think I grew up being a scenic background painter in Long Beach State. Anyone go to Long Beach State?

656
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Learn my trade there. And, you know, so I kind of gyrated more to the backgrounds like Claude.

657
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,000
And it was funny, Claude's rides after Walt passed were like Adventure Through Inner Space.

658
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:37,000
And if you had wings, the Delta, Dream Flight things and things like that, where it was more about the background.

659
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:47,000
So I guess I'd characterize myself as a background person. So Big Thunder, Indiana Jones, rides like that tend to feature more the environmental aspects of it.

660
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Because one of my feelings about Disneyland is it's more about you being the star going into the worlds created in these in these things.

661
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:03,000
The best one, the simplest one, Peter Pan. One line of dialogue that's important. And that is, come on, everybody. Here we go.

662
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:08,000
And Ray Bradbury. I love this thing. I tell it every time. So I'm going to have to do it now.

663
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Ray wrote Walt after getting off that ride a postcard and it said, Walt, I'll be eternally grateful.

664
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Today, I flew out of a child's bedroom window in a pirate galleon over London on my way to the stars.

665
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:29,000
And if you think about that room, it's probably not as big as the space we're in now. I can't see anything, but it's really tiny.

666
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:38,000
And yet the imagination that's still generated there right now at this moment, there's 45 minutes worth of people waiting to get on that ride.

667
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Okay. So it does something right, you know, really right. And that's because it puts you in the perspective of being the star.

668
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:58,000
The worst kind of rides, I think, are where we sit back benign and watch the characters from a film tell their story without inviting you into it.

669
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
You know.

670
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Right on.

671
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:14,000
You know, you mentioned intellectual property and bringing in Star Wars, getting backlash for bringing in outside intellectual property.

672
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:25,000
And now I feel like it's kind of shifted where pretty much every new ride has some sort of, if not the company's intellectual property, a licensed intellectual property.

673
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
What are your thoughts?

674
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I don't know the cost differential between building Big Thunder, Star Tours, and even Splash Mountain compared to Galaxy's Edge, Cars Land, and Pandora in Florida.

675
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:54,000
It's just astronomically more. And so what that means is a company, you know, again, is management oriented and the risk reduction to make those kind of, if Big Thunder had failed, it would have been, you know,

676
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:59,000
it would have built the pre-show area for Guardians of the Galaxy.

677
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:08,000
You know, so, you know, it gives management a comfort zone to know, hey, this movie made $500 million in the first week.

678
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:15,000
You know, everyone's going to go crazy to see it. So all of us love the challenge of building them both ways.

679
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I mean, if you look at Figment and Dreamfinder, we created IP. In Indiana Jones, I dearly loved getting to work with that IP. That was my favorite Lucas character ever.

680
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:34,000
And so like working in that was just as much fun as creating Figment. But I wish we could find the confidence level to invest like that.

681
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:45,000
That's why I say wouldn't it be great to do a Figment movie? And then if it was successful, that would certainly justify going back in and making that a great ride again, you know?

682
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Sure. Yeah, yeah.

683
01:10:51,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Well, that might bring us to our next point because we, you know, the whole point of this podcast, we're comedians or writers or something.

684
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Am I holding my own against your comedy genius?

685
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,000
There they go. Yeah. There's some proof right there.

686
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:23,000
But, you know, I mean, the whole thing is that we're trying to get out of the game and into your game, the Imagineering game.

687
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:33,000
And we, you know, we in an amateur sense do like to think about rides from time to time and just kind of backseat drive.

688
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,000
If we had the keys to the kingdom, what kind of ride could we come up with?

689
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:46,000
And we actually we do have an idea that might do some of what you're saying, which is bringing an old Disney property back to light in an interesting way.

690
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:55,000
And I don't know, would you mind if this is a nice high pressure situation where I think we could prove we have what it takes?

691
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:03,000
My gosh, is it would you let me present an idea for Knott's Berry Farm?

692
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Really? I'm not kidding. What do I do at night? I sit around with my friends and we conjure up ways to fix Knott's Berry Farm.

693
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Wow. Wow. That was. That's similar.

694
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I had a question I was thinking of, like when you're watching TV and you're watching, like, say Seinfeld, are you thinking like what would be a good Seinfeld ride?

695
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
No, because I mostly watch movies. Fair enough.

696
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:41,000
All right. So this might this might be up your alley and just pretend that we are in a boardroom at Imagineering and give us your give us your your honest thoughts.

697
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:47,000
If you think it's cool, if you think it's feasible. So look, it'd be the 12 year old creative kid or the 50 year old manager.

698
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Oh, the latter. All right. So this is an IP. I don't think it's I mean, I don't like to think of it as old.

699
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:03,000
You know, it's a franchise Disney owns. It's about a team of people that are pretty super and it starts with an A.

700
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I think everyone probably knows what I'm talking about after I tease that. Of course, I'm saying it's the Apple Dumpling Gang.

701
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:21,000
We all knew it. And look, we know someone in the audience that knows we're talking about this movie just three days ago.

702
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Whoa, really? That's crazy. Talking about it three days ago.

703
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:36,000
So we know the plot. We all know the plot. Bill Bixby, he's forced to adopt three children forcibly adopting children who discover gold.

704
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:48,000
We know it. We all know it. So we look we know from watching countless hours of Imagineering interviews that you want to make a great ride that like really lets you experience what happens in the movie.

705
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:57,000
So on this ride, you will be made to forcibly adopt three children and they'll be three child actors.

706
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:04,000
It'll be a lot like the great movie ride actors on board your ride vehicle. There hasn't been one of those in a while.

707
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:10,000
So like so like this is happening to you. The forced adoptions are happening to you. OK.

708
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Now, it's of course that I can't. It's interactive. That's a good thing. Yes.

709
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:23,000
You can talk to the actors. We'd have to hire some pretty good improv people, but I think this improv children.

710
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:31,000
So, you know, we want this thing that's going to only work for hours, you know, it's going to be a little expensive.

711
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:39,000
So it's going to be, you know, kind of a roller coaster type situation like, you know, we want it to sort of be like this.

712
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
And we want it to be as massive as the franchise. The Apple dumpling gang is.

713
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:50,000
So we're going to need a lot of space. Have you prorated the gross up to two thousand and eighteen dollars?

714
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:55,000
So we know what it's that would have been a good thing to do.

715
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,000
It's four point five billion dollars. That's what I thought.

716
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:04,000
So it really makes sense. So we want to make kind of maybe the biggest roller coaster ever.

717
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:10,000
So this roller coaster will start at Knott's Berry Farm.

718
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Gee, you know what that is?

719
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:20,000
That was going to be the monorail track when we had certain ideas for Knott's Berry Farm, actually.

720
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Oh, there could have been a monorail. You saw our drawings, didn't you?

721
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Well, good ideas never go away at a matter of hearing, we've been told.

722
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:36,000
So look, this is going to take you over the rough and rugged terrain of Blaine Park, Illinois, California.

723
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Why did I say Illinois? You hayseed. You can't get your home. That's where I'm from.

724
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I'm sorry. Where's the rabbit? Another part of Blaine Park, California, the rock and bruise.

725
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Where's Portello's Hot Dogs? Oh, oh, I love Portillo's. I grew up right by a Portillo's.

726
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:00,000
It's my favorite restaurant. Please don't get him started on Portillo's Hot Dogs.

727
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:06,000
But we have a note from Tony already. The car has to do a stop at Portillo's and you've got to get the kids some hot dogs.

728
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Tony, out of your pocket. Done, easy.

729
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:14,000
So this, of course, there's going to be four seats in the car, three for the children.

730
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,000
So the capacity is 20 people per hour.

731
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:26,000
That's almost equal to the void.

732
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:34,000
All of our friends at the void, please have us back for the Ghostbusters one.

733
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:44,000
So this mine cart will roll its way through the Blaine Park and then on to the five.

734
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,000
So is that caption having a ball at Disneyland?

735
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Yeah. So yeah, so it's going to careen. It'll join the carpool lane for a couple of minutes.

736
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
And then it shoots over into New Orleans Square.

737
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:05,000
And also quick thing, we're going to have to re-theme New Orleans Square and call it Apple Dumpling Square.

738
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:12,000
And we're also going to have to lose Haunted Mansion and Pirates.

739
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:22,000
But the new land is going to be great. There's going to be a lot of great food offerings like apples and dumplings.

740
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
And that's it. That's it.

741
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
And here's the thing. Here's the most exciting about all of it.

742
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:33,000
It's going to launch a new franchise for Disney coming in 2019.

743
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:44,000
ADG Ride or Die starring Dwayne The Rock Johnson and original cast member Tim Conway.

744
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I was just listening to Tim's junior on the radio. Maybe he would do it.

745
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
That'd be fantastic.

746
01:17:50,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Do you think he would he maybe want to commit to being on a ride vehicle every day for as long as he could do the horse races from the ride vehicle?

747
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
I think it'd be fine.

748
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
He can get a phone on there. He can be checking that.

749
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Yeah. And that's basically it. And if you don't like that IP, we can always use.

750
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Oh, yeah. I mean, we know stuff is, you know, there's lots of secret stuff at Imagineering that may already be allocated for another park.

751
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:25,000
So we have a backup. The ride is exactly the same except the theming is.

752
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I don't have a slide for this.

753
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:32,000
No mobile mobile if it if we can't use Apple, not like that.

754
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
So that's the pitch.

755
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Thoughts. Next steps.

756
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
You guys wanted me to be sort of serious, right.

757
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,000
And then you gave me. OK. So, yeah, yeah, yeah.

758
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:52,000
I'll talk about the good things. I mean, Apple dumplings. I mean, they go back to Snow White.

759
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:57,000
So that's pure Disney, right. Apple Dumplings. Dwarfs love them. Everybody loves them.

760
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Great. So that's a positive. All right.

761
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:05,000
The theming is consistent with both Knott's Berry Farm and Disneyland. Right.

762
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
So together, it actually improves both parks.

763
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,000
It elevates. They have a ghost town already. It leaves. That's right. That's right.

764
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:21,000
So, you know, it's got some positive things, you know, putting on my other hat, the capacity hat, the gross proof.

765
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I mean, maybe it's sold a lot of DVDs. It's been out there for a long time.

766
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Who owns the DVD? Does anyone help us? Everyone. Come on.

767
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:37,000
OK. You can buy movies on your phone now. So you can pull up iTunes on your phone and buy.

768
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Buy, buy, buy. And who knows? Apple Dublin gang.

769
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:46,000
And that's the answer. If you can get the thing up to like five hundred million dollars in a month,

770
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:52,000
the studio is going to say, my God, we've been sitting on a gold mine here. Right.

771
01:19:52,000 --> 01:20:00,000
And now you've got them in your pocket. All you need is somebody who can speak your pitch with a British accent and it'll be sold.

772
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Wow. The British accent is all it takes. That'll like dress it up that way.

773
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:10,000
If you don't know what's being pitched, at least it sounds intelligent. You know, you know,

774
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,000
we will start taking some dialect courses and I mean, Hugh Jackman.

775
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
It's not British, but it's Australian.

776
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Ewan McGregor, all of these people, why are they stars? You know, we have a fan and all listener in the audience from Australia.

777
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Maybe he would do it. We'll talk to you later when we think we're going to easily converted my GPS to speak Australian

778
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:40,000
because I like my God, my GPS speaker is so intelligent. You know, he knows where we're going.

779
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:50,000
You know, so you trust that guy. So it's I'm what I'm hearing is a maybe it's somewhere in the hinterlands.

780
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:58,000
The difficulty is always getting out of the meeting without ruining people's lives.

781
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:07,000
That brings up a question I had. I know all jobs get heated like how heated did it ever get it?

782
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Did anyone ever throw a chair at you? How do you know that?

783
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I think you've talked about it on another podcast. Oh, did I do that? Maybe you didn't name name.

784
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I don't know. Well, yeah, but you know, it was a short it was a short moment and then the person called me and apologized for it

785
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:35,000
and admitted I was right. I always like to know that I'm right. All right.

786
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:42,000
You're right about the Japan thing and you're right about that. It rules being right.

787
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Well, you know, we're getting towards the end of our time here and we thought it was 15 minutes. Yeah, yeah.

788
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Yeah, no kidding. Well, well, what we thought we would do since, you know, like there's so many questions that are that are very open ended.

789
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:02,000
We could talk about forever, but we thought we'd we'd do some do some quick hits in keeping with the Disneyland theme.

790
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
So we're going to call this the super speed tunnel.

791
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
We're going to pick up pick up the pace a little bit here.

792
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:15,000
So guys want to rev up the super speed tunnel. Oh, yeah. Yeah. OK. My forte.

793
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Oh, Phil. I love talking and talking and talking. We're going to go as long as you want.

794
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:28,000
The the the Van Eten galleries hired Pinkerton's will break our knees.

795
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:34,000
They won't come after you. OK, so we can call it the moderately pace tunnel.

796
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Yeah, that's less pressure. Yes. Yeah. All right. All right.

797
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Gentlemen, it was the slower pace tunnel. Yeah, yeah, you're right.

798
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Yeah, that's accurate. OK. What what gift of Mara would you choose?

799
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Earthly riches, you use you. OK, you got it.

800
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Do you like that Figman is in that little box on the Guardians ride if they would clear the glass up?

801
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Yes. You know, they're afraid that it'll derail the story if you can really see it.

802
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
But then why did they put it there? You know, mm hmm.

803
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Who has a more impressive collection, the crafts or or Tyvon?

804
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
The panelier to Vaughn is the name of the character.

805
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Guardians of the Galaxy crafts to Vaughn.

806
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,000
You heard it. These are easy, you know, so far. OK.

807
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:32,000
It was a very exciting day on theme park social media when you were spotted at Diagon Alley at Universal in Florida.

808
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Could you talk about the the differences you think between Disney and Universal and any Universal projects you like or admire?

809
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Of course. I can't do this in a one line. Yeah, we're breaking.

810
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I haven't. I'm not so crazy about the one here because the dynamics of the two parks and the Hogwarts Express,

811
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,000
it becomes an incredible double adventure. Yeah.

812
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,000
And the Diagon Alley is truly amazing.

813
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:06,000
And what is it? Gringotts escape from Gringotts is probably one of the greatest rides ever.

814
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I think the thing that's positive about it is it's brought the level of competition up to a class that equals Disney.

815
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I would also add Efteling if any of you have ever been to Holland. Yeah.

816
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:31,000
And they got our T.E.A. I'm on the T.E.A. board. So I vote for awards and T.E.A. gave award to Efteling for their new dark ride over there, which is interactive and incredible.

817
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:40,000
But yeah, I mean, escape from Gringotts and the whole, you know, looking at that London approach across the lake, it's pretty damn impressive.

818
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
And it's really amped up the competition between Disney and Universal.

819
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:50,000
And that's very healthy for all the Imagineers and all the people at Universal, too, because we're working harder.

820
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:56,000
We're inventing new things. That's what happens when you got somebody barking at your door.

821
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:01,000
If you're the only game in town, you get lazy. You know, so I like this.

822
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:07,000
It does feel to me like we got to we were lucky enough to grow up in that era where there was kind of the first big arms race.

823
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Yeah, right. Universal. And it was great. Yeah.

824
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,000
We were the winners either way. Yeah. Yeah. See, it's good for the guests.

825
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:20,000
It's good for the the the Imagineering and all the design companies that benefit from it.

826
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Your favorite Disney hotel.

827
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Probably two things. The Wilderness Lodge because of its theming, but the campground log cabins because it is so convenient.

828
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:44,000
If you don't know this, you park your car right at your door so you don't have to schlep through the parking lots to get in and out of the lobby and then down a long aisle or anything.

829
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:50,000
You come home from having a fun day, park your car and three steps away is the door to your cabin.

830
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
You know, it's awesome. You don't have to have a you don't have to have a tent or a trailer or anything.

831
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
You can just book one of their cabins and they're really great.

832
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Bedroom, another bed that comes out in the living room, a kitchen. It's the way to go at Disney World. Sure.

833
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I get 10 percent of all the people that say.

834
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Oh, it's great having a little commission. You snuck a second sponsor into this episode.

835
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
This is this is actually a little open ended. This was a little tip from the crafts.

836
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:30,000
They said just mention two words to you and see what you say. And the two words are rocket rods, rocket rods.

837
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Actually, you know, nobody knows the whole story on that. Well, maybe some of you do.

838
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,000
But it was a big ride. It was going to be the Indiana Jones level attraction in there.

839
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:50,000
We had they were they are designed and you can kind of see if you look at that stripped down version that we had to build for one quarter of the money that was originally allocated for it.

840
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:57,000
It was going to be a wire frame like a computer design that was rough and hadn't been filled out yet.

841
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:02,000
And the idea was after experiencing the ride and of course, we would photo capture you.

842
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:08,000
You would go to the design center and then you would build body types for it and colors.

843
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:14,000
And at the end, you'd get a printout of the car you designed with the colors you selected.

844
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:23,000
And the goal was that would all be beta test information for our company that was involved in building cars that was going to going to sponsor it.

845
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:37,000
And and that would give them the color preferences and the shapes, whether it was round shapes or square shapes or angular shapes, whatever that came out of the choices that people tended to pick, which I thought was a genius thing.

846
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:48,000
And it was four times the amount because we were going to profile the track. It's the same right system that's used on test track and also journey the center of the earth.

847
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
And there's one more, I think that we have maybe not. Oh, yeah.

848
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Car. Yeah. How could I forget that? So it wasn't a question of it not working.

849
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:04,000
It's just that by the time you backed out the track, reprofiling and the big event of the fact you were riding in an undesigned car, they looked.

850
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:15,000
We did one car. Maybe some of you saw it that had the night striping on it. So it glowed and it looked just like a wireframe computer as it zoomed through the night sky there.

851
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:24,000
So it would have been a really cool thing. But unfortunately, we are money. That's the one time I were a company is just completely backed out.

852
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:32,000
So it went down from, you know, what a normal ticket would cost to about what you could build a teacup ride for.

853
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:42,000
So then, of course, you can't put that sign out in front, say, please excuse the fact that this is not a fully fleshed out, you know, and we hope you enjoy your three hour wait to go on it.

854
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:48,000
You know, so at a panel in 20 years, you will understand why you will learn the story.

855
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:54,000
But the name Rocker Rod's, that is very cool. I mean, it says what it intended to do.

856
01:28:54,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I always think, you know, Disney, when they create their own IP, when you think of words like Space Mountain, two words that exist, but you put them together.

857
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:08,000
And when you say them, Space Mountain, it's only one thing you see. And it's a Disney branded thing.

858
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:15,000
And I think Rocker Rod's could have been just as cool if we had been able to do what we wanted to do with it.

859
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Is that a more frequent scenario than we realized that like something the dream was this budget and then it got it got reduced more than you would have liked?

860
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Well, everything else kind of worked within. OK, we always like Indiana Jones. You may have seen the renderings that showed the mine car ride we put in Paris and the jungle cruise and a very diabolical third attraction.

861
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,000
You wouldn't want to know what it was, though.

862
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Yeah, it was a maze. And see, Andy, the main ride that you have now is over 2000, a little over 2000 an hour.

863
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:53,000
The little mine car ride that we have in Paris is about nine hundred an hour.

864
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:02,000
So how are you going to mitigate the expectations of all the guests coming off of the big Jeep ride and not able to go on the roller coaster?

865
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:11,000
So we had this maze and all the pivot points in it were interactive and movable by somebody watching from a grid above looking down.

866
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:18,000
And so if more than nine hundred people an hour got through the maze, they were vented back to the exit.

867
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:30,000
So it was great because we all we were never starving the little mine car ride, but we were never creating an impossible situation where, you know, people couldn't ride it.

868
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:39,000
But can you imagine the thrill of going through that maze twice in a day after waiting for the main ride and never getting to the point where you get to go?

869
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:44,000
I think it would have been insidiously delicious.

870
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Oh, man, the tantrums you would have caused.

871
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I have been there five days. I've never gotten through the maze.

872
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Oh, man. Every question we listed, we now want a ton of answer. We love this is all great.

873
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I'm wondering, like, are there any attractions you're fond of that you maybe oversaw a little but didn't do like a ton of like I'm not sure how much you did.

874
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,000
One of my favorite rides of all time is Alien and Calender.

875
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Yeah. And I'm wondering, like, what are your thoughts on that, for example?

876
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Well, first, let's say soaring because that was a group of us in Aspen and they now decided on the incredible theme of California adventure as the main park theme.

877
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:39,000
And they broke us down into three quarter groups and said, Lansy and Air.

878
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:48,000
And I was on the air team. And so we started thinking we should really deal with extreme sports, things that Disney could let you do that you wouldn't do in real life.

879
01:31:48,000 --> 01:32:04,000
And so the logical one for the air was hang gliding. So I remember going to the Rubin H Fleet Science Center down in San Diego and they had an Omnimax, which is a curved dome IMAX film.

880
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:15,000
And I thought, what if you hung out over that thing and got the hang gliders to go outside, did some sketches and everyone said, wow, that could be really good.

881
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:23,000
So they brought in a fellow by the name of Mark Sumner who called his mom and she said the erector set was still in the garage.

882
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:32,000
So he said, well, get it out. I'm coming over tonight. And he figured out a way with a little crank and everything to pull three rows of hang gliders up into the air.

883
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:41,000
And they brought in cinematographers and everything. So my involvement was, wouldn't it be cool to be in a hang glider and be safe?

884
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I think you should take more credit for that. That sounds like a lot.

885
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Well, you know, it was just an hour in a brainstorming session. And that's how these things happen. And then it took hundreds and hundreds of people to make that thing a real thing.

886
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Now, Alien. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that was pretty cool. It was going to be truly the most frightening ride ever.

887
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:21,000
You know, and we had this kind of white elephant in that the Mars, previously the moon ride buildings have been grossly passed over by time and the reality of knowing that there's, you know, it was one thing when you thought the moon was going to be inhabited by little green men.

888
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:27,000
And the first Ward Kimball film that was in there showed you the backside of the moon with a lost civilization.

889
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:38,000
It was worth going on the whole ride to see that flare go down and light up this this thing, the city that was all destroyed and you go and it goes, who knows what life forms lived in that city.

890
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:43,000
And then they go, Captain Sir, we're coming from around the dark side of the moon. You're going, wow.

891
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:54,000
And when they got knowledge of the moon and they knew it's dry and dead and boring, then why are we spending all this time at Disneyland going to this dry, dead, boring place, you know?

892
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:59,000
So we had this asset that was kind of becoming a liability.

893
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:13,000
And so the idea of trapping you in the seats and dribbling what might be fluids from a beast down your back seemed like it would be horrific, you know, and it actually worked too well.

894
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:21,000
You know, we weren't able to put a sign out there that said if you're under the age of 20, we would advise you not riding this ride, you know.

895
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:27,000
So then it went the other way. You talk about the pendulum swing and they put in Stitch.

896
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:40,000
And the thing that happened is while we were doing Stitch, you know, the television division was making Stitch a lovable, sweet character.

897
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:47,000
So subsequent kids growing up didn't see Stitch as kind of the mean and bratty Stitch that he is in the movie.

898
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:55,000
They saw lovable, sweet Stitch. So they're waiting in the line all happy that they're going to see their cartoon favorite.

899
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:04,000
And guess what? You know? So it was kind of I think if I was picking, I'd go back to the original Alien Encounter.

900
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:20,000
If we could take it to your attractions and rides associated with you and animatronics associated with you, there's a segment we've been too lazy to do in a while called Animatronic of the Month.

901
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:30,000
And we were hoping really quickly you could pick from a, we have a choice of three hardworking animatronics associated with your attractions.

902
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,000
We have specifically Space Figment, number one, as opposed to the other figments.

903
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:47,000
We have Roxanne, who is Rex's girlfriend who's only in Star Tours in Disneyland Paris.

904
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
You've all been there, right?

905
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:53,000
When I found out there was a girlfriend who was only in France.

906
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Scott's favorite character in fiction is Rex.

907
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,000
I thought it'd be stacking the deck for me to put Rex in here, so I chose Roxanne.

908
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:05,000
And thirdly, the classic, the dynamite shoe and gown.

909
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
All right. If you had to pick.

910
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
I have to say, first of all, I love figment.

911
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,000
But the Space Figment, not my favorite.

912
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:26,000
So I would have to go with the goat because he's overcome such a lowly lot in life to be such a talked about.

913
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
You know, audio-mitronic character.

914
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,000
He never was created to achieve such notoriety.

915
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
So I like that.

916
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Why do you think his story ends? Does he eventually?

917
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Have you ever seen Goat Splatter?

918
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,000
I have not had the pleasure. That's it.

919
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Well, I mean, I think we're heading towards the end here.

920
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
If there's one final thing we could ask you.

921
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:04,000
You know, I'm sure you've spoken to a number of rooms of people who are maybe aspiring imagineers like ourselves.

922
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:09,000
But also, there's a ton of people here who are in all parts of the creative arts,

923
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,000
there's writers and actors and artists and all kinds of people.

924
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Is there some advice that you could give from your career that you think could apply to all artists?

925
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Just in terms of creating indelible works that stand the test of time.

926
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Yeah, I think if you're just starting out and the doors all seem impenetrable and the walls all seem like they're made out of brick and all that, which we all face,

927
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:40,000
do a little research on wherever you're approaching, whichever company it is.

928
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,000
And of course, you've got your portfolio of your work or whatever it is.

929
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
And this goes for engineers, architects, artists, writers.

930
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,000
You know, that's what they're going to hire you to do.

931
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,000
But you're competing with 50, 100 other applicants doing the same thing.

932
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:01,000
So you say to yourself, and it used to be really easy for me when we were doing the Shanghai project,

933
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:09,000
you go in there, you have a respectable portfolio of your work, and then you say, oh, by the way, I'm fluent in Mandarin Chinese.

934
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
You've got the job, see?

935
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
And timing is another thing.

936
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I had a friend that was first year architect at school, came to me and said, should I finish three more years or apply right now?

937
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,000
And I said, we're four years from opening Epcot.

938
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:33,000
If you come in now, we can't, we are hiring everybody that walks in the door that has any talent at all.

939
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,000
In four years, when we finish Epcot, we'll be laying everyone off.

940
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:40,000
And that's when you'll be coming in with your fabulous degree.

941
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,000
You know, so timing is another really critical thing.

942
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:50,000
You know, there's a moment where all projects, films, everything, are really open to the need right at that moment.

943
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:58,000
And finding those windows and then finding a way to make yourself more than your key asset value-wise.

944
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,000
And for me, it was engineering.

945
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
I had my portfolio.

946
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
I could see the look of, yeah, okay, that's good.

947
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Yeah, okay, okay.

948
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
So do you have anything else?

949
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,000
And then I took them out to the parking lot in front of Imagineering.

950
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I had rented a van and I had this kinetic sculpture out there.

951
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,000
And we opened the back end of the van and the interviewer looked at it and said,

952
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:27,000
do you think you'd mind bringing this around into the company in the back end and letting some people look at it?

953
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I said, well, let me think about that.

954
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Yeah, I'd be okay with that.

955
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
So we're carting it in.

956
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I'm looking at all these audio electronics being tested and ride tracks with vehicles going around and all that and carrying my piece in.

957
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:47,000
And for four hours, people came from every department to come down and go, can you run it one more time?

958
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:51,000
And then I got the job about three weeks later.

959
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:58,000
And when I started, for the next six months, people would say, are you the guy that brought in that machine, that crazy machine?

960
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
So who would have known?

961
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,000
I wasn't even going to show that unless I got a sense that the interview was going bad.

962
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
So I think that was the turning point.

963
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:19,000
For people that have been in a company or in a company, it's kind of easy to cite out all the goals and areas that you might rather be in than where you are.

964
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I mean, I was scooping ice cream and you don't say, oh, tomorrow I want to be an Imagineer.

965
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:32,000
But you go, if I was working on a ride, at least I'd be dealing with the products that I want to be involved in from a creative standpoint.

966
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,000
So that goal was fairly easy to get to.

967
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:43,000
And then being a ride operator, you're around people all the time that have more influence at WDI.

968
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:49,000
And so that turned out to be one of the leaders at Disneyland who said, well, I'll take your stuff up there.

969
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:53,000
This was before you could put it on a flash drive or anything.

970
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,000
And it was my one and only portfolio of work.

971
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
So saying goodbye to it was kind of scary.

972
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
But it landed me an interview.

973
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
And I didn't know anybody.

974
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
So it really is still doable.

975
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:13,000
And I think the exciting thing about the era we're in now is, you know, if something goes viral online, you're suddenly a superstar.

976
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
And, you know, that wasn't possible.

977
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
That was not doable.

978
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
And it's something that's a fact of life now.

979
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
So there are many more avenues.

980
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
It's a cluttered field, more so than when I was here.

981
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
But then you've got more avenues to break through.

982
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
So good luck.

983
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Beautiful.

984
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
All right.

985
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
That's incredible.

986
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I guess that being said, I can't believe I get to say this.

987
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Tony Baxter, you survived podcast the ride.

988
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
All right.

989
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Thank you so much, sir.

990
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,000
We had we had a dream guest when we started doing this last year.

991
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:59,000
And you your your name was that dream guest.

992
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,000
And it happened to people in an abandoned sports.

993
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Well, I have to thank Mike and Richard, who are two of my good friends, for organizing this amazing event.

994
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
I've already been here once to look at it.

995
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
And it's like a walk down memory lane and then some.

996
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
And so it's really great that something like this happened.

997
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Really?

998
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Yeah. Yeah.

999
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:33,000
And I think I speak for for everybody here, all three of us, when I say the stuff that you did and the the rides that you put so much effort into made our our childhoods better and cooler.

1000
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:38,000
And you being here tonight helped make our adulthoods better and called.

1001
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Where's that 12 year old?

1002
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
It's got to be there.

1003
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
So it's true.

1004
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Yeah, it's there.

1005
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Well, ladies and gentlemen, that is our show.

1006
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Thank you.

1007
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:57,000
One more hand for Tony Baxter for Tony Baxter.

1008
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Thanks to the Van Eten Gallery, the galleries.

1009
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Thanks to Richard and Nicholas Kraft for putting this thing on and put it definitely.

1010
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
You too.

1011
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Thank you to Paul Shearer for hooking this up for us and connecting the dots.

1013
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,000
You made a dream come true.
