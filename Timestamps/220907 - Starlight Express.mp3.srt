1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You know, there's been a lot of talk on this show lately about transforming trucks,

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but very little about roller skating human trains.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Today we're going to fix that here on Podcast the Ride, the second gate.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I am Scott Gairdner joined by Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Choo-choo everyone. Yes, I'm here and I'm ready.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm ready to talk some, I'm trying to think of the best way to say like,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Synthy choo-choos or futuristic choo-choos.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Sometimes.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Sometimes they are.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Alright, sometimes.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah, that's a confusing aspect.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's a whole, we'll get right into it after Jason Sheridan is introduced.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I would say a zoobily choo-choos.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, that's a perfect way, a perfect description.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That's all I could think about.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes, it is a, it is like, if you've ever seen the show Zoobily Zoo,

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
there is an 80s, early 90s dressing up like animals, like there's a vibe to things.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And this is a perfect zoobily zoo.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Like streaky eye makeup and jazz hands.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Completing, yes, my thought here.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's Captain EO is kind of the vibe of it.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
There's so many things in this zone in this time period that feel like this.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And it's, yeah, thus it's always been kind of dancing on our breath.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I feel like it's like, we've discovered it mid-episode a couple of times.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
For some reason, something about Starlight Express comes up.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And we realize we don't know enough about it.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Anything.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
In a way.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And now we're here and we're doing an episode about it.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And I will tell you right at the top, we still don't know enough about it.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I feel like we have to make a little amends at the beginning here,

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
because here's what I figured out.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There are some people on our Facebook group who love this thing.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And I am worried about disappointing these people.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And I say this not because we didn't, we, I think everybody's absorbed a lot of Starlight Express material,

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
but there's a thousand versions and the most complicated wiki I've ever seen.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And now remember that in the 90s Vegas one takes on a Christmas theme.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And then the rap is out by that point.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And I'm like, I can't.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And then the rap went back in or no, it's the opposite maybe.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No, I could not begin to tell you.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It is so complicated.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There's a couple of things I know about it, but yes, I also felt the same way where I was going through and I go,

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
oh my God, this is so much to know more than almost anything we go in cold on as far as research.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I feel like I feel the same way.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why do I feel more overwhelmed by this than things where there where there should be a wealth of knowledge to have to learn about it?

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's a good question.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I think what it is is that's really tripping me up is I approach.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let me use an analogy to some music that I like.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Will go as a band.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They have an album called Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I still can't tell you all of the different like engineer demos that I have.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I can't like like some of sometimes when there's alternate versions of music, I get confused.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And I think that's a big part of it.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
There are multiple versions of this, multiple versions on Apple Music, and I would have to really sit and draw like a diagram.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I know a little bit about what it is, but it feels like I needed a couple weeks with all the albums to listen over and over again to fully know what was going on.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
In addition to what you're saying, the history of this also is incredibly confusing and how it was put together.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And it feels very convoluted in the story itself.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So every part of it feels convoluted to me in addition to like it being one of the most strange premises.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Every piece of it is confusing.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Musically, it's confusing.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Musically, it's confusing.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It does have a lot of musical theater things in it, musical theater elements.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But usually when a show is updated or opens elsewhere or has a different it's 10 years later, there's little tweaks.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
OK, there's not new characters.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There's not whole songs plucked out or put in.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah, with the exception of like a Spider-Man turn off the dark where like they plucked characters out and they were a disaster.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And they had to.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yeah, that was like scrapped from the ground up.

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That wasn't like an optional.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Why don't we mix it up?

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's like we are.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Everyone people are getting hurt.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We are all everyone is moaning each day that we have to trudge on with this.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, which I feel like a bit of a fool now because this probably a more dangerous show than Spider-Man turn off the dark.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, yes.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But I don't think there's as notorious.

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah, there's not injuries.

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But yes, day to day, I would say for whereas Spider-Man turn off the dark was dangerous for some performers who paid the price.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah, paid the price.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That makes it so it's their fault.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
They paid a price, paid a price for someone.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I would somebody else made them do this feels like it was dangerous a little less.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But to everyone involved, everyone on the stage, there's a high possibility of danger.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Because this is a this is an all roller skating musical.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I think those exist here and there.

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
There's got to be musicals with a little bit of a component of that.

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But this is just nonstop.

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The entire runtime singing and not just not just a little bit of roller skating, multi level like going past bridges and onto different levels.

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And it's like the most not just a little bit of rosy, it's the most complicated roller skating ever put in front of people at speeds of 40 miles an hour.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That seems high.

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Really high 40 miles.

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I think that's top level that I feel that feels like when they announce like wrestlers heights and they had like three inches.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I feel like it's like 20 miles an hour at the most.

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Maybe in like I'm just saying that's the high.

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, like in a race like in one of the like that's as crazy as it gets.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It is from what I could tell people are not going a standard average speed of 40 miles an hour for the entire 40 miles an hour.

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You would go across the flash.

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I think that's top speed and you start decelerating.

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Sure.

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Well, I think because this you look there's you introduce characters, but then there seem to be races.

106
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
There should be a lot of races.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There's a lot of races.

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I think we need to focus on being overwhelmed.

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We're never really as overwhelmed as anyone who had any tiny part in any production of Starlight Express.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's focus on the basics and what we know that we figured out because let me say this.

111
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I remember the first time that Starlight Express ever came up on the show.

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't remember why years ago.

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Your apartment.

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I just remember thinking like what if you just grilled me, what do you know about Starlight Express?

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm like, uh, razzle dazzle, makeup, skating.

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Know that I know that much and people wear like a lot of white and silver.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I think that I could not have produced the fact that this is about trains.

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I didn't know that inherently from like the vague flash of an image that I've ever seen of Starlight Express.

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I've certainly picked that up, but like wherever this was lodged in my head up until 2018 or so,

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I did not know this was a roller skating human train musical.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah, I think I have two things I knew about Starlight Express.

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:17,000
One, Jane reminded me of and that's the family guy gag where Peter's just skating on stage is going Starlight Express, Starlight Express.

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And the joke is kind of like no one knows what Starlight Express is besides their weird costumes and roller skating.

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The other thing I knew in high school, an English teacher was trying to see if there was interest for like a spring break trip to England, like an all inclusive package trip.

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We got a five timer on our hands.

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I think we do.

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I think we do.

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But go ahead, dude.

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm just, you know, you're just waving the flag.

130
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You are trying to make fetch happen with that five timer thing.

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Fetch.

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Mean girls.

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I know.

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, yeah.

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Mean girls.

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's a handy way to say it's a story that's been told before, but go ahead.

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I don't know.

138
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So it was this trip to England.

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Not enough people were ever were interested and it never happened.

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But like the package, not like fetch, it just like never happened.

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The page of events included one of the nights, like, you know, tours, you stay here, you stay in this seat.

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
One of the nights included a showing of Starlight Express in the West End.

143
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yes.

144
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You said, though, you ended up because I think this came up a couple of months ago.

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I think you said you ended up at like a battle, like a reenactment or something instead.

146
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I ended up doing like the DC trip that everyone to.

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Right. You took a boring trip instead.

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Boring trip.

149
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Because I was saying, how could you, Jason Sheridan, certainly the kid who was most of the three of us into musicals, I think when we were little, how did you never see one about trains, which was one of your favorite modes of transportation?

150
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I know.

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But I do think now that I've heard a lot of this, I think you would have felt like this was a blasphemous play because it's like there's since and stuff and you there's no there's not a lot of like ragtime piano.

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
No, but there's a lot of characters introducing themselves via which is a very musical thing.

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And there are musically Weber moments.

154
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But I think, yeah, that's having dived in a little bit.

155
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's my biggest disappointment maybe is that you hear a little bit.

156
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're like, oh, this is kind of a synthy thing.

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
All right. I see.

158
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And then it is.

159
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But it's also got a lot of like shout out.

160
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Like how quickly it turned to that.

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I was very disappointed.

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I found the opposite in a lot of the songs, though.

164
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I would start listening and I go, this is the worst thing I've ever heard in my life.

165
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And I like like 2000s or Everclear albums.

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But I go, I go, oh, this is awful.

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And then all of a sudden there'll be a switch flipped and I go, wait a minute.

168
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This is good.

169
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I really like this.

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm curious where we will all if we all start if we're name checking what these songs are, what are tastes line up?

171
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I would be shocked if you and I don't have the same favorite songs.

172
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I think so.

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Probably the best song by a country mile thing.

174
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Is it too early to say?

175
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Do we have more introductory?

176
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Let's let's I feel like we got we can we need to ease into the web.

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But let's let's say the name at the same time.

178
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah, we will.

179
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What what what's broader stuff that needs to be said?

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
OK, so it's about Andrew Lloyd Webber is the king of musicals.

181
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He's had many hits.

182
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Phantom of the Opera.

183
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
This is a cat.

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The cats.

185
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yes, cat contemporaneous with him working on Phantom.

186
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
OK, lame is I think is or no cats is already hit.

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Not lame is lame is is about to hit.

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
He didn't do lame is.

189
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes, he did.

190
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Andrew Lloyd Webber.

191
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah, right.

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Did like no, he did not.

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
There are two guys, two French guys, I think.

194
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Maybe not French, but there's two guys that are not Andrew Lloyd Webber.

195
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Webber lame is let's find out.

196
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
No, the answer is no.

197
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah, no, no.

198
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I think you're thinking of a different one.

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I think I'm just combining the big musicals at the time.

200
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah, there was there too.

201
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I think French guys, but there were two guys and I don't know their names.

202
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
OK, so cats is out.

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
He's working on Phantom.

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yes, he's red hot.

205
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes, he's red hot.

206
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh, that's what it was.

207
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Lame is fucking rinses this show at the Tony's.

208
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yes, and it was some of it's that video that we were alerted to said pointed out a lot of the same people.

209
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
People. Yeah, not him, but a lot of like stage and lame is is like much better than most of the

210
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
things and you're like, from what I know, and I'm not an expert, but well, let's look.

211
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm no. Yeah, I'm also no Andrew Lloyd Webber expert, but I have the question at this point.

212
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah, is he insane?

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I hope he is.

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I know. I don't know.

215
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm vaguely aware of these shows.

216
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I mean, I kind of I was not particularly drawn in by the cats movie debacle of whenever that was, but it certainly seemed I mean,

217
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:01,000
there is its own insanity applied by not Andrew Lloyd Webber, yet still it reminded me of how strange it is that it is it is cats at all.

218
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And then as you're saying, Jason, it's a lot of introductions.

219
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's nothing but interesting.

220
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You get into this show and it is a lot of introductions as well.

221
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yes, he really likes characters.

222
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The better thing you're taught in improv.

223
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Have everyone be introducing themselves to each other all the time.

224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I hate to make big proclamations about something I'm nowhere near being an expert about, but he seems kind of like a crazy performance artist in a weird way or not.

225
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
He doesn't perform, I guess.

226
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I mean, he plays piano, but he feels like he's more interested in like putting up at weird abstractions or weird perversions of the world.

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Even more so than like just having the tunes be good.

228
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Like as I've said, did I say recently or is that episode not come out where Seth McFarlane recently I read an interview with him or he's saying that he feels musicals haven't been as good as like the Rogers and Hammerstein era.

229
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's a two timers, depending on when I said it.

230
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It will be a future.

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yeah, two timer.

232
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Hold on to that one.

233
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah, yeah.

234
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
We're making it happen.

235
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We're making it happen.

236
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It doesn't feel like the songs are quite as important as everything else.

237
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And somebody's going to yell at me and say like Joseph and tech made like maybe those songs are better.

238
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I've heard a good amount of them.

239
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Like they're OK, I think.

240
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
We're in boy.

241
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I think we're in trouble.

242
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
We might be walking right into this.

243
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah.

244
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Like, wait a minute.

245
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I will point out this Andrew Lloyd Webber.

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's good.

247
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And this and that.

248
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But I will say Les Mis is like good, really good.

249
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I think I really I like it.

250
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I've seen it.

251
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I like the movie.

252
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I don't really know Phantom that well.

253
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I saw cats.

254
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I love the camp.

255
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Don't get me wrong.

256
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I love all this nonsense in camp.

257
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's just when sometimes your question was, is he insane?

258
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm trying to answer that.

259
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm trying to answer that.

260
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I think a lot of people might say, yes, he's insane.

261
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And that's why I like it.

262
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah, I just feel like without the nonsense, maybe there's less there.

263
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But somebody's going to yell at me and the Phantom and cats and memory.

264
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
They love that.

265
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
We're all so on edge.

266
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We're going to be.

267
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't want to get yelled at.

268
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Well, yeah, and there's look, there's passion about this show.

269
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And I don't I don't think the intent is to is to shit on the show.

270
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I like some of this.

271
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I like some of this.

272
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
As with all things that we talk about, it's a it's a funny blend.

273
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It is.

274
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Let me let me bring up partly why I'm bringing up the insanity.

275
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But we probably all saw some version of the the Holy Trinity, the three

276
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
projects that predated course Starlight Express.

277
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This this was before Starlight Express.

278
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This this was born out of over a decade of trying to get train related

279
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
media off the ground.

280
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Let's step through these early 70s.

281
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He attempts to make or be part of an animated series based on at the

282
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
popular in England, but not internationally popular book series.

283
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Thomas the Tank Engine.

284
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
This now friggin mind.

285
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I thought this was so great.

286
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's where this began.

287
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The now unavoidable.

288
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yes, it's the only thing in my house these days.

289
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Two year old.

290
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's it's so ubiquitous.

291
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But at the time it was a British project and it fell apart, I think, due to

292
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
it.

293
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Maybe a question about mass appeal of Thomas the Tank Engine, which was

294
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
proven the most wrong.

295
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It is the most mass appeal thing with certain age group that's ever been.

296
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And around the same time, the time that I was in the show, I was in the

297
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Thomas show.

298
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What was before?

299
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Like like when when the Thomas show did come out was right around the same

300
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
time.

301
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You're there right before right after Starlight.

302
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh, that's Starlight Express eventually.

303
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, like early to mid 80s.

304
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah, he went to them and then they said like, no.

305
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And then, yeah, very soon after, I believe, is the show came out proving

306
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
was proving him right.

307
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I guess.

308
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

309
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Now there's not a lot of information about that.

310
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
There's one picture where you can see on his desk a picture that he's looking

311
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
over of what designs might look like.

312
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And they are horrifying.

313
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's like weird, edge faced, like, I don't know.

314
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's like kind of like Monty Python.

315
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's a little bit like a scary like an Alice in Wonderland hallucination.

316
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
They are not the friendly, cute Thomas's that we know today.

317
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yeah, but the show, the original show is creepy, too.

318
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes, the Ringo and Carlin version, Ringo and George Carlin both played Mr.

319
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Conductor on Shining Time Station, which was the Thomas show.

320
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And the faces are creepy on those shows.

321
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yes, there's moments from it that are chilling.

322
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I've been thinking about like, what is the right music to set some of it to?

323
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And I'm entertained as a parent pulling up Thomas videos all the time by how they,

324
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
you know, the classic video, how do we get hits maneuver is like maybe put a sexy

325
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
lady in there, like tantalize of what's to come in that thumbnail.

326
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But with Thomas, they do that by making the thumbnail the craziest moment of crash

327
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
that occurs.

328
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So it'll be like, this is like horrifying.

329
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You know, or here's Thomas with a bunch.

330
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
He ran into a crate full of whipped cream or or like a crocodile is about to swallow him.

331
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I really like that they're doing like toy train crash porn with their thumbnails.

332
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Is that the old show or is there's a new Thomas that your child is watching?

333
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's a turtles. It never ends.

334
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Sometimes he's in the mood for old model ones.

335
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Sometimes he's in the mood for we, I had none of us, no one in the Gertner household is in the mood for when they just

336
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
abandon them having to be on tracks and they fly around and stuff.

337
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What?

338
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
No, no, no. We want a practical train.

339
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
He's watching it in sort of a scientific. I see.

340
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This is how trains work.

341
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
He does not want to see them fly.

342
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Has to keep them on the tracks, guys.

343
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Has he watched the Baldwin is Mr.

344
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Conductor season?

345
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I was not to say it's a movie.

346
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh, OK.

347
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And I looked it up and it was in its deep in the streaming hinterlands.

348
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I would have happily put it on.

349
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm definitely curious to see his take on Mr.

350
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Conductor. How many can Mr.

351
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Conductors are there?

352
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Do I hate to get on a whole Thomas thing?

353
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Well, I'm not sure because we don't know the entire I don't know what the British wraparound.

354
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yeah, yeah.

355
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I can't name any besides Ringo, Carl and Baldwin, three of the great artists of our

356
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
sure of the job or the last century.

357
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
But there's not one more like Jared Leto was Mr.

358
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Conductor and we don't know.

359
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
He'll get there. He'll run out of things to.

360
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Yeah.

361
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
For to perversify whatever it is he's doing.

362
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So that doesn't work out.

363
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The next thing is they discover a singer who can sing three notes at once like a train

364
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
whistle.

365
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I have a question about this.

366
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Go ahead.

367
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I saw the clip of this single.

368
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I couldn't really tell.

369
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
No, what I just described is not nearly that sounds so much more exciting than what they

370
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
recorded.

371
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah, it sounds like they have like some sort of Michael Winslow ability to mimic a train.

372
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah.

373
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yeah. And it's not bad.

374
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's interesting.

375
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Look, in my mind, I don't have a clip queued up, but in my head it's like, like, because

376
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm in love with you.

377
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
How I would do it.

378
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Yeah.

379
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Like there's like a desperation to it.

380
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yeah.

381
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It sounds like you just like ran around, ran into an alley to avoid burglars, but then they

382
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
found you anyway and they pressed you up against the wall.

383
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And that's the sound you make lightheaded to do it.

384
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah.

385
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't like doing it.

386
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Oh, yeah.

387
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm not going to do it for a second.

388
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Anyway, that song is called Engine of Love.

389
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It is credited to the artist Earl and the Steam Team.

390
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I mean, yeah.

391
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Steam Team.

392
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So good.

393
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
OK, so I'm going to jump ahead.

394
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Eventually, Engine of Love is put in a version.

395
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yes.

396
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Starlight Express.

397
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Correct.

398
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah.

399
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
One of these confusing things that happens.

400
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yes.

401
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The ballad is taken out and we instead want Earl and the Steam Team in there.

402
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Makes sense.

403
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Maybe it works great in the context of the show.

404
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
A lot of the music in the show has kind of a synthy train whistle.

405
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
This really, Earl and the Steam Team definitely pioneered the music that was to come.

406
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Earl and the Steam Team.

407
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The third one.

408
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Is anyone especially excited to take the third one?

409
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I mean, yeah, I don't have it right in front of me, but is it a version of Cinderella where

410
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
they're all trains?

411
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah, that's a good way to put it, I'd say.

412
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
After these two, well, the single doesn't really sell.

413
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Thomas Show doesn't go.

414
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
He is not done with this yet.

415
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So we end up with we're going to do Cinderella, but it's trains now.

416
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I don't know what format this would have been in if it was a stage play or animated.

417
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It could have been animated.

418
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm not sure.

419
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The thing I'm confused about, they leave it generic in any description I've seen.

420
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's like it became it morphed into a story about trains.

421
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And I'm like, was this just you forcing it to we have to make this train thing happen?

422
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah, because it was the ugly train gets to pull the royal coach across a country.

423
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Well, the prince holds a competition to decide which engine will pull the royal train across the United

424
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
States of America.

425
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
OK, so it's a royal train in America and only the most beautiful train at the train ball will get to pull it.

426
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Cinderella would be a steam engine and the ugly sisters would be respectively a diesel engine and an electric engine.

427
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Now, this is all stuff to hold on to for Starlight.

428
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's a lot of the roots of Starlight Express in this scenario.

429
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The difference between the engines.

430
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
This is important.

431
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The difference between a good train and a bad train.

432
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
What how they are powered.

433
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's really the John Peters giant spider thing.

434
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It feels like to me.

435
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000
We've said this before on the show where John Peters who produced Batman was obsessed with getting a giant spider in one of the movies he produced and tried to do it in Superman.

436
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Didn't work.

437
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And then eventually in Wild Wild West, he got a giant spider on the screen.

438
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
He's obsessed with it.

439
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It just took hold of him.

440
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
This is going to end up somewhere.

441
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Come hell or high water.

442
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah, I'd say it's a little bit of a surprise.

443
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Yeah, I found that was all the information on a Wikipedia or something.

444
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I found a note that Angela Weber wrote that went with the Broadway product, like the playbill when this show came to Broadway with a little bit more detail.

445
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
This is so dumb.

446
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So see a Cinderella's a steam engine.

447
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
The ugly sisters were a diesel.

448
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
They're all sisters.

449
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Three sisters, one a step sister.

450
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
One's just not related by oil to the other trains.

451
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:01,000
The steam engine won the competition with a little help from the fairy godmother, aka the Midnight Special.

452
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Then further in parentheses, the Starlight Express will get into it.

453
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The Starlight Express.

454
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The name of the show is a God figure.

455
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's a God of trains.

456
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But before it was a God of trains, it was the stand in for the fairy godmother, the Midnight Special, the Midnight Train.

457
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
He immediately uses a different term.

458
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Midnight Train lent the steam engine special equipment on condition that it was all back by midnight so that the special could so they could leave on time in his haste to get back on time.

459
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
His.

460
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So it's also it's a man.

461
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It's a male.

462
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah, it's a male Cinderella and it's trains.

463
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Multiple premises.

464
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Yeah.

465
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
In his haste to get back on time, the steam engine dropped a piston and the prince went around America to find which.

466
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
To find the engine that the piston fitted onto.

467
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So they do the shoe.

468
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But with it, it's a piston instead.

469
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's a piston.

470
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And it's a male prince trying to find a male engine.

471
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
A prince in America.

472
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Yes.

473
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Maybe just traveling.

474
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But then how does a train get.

475
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So all the trains get loaded up from England.

476
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Wait, the trains are a same sex couple then?

477
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Or is it just.

478
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I mean, assuming that.

479
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Wait a minute.

480
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Is the prince not a train?

481
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Maybe the prince isn't a train.

482
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
There we go.

483
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I think the prince is a guy and he's trying to find the best, most like little engine that could situation.

484
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So he's not looking for romance.

485
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
He's looking for the best train.

486
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
The best train.

487
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It would be great.

488
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Let's take the romance out of Cinderella.

489
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I know that you think like ball gown and romantic dance.

490
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
No, no, no.

491
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It's about a guy who needs a good train in a country that he doesn't live in.

492
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It would be very funny if he's like, I am the prince of Markovia and I am looking for the best American train to fuck.

493
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
To rail, if you would.

494
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Yeah, that's what I thought it was for a second.

495
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Well, look, it's a horny franchise, so that would not be so insane.

496
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
No, this is this is the letter in the program you're referring to where this more details coming from.

497
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:25,000
This is all also where he kind of not do so fully disowns the production, but kind of hedges his bets of like, you know, it may have gotten a little out of control.

498
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Like a little bit gotten away from us.

499
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So we did at the top of the show.

500
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
We don't know everything about.

501
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Look, I don't know.

502
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I work good in England.

503
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I don't know what you're going to see tonight.

504
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I don't know what.

505
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Maybe a wheel is going to fly off of a skate and hit you in the eye.

506
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I don't know.

507
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yeah, he's really like trying to step back from it, even though his ownership over a train thing is so strong down to the fact that I'm telling Aaron some of this and she's like, I'm sorry.

508
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
What's the name of his company?

509
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I say the name of the company is a really useful group.

510
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And she says that's a thing in Thomas.

511
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
That's the most common Thomas theme song.

512
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Really useful.

513
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So beyond the three projects, his company is named after a Thomas thing.

514
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
He's like a little train boy.

515
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And when he's a little boy in England, he's obsessed.

516
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
He's a little train boy.

517
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And he's trying to bring his friends to the screen, to the stage for so long.

518
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah.

519
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Wow.

520
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Interesting.

521
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I don't know.

522
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I mean, I have a little train boy right now.

523
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
That's what's in the house there.

524
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Is that his favorite?

525
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
He's pretty.

526
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yeah, it's that or garbage trucks.

527
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So now there's a little garbage truck boy.

528
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Will he be this way when he is 60 years old?

529
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I don't know.

530
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I would sort of hope not.

531
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But also, look, this did end up being a very successful enterprise after the decade of dreaming.

532
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So it worked out.

533
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Eventually, it becomes what we're talking about today, this sort of garish musical.

534
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And my thought as to what to say first about it is the look.

535
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And my thought as to what to get into first about this thing is the look.

536
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's a podcast.

537
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It's tough to describe.

538
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You know, you can Google it yourself.

539
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:19,000
But what are some big descriptors, whether that be first, let's talk about the character, the design that is really maintained through all of this.

540
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So a lot of makeup, right?

541
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Yeah.

542
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's kind of like it reminded me of David Bowie in the Ashes to Ashes video.

543
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It's I looked up the term.

544
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It's like new romantic that Adam and sort of you're really pale and then a lot of eye streaks.

545
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
But then you're sort of like a one old clown a little bit too.

546
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yeah, it's like you guys not have not seen Return to Oz, right?

547
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
We've been flirting with each other.

548
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
There's these characters called the Wheelies, I think, in Return to Oz that are very new, romantic and remind me of this.

549
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And they're actually like they're people with like their arms are like holding on to like wheels.

550
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So they're kind of wheeling.

551
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
They seem like half people, half, I don't know, like scooters or something bad.

552
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Are they villains?

553
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Oh, they're still scared the shit out of you.

554
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Do you think the whiz falls a little in this?

555
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yes.

556
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Yeah.

557
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I think so.

558
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,000
But it's this very like Euro chic kind of the Robert Palmer girls a little bit.

559
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So we're like we're made up crazy.

560
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Are you going to scare me with the wheel?

561
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I am.

562
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Go there.

563
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I want to jump scares.

564
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I got a moment here.

565
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Here I'm going to go around and.

566
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Yeah.

567
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Yeah.

568
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yeah.

569
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
A little mad Maxie.

570
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Oh, yeah.

571
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
That is a lot like.

572
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Like, you know, I'm not going to go around and.

573
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I mean, many things in that movie did, but them is one of them, especially this would

574
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
this have scared all of you?

575
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yes.

576
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Yeah.

577
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Yeah.

578
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Yeah.

579
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I think I think me too.

580
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I think if you were if we had like close seats to it and they're like surrounding you and

581
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
getting close.

582
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Well, as I said before on the show, I was very scared of sitting too close when we were

583
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
sitting in the back seat.

584
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I mean, I think that's the only way to get around.

585
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I think that's the only way to get around.

586
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Before on the show, I was very scared of sitting too close when we were seeing Peter

587
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Pan in the round when I was six years old.

588
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Yeah.

589
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And that's not even like scared.

590
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Well, Captain Hook scared the pirates scared me.

591
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Not pan.

592
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I loved pan.

593
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Mm hmm.

594
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I was not like I'm not like you.

595
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I love pan.

596
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I did.

597
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I loved him too once, but I learned my change steak.

598
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Yeah.

599
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
The love is gone.

600
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Like this sad song for them about the crystal carol.

601
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
The love is gone.

602
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
No longer a little pan boy.

603
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
That's too bad.

604
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
The wardrobe wise, we got a lot going on.

605
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You're right about EO.

606
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It's very EO.

607
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It's whites and silvers and a lot of like armor and do dads and plastic molding and

608
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
big shoulders.

609
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I mean, it's they're fascinating to look at.

610
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yeah, it is.

611
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,160
There's a lot of like soft piece like it looks soft in the way that like when a Power Rangers

612
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,400
villain who was in a big rubber suit was supposed to maybe look like they were really solid

613
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,720
rock, they would look soft because it was made of some sort of foam material or some

614
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,800
cushion.

615
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,200
And it's very similar to that.

616
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,580
We're like a lot of the pieces that are supposed to be some sort of like tech or some like

617
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,400
impressive part of the train or whatever.

618
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Just they look so they look kind of foamy.

619
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Yeah.

620
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,360
There's I don't know even if I'm describing completely correctly, but it doesn't look

621
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,120
like everybody's wearing hard metal pieces.

622
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,480
It looks like they're wearing kind of foam soft even maybe like a light plastic kind

623
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,480
of a thing.

624
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
Mm hmm.

625
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:44,200
Kind of a little predating and it goes into Lumiere in the Broadway beauty and the beast.

626
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:53,520
It's kind of big diagonal pieces with kind of yeah, little like plastic molded parts.

627
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,800
But then also kind of the like aerobics angle too.

628
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:03,360
There's that stuff, but then the girls are very it's leg warmers and skirts and index

629
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,360
kind of thing.

630
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,360
Yeah.

631
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
Yeah.

632
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,200
So you feel the eighties and it's there.

633
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Yes.

634
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:17,800
There's a revival of anything goes that Bernadette Peters was in in the eighties and the sailor

635
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:23,760
outfits are very eighties eight in the way that the video about starlight express we

636
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:30,180
watch mentions that Andrew Lloyd Webber got a lot of shit from the cats wearing leg warmers

637
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,180
in cats.

638
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,180
Okay.

639
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:36,640
So that so there's this eighties version of anything goes and then there is a revival

640
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,480
of anything goes from a few years ago with Sutton Foster in the lead and it looks the

641
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,560
costumes are wildly different.

642
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:51,680
They are like much more detailed and much more period accurate and less eighties like

643
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,480
I guess you'd call it camp.

644
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,480
Yeah.

645
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Yeah.

646
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,680
I was so this so it's maybe a trend that hit a lot of musicals at the time.

647
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,120
There was maybe that like this we got to appeal to the rock generation.

648
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,120
MTV kids.

649
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,040
How do we get them coming to the theater?

650
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,800
Yeah, that's for sure happening here.

651
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,880
That is happening.

652
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,640
And this is the upswing.

653
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:19,720
This is the Broadway is on the between cats and then Phantom and then the Disney musicals

654
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,280
Broadway is coming back.

655
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,400
It's not the taxi driver Times Square anymore.

656
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
Sure.

657
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,680
Michael Iser's Times Square.

658
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,120
It's Rudy Giuliani's Times Square.

659
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
Well, eventually.

660
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,800
Yeah, that's when this starts.

661
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
But it's money.

662
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Money is here.

663
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,000
I, I, Jane showed me this.

664
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,760
She had a copy of this book from college.

665
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,440
She has a musical theater degree.

666
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,740
And this is like a giant phone book size book called Broadway musical show by show.

667
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,880
And these were some of the ones that were when the book was published route.

668
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,760
Scott, you can see American idiot right there.

669
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
I was hoping it wouldn't.

670
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
Okay, let's go.

671
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,840
We're going to do that eventually.

672
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,480
There is a South Pacific revival.

673
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:06,480
And this book mentions at well, I don't know, this number might be topped at this point

674
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,360
at a cost of well over eight million, the highest in Broadway history.

675
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:16,480
Starlight Express solidified the British invasion by joining cats.

676
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,520
Me and my girl and Les Miserables.

677
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,760
Those were like the big shows.

678
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,800
These big, like big budget spectacular.

679
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,080
Like that like came from the West End was expensive there.

680
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,360
More expensive to do it in America.

681
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,840
Yeah, these are, these numbers are crazy, but it does also make you, if that, if, if

682
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,560
I'm to believe the green goblin and the Spider-Man turn off the dark was a $65 million circus

683
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,920
tragedy or probably more like 75, that number, how crazy is that number when like, cause

684
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:55,280
you can see the expense of Starlight Express big time and that a bad eight million lines

685
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,040
up, but if, but 65, how does the, where did that?

686
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,760
That show looks interesting, but like, I, maybe I don't see it as much.

687
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,480
Did it look that expensive to you?

688
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,640
No, I mean, I saw the retooled version, which I feel like might've been less, I think was

689
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:16,000
like less ambitious and less weird, but still even the pictures I see of what's her name?

690
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Matt was a Matt.

691
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
No, no, this Madam Webb.

692
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It's not Madam Webb.

693
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It's the, thank you.

694
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,680
Rackney was the original character created for the show that was removed once it was

695
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,680
retooled.

696
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,320
But I've seen clips of that and that doesn't look like it was a, like a $50 million piece

697
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,000
of scenery.

698
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,520
Sometimes it looks like a theme park thing.

699
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,480
I'd say a lot of times.

700
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,880
How much did Bono and the Edge make?

701
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,980
That might be well, yeah, a lot of it's $30 million or something like they probably got

702
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,480
something insane.

703
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,240
That might explain some of these songs.

704
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,240
I go, we could do like, if I brought the keyboard over and I, I bet we could write a song that's

705
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,480
better than some of these songs.

706
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,800
Then Starlight Express you're saying?

707
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,040
And Turn Off the Dark.

708
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,040
Not Freak Like Me.

709
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,040
No, no, no.

710
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,040
No one could ever.

711
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,040
But some of the other ones.

712
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

713
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,160
So it's crazy when it's like, like, yeah, they probably are half the budget.

714
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,400
They don't, you don't get those guys cheap, especially in like the late 90s or whatever

715
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
early 2000s.

716
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
That's gotta be it.

717
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,280
That's like the movie is so expensive because of.

718
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,280
And Taymor.

719
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Restoring in it.

720
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,720
Two takes 10 to 20 million.

721
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,960
Like they probably sunk the whole thing because of their salaries, I'm guessing.

722
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,800
And the rest of it went to bees that came loose from the man made entirely.

723
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,920
Because Julie came more insistent on real bees for six months.

724
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,880
We can do it, god damn it.

725
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,880
Would you let me try?

726
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
Yeah.

727
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:42,640
But yeah, I don't, I mean, the British one was complex, but it seems like it came to

728
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,680
Broadway and they upped the game.

729
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:53,120
gigantic ramps and the ramp and like the the stage itself, like there's lights embedded

730
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,680
in it, like flashing lights that you couldn't trip over, you know, like built into the into

731
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:05,480
the ground, into the dome and then huge bridges and platforms that can lower and rotate and

732
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,480
pivot.

733
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,000
It's so it's the most complicated thing.

734
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yeah, fair to say.

735
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,120
We saw Hadestown and they have a spinning stage in that when we were in New York and

736
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,720
I kept just being like nervous that somebody was going to trip.

737
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,720
Yes.

738
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,200
And that's one element that happens here and there in the show.

739
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,600
They weren't on skates.

740
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,360
But they were on skates.

741
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,480
And that was a small, small stage.

742
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
Yeah.

743
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,480
This was a massive.

744
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:35,080
Just the looks like at least again, that that video synopsizes things that they get into

745
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,760
like one night.

746
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,400
So and so was on level three trying to head to level like, oh my god, there's so there's

747
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,560
three stages in a way.

748
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,880
The top one is 20 feet off the ground.

749
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,920
And oh, yes, it's extremely dangerous.

750
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,200
And no, you didn't know how to skate until this.

751
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,840
That's another. OK, so who do you get to be in this?

752
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:05,160
It seems like they had the the dilemma of is it like, can you get entirely great singers

753
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,280
and great actors who are also great skaters?

754
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,920
I'm not sure that was on the table.

755
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,080
You were like, they.

756
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,040
Well, it seems like they ended up splitting the difference.

757
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,520
Half skaters who they were going to teach to act and half actors that they were going

758
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,840
to teach to skate.

759
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,640
They didn't go with a full just Armageddon style solution.

760
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,240
No, they split it in half.

761
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,480
Yeah, they didn't go with drillers who they trained to be astronauts or astronauts.

762
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,480
They didn't.

763
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,760
They they went with drillers who trained to be astronauts.

764
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:38,960
They didn't split the difference and go an interesting pitch for an alternate Armageddon

765
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,840
have half drillers, half astronauts.

766
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,480
It seems like it would also makes a lot of sense to do that.

767
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,240
Yeah. Yeah.

768
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,840
Maybe like cover all your bases.

769
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,600
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

770
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,280
But hey, you can't argue with the results.

771
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,440
It worked out the first time.

772
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,240
That's true. It did.

773
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,120
It's perfect.

774
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:57,240
So thus, they're teaching these people to skate as quickly as they can.

775
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,360
They were also learning all the numbers and songs.

776
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,920
And it seems like it didn't go great.

777
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,040
I'm sure every production of this must be the scariest, toughest shit ever.

778
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:15,160
I couldn't do I couldn't like I couldn't hang in a rehearsal for one minute.

779
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,720
I couldn't make it 60 seconds.

780
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,960
Have you been have either of you been on roller skates in the last 20 years?

781
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,960
I never learned to roller skate.

782
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,840
I buy the bike, but I don't.

783
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,160
I never did skating. You.

784
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,000
Um, I think for a moment, maybe or maybe that was a skateboard.

785
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,760
Even as a child, I would end up going to someone's birthday.

786
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,440
And then for a while, we would do cast parties at the roller rink.

787
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,760
And so I would it would be a year or two in between.

788
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,120
And as I aged, I just got worse and worse.

789
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,880
Was you aged to like 12 to 13?

790
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,520
No, no, no. I mean, from like six to 13.

791
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,520
Oh, no.

792
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,360
You're not much better as I as I became.

793
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,680
No, no, no. I was younger and got worse.

794
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,760
13. No, as I I, you know,

795
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,160
I became a chubby child and my center of balance

796
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,960
just got on a train and went elsewhere to another.

797
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,400
I see. I see.

798
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,560
You got frontloaded with Scrapple.

799
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,640
You're being magnetized to the ground from a big pile of scrap.

800
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,440
I remember like once, like,

801
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,560
like going to get like a snack bar thing or like going to the bathroom

802
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,280
with skates on and almost like nailing my head on like a fixture.

803
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,680
And I was like, why didn't I change?

804
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,640
What was I thinking? Yeah.

805
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,520
I I I one or two roller skating parties, one skating,

806
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,440
a couple ice skating lessons.

807
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,600
I was always bad at it, never felt steady.

808
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,920
And then Lindsay likes to go roller skating.

809
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,000
So a couple of times in the last decade, we've gone to a roller rink.

810
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,120
Oh, as adults. Wow.

811
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,400
And I just freaked.

812
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,920
There's a it is a high pressure situation,

813
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,720
especially when it's crowded.

814
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,160
You're merging out of the freeway.

815
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,480
And I'm not very good at it.

816
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,680
And I am just like my legs are like kind of locked together.

817
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,120
My feet are just like in a tense position the whole time

818
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,480
as I'm kind of trying to figure out a situation where I'm comfortable

819
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,360
and having fun.

820
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,440
But people are getting wiped out all over.

821
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,920
It's still like all the adults who are like much more confident,

822
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,840
like people weaving in and out of you.

823
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,200
Those people are wiping out fairly often when the couple of times we've been.

824
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,480
And I go, well, they're very good at this.

825
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,560
And they're just like too many people here.

826
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,080
So like just the law of like, well, if there's enough possible

827
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,120
situation where you're going to get hurt, it's going to happen.

828
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,800
Especially if you're doing this seven times a week on a stage.

829
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,040
Well, you have to doing your you have to do 10 other things at once.

830
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,960
Well, it did happen. Yeah.

831
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,280
And a lot. Yeah.

832
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,360
There were snapped ankles.

833
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,800
Of course, people's eyes were burnt from sweat

834
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,200
because they're also where they're wearing these complicated costumes.

835
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,760
But like safety regulations require them to wear like soft padding underneath,

836
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,200
which helps them but also just adds to the sheer weight.

837
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,240
Everybody's in like Arnold Mr.

838
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,760
Freeze type, right?

839
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,960
You know, for all of them are.

840
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,880
People take off their shoes and their socks are bloody.

841
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,080
It's just in rehearsal.

842
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,040
We aren't even talking about the show.

843
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,000
And then anybody else see the fact that the averages

844
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,640
that there was that there was a point where they did a ransom math

845
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,160
just based on how many injuries there have been and have been a production of this

846
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,640
in England that.

847
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,200
OK, so there were 24.

848
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,480
I'm sorry. 21 performers in this show.

849
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,440
And just they added up how many injuries had happened.

850
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,760
And that means that all 21 performers averaged two point nine injuries apiece.

851
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,840
So everybody is essentially hurt three times at least

852
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,960
in the course of the production.

853
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,960
I so an earlier iteration of this,

854
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,360
if it's not sounding weird enough,

855
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,920
Andrew Lloyd Webber, I think, wanted this to be more of like a concert show

856
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,720
and wanted it to be kind of like a teaching

857
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:14,120
tool, like we will show children

858
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,240
this, if and especially if they don't know the theater.

859
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,760
This is what they will see.

860
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,960
This is well before the roller skates.

861
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,600
But I'm just like and I guess there was some element of that

862
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,080
with the early versions of Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat.

863
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,400
Meant to be not to be like fully acted out, like it's a thing where it's OK

864
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,240
that you're in one place and you're right.

865
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,200
Yeah. And then eventually took on a life.

866
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,960
And so Joseph pretty well beloved, pretty, pretty beloved.

867
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,200
I'd say is pretty popular.

868
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,520
I've had many revivals, a lot of revivals done by community theaters

869
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,880
and smaller theaters.

870
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,880
Donny Osmond, Donny Osmond is done in and high school schools,

871
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,880
you know, do productions of it.

872
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,480
And I guess they do have Starlight Express, too.

873
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,080
But I feel like you would just be signing a death warrant.

874
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,680
Like, oh, no, don't let your children do this.

875
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,720
I would rather my child being like a roller derby than do this.

876
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,720
I think so in a way, because you know what that is.

877
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,400
Yeah. And there's more safety implements.

878
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,360
Perhaps. Yes. Yeah.

879
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,480
You it's having to like stop.

880
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,760
It's hitting marks on a dot like stopping on a dime

881
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,680
and then and then singing a song.

882
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,760
Yeah. But starting at the top speed of.

883
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,320
Would you rather have your kid play football or be in Starlight Express?

884
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,120
What's more, what's scarier?

885
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:41,240
If it weren't for the danger, it's certainly if there was a play

886
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:46,560
this insane without the danger football on roller skates, but no tackling.

887
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,640
That sounds OK.

888
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,760
Touch it's touch football, but you're on roller skates.

889
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,120
Touch football inevitably devolves into a little bit of tackling.

890
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,520
Sure. Yeah.

891
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,000
I played that in sixth grade.

892
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,200
So that's all right.

893
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,640
It looks insane.

894
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:07,800
It's a captain, you know, army, and they're all in danger at all times.

895
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,840
But what are they doing?

896
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,280
What is the tale that is being told?

897
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,560
And here I turn to, I think, a really nice piece of writing

898
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,600
from a writer named Courtney Enlow writing for sci fi and quote.

899
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,720
In writing, there is a term called a hat on a hat.

900
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,280
What that means is putting too many things unnecessarily on top of each other,

901
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,200
thus diminishing the effects of whatever those things might be.

902
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,960
Andrew Lloyd Webber Starlight Express is essentially 72 hats

903
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,880
stacked up wearing a trench coat.

904
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,840
Like that little synopsis.

905
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,440
Yeah, that's true.

906
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,960
And well, what jumps to mind is what she's referring to.

907
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:51,200
Jason. Well, I'd like to do a little compare and contrast of log lines as well.

908
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:58,960
So the the Broadway, the book of Broadway shows gets a little into other details.

909
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,880
I'm sure we're going to touch on.

910
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,360
So I'm just going to read you the Wikipedia synopsis.

911
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,000
And then I'm going to read you a different synopsis.

912
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,960
OK, the Wikipedia.

913
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,320
It tells the story of a young but obsolete steam train, Rusty,

914
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,120
who races in a championship against modern engines in the hopes

915
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,920
in the hope of impressing a first class observation car pearl.

916
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,800
Got it. Pretty dry.

917
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,880
Pretty simple.

918
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,480
No, very say you're interested in an observation car.

919
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,720
Beautiful observation car. Got it. Yeah.

920
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,160
And he's an underdog.

921
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,560
OK, here's how the Starlight Express Wiki describes it.

922
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,760
It's race night.

923
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,520
Take your seats for the World Championship Railroad race.

924
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,760
Who will win?

925
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,800
Will it be diesel?

926
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,080
Will it be electric or will it be steam?

927
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,600
So you kind of get all of that.

928
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,240
These are the hats in the show.

929
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,360
There is admittedly there's like a straightforward underdog story.

930
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:54,200
And then also a concept that it doesn't hasn't existed before.

931
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:54,960
It's race night.

932
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,960
The different kinds of trains race train race night train.

933
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,040
Train. The trains are racing and the different types.

934
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,840
And we will find out once and for all if steam can beat diesel.

935
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,040
Yeah. Well, I have some things beyond that.

936
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,760
But let's the racing aspect.

937
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,480
Yeah. Trains don't race.

938
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,160
Right. Oh, you're into a train race.

939
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,760
I've never been to a train race.

940
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,600
Has there ever been a train race?

941
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,360
I mean, I'm sure there has.

942
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,200
Yeah. And when I looked up train racing, there's like a car

943
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,520
tries to outrace a train. Yeah.

944
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,840
Or a man. But I don't.

945
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,800
It's not a regular.

946
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,920
It's not a common.

947
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,600
No, there's no sport.

948
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,000
It's set in the high stakes world of train racing.

949
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,120
OK, but what what's that?

950
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:43,160
When you have to go wait back up before even one sentence of the synopsis is through,

951
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,160
you know, you have a problem.

952
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,480
Or not, because this is an exceedingly successful play.

953
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,880
But wait, we haven't even talked about control.

954
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,920
Yeah. Yeah.

955
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,320
Well, you're all, you know, the trains can't do anything

956
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,040
unless they're commanded to by control.

957
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,480
The other worldly voice kind of controlling everything,

958
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,040
you know, setting the setting the stakes of when the race is starting everything.

959
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,320
So that's control.

960
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,040
What am I forgetting about control?

961
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,000
Well, control is a small child.

962
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,240
A lot of this takes place in the mind and imagination of a small child.

963
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,320
Yeah. OK, so it's the high stakes world of train racing.

964
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,320
And there's a love story.

965
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:28,080
But it's all being dreamed up by a kid who in some productions, at least,

966
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,480
you does start with like there's a kid playing with toy trains and then you zoom

967
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,600
at the time, you zoom on what happens to the kid.

968
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,920
Yeah. Well, you probably spotlight hard on the kid.

969
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,360
And then you open up. Yeah.

970
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,160
He makes it out of there.

971
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,440
Whatever it is to do to sneak out.

972
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,400
That's how you do a zoom on the stage.

973
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,160
And you just hear him.

974
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,840
And then this is all his.

975
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,240
I've also seen it described as dreaming.

976
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,480
But that's different than like you're playing with the train.

977
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,920
So it's he's having a dream about trains.

978
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,640
He's not a huge presence.

979
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,840
Almost like the show isn't that well thought out.

980
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,400
They just kept adding and adding.

981
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,160
It's the like the thing that I like the Trey Parker saying, but the writing

982
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,240
that stuff you want to happen, but it's got to become like this

983
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:16,600
happens because this and this and after that, like you kind of weave it all.

984
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,160
This just feels like and and and and and and I think that's probably.

985
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,800
Yeah, you could say that about cats from what I understand about cats

986
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,160
and what I've heard of cats.

987
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,320
A lot of and. Yeah.

988
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,520
Can I can I play the overture?

989
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,680
Because, well, it's weird.

990
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,320
You seem troubled.

991
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,960
Well, there is a troubling element to it here.

992
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,400
I'm just going to play this real quick.

993
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,240
This is the, you know, overture.

994
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,040
Where's this going? OK.

995
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,640
So just want to get to give people a sense of the sound

996
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,520
overtures and musicals,

997
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:17,400
not usually a thing that includes a haunting child's voice

998
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,640
chanting, this is control, this is control, usually just an instrumental medley.

999
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,200
I'd say, no, this is control has never been said in an overture. Yeah.

1000
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,320
Be gone if I was recurring.

1001
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,040
It is like Wendy Yesley Yesley's

1002
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,800
is the water warm and the trains warm enough.

1003
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,920
Shall we begin? Yes, Lisa.

1004
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,520
Yeah, a little unsettling.

1005
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:48,440
And the well, I mean, do you want to do we want to play

1006
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,440
song number well, OK.

1007
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,920
I'm leading it too much.

1008
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,680
What's your favorite song in the show, Mike?

1009
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,920
It is what did you just reset it?

1010
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,720
I just want to make sure I have the title correctly.

1011
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,640
It is one, two, three.

1012
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,320
He whistled rolling stock rolling stock.

1013
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,960
Really rolling stock.

1014
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,680
Yes, really.

1015
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,520
I like that's not even my top two.

1016
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,120
Wow. Wow. Maybe top three.

1017
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:20,320
I, you know, OK, I throw this on in Spotify and rolling stock comes up

1018
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,800
and I'm like, oh, maybe I like it.

1019
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,160
Maybe I like the show. Yeah.

1020
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,200
I don't hate rolling stock.

1021
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,640
I'm just I wanted to say, I'm not.

1022
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,080
I don't know how could you.

1023
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,960
I'm going to play not the one on Spotify, but rather this.

1024
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,280
This one has a video to it, so I will turn my screen around.

1025
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,440
So this is a performance on

1026
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,800
some country in Europe's television.

1027
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,760
I'm not sure.

1028
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,480
But let me set the scene because creepy overture.

1029
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,760
But now it's time to get to the train action and

1030
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,080
the trains have all lined up.

1031
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:00,680
And then things are led by a particular train named Greaseball.

1032
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:05,320
Greaseball takes the lead and he is a cocky train.

1033
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,360
He is cocky because he is diesel and diesels are better than steam.

1034
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,600
Obviously, it's also obvious to me what diesel,

1035
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,360
what they are as opposed to steam.

1036
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:19,440
I don't need to fill the audience in on my vast knowledge of diesel

1037
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,440
and the benefits of it.

1038
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:27,400
It goes without saying anyway, diesel is played by an actor.

1039
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,160
I would say almost all later age, but especially this one, I'm going to play

1040
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:35,440
his hair and his high hair and his clothing remind me a lot of

1041
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,280
musician behind the famous Joker Stare Dance anthem

1042
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,520
and famous sex criminal Gary Glitter.

1043
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,040
It's a very Gary Glitter guy.

1044
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:51,120
And this is just the dopiest performance.

1045
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,560
So you're going from a live performance.

1046
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,840
The spot of my one I kind of like.

1047
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,120
And it was a little bit like, oh, we're in an OK synth zone.

1048
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:01,120
But I'm going to play the the the dopier one here.

1049
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,200
That's that's that pretty much.

1050
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,400
I think you want to point out about what you saw.

1051
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,040
Yeah, it kind of sounds a little like Don't Bring Me Down.

1052
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,520
It absolutely sounds like Don't Bring Me Down.

1053
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,400
I like it. It sounds like Robert Palmer did Don't Bring Me Down.

1054
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,160
Yeah, a little bit of a deeper lascivious.

1055
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I love those like

1056
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,240
I love those like, you know, like, you know, like, you know,

1057
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,800
like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like,

1058
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,480
I love those like gang vocals.

1059
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,240
So many people at once.

1060
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:04,400
Just the fastest thing I like the song.

1061
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,840
If I see the song at karaoke anywhere in my life, I'm doing it.

1062
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,760
I feel like I could do it.

1063
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,960
Roll it stuck. Roll it stuck.

1064
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,280
It's like exactly in my scream zone.

1065
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,640
Yeah, it's no, I had I had a first I was a little bit like,

1066
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,760
I don't know about this. And then I was like, OK, I like this.

1067
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:26,840
And I definitely that would be a thing that happens a lot where I go,

1068
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,880
I don't know about this.

1069
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,280
And then I go, OK, I like this.

1070
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,840
That has happened a lot of times researching the show.

1071
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,920
You know what won me over is that the overture ends and rolling stock hits

1072
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,880
like that, like really hard.

1073
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,880
And that was when I was like, oh, OK, there there.

1074
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,920
This is serious now. We're here to play.

1075
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,480
This has momentum. Yeah.

1076
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:53,840
There's a couple of just musically rolling stock, I think, could be a hit song.

1077
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,880
You're right. It's very similar to a hit song.

1078
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,120
And let me ask you this.

1079
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,440
And when you guys were researching, I did not find evidence of this,

1080
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,280
but I sort of have this theory in the back of my head and we'll

1081
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,280
investigate as we go along.

1082
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:09,280
I feel like every song is maybe based on a popular

1083
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,800
music artist or a lot of them.

1084
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:16,160
Sure. I hear very specific people in some of these songs.

1085
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,360
Yeah, I like that one.

1086
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,240
If it's yellow, you can really sing the lyrics to yellow over that.

1087
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,600
He even like some of the light he does a little bit of sort of like flirty

1088
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:31,200
Bowie. You got no lovers if you got no wheels. Yeah.

1089
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,320
Like Book of Mormon, every song is written like a different musical.

1090
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,440
It's inspired by a different musical. Oh, like music.

1091
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,840
One's the music man. One's wicked.

1092
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,120
One is like they.

1093
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,000
And I feel like almost like maybe there was a different pop artist

1094
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,800
or multiple pop artists influenced these songs.

1095
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,080
I did not find him saying this. It's just a feeling I have.

1096
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,320
Probably just a guess.

1097
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:58,240
I have a vague sense of what is going on musically. Yeah.

1098
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,600
It's Elton John. It's Bowie.

1099
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,920
One of them is Elton for sure. I feel like sounds like Elton John too. Yeah.

1100
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,360
Anyway, I love that one.

1101
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,760
I also like a little bit later you get the line.

1102
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,640
Don't try to show you can go faster than me.

1103
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,920
This is my back view and it's all you'll see.

1104
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:20,040
The lyrics and this are so dumb.

1105
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,840
That is something I think I'm not wrong about.

1106
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,960
The lyrics are so ridiculous and stupid.

1107
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,800
I got to say I am the fastest train.

1108
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,680
Once in a while, there's something that's a little more clever

1109
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,120
that's still in the sort of like genre of a train, like describing itself.

1110
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,680
But usually those lyrics are like, yeah, room two, two.

1111
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,280
It may as well be a two, two.

1112
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,360
It's what I'm going to do.

1113
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,000
Yeah. Well, because this is like the suite of songs.

1114
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,040
Like the next song is Call Me Rusty.

1115
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,760
The next one is a lot of locomotion.

1116
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,040
I'm not a big Call Me Rusty guy. I'll say that.

1117
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,240
It goes off a cliff for me so fast.

1118
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,920
I like a lot of locomotion because that's where all.

1119
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,920
Yes, I think you're wrong about locomotion.

1120
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,960
That's where all the lady cars introduce each other.

1121
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,960
That's what I'm saying. When musicals get into like

1122
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:13,360
a lot of that, I feel like it's a blondie rip off.

1123
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,800
Oh, yeah. Yeah. And I kind of like it.

1124
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,040
The smoking car has a smoking addiction like that's funny.

1125
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,160
But a lot of times I hope you ordered soup.

1126
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,160
I think the cooking.

1127
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,200
It's not that I like that.

1128
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,560
I like Harley Quinn voice necessarily.

1129
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,080
But it's like the vibe.

1130
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,760
It's another one where it starts and I go like, I don't know.

1131
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,760
Do I like this at all?

1132
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,400
And then it like kind of like.

1133
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,400
You can't.

1134
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,400
It's like unpleasant, atonal.

1135
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,760
Like this is this illustrates just because it's since doesn't mean I like it.

1136
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,480
This is doing nothing for me.

1137
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:55,120
Like that part, you're like, OK, I don't know.

1138
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,400
What is this? And then it kicks in.

1139
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,680
Take the lead from the Eastern Ocean

1140
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,400
to the West Sea.

1141
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,560
Locomotion is going to carry me.

1142
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,600
That locomotion, that's what we need.

1143
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,480
If we are in a good baseline.

1144
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,400
So what's the.

1145
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,640
Out. Do you like that song that I think it sounds like?

1146
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,040
Which one?

1147
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,480
What's that song called? Right.

1148
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,120
OK, the heart of the one that might like Cyrus does.

1149
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,240
I don't know.

1150
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,160
Maybe I don't know.

1151
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,720
I should know the name of it. I don't.

1152
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,920
I'm a glass glass.

1153
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,160
We should mention one of the notable people to come out

1154
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,080
an early acting role for this performer in Starlight Express.

1155
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,760
She did survive. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1156
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,440
Jane Krakowski.

1157
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,560
Yes. Maybe the only like mainstream famous graduate.

1158
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,480
Yeah, I think really young.

1159
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,680
Yeah.

1160
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,040
She there. The clip is down.

1161
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,280
I think she was on Seth Meyers or something talking about it.

1162
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,120
The implication was that she she asked if she could skate and she lied.

1163
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:18,400
She was that as and young enough to be willing to.

1164
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,720
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Why not?

1165
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,560
Also, no way she's the only one who lied.

1166
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,520
Oh, yeah.

1167
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,120
Yeah. They said they saw a thousand people.

1168
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,120
There's some liars in there and there's some liars and whoever they can.

1169
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,840
Like in the year, you're telling me that in the area of actor special skills,

1170
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:38,240
that that is a zone of the resume that is sometimes not true.

1171
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,080
Mine says that it is an actor special skill lying.

1172
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,480
Lying comes in the play.

1173
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:48,160
All do is a lot of like the phrase like, oh, I'm just checking on this.

1174
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,320
It's my agent.

1175
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,760
And it's like, I'm suspicious you're going to kill me somehow

1176
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,920
due to lack of safety.

1177
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,000
I'm believing it on my agent.

1178
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,040
There's a there's a photo of Jane Krakowski

1179
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,840
while promoting the event, not inside a stage, but out in a park

1180
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,560
in New York somewhere.

1181
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,960
And here's I think you got maybe greaseball there

1182
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,280
and another of the female characters, I'm not sure.

1183
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,240
You and Jane Krakowski, why you wonder, am I showing you this

1184
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,440
on the corner of my screen?

1185
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,360
Well, that's because I'm going to slide it over and reveal

1186
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,680
one more person next to Jane.

1187
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,000
And oh, look who it is.

1188
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,160
It's old Donald J. Trump.

1189
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,360
What is this? Why?

1190
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:36,680
Why is he with the Starlight Express people?

1191
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,880
This is I mean, I mean, this is like her character on 30.

1192
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,160
Like, this is a thing that Jenna would

1193
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,960
which they may have clipped on the show.

1194
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,400
Oh, yeah, there is.

1195
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,760
There's a scene where she's like lacing up skates, like a quick shot of

1196
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,120
some implied bad thing she's in.

1197
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,160
But don't know why Trump.

1198
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,840
But Trump, though, it's a real runner.

1199
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:05,520
The Andrew Lloyd Webber, one of maybe the biggest Andrew Lloyd Webber fan.

1200
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:11,440
It became like it was in the the craziest days of 2020.

1201
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,760
It would they would calm him down by playing memory.

1202
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,960
And he loved Vita.

1203
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,440
He's always been a big Lloyd Webber stand.

1204
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,520
He's a theater guy. He's a weirdo.

1205
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,080
He's a Manhattan weirdo.

1206
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,440
He's all the shows like.

1207
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:30,640
Yeah. With like with a lady on his arm with like a mink coat and.

1208
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,200
We're mother. Going to the theater.

1209
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,320
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

1210
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,560
Mm hmm. Yeah.

1211
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,520
Weird giant haired mother.

1212
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,440
Jason, you're saying that because you're saying he's not a salt of the earth

1213
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,120
religious guy. That's what you're saying.

1214
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,000
I Michael, I know you're trying to imply.

1215
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:49,560
I the most salt of the earth thing recently is like

1216
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,640
the the golf photos that came out.

1217
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:57,360
He that there was an event at its golf resort and he looks like absolute shit.

1218
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:01,000
If it's so it's like salt of the earth and then that it reminds you

1219
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,920
that he will be in the earth.

1220
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,600
He looks like he should be in the earth within six months, although we know

1221
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,960
like we're stuck with this guy for three goddamn decades.

1222
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,600
He looks like a snail who has been covered in salt.

1223
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:18,640
Like any sense of moisture has been drained from his being.

1224
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,760
I'm not sure the character in Scrooge,

1225
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,360
but there's like a like, oh, yeah, you know, I'm tired.

1226
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:28,680
Aaron's pointed out in a in a cap and who's like mummified.

1227
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,520
Yeah. That's what that's what he looks like.

1228
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:36,000
And I think so Trump loves it.

1229
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,800
Trump loves it.

1230
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:41,360
She OK. So I think he plays because there are these are all the different types

1231
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:44,200
of cars, the dining cars, the smoking car.

1232
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,080
She's Joe. She's Dina, the dining car.

1233
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,560
We're jumping around.

1234
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:53,680
But she her big number is a song that is spelled.

1235
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:57,720
And when you put the acronym together, it spells out uncoupled.

1236
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,360
And OK. Yes.

1237
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,440
Wait, what, though? What's that?

1238
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:06,680
And just imagine in the context of the show that you're hearing,

1239
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:11,280
I guess I'm you and see, oh, you like, hang on.

1240
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,360
You can't do the long spelling.

1241
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:17,240
Unless it's a very word we're going to get right away because coupled.

1242
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,120
What? Oh, it's train.

1243
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,880
That's when trains. Yeah.

1244
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,240
Hook up. That's when trains latch to each other.

1245
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,920
And that's so to talk about trains hooking up.

1246
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:32,120
It's all about the whole thing is about male engine trains

1247
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:38,120
who are horny for female other types of cars.

1248
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,000
Right. Because the shift happened later.

1249
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,800
But in the first few iterations, the shift did not happen.

1250
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,160
It was very clear men are engines and women are everything else.

1251
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,760
There could not be. Yeah.

1252
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,880
That's why I think that goes back to the Cinderella thing.

1253
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:58,080
Like, why isn't it just a female and well, because a female engine?

1254
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,760
Are you crazy? This world has to have rules. Right.

1255
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,280
Yeah. For a while.

1256
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:07,480
And now they've broken down this barrier, this female engines now.

1257
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,240
But just a weird facet of the show and that like,

1258
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,160
I'm just like, so is it OK?

1259
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,440
The little like latches of a train that grab each other.

1260
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:24,320
Is that just like holding hands or is it a little is it a little more than that?

1261
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:30,720
Is it like when you put your braid into the mighty Akron's whatever orifice and fly?

1262
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,640
He got to it.

1263
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:36,160
It's hard to think of ways for things to have sex that aren't general based.

1264
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,800
Right. But it's Cameron did it.

1265
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,920
And maybe Angela did it, too.

1266
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,200
They're the only two.

1267
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,960
That's all I can think of.

1268
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:49,240
Yeah. A male train, a boy train takes his little lash

1269
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,560
and a female train takes her identical latch.

1270
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:55,840
And when they latch, that's how you make a caboose.

1271
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,840
Have you had this conversation with your son yet?

1272
01:04:59,080 --> 01:04:59,880
It's going to be happening.

1273
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,680
So I will. That's no that's how I'm going to frame it.

1274
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,520
It's going to help me.

1275
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,280
Like, you know, you remember watching Thomas growing up?

1276
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,080
You know, their latches.

1277
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:10,120
I mean, you know how boys are always and you know how in Thomas

1278
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:14,320
this also was the same thing that only boys could be engines

1279
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:18,920
because Thomas has like a like a girl behind him all the time.

1280
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,080
Oh, you only barely because there's all these books in the house.

1281
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:26,200
And like you'll just see like half of her eye poking out from behind Thomas.

1282
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,120
That's his poor character.

1283
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,000
They're not passing the Helen test.

1284
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,160
Have they fixed that in recent Thomas versions?

1285
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,440
Yes. Now there's I think there's a lot of female.

1286
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:39,840
OK, engines. But yeah, up until not in the the Carlin

1287
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:43,560
and Ringo era, the Stone Age, I call it.

1288
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,320
So sexiness throughout.

1289
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,040
And again, let's let's go backwards.

1290
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,920
Remember, it's a boy's it's a young boy's dream.

1291
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,440
He's dreaming of his trains dating.

1292
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:58,920
Yeah. Which is like a young Angela Weber was day was imagining this.

1293
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,440
Andrew, listen to me.

1294
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,720
When you grow up and start dating, it's like a train dragging a caboose.

1295
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:08,400
You're just dragging dead weight along with you.

1296
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,600
You have a choice to make.

1297
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,760
Are you doing the dragging or are you being?

1298
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,240
You're strong. You're the you're the force.

1299
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,680
They're just a looky loo observation car.

1300
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,920
Just remember that.

1301
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,680
Mommy, I'm a little steam train and I want to chew.

1302
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,840
I'm going to be the most famous steam train in all of England.

1303
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,200
I want to kiss the other cars, Mommy.

1304
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,520
When will I get to couple?

1305
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:37,240
I want to couple with them.

1306
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,160
He's like an elegant car.

1307
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:43,360
Your son has been telling the girls at school he wants to couple with them.

1308
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:49,120
We have to get we have to reprimand the boy in some very graphic drawings.

1309
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,360
What have you done to your son, Mrs.

1310
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,480
Lloyd Webber? I screamed at him.

1311
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,800
Andrew Mark, my if you don't stop drawing this filth,

1312
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,560
this will never work out for you.

1313
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,640
You will never be an artist in the medium of trains,

1314
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,080
no matter how many decades you try.

1315
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,440
His Spider-Man origin.

1316
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:12,600
Maybe try once, but get the message and don't try four times.

1317
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,240
I'll prove mommy wrong.

1318
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,000
He's sobbing.

1319
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,080
Choo-choo.

1320
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:17,840
Choo-choo.

1321
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,200
That's how it happened.

1322
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:26,880
Um, I think just shout out songs that you dig or don't do.

1323
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,800
What what did you have a reaction to?

1324
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:29,880
Sure.

1325
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:34,680
I will say overall, the first third had my attention.

1326
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,720
The middle third kind of lost me.

1327
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,640
Yeah, I agree with that.

1328
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,560
What kind of brought me back?

1329
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,880
I think I figured out how to get it on the big TV.

1330
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,600
I am starlight.

1331
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,480
I thought kind of got my attention again.

1332
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,280
I do have to shout out ACDC.

1333
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:55,000
The song that is about is it about an electric train or is about a computer?

1334
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,080
I think they say I am a computer at some point.

1335
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:01,520
Well, I think maybe it's that definition or anything digital.

1336
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,480
Yeah, which I'm sorry, electric.

1337
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,040
Yeah, electric equals computer.

1338
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,240
We know that.

1339
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:10,920
I think we should say one third of songs, popular songs in the 1980s,

1340
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,520
were about like I am a computer.

1341
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,800
Beep boop boop.

1342
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,880
Hit my keyboard.

1343
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:19,600
Like that was so if you were stuck, if you had writer's block in the 80s.

1344
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,240
Computer blue.

1345
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:21,680
Sure.

1346
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,520
By Prince of the Prince.

1347
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,920
Oh, yeah.

1348
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,960
But you could just like you just put a little synth on it or you could put a

1349
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:32,880
little sound effects and just go like computers around us everywhere.

1350
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,440
We are like computers now.

1351
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,800
Top of the pops, please.

1352
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,320
Computers everywhere around us.

1353
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,160
So you just wrote a song that could be in the show.

1354
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:41,920
Sure.

1355
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,520
Yeah, yeah.

1356
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,120
That's what I'm saying.

1357
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,560
Compu-dar train.

1358
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,440
I pulled a clip from ACDC.

1359
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,040
This is a more recent production.

1360
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:51,640
This is, I think, a perennially going production in Singapore.

1361
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:58,880
There's been a parade of digital based trains, but then kind of the ultimate one

1362
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,360
comes out who this is like this seems like the part in the show.

1363
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:07,800
This is like the big crazy, glammed out androgynous big like a highlight

1364
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:13,960
number that is like good, but then insane the way the vocals are treated in this.

1365
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,320
You'll you'll you'll hear.

1366
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:35,000
Electric, the future is me.

1367
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:36,560
I love it.

1368
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,080
Yeah, I do love that.

1369
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,920
I am electric.

1370
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:44,840
Yeah, you like I have wires.

1371
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,920
Also, some circuits.

1372
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,720
The lyrics are so bad.

1373
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,560
That's what's on the top of my keyboard spell.

1374
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,560
Quirty.

1375
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:58,360
It's not that there's not that you just exhibited like ten times the knowledge

1376
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,960
about computers with that joke.

1377
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,040
Yeah, you have to dial it way.

1378
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,280
But I think I have a screen.

1379
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,480
Lightning bolts leaves the wire and enters the big box.

1380
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,960
Zeroes and ones, I believe.

1381
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,800
I read that once.

1382
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,320
I do like that.

1383
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,160
I do like that, especially seeing the visual.

1384
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:22,800
I mean, I will give it a lot of credit to even the songs that I don't like.

1385
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,280
Seeing the clip of it does make the song better.

1386
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:27,280
Yes.

1387
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,280
And that's what cats do.

1388
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:31,040
That's that's annoying that it's not tough.

1389
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:34,640
It's not easier to do this in all the time that the show has been going.

1390
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,800
Something that everyone has forgotten to do is to film a nice version of it.

1391
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,200
Yeah. One you can watch.

1392
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,680
Right now, we were helped out on this issue.

1393
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,120
Without even saying explicitly, we were going to do the episode.

1394
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:51,720
One day I saw we had a DM from Amy Elizabeth,

1395
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:56,160
who sent us a massive pile of pro shot versions of the show.

1396
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,800
And I was excited.

1397
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,760
But even the pro shot versions are like, well, that means that there were

1398
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:03,120
multiple cameras and somebody like I had a tripod.

1399
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,560
Try that. It was a tripod.

1400
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:09,240
But right. Like, I don't think this has been filmed by a network

1401
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,440
for any other than like they were on the Tonys.

1402
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:15,760
They were on the Macy's Thanksgiving parade.

1403
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,000
Rolling stock was on that.

1404
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,920
But it's a I don't know.

1405
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:23,280
I mean, thanks, Amy, for everything you sent us.

1406
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,680
It made it easier to watch. Yeah.

1407
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,880
But it's so odd that this is not more.

1408
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,600
Yeah, there's multiple versions of Les Mis and other things.

1409
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:33,680
Like, I don't know about his other musicals of how easy those are

1410
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,320
to find some version.

1411
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:38,040
I think so many things. There's PBS. Right. Right.

1412
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:42,200
Like somebody today at some point, they did it sort of as a special. Yeah.

1413
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,120
And the NBC should do a live version.

1414
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:48,200
Oh, yeah. Sure. And all the wiping out. Yeah.

1415
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,880
Like famous people hurting themselves. Oh, yeah.

1416
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:55,600
Well, kind of and kind of like contacting performers

1417
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,200
without foot like where they'll say, oh, yeah, what is it?

1418
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,920
Yeah, I'll do it. I'll do a live musical thing.

1419
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,680
And then they get there and like, sorry, I'm doing what now?

1420
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:06,800
How many weeks of skating rehearsal?

1421
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,200
Bieber is like, uh,

1422
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,640
you're the first one. This was a two day gig.

1423
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,800
In my mind, they they called Richard Karn.

1424
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,400
I don't know why

1425
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,560
you're kind of like, oh, hey, just a few, a few quick questions.

1426
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,760
Now, once is I skate on a stage.

1427
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,960
What does that was ever for to pretend with my feet? Right.

1428
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:35,920
Amy also sent us the the YouTube channel is Wade in the Wings.

1429
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,600
And the video is called Andrew Lloyd Webber's Crazy Train Musical.

1430
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:45,600
And I think this account is like a, you know, video essay channel about,

1431
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,640
you know, plays and musicals and stuff.

1432
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,360
So so like Defunctland for shows,

1433
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:55,760
which I say Defunctland thanked in the opening credits of this video

1434
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,160
as a supporter. So check out that channel.

1435
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,200
That's a good chain. Yeah. Yeah.

1436
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,680
I think now going to be all I watch.

1437
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:07,320
Did you guys get into the two versions like the two different album versions?

1438
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:10,080
Because the song I mentioned, he whistled at me.

1439
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,120
There's two versions of it.

1440
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,680
OK, I don't know. I don't know any of this breakdown.

1441
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:19,480
Do you mean that there is a cast album, but that then they did kind of a more

1442
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:24,040
let's aim for the pop charts and Phil Ramone, who I forget exactly who that is.

1443
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,560
But that's like a rock producer. Right.

1444
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:31,760
Well, so so what and in Apple Music, at least, there's the original version,

1445
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,560
which is listed as the year 1984.

1446
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:40,280
And then there's an album version listed as 1993 called the New Starlight Express.

1447
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,560
Oh, this isn't what I was talking about.

1448
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,880
And it's like a more streamlined feeling show.

1449
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,760
A lot of the some a lot of the songs are gone.

1450
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,320
And then some of the songs are shorter

1451
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:54,040
and like and kind of reworked like he'll whistle at me is totally different

1452
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:56,160
version than the original whistle me.

1453
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,320
Now, I like both. He'll whistle at me.

1454
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:03,640
Not maybe not equally, but close to equally lay out some stuff about he whistled at me.

1455
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:04,880
This is this is Pearl.

1456
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,000
This is the primary role. Yes.

1457
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,760
And now, I guess if you think about it, and I know there was some people said the show,

1458
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,360
I think a version of the show people were saying was sexist.

1459
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,080
And then Lloyd Webber wanted to go in and fix it.

1460
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,320
So I guess, yeah, maybe cat calling isn't

1461
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,600
isn't not sexist, but whistle trains.

1462
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,480
It's clever. So I think you get around it.

1463
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,240
Oh, all right.

1464
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,000
No, I guess. Oh, OK.

1465
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,680
I mean, I think really it's just like saying hello or being interested.

1466
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,400
It's really what the song is.

1467
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,920
That's how trains talk. Right.

1468
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,440
Yeah, I got Thomas on all the time.

1469
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:41,600
He whistles when he it's like how characters break into song

1470
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,400
when there's nothing left to say.

1471
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,920
You start to sing and that's that's Thomas going, whoo, whoo.

1472
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,280
Yeah. Now, there is the voice.

1473
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,800
There is the whistle in he whistled at me.

1474
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,480
And it's hilarious.

1475
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,360
Oh, I do remember that. OK.

1476
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,920
And you got it. So, yes.

1477
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:00,080
Again, this is another one song where I started and I went, oh, God, what is it?

1478
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,840
What are we going here?

1479
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,840
And then it starts the beat kicks in and I go, well, wait a minute.

1480
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,920
So you get a penalty.

1481
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,840
Rusty, unconnected penalty.

1482
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:12,160
So you get that. You're like, OK, all right.

1483
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,000
What are we doing here?

1484
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,440
It's a lot like pan. I got to say.

1485
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,360
And that's like slow.

1486
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,880
When they finish, they ramp up and then.

1487
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,560
There's that crazy noise.

1488
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,840
It's got like an is it an 808?

1489
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,840
It's like a really great snare drum.

1490
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,680
This is like it's Madonna.

1491
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:36,960
Yes, exactly.

1492
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,040
So wait till this chorus when the chorus kicked in, I went, OK, we got a winner here.

1493
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,600
You're right. I was confused.

1494
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,720
This is better. Here we go.

1495
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,120
That's good. That's good.

1496
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:57,080
They got that little ramp up.

1497
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,920
That noise is so funny. That's insane.

1498
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,120
It's hard to imagine.

1499
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:11,240
It's a little weaker at that time.

1500
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:14,800
Losing whistle steam.

1501
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,800
But the sounds, all the sounds of the production are all the stuff we like.

1502
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,120
Like it's right in the zone.

1503
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:24,080
You know what it's like is the Mickey.

1504
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,280
She's got a crush on you.

1505
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,400
100 percent it is.

1506
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,800
And it's got it's like everything is like the chorus is a little weak,

1507
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:33,560
but compared to every most everything else on there, it's like a perfect pop song.

1508
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:34,840
It's a little weak.

1509
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,120
But with the choo choos are insane.

1510
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,440
You're getting a green day.

1511
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,640
You're throwing out perfect, pretty handily.

1512
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,880
I'm saying compared to the rest of the show.

1513
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,080
Yeah, I'm saying like compared to the rest of it.

1514
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,720
You go, well, this is like a perfect pop song like yours.

1515
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:52,120
It's like you got out of the hot tub and you got into like, you know, the water is

1516
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,800
the water feels perfect because you've been submerged.

1517
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:59,640
Yeah. But there's a new the newer version is a slow version,

1518
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,360
which I also think is pretty good.

1519
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:04,880
It's just short, but it never kicks into the like disco thing.

1520
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:09,080
But it's a little bit more of a like, I don't know, a slow kind of a thing.

1521
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,040
But the singer, I really like the singer on this one.

1522
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,640
Revo Rice.

1523
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:20,560
Oh, she was the one that in that video, they said she's she was a performer

1524
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,320
who had skated since she was a child.

1525
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,400
So she was kind of like a head of the made for this show. Yeah.

1526
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,840
I will hear that.

1527
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,680
I like her voice a lot. Yeah, yeah.

1528
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:42,120
I will hear the distant call and then he'll whistle at me.

1529
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:46,000
This is like Whitney or something.

1530
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,080
Yes. Yeah, it's great.

1531
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,880
For again, for the show. Yeah.

1532
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,960
I'm going to get you to me.

1533
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,960
I'm going to get you to me.

1534
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,680
So fun. So dumb.

1535
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,920
So anyway, I like I think both of those are really good.

1536
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,120
I would I those will end up on playlist someone, I think you're going to.

1537
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,360
You'll keep listening to despite it having.

1538
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,640
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

1539
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,040
I got a lot of stuff I listen to.

1540
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:16,000
Can I talk about the rap?

1541
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,040
Yeah. Yeah, you can.

1542
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:19,800
Fortunately, you can do that.

1543
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,840
So if you are thinking to yourself, hmm,

1544
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:28,160
the early 1980s and a British writer,

1545
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,760
British musical theater and presario,

1546
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,720
what does he think rap is?

1547
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,720
And I do have an answer to that.

1548
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:39,240
I'm going to try to jump around in this to to prove my point.

1549
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:46,920
A lot.

1550
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,480
That's right. That's true.

1551
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,720
OK, girl, I'm with you.

1552
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:05,480
Hey, yes, you must have.

1553
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:14,240
OK, so this isn't so much a rap says so much as the song Rock Island

1554
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:18,280
that opens the music man where a bunch of traveling salesmen

1555
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,960
are riding a train and they're going

1556
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:27,440
they're they're singing about selling items and about like, you know,

1557
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:30,560
you can't you can't sell on credit anymore.

1558
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,720
You're saying that the the the the subject matter.

1559
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,680
No, I'm just saying like the vibe like that.

1560
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,320
And it's a better.

1561
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,320
Yeah, I'm going to try to find Rock Island

1562
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,840
to usually played at the end of the overture.

1563
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:48,000
So but I'm just going to see if I can catch them.

1564
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,320
Oh, you just wanted to get this on here.

1565
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:54,200
So I got to get music man into the show.

1566
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,080
Jason's clothes turned into a sailor suit.

1567
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,160
Chorn by the stove.

1568
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:00,200
Change the approach of the traveling salesmen made it pretty hard.

1569
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,280
No, it didn't. No, it didn't.

1570
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,760
But you've got to know the territory.

1571
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:07,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh rearrangement.

1572
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:11,160
It's just people like chanting rhythmically at each other.

1573
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,640
Yeah. Yeah. More what the rap is.

1574
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:14,880
Because there's little rap.

1575
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,600
This is a little like Tink Tink does not make it rap. Yeah.

1576
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,000
Are you saying the music man invented rap?

1577
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,200
Yes. Meredith Wilson invented rap.

1578
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,200
Oh, I didn't know.

1579
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:33,280
The main the title song, that seems like the one that anybody knows.

1580
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,400
I sort of knew the melody. Yeah, I did, too.

1581
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,760
Starlight, Starlight Express.

1582
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:39,840
Fine. It's OK.

1583
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,480
I don't. Hey, I don't dislike it. Yeah.

1584
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:43,960
But it's not so it's not as good as like memory.

1585
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,920
No, no. Here's I get memory.

1586
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,240
A quick hit.

1587
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:54,120
Jason played his musical alley, the music man.

1588
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:57,400
I have this is I was like, I don't I don't know how much I like any of this.

1589
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:01,160
And then I discovered there's an album where they did like a pop version of it.

1590
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:04,440
That's what I was saying with the pop producer and the song,

1591
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,480
which I don't love when it's in kind of showtune mode.

1592
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:10,280
Starlight Express.

1593
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:13,920
I'm less into it than it was covered on this by L.

1594
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:17,760
Debarge, one of my favorite 80s R&B dudes.

1595
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:21,240
Oddly, in fact, only this song produced by Jay Graydon,

1596
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:24,120
my literal favorite 70s, 80s producer,

1597
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:27,600
how played the guitar solo on Steely Dan's Peg. Legend. Great.

1598
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:32,360
Quick hit of this. This is like, oh, all right, I could deal with this big time.

1599
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:51,120
Starlight Express.

1600
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:54,200
Starlight Express.

1601
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,800
Are you real?

1602
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,680
Yes or no?

1603
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,760
Oh, and the cover also, look at that.

1604
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:02,960
I look at that. Oh, wow.

1605
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,120
That's good. Yeah.

1606
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:08,440
Like now, if it was all like this, I think I'd be I'd be fully on board.

1607
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,080
Meanwhile, can I?

1608
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,920
I'm going to text you guys an image.

1609
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:16,760
This is what when you play Spotify on a TV that with this album,

1610
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:18,680
this is what you're looking at.

1611
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:23,840
And this is a ALW's, how he comes up on Spotify.

1612
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,800
Just a picture of him looking concerned.

1613
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,520
It's just yes.

1614
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:31,960
Angela Weber in front of a mixing board looking concerned.

1615
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:36,440
But the Starlight Express, the album art is so small and he is just

1616
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:39,360
massive on TV.

1617
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,200
Look into my sunken eyes.

1618
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:46,200
My so many years of trying to make my train thing turn me to this.

1619
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:50,040
I so that's fine.

1620
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:53,720
But and then like, yeah, it does start to I'd written some of I think

1621
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,840
some of the songs, CB is good.

1622
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,400
Yeah, CB is pretty good.

1623
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,520
He's a little yeah, I don't have to play all of them.

1624
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:03,320
I this is called No Comeback.

1625
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,840
That's a little bit of a of a jam.

1626
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,840
Where's that one?

1627
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:10,560
Um, I mean, I recall anything on the way,

1628
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:14,520
but I think what I mainly want to talk about is the very final song.

1629
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:17,440
But by all means, jump to anything we haven't hit.

1630
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,120
Those are the ones I played that I was the most excited about.

1631
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,760
There was a one that's early that reminds me of Elton John.

1632
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:27,160
And I'm now I'm forgetting which one, which I think it's on the first album.

1633
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:27,960
It's.

1634
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,160
I think it's pumping iron.

1635
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,120
Yeah, yeah.

1636
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:33,920
It's.

1637
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:39,280
This is a very like, well, this is because.

1638
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,600
That's like, like, yeah, did you do?

1639
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,160
Like the way he sees it?

1640
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:51,360
Well, I think Greaseball was intended to be.

1641
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,320
Well, as with that, I think he was intended to be sort of an Elvis,

1642
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:00,560
even though that rolling stock is not quite that.

1643
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:07,920
I mean, the way I can I go to the last song or the other one?

1644
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:11,600
The there's a I think recently this

1645
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:17,000
is one thing that popularized this with kind of like snarky Twitter world

1646
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,320
was this one Twitter thread by somebody named Josie Campbell.

1647
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,960
And all right, let's go back.

1648
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,040
Remember that hat on the hat?

1649
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:27,200
Remember that all these romance songs were dreamed up by a child. Yeah.

1650
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,560
And she did this.

1651
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:33,680
So Josie did a really funny thread about just like, can I?

1652
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,720
It was when Katz was out, like, right.

1653
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:37,280
Everyone's obsessed with our crazy cats is.

1654
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,480
But can I remind you how crazy Starlight Express is?

1655
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,000
And this is one this this really caught my eye, which she said here.

1656
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,520
There are a ton of races and rusty sabotage,

1657
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:50,560
and then everyone argues about the rules and then rusty wins the next one.

1658
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,800
And then the bad guy gets into a wreck and then all the trains

1659
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:59,640
refuse to race anymore and rebel against the child having the dream.

1660
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:04,280
The end. And I I was so confused.

1661
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:08,160
Like, what? How does that manifest itself exactly?

1662
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,840
And it does in this form.

1663
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,680
This is in the song Light at the End of the Tunnel,

1664
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,920
which is kind of like the big showstopper,

1665
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:22,200
a little bit of lead up to the moment where the trains become sentient and rebel.

1666
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,760
But here's the first.

1667
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,360
You could be converted.

1668
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:33,320
What do you mean?

1669
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:37,800
Rebuild with a new and better form of power.

1670
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:41,680
You mean I could be converted to steel.

1671
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:44,640
You're cool.

1672
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:48,000
And this is oh, my God.

1673
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,800
I could you could jury do my interior.

1674
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,480
More modern furniture, please.

1675
01:25:55,880 --> 01:26:00,600
I'll see if it's in the budget to do so.

1676
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,600
Those lyrics have made like millions of dollars.

1677
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:07,080
Yeah, decades that people lined up

1678
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,160
in many countries for many years.

1679
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:14,040
Yes, shouldn't be problem.

1680
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:18,360
How long will it take to ballpark the time?

1681
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:21,680
But five to seven beers in his days.

1682
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:27,200
Now, this is like the the conversational verse of like

1683
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,880
sorry with the fringe on top where it's like,

1684
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,960
does it really have two white horses?

1685
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:36,200
One's like, oh, God, what is it?

1686
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,080
It's like one's like,

1687
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:45,000
Melk, the others more like that, like, hey, you know,

1688
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,760
where the melody is going.

1689
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:48,840
Where are you going with this song?

1690
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,680
Yeah, they're kind of just seeing talking.

1691
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:56,400
It seems like a real musical cop out to like that's what Macfarlane

1692
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,200
was talking about, I think a lot of the time.

1693
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,120
I mean, there's also a weird thing.

1694
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:02,800
And this happens in a lot of musicals where it's like, again,

1695
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,760
we got like a British guy

1696
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:11,280
who's like lewd and quail, lewd ratio, quail, lewd and cocaine ratios

1697
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,480
are off balance.

1698
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,480
And that's how we started writing train musicals.

1699
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:19,720
Is that so? Before we start saying, was that wherever you have a coke problem?

1700
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,280
That's just my guess. It's an IPD.

1701
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,360
I'm going to look it up.

1702
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:23,560
Don't want to slander.

1703
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,120
Coke ratio is off.

1704
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:30,560
There's the thing of like, OK, you're a middle age British guy.

1705
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:33,600
And you're like, and this one's going to be a gospel number.

1706
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:37,800
You know, you all know what I mean, right?

1707
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,440
Wink. And it's like, all right, man.

1708
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,440
I don't know if you're supposed to be doing that.

1709
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,560
I think somebody somebody threw it out there that he was

1710
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:49,480
doing cocaine while he made cats, but I'm not sure if it's actually verified.

1711
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:54,480
OK, I'm just talking more of an 80s vibe that that was the 80s vibe.

1712
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,360
I just have steam.

1713
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,080
Steam is plenty for me.

1714
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:00,000
Steve, Steve,

1715
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,600
diesel. My best friend is Robert L.

1716
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,120
All right. The rest of this.

1717
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,360
And you've been the.

1718
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:14,640
Come on.

1719
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,320
Must obey control.

1720
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:19,640
Engines must obey control.

1721
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,960
Do what you're told.

1722
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:22,920
Shut it.

1723
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,120
Control.

1724
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,240
Diesel is for unbelievable.

1725
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,520
So, yeah, that.

1726
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:31,840
So the play culminates with all of the trains in the child's dream,

1727
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,560
telling him to shut it.

1728
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,600
And now they have free will.

1729
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,240
That's like Lloyd Webber's self-loathing coming out.

1730
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:40,680
He knew that this train obsession was unhealthy.

1731
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,680
You know, if I'm playing psychologist here.

1732
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:46,840
Oh, maybe he wanted the trains to tell him to shut up.

1733
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,120
That's what he wanted. He knew he was haunted by those trains.

1734
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:55,880
I want to stop pursuing these shows, but the trains in my brain make me insane.

1735
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:59,600
Mommy, I love the trains, but I also hate the trains.

1736
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:02,520
And that song goes exactly where you think it would go.

1737
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:03,360
Yeah.

1738
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:08,360
I did. I also wrote down the note.

1739
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:11,120
The trains tell the kid to shut up.

1740
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,680
Question mark. Like that was one of the last things.

1741
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,760
But I'm not sure the album.

1742
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,640
And I'm like, yeah, all right.

1743
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,920
I'm going to put my shoes on and get my bag together.

1744
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,920
I got record.

1745
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,400
And on that note, on that note.

1746
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:28,920
So that's it's kind of the show, but then all these different songs

1747
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,000
slide in and out.

1748
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,640
It's extremely expensive, but it's the talk of the town.

1749
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:40,040
I think it was I think it worked with audiences to some extent on and off.

1750
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:42,600
More so in England. Maybe didn't work great here.

1751
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,640
Lost the Tonys almost entirely.

1752
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,200
They made a costume design.

1753
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,400
They made a 90 minute Vegas version, too.

1754
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,280
Yeah, made it more of it.

1755
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,640
This is a thing I'm interested in.

1756
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:52,600
I know this happens a lot.

1757
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,400
It's like, let's cut that thing down.

1758
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,440
Right. Let's just make it like a concert, essentially.

1759
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,680
Which is what they were talking about doing, Spider-Man.

1760
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,240
And they never did.

1761
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:03,360
Oh, I was so in place for it.

1762
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:04,360
I know. That's what I thought.

1763
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:05,160
I was like, oh, good.

1764
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,280
Like, but obviously, like some numbers didn't add up.

1765
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,040
Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, that's what they were.

1766
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,000
They were like, all right, we're moving.

1767
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,080
We're moving this thing to Vegas.

1768
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:14,640
Vegas one was also Christmas.

1769
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:15,520
Now it's Christmas. Oh, yeah.

1770
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:19,560
If we didn't have they put a Santa hat on top of all the other hats.

1771
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:23,200
And and by the way, this was at the Las Vegas Hilton, the soon.

1772
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,000
Oh, I didn't know of it.

1773
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Never intersected.

1774
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,400
But like a couple of years later was Star Trek the experience.

1775
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,360
Yes, I did. I did the math.

1776
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,800
I was double checking what I heard it was at the Hilton.

1777
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:37,640
Because imagine if doesn't do it in one hotel you could do.

1778
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:39,680
Yeah. Yeah.

1779
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:41,720
Oh, what the happiest place on earth.

1780
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:45,120
Yeah. I on the Vegas point,

1781
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:48,040
I think there's a lot of crossover seemingly between people who are fascinated

1782
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:50,280
by Starlight Express and this other thing.

1783
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,640
EFX, is that the correct name?

1784
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:53,880
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1785
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:57,720
It was a very like I think it was I think it's a show that existed in other forms.

1786
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:01,360
But I remember it being at the MGM Grand and being up on the big sign

1787
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,320
at the MGM Grand in the 90s.

1788
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:05,640
And like David Cassidy was in it.

1789
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,000
And it's another I could not tell you anything about it.

1790
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,120
Maybe he is a bandana.

1791
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:12,440
I what are any facts about EFX?

1792
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,560
It just seems like that's a cousin.

1793
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:18,880
Maybe we need to do maybe a dive into whatever is going on.

1794
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:21,680
This looks familiar, but I have no I don't know what it is.

1795
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,840
Do you can you you're looking at an image or so?

1796
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:28,280
Is there anything you want to venture a guess in people who know will tell us

1797
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:29,000
we're way off?

1798
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,040
It looks like he's it's David Cassidy of Partridge Family fame.

1799
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:36,040
And it says at the top of the poster, it says miss it.

1800
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,840
And you miss Las Vegas.

1801
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:40,080
EFX and then a picture of the MGM Grand.

1802
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:44,080
And then he's sort of in a kind of not a well, a line of people, not a course line.

1803
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:47,400
He's kind of got like the greatest, great, greatest showman like

1804
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:50,760
Ringmaster outfit with a hat off.

1805
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:53,240
So like that feels like it's part of it.

1806
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,720
And then if you scroll through the YouTube video and he's wearing,

1807
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:01,080
like, definitely like a ringmaster jacket and there's like giant heads,

1808
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:04,000
there's like giant statue heads surrounding him.

1809
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:09,120
It's all very and they're all kind of white and babyish and scary.

1810
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,400
It's all a little bit like never ending story.

1811
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,480
Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.

1812
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:15,960
And if you scroll through, it says Rick Springfield and EFX alive.

1813
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:17,280
Oh, my God.

1814
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,760
Did Rick Springfield take over for David Cassidy?

1815
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,120
Incredible cast. Whoa.

1816
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,000
All right.

1817
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:28,640
Well, audience, if you know, please affirm if EFX is worth looking into.

1818
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:30,240
Michael Crawford. Oh, my God.

1819
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:32,520
No, there's no way it's not starring Tommy Toon.

1820
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:38,560
I think you're the only person under 60 years old

1821
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:42,840
who would ever say starring Tommy Toon with that degree of excitement.

1822
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:44,880
For the show's purposes.

1823
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:48,320
There's multiple posters of EFX starring Tommy Toon.

1824
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:53,080
Wow. If anyone if you know what Michael Crawford looks like from this

1825
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:55,800
or from Phantom or anything, just know he he's the celebrity

1826
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,000
who most closely resembles my father.

1827
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,200
So just if you're looking at a picture of Michael Crawford,

1828
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:03,560
now you maybe know what what my dad looks like.

1829
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:04,480
Wow. Vintage.

1830
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,880
I'm looking at him now. That freaks me out.

1831
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,800
Vintage Rick Springfield, the effects alive shirt for seventy dollars on Etsy.

1832
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:12,800
And he's got the guitar in one hand,

1833
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,040
and he's got kind of a pirate type shirt on.

1834
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,960
What? What is it?

1835
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:20,640
I don't know. Like, I mean, it sounds like a lot of the Vegas

1836
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:22,840
kind of review shows now.

1837
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:25,920
Nowadays, I think they lean more heavily towards burlesque

1838
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:29,800
or circ influence.

1839
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:35,320
But there's always some sort of like Mulan Rugey.

1840
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:39,360
Yeah, like a rock show, rock review.

1841
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:42,360
But there's that showgirls element.

1842
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,280
Yeah, there's the standards element.

1843
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:45,600
Tony and Tina's wedding.

1844
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,280
It all gets matched up.

1845
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,840
And everything else. Yeah.

1846
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,760
You just wanted to say that. Yeah, I did.

1847
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:54,880
That's what you mutter in your sleep.

1848
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,440
I've never seen it. I haven't either.

1849
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:58,680
We'll do that one, too. Oh, yeah.

1850
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:01,000
That's a show where like people sit on your lap, right?

1851
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:01,680
That's an inner.

1852
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:06,120
It's like a dinner theater show where you are part of the show. Yeah. Right.

1853
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:07,920
Other versions of this.

1854
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:15,120
This was done in 1987 and 1988 in Tokyo and Osaka in stadiums,

1855
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:18,280
in the round and with double the skaters.

1856
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:23,240
So knowing the aesthetic of I don't know if it was at the Tokyo Dome,

1857
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:24,960
the city that we both went to.

1858
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,920
Yeah, cool. If I'm like, oh, my God, a late 80s

1859
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,760
Japan version of this would have ruled.

1860
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,000
I mean, that's yeah. Tokyo Dome is like they do baseball games in there.

1861
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,800
They do big one a year wrestling events there.

1862
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,520
But that's a massive place.

1863
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,080
Double the may of me.

1864
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:45,360
If you look at the skaters of Tokyo Dome, Starlight Express, let's see.

1865
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:46,240
Could have been. I don't know.

1866
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:49,320
There's other arenas. That's just what I sure, sure. Imagine.

1867
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,200
Yeah, I don't.

1868
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:54,080
Hmm. I don't sure. It's not coming up immediately. So.

1869
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:58,680
There's a version on ice that was attempted, a touring version.

1870
01:34:58,680 --> 01:34:59,920
This failed for some reason.

1871
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,920
We do not want Starlight Express definitively.

1872
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:05,000
No, it's not ice. It is skates.

1873
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:09,680
Then there's been versions where there's a big screen and you get 3D glasses

1874
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:14,320
and all of the races are represented by or there's like a just that component

1875
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:18,040
of 3D movies to enhance the race, which apparently there are many.

1876
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:21,320
This is again, audience cut us some slack if you know the show very well,

1877
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:23,720
because I don't know what's going on besides the songs

1878
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:26,120
because you can't find them almost anywhere.

1879
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,600
Or it's so many versions to sift through.

1880
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:33,800
But I think a lot of races is what people kept iterating.

1881
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:40,400
So fascinating, weird, bizarre, on and on.

1882
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,200
Didn't really wasn't a big hit in America,

1883
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,400
the hit in England, but it kind of ran its course.

1884
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:50,480
But something that you said, Jason, the last time this came up on the show,

1885
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:55,760
that there is one place where this is a staple,

1886
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:58,240
where it's part of the culture now.

1887
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:01,400
I it's just so.

1888
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:04,320
It's just so odd.

1889
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,480
The details are so weird.

1890
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,400
Bochum, Germany, Bochum, Bochum.

1891
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:14,800
It's hard to it's kind of I think it's sort of central Germany.

1892
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:18,160
I put everything near Dusseldorf because I live, I studied abroad there.

1893
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:20,360
And it's like 40 minutes north of that.

1894
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:25,760
Don't know much about Bochum, but it opened in 1988 there and it never closed.

1895
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:30,120
The same like one continuous mostly.

1896
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:34,200
That's what I that's that's the the stat they want to say is that.

1897
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:39,920
But it did close and everyone was so sad that it closed.

1898
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,600
There was a closing night where like everyone was bereft.

1899
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,080
How can this be? We can't let this happen.

1900
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:50,840
Please, if you were a financier willing to help this show go on.

1901
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:55,680
And then the city itself stepped in and said, we will help finance this.

1902
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:57,440
We will make this happen.

1903
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,120
And eventually the financiers were found.

1904
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:03,960
And since then, it is all so this was like this is very this is what movies,

1905
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,760
old movies about Broadway shows are.

1906
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:06,920
But we got to save the show.

1907
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:08,920
We got to put on a show and save the theater.

1908
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:12,120
That happened in Germany for this roller skating train musical.

1909
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:13,920
They're obsessed with it.

1910
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,640
Yes. And we're missing one important detail.

1911
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:20,920
It's it is staged in a purpose built theater.

1912
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:24,160
Only for this built for this.

1913
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:25,680
Yeah. Yeah. I love this.

1914
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,760
Reminds me so much of a thing.

1915
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:32,000
I've somehow we have not covered on the show an Orlando oddity

1916
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,320
that at some point in time, and it's a cousin of Pirates

1917
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,240
Dinner Adventure, Medieval Times or whatever.

1918
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:39,600
But for a while in Orlando, there was an American Gladiators Theater

1919
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:42,080
that now is a megachurch.

1920
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:44,000
Yeah. What the hell else do we do with this?

1921
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,360
But that reminds me like, oh, my God, it's this it's the Starlight Express.

1922
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,560
Like we built them a rink.

1923
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:51,560
It's only for Starlight Express.

1924
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:54,560
And with that, OK, this is all right.

1925
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:59,880
If I've sounded mixed on this show and would I have enjoyed this one or that one?

1926
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:01,800
You know, I don't know. I don't know where I fall.

1927
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:03,160
And I don't mean to insult the thing.

1928
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:07,520
But the more that I see footage of or hear about the Germany show,

1929
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:10,560
I think this that's a this is what I want to see.

1930
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:15,960
OK, seems so good and so immersive and committed to

1931
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:20,480
like you just the you're not even in the show yet.

1932
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:22,880
The lobby is a Victorian train station.

1933
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:25,760
And and there's buffet carts for snacks.

1934
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:30,440
There's bronze statues of the characters, an old flip down departure board

1935
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:34,040
that lists the cast that night's like you're in an old station.

1936
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:38,120
And then the stage is more like sports arena than proscenium arch.

1937
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:43,160
Hydraulic bridges, lasers, a triple level racetrack seats on four levels,

1938
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:47,800
including fully rotating swivel chairs for audience members in the pit.

1939
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,880
You're flipping around. They're going all around.

1940
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:54,480
Like and then the footage of that, I saw a clip where

1941
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:58,000
this looked like 40 miles per hour to me, maybe more than 40.

1942
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,240
And the guy there's pyro shooting out of the skates.

1943
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,240
This, I think this is the shit.

1944
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:07,120
I think the Germany production because it just gets a little.

1945
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:10,120
I think it must have been weird to watch this in a theater

1946
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:13,640
and in spaces that weren't meant for it in the Broadway one.

1947
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:18,440
They had to remove 10 rows of seats to get it to the way they wanted to.

1948
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:22,120
But they built an arena that's only for this dumb musical.

1949
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:24,880
That's like a human monster truck show or something.

1950
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:27,240
Yeah, yeah, it's true.

1951
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,960
You're like, oh, my God, this is some sort of spectacle.

1952
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:32,840
This is not about maybe the details of the lyrics,

1953
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:35,840
the lyrical content of the show as much as it is about, oh, my God,

1954
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:36,920
what are we watching?

1955
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:37,920
I think it forgives a lot.

1956
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,720
Well, you're getting now it's getting closer to roller derby.

1957
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:43,480
Like, yeah, it's roller derby with a story. Yeah.

1958
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,720
It feels right that it's a hit in Germany.

1959
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:48,840
It just feels right.

1960
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:50,760
Like David Hasselhoff.

1961
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:54,840
I mean, I would pass off Starlight Express, but how did he not?

1962
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,920
He would be perfect singing Rolling Star. Yeah.

1963
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,440
There's yeah, there's not like sort of than me.

1964
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:01,920
It's been like enunciation.

1965
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:05,360
There's not some like German variety show he was on where he sang it or something.

1966
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:06,480
Yeah, it's got to be some.

1967
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:09,640
Over on your you know, your audience. Yeah.

1968
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,720
David, they'd go ape shit.

1969
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:13,920
You're doing Starlight Express.

1970
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:14,760
Do you know all that?

1971
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:15,600
Do you or not all?

1972
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:16,880
But you know, have you?

1973
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,640
How many albums does Hasselhoff have?

1974
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:20,440
I don't know that I couldn't.

1975
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:22,920
I'm vaguely aware of the body of work. Yeah.

1976
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:23,920
They're all insane.

1977
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:26,680
I mean, they're interesting to listen to, but that's like,

1978
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:32,840
you know, that's like eating the sugary pie for every meal of the day.

1979
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:37,160
Like I tap out pretty quickly. Yeah.

1980
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:40,600
You know, he's got the answer is a lot of the answer is a lot.

1981
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:47,240
I I have an Andrew Lloyd Webber sort of story, which is

1982
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:51,240
I was I've been listening to recently.

1983
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:54,720
There's a Patti LuPone live record from the 90s.

1984
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:57,520
And she talks throughout it.

1985
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:00,080
But at the beginning, she says, you know,

1986
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:02,400
it's it's great to be performing in Los Angeles.

1987
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,480
I've lived here for a while now.

1988
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:09,400
And this is kind of a goodbye for now because I'm going for two years.

1989
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:13,280
I'm going to live in London and then New York to do Andrew Lloyd Webber's

1990
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:16,960
Sunset Boulevard, which he made a musical version of Sunset Boulevard.

1991
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,400
And then I started reading about the musical version of Sunset Boulevard.

1992
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:24,800
The actress Gloria Swanson, the original Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard,

1993
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:28,720
tried to make a musical out of it that had happy or end it.

1994
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:32,000
That didn't happen because Paramount only ever gave her

1995
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,920
gave her a handshake deal to use the rights and they couldn't figure it out. Oh.

1996
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:41,000
At one point in time, someone approached young Steven Sondheim

1997
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:44,400
about making a musical.

1998
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:48,920
And he saw Billy Wilder, an old Billy Wilder at a party and said,

1999
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:51,280
What what do you think about this idea?

2000
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:55,080
Billy Wilder says, no, absolutely not.

2001
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:59,160
If you are going to make it into music, it's got to be an opera

2002
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:02,000
because this is a big operatic.

2003
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,880
This is a big, crazy character.

2004
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:06,040
So Steven Sondheim never does it.

2005
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:08,080
But who does do it?

2006
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:11,200
The king of the operatic musicals, Mr.

2007
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:15,000
Andrew Lloyd Webber, a DAP sunset boulevard in the 90s.

2008
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Yeah. Have you heard it?

2009
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,040
I've never heard that one.

2010
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:20,880
I have heard bits and pieces of it.

2011
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:25,840
My mom had there was like a best of Andrew Lloyd Webber album

2012
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:30,160
that I think everyone gave their mom for Christmas in the 90s.

2013
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:33,520
And I would listen to the title song on there.

2014
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:37,880
Hmm. My mom, not a Lloyd Webber fan, but a Big Rogers and Hammerstein fan.

2015
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,480
Oh, sure. Yeah.

2016
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:42,960
Not sure where my mom, she loves musicals, but I've never we've never discussed

2017
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:44,600
Starlight Express.

2018
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:45,440
Yeah, I know.

2019
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,840
There's no way my mom knows anything about Starlight Express.

2020
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,960
Yeah, yeah.

2021
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:51,960
She was not like a Phantom fan or anything.

2022
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:54,760
She I was just a kid,

2023
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:58,520
a little nerdy musical kid without a country because the other kids

2024
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:02,480
who really liked musicals, I remember, were the ones who like the family.

2025
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,520
They went to New York. They came back from New York.

2026
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:10,560
They had their souvenir cats or Phantom giant photo book, and they clung to it.

2027
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:13,480
And I was like, well, my family doesn't really go to New York.

2028
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:16,880
But do you know what MGM Studios is?

2029
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:19,360
Do you know what Disney MGM Studios is?

2030
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:20,880
Because there's some musical stuff there.

2031
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:23,680
And then you can find those at the local video store.

2032
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,920
You try to within the niche.

2033
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:30,440
I like I like theme parks, so like roller coasters.

2034
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:33,240
No, I will see Starlight Parade is

2035
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:37,640
tributed in a ride that takes you through the history of the movies.

2036
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:41,600
No, no, no. It was more like they like musicals,

2037
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:44,600
but I don't know these musicals is what I'm saying.

2038
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:47,520
I'm trying to learn about musicals from elsewhere.

2039
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:52,480
Yeah, I was like or rent rent, of course, was huge in the in the later 90s.

2040
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:53,800
But you weren't hip to that stuff.

2041
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:55,560
But I wasn't hip to any of that stuff.

2042
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:56,920
No, no.

2043
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:58,920
So you all you had was saying, like,

2044
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:02,360
did you know that there's a fake Sunset Boulevard in Orlando?

2045
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:08,240
Yes. Or I would buy compilation CDs at like a department store

2046
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:11,680
of like Broadway in the 50s, Broadway in the 40s.

2047
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:13,320
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

2048
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:16,520
I just I looked I liked it when the turtles sang when I was young.

2049
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:18,000
And that was about it.

2050
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,120
That was at Radio City.

2051
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:21,600
That's in the vicinity.

2052
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,560
Yeah, Broadway. I know Broadway.

2053
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:25,480
Seen it. I've seen it on tape.

2054
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:26,520
It was the worst.

2055
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:31,240
And look, this thing and this is where the Germany stuff really

2056
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:33,840
kicks the stats just in.

2057
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,080
Oh, yeah. The hyperdrive,

2058
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:40,240
because this is on their website for the freestanding theater.

2059
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:44,960
Over 15 million people have been to see Starlight Express in Bochum, Germany.

2060
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:48,400
Starlight Express in general, all the productions have generated

2061
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:52,720
over one point four billion dollars in ticket sales.

2062
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:54,600
This is isn't it?

2063
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:57,920
It's like it's almost like invisible and that we knew it existed.

2064
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:00,320
We're like, oh, yeah, I think I've seen a picture that what are they?

2065
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,520
They like roast getting clowns. I don't know.

2066
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:06,320
Meanwhile, it's a religion in a German city,

2067
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:09,760
a religion to some of our audience members, perhaps. Yeah.

2068
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:14,600
And incredibly prof. Like, look, Andrew wasn't wrong.

2069
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:17,520
It is this is massive.

2070
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:22,560
This is a story that the story of which, by the way, then what is it?

2071
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:27,080
Rusty wants a girl, he gets her and wins and steam works.

2072
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:29,360
Actually, other trains start wanting steam conversions.

2073
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:30,960
They want to be in the steam.

2074
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:33,600
And that story, that's the story.

2075
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:37,040
Yeah. Yeah. Is this this beloved around the world?

2076
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:38,960
Oh, and I missed one Germany thing.

2077
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:43,200
The craziest fact that in they did.

2078
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:45,760
There was a German reality show.

2079
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:49,000
And the sole purpose of it was to find new

2080
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,320
cast members for this production of Starlight Express.

2081
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:56,120
Goodness. The show was called Musical Show Star 2008.

2082
01:45:56,120 --> 01:45:59,680
Who was Thomas the Tank, one of the judges

2083
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:02,320
or one of the Mr. Conductors?

2084
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:04,040
And is he I think Mr.

2085
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:06,120
Conductor would be a judgey Simon type.

2086
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:08,240
But Thomas would be a supportive Randy.

2087
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:10,640
Right, right, right. Well, Simon.

2088
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:12,960
Yeah. Was Simon could Simon play Mr. Conductor?

2089
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:14,680
Simon would be a good.

2090
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:16,880
Yeah, I don't know. Maybe a little too snide.

2091
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,800
You got to be going to be kind of jolly.

2092
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:21,680
Like Simon. Anyway, then they then they went.

2093
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:22,720
And here's the boy.

2094
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:26,200
This doesn't tell you the difficulty of the show that they got through it.

2095
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:29,480
And there were two winners chosen and one of them started getting into it.

2096
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:30,760
And it's like, actually, I never mind.

2097
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:32,920
I don't want to do it too hard. Too hard.

2098
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:37,720
It's like when someone on The Bachelor doesn't like to get divorced or something.

2099
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:39,360
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

2100
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,360
It's exciting. It's an exciting turn.

2101
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:44,080
But weird as the whole point of this. Yeah.

2102
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:47,160
Well, what do we what do we think?

2103
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:48,920
We've talked about it now.

2104
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:52,000
Do you like it more than before you knew anything about it?

2105
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:54,240
Or are we going to say I do like it more?

2106
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,600
Mm hmm. I like it more.

2107
01:46:56,600 --> 01:47:00,080
It's still a big mess as far as like.

2108
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:03,800
Yeah, the music's still kind of all over the place.

2109
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:04,400
I don't even know.

2110
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:07,240
I would have to see exactly what version they're doing in Germany.

2111
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:09,520
Maybe you're right. The German version is the ultimate version.

2112
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:15,080
There's enough ingredients in the stew for me to say I like it.

2113
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:17,280
I'll say that. I think so.

2114
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:19,200
I think I like that it's there.

2115
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:23,960
I have talked for a long time about wanting to go back to Dusseldorf and relive,

2116
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:26,560
like go back to the place I got to spend a really fun semester.

2117
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,960
If I did that, you got to do it.

2118
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:30,400
I think so. Yeah.

2119
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:34,680
I mean, it's also close to Fantasia land that we discovered and got to do it.

2120
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:36,000
The European vacation.

2121
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,560
I think now I would.

2122
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:41,360
That's that's the difference between me now and me at 20.

2123
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:46,720
I would go way out of my way to see to go to a weird Disney ripoff theme park

2124
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:50,160
and then go north to see a freestanding train musical.

2125
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:54,160
And now we've learned enough about it where, like I said,

2126
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:56,520
I'll go to almost any concert.

2127
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:00,320
Oh, yeah, I'll go see it and I'll get hyped for he whistled at me or whatever.

2128
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:03,080
I think I would, too. Yeah, I would, too.

2129
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:06,600
I think I think there'd be chills when rolling stock.

2130
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:09,560
Finally, the thing you describe, Mike, it certainly happens to me

2131
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:12,800
where like you're a little like, huh, and then it becomes your favorite thing.

2132
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:15,160
Yeah. As I was this.

2133
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:18,600
Aaron, as the week went on, is like, you're listening to rolling stock.

2134
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:22,400
I think I think you like it.

2135
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:25,080
No, no, I'm not a little train boy.

2136
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:27,880
I'm listening to it because it's funny. Yeah.

2137
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,560
It's for research.

2138
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:32,480
I excitedly ran into the house because I was listening to this in the car

2139
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:33,960
and I go, Lindsay, you got to hear this.

2140
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:35,680
You got to hear. He whistled at me.

2141
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:36,600
I was like, what do you think?

2142
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:38,760
She was like, oh, yeah, yeah, she got it.

2143
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:41,160
I mean, she wasn't as dismissive as I'm making it sound like she was.

2144
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:42,640
She was like, oh, no, that is good.

2145
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:45,240
Yeah, that's a sounds better than I thought.

2146
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:48,640
And she started reading the Wikipedia and was like, this is insane.

2147
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:50,600
What the hell?

2148
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:54,800
Yeah, I think I think one thing that that really makes it interesting

2149
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,800
is on paper mathematically.

2150
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:01,960
If you look at it from a certain angle, it does work that that book of musical

2151
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:06,960
like that musical encyclopedia says, like considered cats on roller skates.

2152
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:09,880
And it's like, well, cats is making money.

2153
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:11,440
He had a fist.

2154
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:13,960
So let's just do it again.

2155
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:16,880
But it's slow trains instead of little cats.

2156
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:19,560
Still a very confusing formula.

2157
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:21,000
Using it's easy.

2158
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,680
Make the cats trains.

2159
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:24,560
Make Cinderella train.

2160
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:27,520
But it's like when like the oh, what?

2161
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:32,600
Like a few months ago, like there was like a trade magazine

2162
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:36,000
article that was like, well, between Dr.

2163
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,080
Strange and everything everywhere all at once.

2164
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:43,480
But the theater going audience is crazy for multiverses.

2165
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:46,840
And everyone's like, no, what are you talking about?

2166
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:49,600
Like, it's just like someone who just missed the point.

2167
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,520
Jason, I don't want to get your rage up,

2168
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:54,280
but I might have to call that a five time.

2169
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:55,520
I think that's a five time.

2170
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:56,680
We're making it happen. It's a five timer.

2171
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:57,720
But that is the thing.

2172
01:49:57,720 --> 01:50:02,040
Like a trend happens and then they start like duplicating it.

2173
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:06,160
So like cats. So that's what happened when cats became trains.

2174
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:07,200
Cats became trains, though.

2175
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:09,720
It's obviously multiverse.

2176
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:11,440
But think about it.

2177
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:14,480
Cats was a like children, like a book of weird,

2178
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:17,560
fanciful little stories or little illustrations.

2179
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:23,080
He started with a little children's book about trains.

2180
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:26,520
It's kind of the same evolution.

2181
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:29,120
I don't want to get into an argument here.

2182
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:31,400
It takes a more circuitous path.

2183
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:34,960
I think I'm not going to say like, he just he just went through.

2184
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:38,400
He just did a fine and replace of cats to trains.

2185
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:42,600
I am shocked that it is the same guy, because it does seem like some,

2186
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:44,880
you know, dummy just copy it like.

2187
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:47,440
Well, I'm sure there were people going like, what about dogs?

2188
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:49,680
You know, make music about dogs.

2189
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:51,800
We should look into stuff like that, because I'm by the way,

2190
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:53,040
I'm still choking from earlier.

2191
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:56,120
But I bet there was an attempt at dogs somewhere.

2192
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:59,360
There had to be a dogs cars after this.

2193
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:01,320
There may be cars last year.

2194
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:03,400
It was a twinkle in Lasseter's eye.

2195
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:06,280
Maybe after this, he was like, oh, yeah, the trains talk.

2196
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:08,520
If this had hit cars for sure.

2197
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,400
Did Leno ever see Starlight Express?

2198
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:13,200
What did he think about it?

2199
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:14,280
Does he have a train?

2200
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:15,160
I don't know if it's up his alley.

2201
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:17,400
And does he have a train in the Big Dog garage?

2202
01:51:17,720 --> 01:51:18,920
I don't think he's into trains.

2203
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:19,840
Trains aren't cars.

2204
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,760
He's not a little he's not a little train boy.

2205
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:24,160
I know he's an all American car man.

2206
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:26,920
I understand that, but he likes the machinery.

2207
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:29,000
He likes the mechanics of it.

2208
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,120
So I bet he likes trains.

2209
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:32,200
He appreciates it, but it's kind of like.

2210
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:35,720
You know, he has a caboose in the Big Dog garage.

2211
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:37,560
You don't think there's just a caboose hanging out in there?

2212
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:38,880
I genuinely don't.

2213
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:42,920
I'd like to go along with you on this, but I think I think he is one.

2214
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:47,680
I think his heart belongs to cars and to any else that doesn't mind his wife.

2215
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:51,440
But mainly he's in love with cars.

2216
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:55,520
And if you have a space, I think a caboose is going to take up room.

2217
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:58,760
The two cars could occupy.

2218
01:51:58,760 --> 01:52:02,160
I bet there's been a caboose in the Big Dog garage at one point.

2219
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:04,680
I'm not saying there's one now, but I bet at one point

2220
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:07,160
there's been part of a train in the Big Dog garage.

2221
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:08,840
I will compromise with you.

2222
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:14,360
Maybe a train car that you can drive cars into and is used to transport cars.

2223
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:16,800
OK, cars have to be there.

2224
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,520
Like so there was a car in this, right?

2225
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,520
Because if there wasn't a car, get the fuck out.

2226
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:22,280
I hate train.

2227
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:24,400
What if we what if he hated trains?

2228
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:26,720
Yeah, maybe that's possible.

2229
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:28,560
He hates planes. He hates trains.

2230
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,640
Yeah, cars that are wiped them off the map.

2231
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:33,000
We've invented something better.

2232
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,440
Why do they still do trains?

2233
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:38,080
Started the job. Just deal the killing blow, you know?

2234
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:41,040
We got to get over there.

2235
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:42,880
Yeah, yeah. That's it. It's a themed environment.

2236
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,560
I think we'll find out anyway.

2237
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:45,640
I'm not going to stay on this.

2238
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:49,280
I'm going to I'm going to say this and just plan it like I'm going to throw a bomb

2239
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:50,160
and then we're going to get out.

2240
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:51,960
Oh, here's what it is. All right.

2241
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:54,160
I heard people referring to this play as horny.

2242
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:57,040
We talked about some of the what coupling refers to.

2243
01:52:57,240 --> 01:52:57,680
That's true.

2244
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:59,720
I googled the phrase Starlight Express horny.

2245
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:01,760
There is a lot of erotic fiction.

2246
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:05,040
Yeah. Vong stories about.

2247
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:11,280
And boy, do these the writers really give up on the idea that they are trains.

2248
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:15,360
It's so quickly is just like he caressed her breasts and like, hang on.

2249
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:18,240
You have to at least do a look.

2250
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:22,920
Andrew, Andrew turned the slippers into pistons.

2251
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:23,840
You got to do that. Yeah.

2252
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,640
Rest her piston.

2253
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:28,400
You have to figure out what train part is what body part.

2254
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:31,040
I don't want any of his filth trains don't have.

2255
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:33,920
Yeah, yeah. No, he.

2256
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:36,760
Well, OK, the train real quick, I know you said you're going to drop it

2257
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:37,520
and we're going to get out of here.

2258
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:40,600
But when the train, when the human is upright,

2259
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,320
is their stomach the undercarriage of the train?

2260
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:46,280
Yes. Right.

2261
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:46,920
I don't know.

2262
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:51,240
I don't know if I can say that exactly because some of the dancers in rolling stock

2263
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:53,400
had little train. Yeah, I know you're right.

2264
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:56,320
So I'm standing up is like they're

2265
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:59,720
it's as if the train car and they're actually on their wheels.

2266
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:02,960
I think that all of the dancers and skaters that we're seeing,

2267
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:06,720
we're supposed to be like fuzzing our brain, looking past them and seeing.

2268
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:07,960
Yeah, seeing the front.

2269
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:10,440
If they're yeah, if they're facing you, you're seeing the front of a train car.

2270
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:11,640
That's the idea. I think you're right.

2271
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:13,560
You're not this. They don't exist.

2272
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:16,640
There's no such thing as man train hybrids, though.

2273
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:19,200
I think that's what the stories are about.

2274
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:21,280
I think they want to see these.

2275
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:23,320
I think you're reading the people in these costumes.

2276
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:27,160
Yeah, you're reading people without as much imagination.

2277
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:30,880
There's got to be true slash fiction for Starlight Express,

2278
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:34,360
where the people are committed to the idea of the trains.

2279
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:37,000
Fucking well, yeah.

2280
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,600
I do. You guys know what archive of our own is?

2281
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:41,760
So that's what I saw.

2282
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:44,360
Yeah, it's a massive repository of.

2283
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:47,880
Do we have any in fiction stories about three of us on there yet?

2284
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,160
We don't want it.

2285
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:52,840
We I'm telling you, there's a lot of Starlight Express on here

2286
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:58,320
and a lot of these stories are the doughboys on it.

2287
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:00,960
I bet there's a doughboys piece of erotic fiction.

2288
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:03,280
I was friends with people who worked at crack.com,

2289
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:05,840
who made videos that are very popular on cracked.

2290
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:08,240
And they told me, yeah, there's stories about us.

2291
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:10,560
Oh, my God. Really? To read the story you don't.

2292
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:13,480
People doing via wait, wait, wait.

2293
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:15,640
What's the when when you're imagining the shipping?

2294
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:17,040
Yeah, yeah. Ship. Yeah.

2295
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:20,480
Too weird to be interested to see it.

2296
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:22,200
I'll be honest.

2297
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:23,920
Yeah, I think college humor.

2298
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:27,240
People really like huge fan base.

2299
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:29,960
You forget no love for funny or die.

2300
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:34,120
I guess nobody's shipping me and whoever else worked.

2301
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:36,840
Alex Fernie. Come on. Where's that?

2302
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:38,400
Yeah, come on. Is that fanfic?

2303
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:42,120
There's one phrase that I pulled in that and this is and

2304
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:45,200
and we're going to black out after this and the phrase is this.

2305
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:48,400
Greaseball dried the fluid off of his mouth.

2306
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:53,000
You survived podcast, the ride, the second gate.

2307
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:02,120
Let's let you know about Club 3, do Club 3.

2308
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:04,640
Let's let Mike have some water and we'll wind it down.

2309
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:05,320
Get some water.
