00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,480
Welcome to Podcast The Ride The Second Gate, today a therapy session about the ultimate

2
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,040
toys we were deprived of as kids.

3
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,480
I'm Scott Gardner, I've got a lot to work through today, Mike Carlson.

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,760
Yeah, me too.

5
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,320
So I'm preemptively sad, usually I'm sad by the end of every Podcast The Ride episode

6
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,480
just for various reasons, but today I'm sad ahead of time.

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,480
Everyone?

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,280
Yeah, I'm just very sensitive and I hide it well.

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,000
Gee, well except the ones where you announce it, Jason Sheridan has to leave that for too

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
long.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah, there's so much already to deconstruct.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Already?

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Already, Mike.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh, with what I just said you mean?

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,960
The toys we didn't get, I've got stories about that, Mike's hidden sadness, like this

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,960
is...

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,880
Well, I mean, this came up recently because you just came out of the gate like, look,

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,720
I don't want to complain, but I don't want to be dark, but, and then it was that you

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,600
don't get to go to something called Quacky Duck City because it's only in Tokyo.

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,480
It was still mildly baffling energy to me, although I guess I started with something

21
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,840
similar here.

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,960
But you know, at least I take comfort in that no one gets to do any of what we're talking

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
about today.

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,400
It's all unbuilt stuff.

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,680
That's a good point, because if other people were having fun, then I would be jealous and

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,680
sad, but I'm just sad now.

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,800
Yeah, no one got to meet the light keepers.

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,320
Imagine who we would be if we got to spend time with the light keepers.

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,200
Oh boy, I wish.

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,400
We would have retained their light, it would have carried us into adulthood instead of

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,600
the pure black dark that is in us instead.

32
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,360
Yeah, which in Mike's case is why half of the music of Olivia Rodrigo resonates so much

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,040
because it taps into that that darkness and that angst.

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,080
You know, there's a Taylor Swift song she has on her new album called So High School

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,160
that I really like.

36
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,480
It's really good, but it's about being like in high school again.

37
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,280
So it's like really doing a couple of things, making me feel young because of the lyrics,

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,520
but also because Taylor Swift is a popular music artist.

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,360
I feel young in that way as well.

40
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,920
Let me ask, are you a light keeper in disguise?

41
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,920
Maybe.

42
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,080
Because that sounded like a very quote unquote human sense.

43
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,640
Yeah, there was a lot.

44
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:40,040
Yeah, very normal things that a human being, a flesh human being would say.

45
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,080
It makes me feel young because Taylor Swift is a pop star singer person.

46
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,640
Yeah, it's like an AI.

47
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,400
It's like I'm hosting a show, but I'm not here.

48
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,440
It's an AI of me hosting.

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,280
It makes you feel young because it's about high school.

50
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
Yeah, well, right.

51
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,840
Because it says the words high school in it.

52
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,200
Well, no, but it's about, there's specifics in it about like American Pie and Grand Theft

53
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,360
Auto.

54
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,200
She says, touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto, I believe, in the thing, in the

55
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
song.

56
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,360
It's not a scenario I've ever been in or wanted to be in.

57
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Neither have I.

58
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,040
It was a little inappropriate for young, I guess, I guess for some people, it was normal.

59
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,080
It takes you back.

60
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,080
So it takes you back to high school memories that you don't have because they didn't happen

61
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,440
because you wouldn't have been in that position.

62
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,640
A common thing on the show is me having nostalgia for things I didn't do, like the Pleasure

63
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,480
Island episode and then this perhaps because it never existed, but still I have nostalgia

64
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,040
for something that didn't happen.

65
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,240
I think this is common as well.

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,920
I like I'm a big Hold Steady fan and there's just constant like people overdosing in those

67
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,880
songs and having like really messy breakups.

68
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,240
I've had none of that.

69
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,240
These are all like fantasies, but like for some reason I'm nostalgia for the characters

70
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,120
from the Craig Finns song.

71
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,600
You fantasize about overdosing?

72
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
No, I don't.

73
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,080
I'm just saying, though, like this feels like, oh yeah, I remember when I was hanging out

74
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,080
like back in these days with these characters and like, I'm like, you didn't hang out.

75
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,080
You were not partying like these people were partying.

76
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,080
This is not your life.

77
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,560
I hate to say, I think both of you, I think all of us would be the ones playing Grand

78
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,640
Theft Auto and yet none of us would be referred to as bros.

79
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,040
We're not in the other room with Taylor.

80
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,040
That's true.

81
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,040
And probably going, hey, keep it down back there.

82
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,560
Are you touching her?

83
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
Would you stop it?

84
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
What the fuck?

85
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
What are you doing?

86
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
I hear moaning.

87
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,400
Go in another room, allow some privacy, some decorum.

88
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
I'm on a heist.

89
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,200
I'm doing a heist over here.

90
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,680
I've got three stars.

91
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,560
The police are after me.

92
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
The police are after me.

93
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
I stole a cop car.

94
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,600
And you're doing your hanky panky over there.

95
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,240
Can we stick to the missions when we go off the rails, it just gets a little foul.

96
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,440
I just want to, I want to achieve things and we get out of the car and start beating people

97
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,440
up.

98
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
I want a low body count on this mission.

99
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
All right.

100
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,520
I don't want any shenanigans.

101
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,080
That's the sign of a success.

102
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Yeah.

103
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
Was anyone

104
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,880
Not a body count, not a body count in regards to like a high school sex haver.

105
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,440
You are, you've already got the low body count in one way.

106
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,720
I want it the other way.

107
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,640
Now you've gone from AI to serial killer.

108
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,040
You think stacking up how many people, how many bodies you've had sexual encounters with

109
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,400
is a body count?

110
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,800
No, that's a young person.

111
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,080
Jason, help me out here.

112
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,800
That's what young people call the monosexual partners.

113
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,120
Young people in videos say, what's your body count?

114
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,560
Listener, you have to know this is one of those times that Mike is pointing and pointing

115
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
and pointing.

116
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,560
I'm not crazy for this.

117
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,680
When he's fired up, we point and point.

118
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
This is real.

119
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,720
A body count can refer to sexual partners, romantic partners, or the number of people

120
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,640
you've killed in Grand Theft Auto.

121
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,640
Yes.

122
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
Yes.

123
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
And this will come.

124
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
This is not obscure.

125
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Or IST's band.

126
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,200
Mike, I want to say, you are essentially pining.

127
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,560
It's like the Hollywood that never was and always will be.

128
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,120
The plaque that's in MGM Studio, that's kind of like back in high school.

129
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,160
That feels like that to me.

130
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
The high school

131
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
That never was.

132
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
The high school that never was.

133
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,120
And will always haunt you.

134
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,640
It could have been so perfect, if only.

135
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,120
This doesn't make sense to me.

136
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,600
Is not your life better now than it was in high school?

137
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Well, sure, of course.

138
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,720
So why do you still want high school to have been good?

139
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, the movies and TV tell me it's going to be a wild, fun time, and it was not.

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,360
I think that's what I'm saying.

141
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,040
I think it's probably not for most people.

142
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,400
The idea of still that you wish that high school was great.

143
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
I think that's still in there.

144
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,720
I think this is most popular culture.

145
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
I think so, too.

146
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,000
I think most people in their mind wish high school was better.

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,120
I think it fuels a lot of people in their adult lives up until they die.

148
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,880
They're trying to fix mistakes from high school.

149
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,360
Some people use it in a destructive way.

150
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,160
But I think that's a common thing where your brain is trying to kind of like...

151
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,360
The people who like to spend their time trying to prank deans.

152
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,760
Schools they don't even go to.

153
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
And that's just...

154
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,200
There's a thin line between pranking and assault.

155
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
Yes, that's true.

156
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,640
That is one way this can manifest.

157
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,760
Yeah, you unleash three pigs in the school and you paint on their backs one, two, four.

158
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,000
But there is no pig three.

159
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But they're looking.

160
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,200
They think there's a pig three.

161
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,720
So that adds to the prank.

162
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,320
OK, that is a good prank.

163
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
From something?

164
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,920
Or is that a prank you just came up with?

165
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,440
I'm sure it's shown up in TV.

166
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,320
I feel like I was just heard it as an urban legend.

167
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,200
You didn't commit this prank because you would never...

168
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
No, no.

169
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
Yeah.

170
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Would you prank us in that way?

171
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,400
No, probably not.

172
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,080
Seems an elaborate prank, I suppose.

173
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,240
So a bunch of pigs have burst into the recording and said, well, this is a podcast.

174
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,720
Well, now we know who's responsible if a bunch of pigs burst in here.

175
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,520
So I guess you can't do it now.

176
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Well, if you can...

177
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,440
Jason just looked at me like, oh, can't I paint with pig bloods on my hands?

178
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,280
I was using a dramatic pause.

179
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,320
That was purposeful dead air.

180
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Well, if...

181
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,560
It was for a reason.

182
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,840
I was milking, you see.

183
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
No.

184
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,000
OK, well, if we can get our heads in the present and out of a high school that never was and

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,520
never can be in order to make this episode happen, and if us, the human podcaster stars

186
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,120
can get through this episode and we can talk about, well, this, I guess, that's all confusing

187
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,840
because now we're talking about a future that never was and never can be unless they go

188
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:33,080
back and do these plans again, because we're talking about Tomorrowland 2055, the unofficial,

189
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,240
perhaps official, well, official enough because they use this logo, I guess they were going

190
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,720
to call it this.

191
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:46,160
But this is the unbuilt Tomorrowland redo for Disneyland in the early 90s.

192
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,640
We talked recently about the rocket rods and as part of that, the Tomorrowland redo that

193
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,720
did happen in 1998, which was meant to fix Tomorrowland forever so that we would never

194
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,320
have to go back and redo it again.

195
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:08,680
And instead, it's almost immediately after was in a permanent state of always needing

196
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,080
a redo, perhaps more than ever.

197
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:17,120
A heartbreaking thing, especially given that this was potentially in the cards.

198
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
I know.

199
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,880
It's just, it feels tragic.

200
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,200
As we've said over and over and over again on the show, this thing could have at least

201
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,280
given us what we want.

202
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:34,040
It would have fulfilled the promise of Tomorrowland and made it our favorite place in the park,

203
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
potentially.

204
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
That's all they said for me.

205
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,800
I'm sure if they carried out these plans, I think I would still, Tomorrowland would

206
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,600
be my zone in Disneyland.

207
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,600
I feel like visually, this might be pretty timeless.

208
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,920
If all these lighting effects worked, because I think what they were pitching is kind of

209
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:01,040
proto version of stuff they have done elsewhere and that has been very successful elsewhere.

210
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,240
So there was an opportunity here, much like High School Us, that was blown.

211
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
I know.

212
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,440
There are similar levels of tragic, I think, for having not gone the right way in my mind.

213
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,280
Now, if we have time or want to, there is also the talk of talking about another unbuilt

214
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,880
Tomorrowland in Tokyo, Sci-Fi City.

215
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,520
Did you guys look into Sci-Fi City at all?

216
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,760
We could touch on that.

217
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,200
I'm not pining for that one as much, although there are incredibly cool ideas.

218
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,800
As we head towards an episode where we try to crack the Tomorrowland problem, I think

219
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,800
it's good to touch on these unbuilt ideas and maybe they end up influencing what we

220
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,480
end up proposing, either at mega budget or micro budget levels.

221
00:10:51,480 --> 00:11:01,440
So Tomorrowland 2055, have you guys, has it been similar, basically we're working with

222
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,320
three pieces of concept art here.

223
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
There's not a lot.

224
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
Yeah, it's not.

225
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,520
I was like, oh yeah, well now I'll dig in and find, but it is basically the big ones

226
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
I've seen.

227
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Yes.

228
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,960
There's a lot out there, but they are, what is out there is intriguing enough to haunt

229
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
you for sure.

230
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Oh yeah.

231
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
For sure.

232
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
Yes.

233
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Did you guys, I guess we should start, this is like the overview of the land, this kind

234
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,440
of glowing gems.

235
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Yes.

236
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,760
And this was, who knows how far this got.

237
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,360
That looks like heaven to me.

238
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
It looks like-

239
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
It does.

240
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
It kind of does.

241
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Yes.

242
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,960
If you told me that there definitively is a heaven and it looks like the concept art

243
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,640
you just showed, I'd say that's fine.

244
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
I'm ready to die.

245
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:48,960
As long as it's bigger, I'm like, cause that doesn't seem like enough to fit, you know,

246
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,360
every soul that's ever, well not every soul, cause some go to hell.

247
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,840
Yeah, yeah, but I completely agree.

248
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,200
I mean, it feels like a really cool mall or heaven.

249
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,880
Which I guess is the same thing.

250
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,880
Same thing to me.

251
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,280
So basics here.

252
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:15,200
In terms of that, yeah, that overall vibe, which seems so much more coherent and consistent

253
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,240
and forward thinking than obviously what we ended up getting.

254
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,280
But even like, I mean, one big question I have is, would this have been better than

255
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
any of what we got?

256
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,480
Would this have been better than Discovery Land, which remains kind of successful in

257
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Paris?

258
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,760
Is it maybe better than Tomorrowland 94?

259
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,400
The redo that happened in Disney World, if it was the ultimately achieved version of

260
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
that concept art?

261
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
I feel like maybe.

262
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
I think this could have been best Tomorrowland.

263
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,440
I think very possibly, yes, I think you're probably right.

264
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,560
I would be interested to know what it looked like during the day, cause what we see here

265
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,960
looks like everything's illuminated and they're sparkly and things, there's different colors

266
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,440
on the sides of buildings that kind of pop and almost make it look like they're stars.

267
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,360
But I wonder, I just wonder what that would look like during the day.

268
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,240
Would it look a little cheap, especially in this year?

269
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,400
Like I could see a version where this is just an amazing like a blue sky version and ultimately

270
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,040
what we got still looks cool, but it looks a little cheaper.

271
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,880
It looks a little less inviting, less heaven-like, I guess.

272
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
A lot.

273
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
Yeah, a lot.

274
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:28,360
There's this piece of art of the Carousel Theater building that they were going to kind

275
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:36,160
of turn into Flying Saucer, again, drawn at night to emphasize all the lighting rigs.

276
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
But it could have.

277
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
I mean, it definitely could have.

278
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,520
I think it was definitely, it would have been in the mix for best one.

279
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,400
Well, you still got amazing architecture either way and like, you know, and we're looking

280
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,360
at cool rock work and cool spires, you know, I mean, that stuff stays.

281
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,440
And I think if the inherent colors are neat, then they are.

282
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
Yes, yes.

283
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,640
I think what's cool about this is that, well, like some of the other, you know, there's

284
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,520
like mildly a story, I would say, to some of the Tomorrowland re-dos that did end up

285
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:12,600
happening and this would have had a general buy-in in sort of a galaxy's edge way before

286
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,000
you even enter the land.

287
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,520
And the buy-in is crystals.

288
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
The story is crystals.

289
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Yeah.

290
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,520
It's the story of crystals.

291
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:33,280
They, like in digging up and trying to redo Tomorrowland, they happened upon ancient supernatural

292
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,440
crystals, beacons buried beneath the earth long ago.

293
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Great.

294
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,440
Yeah.

295
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,160
Just like kind of at the sewer line of what ended up getting turned into Disneyland.

296
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,800
It's lucky how that worked out.

297
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,080
So in this, like, where should we put all these crystals?

298
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
Orange groves?

299
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,080
Those orange groves right there.

300
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,400
It seems like nobody's touching those for a while.

301
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:59,000
So aliens planted crystals and now they are uncovered and exposed to earth's sun and the

302
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,320
glowing crystals are transmitting messages deep into space, drawing aliens who had long

303
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,080
forgotten about earth.

304
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,080
Yeah.

305
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,080
Neat.

306
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,080
That is cool.

307
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
Yeah.

308
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
Big communication crystals.

309
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,080
A lot to read into if you are a crystals kind of person.

310
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
Yeah.

311
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,480
It's one of my favorite theme park conceits of like, we were building a ride or we were

312
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,120
shooting a movie and then it turns out, I thinking of the mummy ride in Florida.

313
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:32,480
It's like, oh, we were filming a movie and we accidentally unleashed the mummy.

314
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
Yeah.

315
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,560
It's funny how this ends up working out.

316
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:42,080
It's like certain themes are just inherently imbued in certain plots of land and the future

317
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,240
part of this park, like it, you know, it's that way because it had crystals and this

318
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,640
sound stage is this way because there really were mummies under there.

319
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
It's kind of magical.

320
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
If you think about it.

321
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,640
Yeah, very magical.

322
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
Yes.

323
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,320
And as a kid, especially that would actually make, if you're in that right age where you're

324
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,520
like a little bit logical, but you still believe in things like that's the perfect narrative

325
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,640
for that, where you're like, I'm a kid, I know mummies aren't real, but I am a little

326
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,760
afraid still.

327
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,240
I'm still kind of a kid.

328
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,240
And then you go on that ride and it really walks your brain into a reality where maybe

329
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,120
the mummy is real, by the way, like there's a perfect, like, I don't know what the everyone's

330
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:26,200
different, but like, you know, 11 to say 30 for some of us, but like 11 to like 15 or

331
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,980
something where you're like, I'm, I'm an adult now basically, but I'm kind of afraid of mummies.

332
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,560
Like it's a really good way to bridge that.

333
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:39,240
You've taken the PSAT, but you're still a little scared of those mummies.

334
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,960
You're still a little scared of mummies.

335
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,640
I would say if we're looking for reasons why your ultimate Taylor Swift, make out with

336
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,560
your bros, what make out while bros play grand theft, if you're looking for why your high

337
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,520
school experience wasn't like this, perhaps fear of mummies as a teenager might factor

338
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,520
into.

339
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
Yeah, of course that was part of it.

340
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Yes, of course.

341
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,280
The big thing holding you back was being, that even at any house party, I can't trust

342
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,280
this.

343
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
I don't know.

344
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,280
I don't know who half of these people are.

345
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
One might be a mummy.

346
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
Yeah, that's true.

347
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,600
I mean, I, but if you just give me a little chance, I'm going to razzle dazzle you and

348
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,160
told you about the magic of storytelling.

349
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,160
Well, you, that's what was waiting.

350
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
That was what your problem.

351
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,600
Why won't a pretty girl come talk to me so I can convey the power of storytelling?

352
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,080
You wanted to talk about the power of stories.

353
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,080
Yeah.

354
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,080
And old actors.

355
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,040
Say, baby, do you know stories bind us all?

356
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,520
Never thought about it, huh?

357
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,440
Watch me while your friends talk about the power of stories.

358
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,600
I think that could be a good lyric too.

359
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
She wanted to change it.

360
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Or there's a remix, you know.

361
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Hey, pretty lady.

362
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,120
Did you know Norman Desmond is still a star?

363
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,640
It's the pictures that got small.

364
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,160
I could rewrite the whole so high school where like Taylor and the boyfriend are hanging

365
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,580
out and then you're in the background doing all your stuff.

366
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,280
Like you're singing to to tootsie and stuff in the background.

367
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
Surprise verse four.

368
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Yeah.

369
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
Yeah.

370
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
Taylor picks Jason.

371
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,680
He's done a full remix before of certain songs.

372
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,600
So you know, you've probably heard the phrase, I'm ready for my close up, Mr. DeMille.

373
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,400
And now what that's referring to is Cecil B. DeMille.

374
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,480
You're like a tour guide and you're 12.

375
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,760
I very much wanted to be a 12 year old giving tours.

376
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,280
Taylor, let me whisk you to a world, a world comprised of the three most famous quotes

377
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,320
from movies before 19.

378
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:35,960
Oh, yeah, I have heard those before from a movie, right?

379
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Yes, they are.

380
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,640
But you're two more obvious ones.

381
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,920
She grew up in Pennsylvania.

382
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:46,680
She wasn't that far away, you know, could have happened, could have happened at one

383
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,960
of those school meetings, you know, at one of those, you know, competitions or something.

384
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Would that have overlapped?

385
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
How old is she?

386
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,960
36?

387
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,960
I guess that could have worked.

388
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,720
Yeah, that would have worked.

389
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
That's all.

390
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,200
You do an age check and yes, all right, could have worked, could have worked.

391
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,000
No other factors need to be considered.

392
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,280
Well, it could have been totally impossible if that age was different.

393
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,440
We were both on field trips to Amish country.

394
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,320
You know, we toured a pretzel factory, we went to a smorgasbord.

395
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,840
Yes, this could have happened.

396
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,400
It is possible that it happened.

397
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
It didn't.

398
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,680
I mean, it's possible that it could have happened.

399
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Looking at the giant smorgasbord Good and Plenty and saying, like, you know, this inspired

400
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,920
the Imagineers for Ohana.

401
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
Did you know that?

402
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,200
Wait, the place was called Good and Plenty?

403
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
It's called Good and Plenty.

404
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,760
But not related to the candy.

405
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,880
No, it's not related to the candy.

406
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
Okay.

407
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,480
The story is that an Imagineer saw buses of people, like giant tour buses being dropped

408
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,520
off and others coming and going.

409
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,440
Plenty is like, well, if they can feed this many people per hour, we can do it.

410
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,480
So they ripped off the Good and Plenty.

411
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,280
Because it serves family style.

412
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,280
Right.

413
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,960
I know what that is.

414
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,480
That's family style is what I had at the Liberty Tree Tavern or whatever it's called.

415
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
Sure.

416
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
Family style for one.

417
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:13,240
Can you just plop Taylor into this and just see where her mind goes?

418
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
Family style.

419
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
Tell me more.

420
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,800
Okay, so I had a flight late at five o'clock.

421
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,040
Jason could have been hanging out with Taylor Swift.

422
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,040
Yeah.

423
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,440
He could have been in the entourage by now.

424
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,520
Or they fled to Nashville.

425
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,800
You should quit writing those songs.

426
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,480
That's never going to get you anywhere.

427
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,440
Get a summer job with me at the Jersey Shore at the Taffy's factory.

428
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,880
Now that's a path forward.

429
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,920
And would you turn off that rock and roll music?

430
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,160
Why don't you listen to something a little bit more classy?

431
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
A little bit higher brow.

432
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Hey, give me down back there.

433
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,160
I'm trying to play Grand Theft Auto.

434
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,600
You could have been, yeah, you could be on the vacation with her and Phoebe Bridgers

435
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,880
and Haim and Jason.

436
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
All on vacation together.

437
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,420
Hi everyone.

438
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,280
Are we going to make our itinerary times?

439
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,520
So y'all do music, huh?

440
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Any of it big band?

441
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,520
Glenn Miller?

442
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
Anything?

443
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
Dorsey Brothers?

444
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,360
How many trumpets you've got in the lineup?

445
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
Alto sax?

446
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
All right.

447
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,400
Well, I guess it sounds interesting.

448
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
All right.

449
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,480
I could see my toes tapping to that.

450
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,360
You're in Boy Genius now.

451
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,040
You're the male member of Boy Genius.

452
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
I'm the boy.

453
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,760
Jason is the boy in Boy Genius.

454
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
They named it after you.

455
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Yeah.

456
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,880
Because you were so knowledgeable about the old big band music.

457
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,800
Anyone want a moon pie?

458
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,120
It's inexplicable that they came to that name despite not knowing the boy genius himself.

459
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,880
Yeah, that is weird.

460
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,940
Now that couldn't, they are younger.

461
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,840
That couldn't have happened in high school.

462
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
They are younger.

463
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,840
They are young.

464
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Boy Genius is younger.

465
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,840
So that we can eliminate.

466
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,840
We can eliminate that.

467
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:58,600
This is the least ratio of episode topic to being talked about.

468
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,280
Which is funny because there's certainly plenty here.

469
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
And I like this topic.

470
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
I'm not trying to avoid it at all.

471
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
Yeah, I like a lot.

472
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,280
We've waited for it for years.

473
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
We just keep landing there.

474
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
I'm sorry.

475
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Okay.

476
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,400
So it's just always a funny switch to make.

477
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Okay.

478
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,080
So imagine a Tomorrowland that is a melting pot of humans.

479
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,120
I don't know.

480
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,920
It is cool.

481
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,360
Because at this point you've got to work with, as I said in the Rock Rods episode, you have

482
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,520
to work with the locks.

483
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,720
The rides that aren't going anywhere.

484
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
We've got Space Mountain.

485
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
We've got Star Tours.

486
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,080
Any premise has to include those as well.

487
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,640
And those are interstellar travel situations.

488
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,580
Those are ways to get to space and back.

489
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,820
So the rest of the land has to involve that kind of stuff too.

490
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,500
So it's a land that's a port.

491
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,100
It's a transport hub.

492
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,060
And there's ways for humans to get here and there into space.

493
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,180
And there's ways for aliens to get here and there.

494
00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:01,260
So it would have been this bustling metropolis of some human wares, some alien wares.

495
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,100
Sort of a proto version of what Galaxy's Edge became.

496
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,100
Yes.

497
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:10,740
It's a neat, tidy explanation for many lands, I feel like.

498
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,740
They're sort of ports.

499
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,820
This is where everybody gets together.

500
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,860
I feel like that comes back in a lot of, obviously, port Disney, just even the idea of it.

501
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,180
Port of entry.

502
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,180
Port of entry.

503
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,180
A port where you can enter.

504
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,180
It's easy.

505
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,180
It makes sense.

506
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,540
Okay, everything is gathering here.

507
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,540
It's an exciting place.

508
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,540
Good catch-all.

509
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,540
You need a lot of stuff at a port or a port city.

510
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,260
And then it also makes sense, too, because it's like, okay, the Star Wars characters

511
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,660
are here as well.

512
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,780
But then also, original Disney aliens that we're going to create are here as well.

513
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,820
You can fold in different universes into this premise.

514
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,820
Yeah.

515
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,820
Yeah.

516
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,140
And other ones are versions of this.

517
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:56,300
But I'd say they fully bailed in order to do what they did in 98.

518
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:03,580
But so, you know, also this notion of, like, okay, that it's crystals and things that

519
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:08,860
are, like, all the lighting is coming from within the big physical pieces that we build.

520
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,620
That's a little bit Pandora, right?

521
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:15,980
I even see that the word bioluminescence is used in reference to some of what they were

522
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,980
going to do.

523
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,980
Yeah, yeah.

524
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,300
So this, and this is what makes me think it could have been a big success, is that we've

525
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:27,540
that become Galaxy's Edge and Pandora are used in a big way in those, like, giant hit

526
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,540
lands.

527
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,540
We might have gotten to them here.

528
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,540
Yeah.

529
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,540
No, that's a good point, too.

530
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:35,860
I think, yeah, there are a lot of things in here that sound very promising.

531
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,860
One of them?

532
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,860
A second floor.

533
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,860
I know.

534
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,860
I know.

535
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,660
And this is, you almost, like, forget, it sort of doesn't sound like a big idea on

536
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,660
its face.

537
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,420
But as you start going through it, you're like, yeah, wait, theme parks are pretty much

538
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,420
one story, right?

539
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,420
Yes.

540
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,300
It's really not a lot where you go up on a second floor, other than to, like, wait in

541
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,340
a line and the line is up there.

542
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,660
But stuff to do up on a second level, like, this would have been, you would have been

543
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,020
able to walk through all of it in theory.

544
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:06,580
It's shops and restaurants and stuff that's just up there, and then you get views of stuff

545
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,580
from up there.

546
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,500
Bridges, escalators, catwalks, you know, that kind of thing.

547
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Yes.

548
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,500
Yes.

549
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
That all sounds great.

550
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:19,900
And I spoke very highly of Tokyo's Tomorrowland, which, like, look, half of it is very locked

551
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,220
in 1983.

552
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,500
And therefore, because they're kind of doing the Tomorrowland of Magic Kingdom,

553
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,660
therefore it feels kind of 70s, which I love.

554
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,340
But I could understand why it's not a big thing for a lot of people.

555
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,620
But, all right, you know, the main drag is OK.

556
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:43,420
But then that zone that I love so much with the Pangalactic Pizza Port and a star

557
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:48,420
tours that takes you upstairs at the end and then you've got to exit through a catwalk

558
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,620
and then you and then you can deal with different vantage points of that restaurant,

559
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,820
whether you're on the second floor or the first floor.

560
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,180
It does so much to the vibe, even though it's not much.

561
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:02,180
It's just one little bridge and then like cool satellite dishes and stuff up there.

562
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:07,700
But it like this nook is, I think, maybe at least to me and my particular

563
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:14,100
interests, like the most successful zone of any Tomorrowland, because it's doing all

564
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,100
these kinds of things, these characters you can only meet if you go up into those catwalks.

565
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,420
It's so cool.

566
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:25,020
And to think about a version that we have here and it's all like that is it's overwhelming.

567
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:30,420
I'm pining. Yeah, I know we're specific that specifically when exiting star tours,

568
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,780
you get that vantage point. Yeah, they have they have like kind of like a main drag

569
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,060
from the hub that's very similar to the ones we know.

570
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,140
We're like, there's a right over here and right over here.

571
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,940
And none of that's a lot to write.

572
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,100
I don't even remember what they are.

573
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,380
It was one of them Buzz Lightyear and one of them's some stitch thing.

574
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,220
It's not the same stitch thing. Right.

575
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,780
It seems fine. You know, I don't know.

576
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,100
That they could change.

577
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,300
And then they are blowing up Space Mountain and starting over.

578
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,860
Yeah, cool. And which looks kind of like this.

579
00:26:54,980 --> 00:27:01,100
I was going to say, yeah, the the saucer building looks very similar to what they're

580
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,140
ended ending up like the concept are for the new Space Mountain there.

581
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,580
And yeah, that's so like fun and playful.

582
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:14,180
And like, it's it's very like it's rounded edges and swoops and squiggles.

583
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

584
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:20,740
As opposed to the very like kind of stiff uptight version of most Tomorrowland,

585
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,580
which even this would would fall into. Yeah, yeah, for sure.

586
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,140
I mean, we've talked many times on the show about like looking at things

587
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,740
from different angles that we really like when you're on the train,

588
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,660
the old people mover and then out and the people mover in Florida.

589
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,180
It's like just getting to see your favorite ride from a different vantage point.

590
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:41,340
The line of your favorite ride from a different vantage point.

591
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,460
So the idea that you could like, like see Tomorrowland from up and down.

592
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:51,260
Yeah. Well, the second floor of the old interventions, carousel building

593
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,580
in Disneyland, they have set up couches like they have set up couches.

594
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,500
So they get it. They know people like being up high.

595
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:05,100
Yeah, to a certain extent, cosmic rays that you get your food

596
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,140
kind of on one level and then the seating is all kind of down the level.

597
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,100
Sort of. That's like a ramp.

598
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,580
That's like a foot down, though.

599
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,220
I'm saying you see a sunny eclipse for a little elevated.

600
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,020
And then you can go.

601
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,340
I'm never going to be mad about seeing them from a different angle.

602
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,780
But we're talking about at least three to six feet.

603
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,580
I it's a stretch, I admit.

604
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,260
I like seeing sunny from lots of angles.

605
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,300
You're just saying that's how much you like elevation.

606
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,300
That's how much of a hype miser you are is that even three feet counts as height.

607
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,260
You can maybe see a bald spot on Sunny Eclipse.

608
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,460
Right. Yes. Yeah.

609
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:47,460
I'm probably elevating it because the second level has the toppings bar.

610
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,460
And I find the finest area and dining as we've established.

611
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,220
You have defended that place a few times on the show.

612
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,380
And I think, yes, we figured out it's because of the toppings bar.

613
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:03,100
Yes. But it's at least the last time I had it.

614
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,820
It's bad. It was bad.

615
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,580
Do you get like a feeling in your heart?

616
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,420
Like when you're about to say it, does your heart kind of swell

617
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:14,260
like you're as if you're going to like, you know, like discuss a true love?

618
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:18,100
I mean, I used to like Cosmic Graze a lot better

619
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,500
because they had pretty good cheesesteaks.

620
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,380
And it was very and we were so far from Philadelphia.

621
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,860
But then to get the good cheesesteak and then go to the topping bar

622
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,820
and get extra onions and mushrooms.

623
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,740
That's OK. Here's another thing.

624
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,380
You're on like you're on an early vacation and you like

625
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,500
you're about to pine for like, oh, these mother.

626
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,220
These cheesecakes will be fine.

627
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,060
They'll satiate me for now.

628
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,220
But oh, the cheesesteaks back at home.

629
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,500
And then you hear and then you see a statuesque blonde girl

630
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,820
saying the same thing to her parents.

631
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,980
And you and you lock eyes from across the few years younger.

632
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,260
But she's still close and she would go to high school with you.

633
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,180
Well, this is a lovely scenario.

634
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,740
My eyes are fully locked on sunny eclipse.

635
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,300
I don't care about anything going on around the biggest obstacle.

636
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,860
Yes, to a chance Taylor Swift.

637
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,220
We have girls back home.

638
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,860
We don't have sunny eclipse.

639
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,660
Oh, you're a singer, huh?

640
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,340
You'll never reach the heights of the space angels. Yeah.

641
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,740
I also like the idea that you're gone for like five to seven days

642
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,620
and you're just like, oh, those Philly cheesesteaks.

643
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,780
How I miss them.

644
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,540
Mom, I'm having a good time, but I can't help but be a little wistful.

645
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,380
It's not quite wistful from home, but anything that wasn't slices

646
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:38,300
of pizza or cheeseburgers was interesting in the 90s at Disney World.

647
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,780
You're saying, OK, so you're saying the novelty of the sunny eclipse.

648
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,820
The novelty, you know, the novelty of cheesesteaks period

649
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,660
in the Magic Kingdom is kind of terrible food. Right.

650
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,780
But I'm just saying like you were missing the home cheesesteaks,

651
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,780
but you were intrigued by what the Disney World cheesesteaks were.

652
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,020
Well, I certainly was intrigued to try them.

653
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,940
But I'm just saying the food offerings in the 90s were so bad.

654
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,380
Oh, of course.

655
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,540
I'm just saying it sounds like you were like missing that,

656
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,020
like you would miss like your dog was at home or something.

657
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,420
You were missing the cheesesteak for five days.

658
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,740
I suppose a little.

659
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,380
You're writing like a letter to the cheesesteak.

660
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,940
A dearest cheesesteak.

661
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,220
You're correct.

662
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,940
Yeah, the food offerings have gotten better,

663
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,460
except at the place we're talking about.

664
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,180
The food remains garbage.

665
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,940
A bad place.

666
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,180
I didn't have it last time we were there, but the time before was bad.

667
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,940
I had some good chicken fingers and fries.

668
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,060
What do you want?

669
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,340
You're there for the entertainment and the ambiance, not the food.

670
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,220
Well, that's true.

671
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,020
You bring your own food and sit in there.

672
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,340
Yeah, that's true.

673
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,180
Twenty twenty one.

674
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,340
We were happy to be out of the house, you know.

675
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:44,980
What else do you want?

676
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,460
That was the oldest man thing ever said about one of the most recent years.

677
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,060
Twenty twenty one are happy to be out of the house.

678
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,660
Your chicken figure going to complain about chicken fingers?

679
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,460
OK, those were the days about three years ago.

680
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,660
All right.

681
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,140
I guess it helps that we are recording this with you on a plaid couch.

682
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,740
That's a set from another show that records here.

683
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,420
Yeah, I said like a fake basement.

684
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:09,660
So I am you are giving me like very Archie Bunker and

685
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,580
shit my dad and shit my dad, William Shatner.

686
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:19,660
Bleep, my dad says, you know, even regardless of what you're saying.

687
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,100
OK, so so there wouldn't have been a cosmic race here.

688
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,260
I don't I don't believe so.

689
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,500
I don't even know exactly what's going on restaurant wise,

690
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,060
except that maybe there's up there's some up on the intriguing second floor.

691
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,860
Yes. Attractions, I'd say, are the main thing.

692
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,220
And maybe the thing that would have set this apart is because, like, for example,

693
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,700
in one of the places that is now a pizza

694
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,700
cafeteria type restaurant, there would have been an attraction instead,

695
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,700
which is one of the great losses.

696
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,660
Like any you know how sad the Imagineers were to go.

697
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,060
We have lost a ride or an attraction, at least.

698
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,260
And it's going to become just a pizza place instead.

699
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,540
I don't know. As I say this, maybe Jason doesn't feel.

700
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,380
No, no, I honestly didn't know for years that that

701
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,220
that exactly was where Mission to Mars and Flight to the Moon were.

702
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:19,220
But like, it does make sense because it is a huge plot of land. Yes.

703
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,700
And Mission to Mars and Rugged to the Moon, that space, which is these

704
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,140
it was we talked about it a couple of months ago or longer.

705
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:33,140
That that was like retundas essentially all in the round,

706
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,300
you know, with like stadium style seating.

707
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,460
And all eyes are drawn to the center of the room for what was then

708
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,900
like a little simulator thing.

709
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:45,380
And to replace this and which these attractions were getting very outdated

710
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,980
and to do something cooler and edgier and scarier.

711
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,380
That is why Alien Encounter was developed.

712
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,260
It was meant to fit into that space.

713
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,940
And that's the space that it fit into in the Magic Kingdom and Disney world.

714
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,940
And this is what it was.

715
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,220
It was supposed to be here first.

716
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,900
So this if this at all gone according to plan,

717
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,420
Disneyland would have had the first alien encounter.

718
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,100
I wonder if Disneyland would have like received it better.

719
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,340
Like, I wonder if it would have stuck around longer.

720
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,220
Well, that's what a lot of the blogs I was reading said.

721
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,260
Like, oh, they already have PG-13 kind of thrills.

722
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,500
They have Star Tours, they have Indiana Jones.

723
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,500
So it might have been received better.

724
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,180
And then it might have stuck around later.

725
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,140
Yeah, that there's less like, yeah, I mean, I guess

726
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,380
you still think of Disneyland as like the storybook park.

727
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,940
But I guess by virtue of that, you know, more goes.

728
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,340
I guess like everything is tamer, I guess, in the Magic Kingdom.

729
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:41,220
Magic Kingdom, yeah, that time didn't have anything at the level of Star Tours even.

730
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,540
Right. So, yeah, maybe, maybe.

731
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,780
And just like the California guests are tougher than the Florida guests.

732
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,260
They could they could hang.

733
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,340
That's interesting.

734
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,300
That's a big proposition.

735
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,300
Well, the locals, the locals, they go on more rides more often.

736
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:03,500
More, you know, you don't think everybody in SoCal is a soft Hollywood.

737
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,540
Well, I am. We are, but not not the average

738
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,100
like annual pass holder.

739
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,500
Plus, a lot of teens, teens used to hang out in Tomorrowland a lot.

740
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,580
That Jason's right.

741
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,900
There are more teens, I bet, in California in general,

742
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,940
and teens would like to go and scream on Alien Counter.

743
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,980
There's more teens in California going to Disneyland.

744
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,020
They would be hanging out there.

745
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,860
More teens going to California than going to Disney World in Florida.

746
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,500
Well, the locals park, so it would stand to reason

747
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,820
there would be more teens hanging out often together with themselves

748
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,380
just as teens and not on a vacation, like a family vacation.

749
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,460
I think back when annual passes were very cheap and bands.

750
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:45,460
One video I saw, it was like, well, bands would play the Tomorrowland stage.

751
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,460
So that's where people would congregate.

752
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,020
They would just treat it like a mall if they lived close by, you know.

753
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,980
But you think the way less of this in Florida?

754
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,580
This is a sweeping general about teens.

755
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,420
All right. I know.

756
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,060
And then, Mike, I know that you remain a teen expert, however.

757
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,980
Yeah. Well, let's unpack what.

758
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,620
OK, so Disneyland is much more of a locals park. OK.

759
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,700
So I do think there's some logic in it, in that there would be more

760
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,740
just teens hanging around because there's more people with annual

761
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,180
passes in general.

762
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,380
So I think it would stand to reason that there would be more just teens

763
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,300
roaming in the Disneyland and I guess now California Adventure.

764
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,660
Versus families all going on vacation together.

765
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,420
And yes, certainly teens can break off from them.

766
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:36,140
And I would do that with my family and I would go do stuff entirely alone.

767
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,860
I would just ride the same rides, but in the order I want it.

768
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:45,420
And then and loiter in the stores for as long as I pleased.

769
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,980
Free from the tyrannical rule of your parents.

770
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,100
Of my very low key parents.

771
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,580
Of your low key parents who wanted to go on the same things,

772
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:57,820
but not in the precise order that you were just striking out my own.

773
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,660
I just want a little time to myself.

774
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,660
All right. We'll see. I guess so.

775
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,940
To keep in mind, the teens that it's Florida, the teens aren't roaming.

776
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,140
It's a theory that maybe Alina kind of would have done better

777
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,220
because there are more teens hanging around and people were a little more used

778
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,540
to like a mature experience at Disneyland.

779
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,860
And they would have learned to appreciate this art deco concept art

780
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,340
if it actually got made.

781
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:28,420
This, by the way, the roaming SoCal teens A are tough and B appreciate art deco.

782
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,820
Do you guys know Jason's point? I'm not going to argue that point.

783
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,900
I think if they built this building, if they did all like metalwork

784
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,660
statue kind of carvings and stuff in this might have ended up

785
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,380
being the most expensive building at Disneyland.

786
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,700
That is insane. Yeah.

787
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,100
That's right. That's really cool.

788
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,980
It's so weird and scary.

789
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,100
You get a creepy feeling just looking at it because it's like,

790
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,180
yeah, it's it's art deco and we're somewhere.

791
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,220
It's even in I don't know.

792
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:58,780
It's reminiscent of like whatever murals and statues and Rockefeller Center

793
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,700
or whatever.

794
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,860
But it's like in this kind of scary, brutalist

795
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,220
you know, German kind of way.

796
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,980
It's like it's a bunch of like toiling laborers.

797
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,820
Like this is what they were trying to imply is that, OK, if you look close,

798
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:23,260
the pillars of the building are all like people being really put upon

799
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,420
and having to like carry the building on their shoulders.

800
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,060
Yeah. Which is meant to subtly imply that you're going to get in here.

801
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,460
And what is built is kind of a friendly demonstration of what if aliens

802
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,460
could teleport to us that it's being done by people

803
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,180
who kind of have other plans for humanity?

804
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,180
Yeah. Yeah.

805
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:45,540
Who maybe are going to dominate us and whip us and keep us in cages.

806
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,180
Which kind of mirrors the art at Rockefeller Center

807
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,980
that the artist feuded with Rockefeller a lot about that art.

808
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,620
Really? Yeah, you can see it in

809
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:00,620
oh, the Frida Kahlo movie, I think, that Salma Hayek was in.

810
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,140
Ed Norton is Rockefeller.

811
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:07,780
Oh, and Molina is is it Rivera was the artist?

812
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,940
I don't know.

813
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,580
I'm blank on his first name.

814
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,980
But that was a historical fact.

815
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,460
You really had to fight to get those murals and statues and stuff in there.

816
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,420
OK. It would have been similar.

817
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,500
Well, this feels like like that building and even just the explanation

818
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,740
of alien kind of it does feel like it's like two two letter grades

819
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,700
more intense for anything at Disneyland.

820
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,660
Three letter like it.

821
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,740
Yeah. Like if Indiana like, let's use movie writing like Indiana Jones is PG.

822
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,220
This does feel like an R rated ride in some ways.

823
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,340
Yeah. And especially your swearing.

824
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:45,540
The roots being they were trying to get like the 20th century Fox.

825
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,340
Sure. There was discussions about like,

826
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,860
can it can the alien the to be the xenomorph?

827
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,100
Yeah. Yeah.

828
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,580
And George Lucas was involved in the early like, like,

829
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,180
it'd be interesting to see, does this does this early version?

830
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,340
Does it work?

831
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:09,700
Do they somehow by using the real alien and having George Lucas's involvement,

832
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,740
does it somehow succeed more?

833
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,340
Because it is undeniably like I think a lot of people are very fond of it,

834
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,700
but it undeniably like was a troubled production

835
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,980
that they had to keep retooling.

836
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,380
And does it sail through better or is that initial version so

837
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,820
hard are scary that it has all the same issues?

838
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:33,020
Is it a flawed concept regardless of its Lucas or its xenomorph?

839
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,100
That's a good question.

840
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,420
It's it's interesting because I think like years now of like just, OK,

841
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,260
Epic Universe were doing the Monster's Land.

842
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,540
They just revealed this in a video. It looks amazing.

843
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,580
The ride looks scary as shit.

844
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,100
Yes. Yes. I think I was hearing that.

845
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,460
But like that, I'm like, oh, I think they're really going to go for it.

846
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:54,340
I do think years of Halloween horror nights and different Halloween events

847
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:58,620
have prepared your average theme park goer for something this scary.

848
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:02,100
Yes. So I think maybe you're what you might be getting at

849
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,180
or what it might have just ended up being too early

850
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:10,020
for your average theme park guest to be that scared on a ride.

851
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,860
But I don't know that in this day and age, if it was placed

852
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:16,420
in the right spot in a Disney park, people would understand it

853
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,740
and would be like willing to be that scared because they like that now.

854
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,140
And Disney owns that alien.

855
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,500
Yes, that's true.

856
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,340
What is what has Disney done that is scary?

857
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,540
They have they gone in this direction at all?

858
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,540
And I don't mean like the thrill of the ride.

859
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,180
I mean, like thematically scary.

860
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,580
I mean, what is that?

861
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,340
It's a good question.

862
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:41,140
What's the scariest moment on a Disney attraction or like

863
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,460
is Tower of Terror scary?

864
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,460
I mean, it was scary to me when I was a kid.

865
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,620
But is that just is it part of what happens in it?

866
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,500
Is it like is the story scary or no?

867
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,660
Because it's like, but it's not like you're about to get killed

868
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,060
by an alien in the like complete pitch black wrapped in.

869
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,060
Yeah, but it is scary.

870
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,340
I mean, that's that's up there.

871
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,100
And then Everest Yeti sort of scary.

872
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,860
Yeah, but that's one where you're like going so fast.

873
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,340
Yeah, to me, at least when I'm going fast, I'm not quite as scared

874
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:16,140
that like when I'm going slow, there's not a lot of the domestic parks,

875
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:20,260
but they Hong Kong did have houses when you're one year.

876
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,300
They did it is they are.

877
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,340
They are grotesque in a way that was in a Club Three poll.

878
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,580
Yeah, yeah, but that's worth looking at.

879
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,580
Yeah, but then they don't do those anymore.

880
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,460
Yes.

881
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:35,060
So they just never they haven't really gone this direction.

882
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,900
They have not gone really much this direct since, especially since.

883
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:44,300
But I do think years now of horror nights in different haunted houses,

884
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,740
I think more people really love this because everything is expanded so much.

885
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,180
But under the universal.

886
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,100
Certainly under the universal.

887
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,940
But I'm sure there's plenty of Disney people that go to both

888
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,380
and there would be an appetite for it.

889
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:00,500
So I think it was ahead of its time in some ways that they are.

890
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,500
But we needed all of the 90s Halloween events to to desensitize you a little.

891
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,180
But that's how it happened to me.

892
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,620
And to get the floor to get the Florida people

893
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:14,060
tough to the degree of the socal teens famously tough socal team.

894
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,820
Well, they have been going to scary farm.

895
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,020
So they had sort of worked themselves into a spot

896
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,780
where they now were a little bit tougher than the Florida goers

897
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,020
who didn't have a scary farm seeing the sliders.

898
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,060
Right. They're calloused from the sliders.

899
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:29,380
Yes. So I I'm sure there's some imagine

900
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,860
you're somewhere that's like we could sneak an alien ride in here.

901
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,660
And I don't think it's going to I would bet no money that will happen.

902
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,660
Yeah. Yeah. I would bet zero money that they're thinking about it.

903
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,020
It's land or something.

904
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,620
Maybe. Yeah. But even villains land like the xenomorph doesn't fit tonally with.

905
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:47,100
It would be funny if they're like the villains.

906
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,300
Jafar, the queen of hearts, the xenomorph.

907
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,740
Yes, that would be awesome.

908
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,940
But I don't see that bandits from home alone with bandits.

909
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,940
The top villains and the predator and the predator predator.

910
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,980
If we have room predator.

911
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,540
Oh, that would be so great.

912
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,020
But there's no way. Yeah.

913
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,020
There's no unless it's a fifth park that's all Fox properties,

914
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:11,740
which we talked about for nemesis from American Dad.

915
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,820
Yes. This is from American.

916
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,740
Dad is in there.

917
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,700
The one Mr. Burns, Mr.

918
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,500
Burns and the one eyebrow baby from Simpsons, Maggie's nemesis.

919
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,580
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

920
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:27,980
And then which were the planet of the apes would be in there, I guess, as well.

921
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,020
Yeah. But they're not. Yeah.

922
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,940
But the nemesis is man. Right.

923
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,940
So that's a tough ride.

924
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,980
That's a ride that makes you think, yep, I'm the I'm the villain in villain land.

925
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,740
Anyway, it did like cool building.

926
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,980
Oh, I also saw the term techno deco.

927
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,700
How cool is that? That's a cool name. Yeah.

928
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:51,580
Right. There's a guy named a designer named Rob Yeo who created

929
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,780
what he thought this land might be like in 3D.

930
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,260
And I encourage you to look up those designs.

931
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,740
Those are really cool. He took some leaps.

932
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,660
He was going off of like the several pieces of concept art that exist.

933
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,740
But in doing so, kind of like extrapolated from, OK,

934
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,700
if there's if we're doing this techno deco thing, you know,

935
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,740
maybe this would look like this or this would look like this.

936
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,940
And I especially really love how he rendered the people mover

937
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:20,340
in this cool where it's like, I yeah, I don't know.

938
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,100
I don't know how to describe it.

939
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:25,380
It just it looks like it's a weird 40s version of the people mover,

940
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,540
which is really neat.

941
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:30,260
It's not anything the Imagineers actually thought of, but they should have.

942
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,860
It's cool. And boy, if it was if this place is going to be anything

943
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:36,300
like his concept art would have been even cooler at night than you think.

944
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:40,660
Yeah. Then even just the logo on cast member,

945
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:46,500
like crew gifts and stuff that they they is very cool.

946
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,780
This logo is awesome. It's out there.

947
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,980
You're showing an eBay listing is a picture, I guess,

948
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,340
for something that they're selling on eBay.

949
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,820
These things would come up at some of these van Eten auctions

950
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,620
where they sold the park stuff like crew jackets they've sold.

951
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:00,860
Here's the jacket.

952
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:06,860
The asking price for one button is 79.95.

953
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,340
Wow. And the jacket they won

954
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,220
one thousand four hundred ninety five.

955
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,780
Geez. Wow. Wow.

956
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,140
I wonder what's the last one that sold.

957
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,700
I wonder if that's like it sold for that or that's just like one of a kind

958
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,380
almost on eBay at this point.

959
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:24,860
I don't know. It is such a neat logo that really like

960
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,700
just alludes to the promise of what this place would have been.

961
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,100
This tomorrow would have been like aesthetically.

962
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:35,860
You see it sometimes with like pink on black teal on black

963
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,980
or the version you just showed both.

964
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:40,820
This is a superior color scheme. I love it very much.

965
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:44,100
And it's the outlines of big rocks like what would have been in the front.

966
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,540
We got kind of a lesser version of the big

967
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,540
jagged rocks in the final land.

968
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,780
And then also the moon liner, the big rocket was going to be a part of this.

969
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,820
Now, the rocket did end up existing.

970
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,500
It is a Coke booth where I mean, it's OK.

971
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,500
This is a thing that was in Disneyland in the 50s and 60s.

972
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,100
It was maybe one of the icons.

973
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,900
If you went to the park back then, then it went away for a long time.

974
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:09,020
They were they did bring it back, though it's kind of small.

975
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:12,820
And as we addressed, just that's where I think you get the Coke bottles

976
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:16,380
that shoot up out a little cannon that I'd never heard about until now.

977
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:22,340
In this version of the land, it would have been three times bigger.

978
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:27,940
The symbol of the land, I think, like, you know, the big pinnacle piece in the center.

979
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,020
Yeah, sounds really cool. Looks really cool.

980
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:35,540
Yeah, I just think those I wonder what like would be around now.

981
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:39,260
I guess I guess now because I was impressed that they even had like 3D

982
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,700
rendering stuff back then.

983
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,940
But it's you know, that stuff was all available, maybe not commercially,

984
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,420
but was available to designers and things.

985
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:51,540
But I just I would I want somebody now to make like a 3D model of this,

986
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,820
like with modern technology, too, just so you can like I want to like go VR.

987
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,940
I guess what I'm saying. Oh, sure.

988
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,620
Well, Rob, you might have like had to add it to that.

989
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,900
I don't know. Yeah, maybe you might have had a walk around version.

990
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,260
And I remember so other stuff.

991
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:10,100
I mean, like big central attractions would have been just, you know,

992
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,900
imagine the Tomorrowland doesn't have pizza port.

993
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,500
It has alien encounter that somehow makes it to this day.

994
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,580
The Timekeeper, I believe, would have been in the Circle Vision Theater,

995
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:26,340
which will address more fully down the road, but like pretty cool,

996
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,300
unique, very memorable attraction.

997
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,940
There was a Disney World for a long time.

998
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:36,580
But I feel like the central piece is what ends up in that carousel theater.

999
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,460
This is what really haunts you because they had already started

1000
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:44,620
bailing on America sings those robots are going to Splash Mountain.

1001
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:49,420
We aren't going to run this thing anymore, but we didn't rip out the mechanism.

1002
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,020
It still turns. We didn't rip out the seats.

1003
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,220
We could get something new in here.

1004
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,980
And this if it's not the primary.

1005
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:57,740
OK, you know what?

1006
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,940
Sometimes we get the question in a mailbag or whatever.

1007
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,380
Like, what's the unbuilt thing that you find for the most?

1008
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:05,620
And if you go, if you want to say like a full park, right?

1009
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:08,420
You want to say Westcott, you want to say Port Disney or even this,

1010
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,020
this full land in general.

1011
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:13,340
If we're going specific attractions could be my number one.

1012
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:18,940
This is because we don't know much, but the phrase will always haunt me.

1013
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:23,300
And the phrase is Plectu's fantastic intergalactic review.

1014
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:26,380
Yeah, really happy we've arrived at the point in this podcast

1015
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,420
where we can talk about Plectu.

1016
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:35,580
I mean, just the name alone just implies the funnest, silliest.

1017
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:39,460
It's a sci fi country bears that would have it.

1018
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:43,220
And if it's in the revolving theater, that means we get five stages.

1019
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:47,820
Right. Of instead of, you know, Storks, Whistle and Dixie,

1020
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,580
all this shit that was in there before.

1021
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,060
We just not like it to one bit.

1022
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:58,420
Instead, you get like five stages of weird sci fi robots.

1023
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,540
Wouldn't have been as educational as the carousel of progress,

1024
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,180
but it might have been a lot more fun.

1025
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,220
This is this sounds so great.

1026
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,540
Yes, it is. It is.

1027
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,700
This is something that they'll never do again.

1028
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,020
It'll never something like this will never happen again.

1029
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,260
It's something that requires like a minimum.

1030
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:18,220
What's a minimum is like 70 animatronics, right?

1031
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,300
Yes, right.

1032
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,060
And these are seemingly original characters.

1033
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,420
And obviously, if we're explaining why, I mean, if you listen to the podcast,

1034
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,180
you don't need to know why.

1035
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,500
But this is like, you know, the hyper Chuck E.

1036
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,020
Cheese with new original Disney created sci fi characters.

1037
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,620
And especially with my kid brain, I was all about space.

1038
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,420
I did not care about the old west.

1039
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,620
I did not care about a lot of these other things.

1040
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,380
And I said this, I've admitted this before on the show.

1041
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,260
I liked the country bears as a kid, but I was not enamored with them

1042
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,820
like I am as an adult.

1043
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:54,460
So especially with my kid brain, this is what I wanted from a robot show.

1044
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,780
This is the ultimate thing.

1045
00:50:55,780 --> 00:51:01,460
This is a alien based space based robot show with, I assume, original songs.

1046
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,980
Yes. I don't know.

1047
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:03,900
Some covers, whatever.

1048
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,660
But this is my kid brain is all I wanted.

1049
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:10,100
There's a pretty I'm going to call this an unvetted fact

1050
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,780
because it only appeared in comment sections.

1051
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,700
And, you know, now I'm looking at things through Eisner Golf for brain.

1052
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,420
Yeah. And I can't report this like it's a real thing

1053
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,020
because I just don't think the proof is there.

1054
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:24,460
But there were people saying that the music for this attraction

1055
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,820
was being worked on by Danny Elfman.

1056
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,660
Take that as you would.

1057
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:33,060
That seems too crazy that he's making time for that in early 90s

1058
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,620
when he's the most in demand.

1059
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,300
Well, he's done stuff for the parks.

1060
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,780
He's what he did something for a Mystic Manor, correct?

1061
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,100
Yes. And he did. He's doing Epic Universe.

1062
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,660
He's doing the Monsters Land.

1063
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,620
He is. Yeah.

1064
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,220
I didn't know that part. He said it.

1065
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,140
He announced it too on his Instagram. Oh, I've never heard that.

1066
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,260
I'm hearing this for the first time.

1067
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,620
That's crazy. Wow.

1068
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:55,540
So, yeah, and he's he I don't know, he wrote enough things

1069
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,700
in that post to make me think he like, oh, he's interested in theme park.

1070
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:03,260
So I don't know if he's doing Nightmare Before Christmas around this time,

1071
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:06,980
then he's at Disney and he's doing songs with vocals.

1072
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,820
So maybe, maybe.

1073
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,780
So, yeah, possible, very possible.

1074
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:12,220
But I don't know.

1075
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:16,540
That's maybe something for a gym to look up, somebody to look up,

1076
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,420
somebody to find out. Yeah, we need a little bit.

1077
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,420
We need some official, we need to see some pace.

1078
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,100
I'm talking about, but maybe then maybe it just didn't happen.

1079
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,940
Maybe it didn't get to the point where somebody was actually writing songs.

1080
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,580
Yeah. OK.

1081
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:32,820
What to say about this premise wise, and we're not we're going off of not a lot here.

1082
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,420
There's a couple of blog posts. Yeah.

1083
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:41,940
But the basics are in the carousel theater would be transformed

1084
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:47,420
into a flying saucer that is crash landed at that spot in Tomorrowland.

1085
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:52,260
And and they happen to have a dinner show going.

1086
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:55,020
I don't know. I was doing a wind up as if I had a lot more to say, and I don't.

1087
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:58,820
I don't know. Flying saucer landed and they put on a show for you and spins. Great.

1088
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,580
Yeah, it's great.

1089
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,900
It wasn't like they're not eating in there.

1090
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,140
But it was. Oh, thanks.

1091
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,140
Yeah. But they're doing a little review.

1092
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:10,660
There's a lot more lights and neon on the outside of the building.

1093
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,460
Yes. Yeah. Neon squiggles.

1094
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,460
Love it. Great squiggle.

1095
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:17,420
Big light fixture that looks like a big drum kit.

1096
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:24,140
Awesome. One question I have is like, would this have been outdated by the time?

1097
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,540
Like maybe now Plectu would not be looking.

1098
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,140
Plectu might be the ultimate thing that we talk about.

1099
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:33,780
You know, Plectu is a two part, three part episode for us.

1100
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,020
Yeah. But other people are like, what's this boring Plectu thing?

1101
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,300
But we know we know how much this would be in our wheelhouse.

1102
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,100
If this got 100 percent, I do think it would be closed down by now.

1103
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,700
Probably. It might have been closed down in 2000.

1104
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:51,580
Very possible, because we've also this is the problem with the country bears out here.

1105
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:58,260
The locals are blamed because the locals don't go to shows like that as much as a tourist.

1106
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,300
Obviously, also part of the country was we built two theaters,

1107
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,420
which is too much real estate out here because they're like, it's so popular in Florida.

1108
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,620
We need two of them out here. And they did not.

1109
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:10,340
Yeah. Expanded too quickly, like Planet Hollywood, which just like Planet Hollywood.

1110
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:14,020
But I do think also I've heard people blame the fact that locals

1111
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:17,940
don't necessarily go and fill up theaters for longer shows.

1112
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:21,300
We've seen that. We'll see that next time or we'll see that next year.

1113
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,460
And they're so tough. Also, they're too tough.

1114
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,940
And they're too tough to enjoy a cutesy bear show.

1115
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,180
Cutesy shows. The teens would rather go Rome.

1116
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,860
They don't want to sit in one place for 20 minutes.

1117
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:32,740
I think that's right. They get antsy. Teens get antsy.

1118
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:36,940
They would have loved hearing me explain, you know, this original character, P.T.

1119
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:41,100
Quantum is kind of a run down to P.T. Barnum.

1120
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:47,300
Is that so? They would have loved that.

1121
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,100
They wouldn't do it in that room.

1122
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,580
Yeah, Pete. Yes, P.T. Quantum.

1123
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,700
Now, here's where things show me that photo again. Sorry, Jason.

1124
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,940
Sure. He is. Oh, yeah, yeah.

1125
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,940
It's a little space hub. Yeah, he's great.

1126
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:01,740
He's well, and he's got a big staff.

1127
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,140
We're in botanicals land. Yeah.

1128
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:07,540
This might have been maybe this might have superseded.

1129
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:10,180
We maybe we wouldn't have even made it to Botanicus. Right.

1130
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:14,060
Until way later in the show, because we would have been so fixated on P.T. Quantum.

1131
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,660
So T-shirts had just said pot quantum.

1132
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,220
You're already there. You're like one letter away.

1133
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,460
Most of the letters you need.

1134
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,620
I mean, he's so great.

1135
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:28,780
What if you had to if you're staring at him,

1136
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:33,180
what is a sci fi property that exists that seems the closest

1137
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:36,420
to something that P.T. Quantum would exist in?

1138
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,580
Yeah, that's a good question.

1139
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:42,340
Like he's in a he's in a very complicated robe.

1140
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,580
There is so much design going on on the road and the staff is so complicated.

1141
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,700
And his art, his hands look like they have barnacles.

1142
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,460
And he sort of has the proportion.

1143
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,420
We're almost like, couldn't you see like this is the concept art

1144
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,340
of a Ninja Turtle action figure?

1145
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,820
Well, I was about to say he looks almost like more of a Mirage Comics

1146
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,580
Eastman and Laird character.

1147
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,780
Even even the drawing style.

1148
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,380
He certainly looks like he could just have been a figure, a playmates figure.

1149
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:10,060
But he specifically does look like he was from maybe like the original comics.

1150
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,540
Yeah, art style wise, too.

1151
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:16,220
I'm trying to think of a good obviously splinter is a very like

1152
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,260
yeah, character that you would think is similar to this guy.

1153
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,060
But even other characters, I'm trying to think.

1154
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,460
This is not a futuristic property,

1155
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:28,060
but I feel like he would not be out of place in the world of Dark Crystal.

1156
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,740
Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah, Dark Crystal.

1157
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:36,300
There's a French comic artist, like long, long time acclaimed guy named Mobius.

1158
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,780
Is it Mobius? Yeah. Yeah.

1159
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:44,580
And and he's worked with every big company under the sun.

1160
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:46,580
He did a lot of movie concept art.

1161
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:48,820
I think he worked on some Blade Runner stuff.

1162
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:53,900
But it's very much in his wheelhouse, I feel like. Yeah. Yeah.

1163
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:58,740
I mean, it's like an expanded unit, like an old Star Wars comic specifically.

1164
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,300
Sure. Yeah. Marvel Comics.

1165
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,260
Star Wars. Yeah. Yeah.

1166
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:05,260
Yeah. You could slide into a lot of different places, probably.

1167
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,940
Did you guys find the other characters?

1168
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,020
This is a very last minute find for me.

1169
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,660
Yeah, I did.

1170
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:15,020
And there's there's a thing I want to talk about one of them.

1171
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,940
But go ahead.

1172
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,380
Well, we got some other characters.

1173
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:24,220
And I don't know if you ran into harmony and melody.

1174
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:28,460
Listeners just put up space after Harmo Harmo.

1175
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:32,940
First name, last name, the Mel space.

1176
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,740
Oh, D. Irish.

1177
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:41,060
And these are also they're kind of like big Fraggles.

1178
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:45,260
Yes. Right. Big Fraggles.

1179
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:48,660
Bucky O'Hare. They look like they do look like Bucky O'Hare characters.

1180
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,020
Bucky O'Hare. Yes.

1181
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,220
Oh, wow. It even says Irish Micronauts.

1182
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,620
They did think this through.

1183
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:00,300
Harmony is like the painting, the blue boy,

1184
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,780
except a weird little like space gopher.

1185
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:07,380
Yeah. And he's got like tassels and I don't know.

1186
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,380
I like him.

1187
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,900
And then and I'd love to see a robot of him.

1188
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:16,100
And then Melody is kind of like a boy.

1189
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:19,820
I mean, she's like a marching band sort of.

1190
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:24,180
She's described as fun and feisty, like Marion Ravenwood.

1191
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,500
She plays the raucous stuff.

1192
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,940
He the softer, prettier passages.

1193
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:33,420
Yeah. And there's a lot of notes on the art.

1194
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,620
Lambskin Collar like this.

1195
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:41,060
We're looking at like some deep Imagineer art here with all of the details.

1196
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:44,020
But then there's something very strange that I will leave it to Jason.

1197
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:48,780
Yeah, there's a phrase that is probably the correct phrase to use

1198
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:53,060
in like trying to design creatures or a species

1199
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,580
right atop the drawing of Melody.

1200
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:00,540
It says sexual dimorphism and micronauts.

1201
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:04,540
And that is very interesting to me.

1202
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:07,260
That is just such an oddball note.

1203
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,900
I'm assuming it is.

1204
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,100
They just mean like, here's a boy one.

1205
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,340
Here's a girl one.

1206
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,980
What is it? Male, female.

1207
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:17,020
What does it mean to say it?

1208
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,580
It's just it's almost I mean, you're looking.

1209
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:21,500
You look at that phrase and it looks like the name of an essay.

1210
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,980
Right. It's a strange like if you put that on a piece of art

1211
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,380
because otherwise it says like her jacket is red.

1212
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,100
He has freckles.

1213
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,460
Sexual dimorphism in micronauts.

1214
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,020
It's a very strange.

1215
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,820
What is that? What does it literally mean?

1216
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:42,900
Dymorphic refers to occurring in or representing two distinct forms.

1217
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:46,940
OK. But then OK, sexual dimorphism is the condition where sexes

1218
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:51,340
of the same species exhibit different morphological characteristics.

1219
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,660
So just, you know, and then there's a picture of two ducks

1220
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:57,140
and the male and the female look very different

1221
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,860
than the species Mandarin ducks.

1222
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:01,220
That's what I'm seeing.

1223
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:04,380
I mean, I this always seems to happen.

1224
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,900
Like in like sometimes in science fiction where it's like,

1225
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:11,780
there are these creatures and they're not like you and I.

1226
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:16,780
They speak through thoughts or light that there's a boy one and a girl one.

1227
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,900
For sure, there is.

1228
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:23,860
I mean, it's also it's I guess sexual dimorphism is it's

1229
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:27,020
just telling us that the male and the female even have the same species

1230
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:28,860
like look extremely different.

1231
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:32,100
Like another example here on Wikipedia is Mississippi map turtles.

1232
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:35,580
And the male turtle is kind of small.

1233
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:38,540
And the female turtle is like three times.

1234
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,700
Yeah. Wow. Look at that. That's wild.

1235
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,060
Wow. Interesting.

1236
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:44,020
It looks normal to me.

1237
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:46,340
Just the way I see the world.

1238
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:49,340
Everyone's bigger than Jason.

1239
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:53,140
You're just a tiny turtle in this world.

1240
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:55,900
So there's some there's some sexual dimorphism

1241
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,100
in the difference between you and Taylor Swift.

1242
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,980
Wild. OK.

1243
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:09,620
So important one of the strangest things written in an

1244
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:12,420
imaginary document as far as I've seen. Yeah.

1245
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,380
I have some questions.

1246
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:19,620
We've seen Melody in Harmony and we've seen PT Quantum.

1247
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,260
But who is the titular Plectu?

1248
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,620
There's no concept art of Plectu.

1249
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:28,220
Is he is that what the P stands for in PT Quantum?

1250
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,780
Probably not. That's a little confusing.

1251
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,340
I want to know who Plectu is.

1252
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:33,420
It's somebody that we meet.

1253
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,900
Is it someone that we have to rescue through the power of rock music?

1254
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,540
Good question.

1255
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:44,020
Is Plectu in any of this art, the other art things I'm assuming you saw?

1256
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,700
There's one that kind of looks like under the sea.

1257
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,540
Yes, for sure. Yeah.

1258
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:51,100
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe Plectu is in there.

1259
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,700
Is that Plectu?

1260
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,300
I don't know. I don't know.

1261
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,980
And then for this one, I haven't seen what you're showing.

1262
01:01:58,980 --> 01:01:59,860
What's happening in that one?

1263
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:03,060
This one, this is just sort of a sketch of like it kind of shows you

1264
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:06,660
like the type of like with the old man in the Muppet sit

1265
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:09,460
up in this part of the theater.

1266
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:13,220
There's a big, there's a long haired, there's a long neck creature there.

1267
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:15,740
There's like kind of a long neck creature with two eyes that are kind of

1268
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:20,220
like also on long necks and then a sort of a more round creature sitting up there.

1269
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,700
And they look like they're in like the little little box,

1270
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:25,300
like the Muppets guy, like Statler and Waldorf.

1271
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:29,700
And then on stage, there is a kind of long necked alien

1272
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:32,540
pulling a head out of a hat, like he's doing a magic trick.

1273
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,420
Wow. There would have been magic in this show.

1274
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:39,340
And then what looks like there's a alien behind him

1275
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:44,780
playing maybe a guitar, but also smoking a cigarette or a cigar.

1276
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:48,260
Like there's there's definitely smoke lines coming off of this stick

1277
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:51,100
that this alien with a guitar is holding.

1278
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:57,580
So there was some alien smoking a cigar or a cigarette there, too.

1279
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,740
So that's very exciting.

1280
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:02,780
Well, you know, with all due respect to the Carousel Progress,

1281
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,100
which I like and I do every time.

1282
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:08,260
But then you're in there and it's like, you know, we got the Ed Sol running

1283
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,340
and then America Sings is a collection

1284
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,100
of some of the most unpleasant songs ever created.

1285
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,380
And that we're going to get this, that we're going to get cigar

1286
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:23,300
smoking aliens doing magic tricks and melody and sexual dimorphism.

1287
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,740
This is a wild show.

1288
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:28,260
There is another piece of concept art.

1289
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,460
Did you see this of the building?

1290
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:34,460
It's a little less detailed than the other drawings of the building.

1291
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:38,060
But it looks like they gave the building like legs.

1292
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,540
Well, that's cool.

1293
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:41,900
It looks a little more crooked, like it didn't land so straight.

1294
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,820
Yeah. Yeah. It's sort of a canted thing.

1295
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,220
Yeah. Cool. I don't know.

1296
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:49,660
We're just left to speculate.

1297
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:52,260
Yeah. I mean, well, like music musically, though,

1298
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:56,500
Danny Elfman doesn't even feel right for for that for when my dream

1299
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,700
scenario of what this show was.

1300
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:02,860
And I guess I'm picturing more of like 80s synth pop

1301
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:06,340
more than Danny Elfman, the genre that he did.

1302
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:09,500
Well, yeah, but not the kind I'm thinking of.

1303
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:13,340
OK. You know, not not necessarily dead man's party or anything.

1304
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,860
Or I'm just thinking of like I'm trying.

1305
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:18,580
I'm talking out loud here, like what I would want from it.

1306
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:22,500
And I think I don't know.

1307
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,900
I don't know. Maybe maybe in the mid 90s, he would have done

1308
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,620
like I don't want it to sound like Nightmare Before Christmas.

1309
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:32,020
I don't want it to sound like Beetlejuice.

1310
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:34,980
I want it to be kind of like Halyx.

1311
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:37,580
I get Halyx a little too rockin, but I don't know.

1312
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:39,860
I want something more in that vein, I guess.

1313
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:42,100
I don't know. It's a customer.

1314
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,940
If you worked there. Yeah.

1315
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:46,100
There are some music tracks

1316
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:49,620
labeled Tomorrowland 2055.

1317
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:52,020
Yes, but that's like area music.

1318
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:55,820
Apparently leaked because they were playing it just in a bathroom.

1319
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:59,220
Oh, yeah, I saw that music in the bathroom at Disneyland.

1320
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:01,980
So and somehow this has been saved from that form.

1321
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:04,740
But this music idea, I don't know.

1322
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:09,660
I mean, is how do we arrive at an artist that satisfies what you want?

1323
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:11,340
It's a good question.

1324
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:15,060
I mean, the Tomorrowland loop in Florida is close.

1325
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,260
Like, I think that's great.

1326
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:21,980
It's like technically versions of a lot of the Tomorrowland songs

1327
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:22,940
throughout the years.

1328
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:25,140
I'm just trying to think of like what the ultimate artist I want to

1329
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:29,620
would have wanted to be contracted in the mid 90s to do early 90s to do this.

1330
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:33,220
Yeah, that's closer, I think.

1331
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,380
I'm trying to think like early Madonna.

1332
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:37,660
Could would Madonna have done the music for this?

1333
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:42,660
Could you have gotten in the early 90s photo of old man P.T.

1334
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:48,140
Quantum? Something tells me that Madonna in 1982, her absolute zenith.

1335
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,660
What about you would have had a hard time

1336
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:52,340
looping her in to make up the songs for P.T. Quantum?

1337
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:53,660
But she kind of likes.

1338
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:56,460
I mean, she was like material girl era.

1339
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:59,300
She did, you know, the Sondheim music.

1340
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,740
She said it's a major motion picture, though.

1341
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:06,620
And this is a ride with an alien smoking a cigar with an ancient.

1342
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:08,820
Just I mean, you can imagine with this guy.

1343
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:11,060
We've come from across the galaxy.

1344
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:14,740
All right now, everyone. Vogue.

1345
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:19,300
Tiffany or Cyndi Lauper, maybe you're firing Danny Elfman

1346
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,300
and you're giving it to Tiffany.

1347
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,420
Tiffany can even write.

1348
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,940
She may not have written any of those songs, and she didn't write.

1349
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:26,300
I'm sorry. I'm having trouble here.

1350
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,340
Devo, yes, Oingo Boingo, no.

1351
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:31,940
Is this this cold hearted nature where Elfman is out?

1352
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:35,180
Elfman, you're looking at looking at Giffords in the mouth.

1353
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:37,380
I'm not just doing it because of the allegations recently.

1354
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:40,780
I'm just that's I'm just trying to think of what I would picture this being.

1355
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:44,340
I'm just OK. I'm not saying this is all definitively.

1356
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:46,260
I'm just again, I'm thinking out loud here.

1357
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:49,300
I mean, I look at Melody and I hear her singing like that.

1358
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,220
What is the song like? Do you hear me?

1359
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,300
What is that song?

1360
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,700
Uh, wait, what is it?

1361
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,140
Not Papa. Can you hear me?

1362
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,700
No, no, no. That's a different song.

1363
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,380
Am I? What am I thinking?

1364
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:06,140
I'm not sure since. Oh, maybe you hear me.

1365
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,900
I don't know what that is. Is it Kate Bush or something? No.

1366
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,780
Kate Bush could do the music for this.

1367
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:13,020
Now we're talking.

1368
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:14,980
OK. Hounds of Love era, Kate Bush.

1369
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,620
Yeah, that would be awesome.

1370
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:17,740
That might be the ultimate.

1371
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:19,820
Yeah, that would be good. I could see that.

1372
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:21,820
Well, because and it's also I don't know.

1373
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:25,540
They're like they're like a like fantasy.

1374
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,540
They're very fantasy in their design, too, which I see her

1375
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:29,660
what I'm with as well.

1376
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:32,220
What about Electric Light Orchestra?

1377
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:36,060
Not then. Oh, not in the early 90s, no.

1378
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:38,380
Well, what if they got contracted years prior, though?

1379
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:38,940
It's been a work.

1380
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:40,620
They've been working on this for a long time.

1381
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:41,980
History here. OK.

1382
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,620
Well, that's part of the fun of this.

1383
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:44,620
Changing history.

1384
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:46,540
What if they were still good?

1385
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:47,700
I guess. OK.

1386
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:52,420
I mean, yes, a bunch of aliens putting on a show that sounds like DLO

1387
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:55,340
still in likes, but we got to go, you know, they start to get bad.

1388
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,780
You know, we're going to go back to 78.

1389
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,980
OK, that's fair enough. They might be giants.

1390
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:04,460
It's a little kooky and it's a little good.

1391
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:08,020
I know you like them, but I love that.

1392
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:09,220
I revisit them.

1393
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:10,620
I have no problem with them.

1394
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:13,700
But for this, we're talking about a harmony and melody.

1395
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:14,620
We're going to do this.

1396
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:18,060
Think college music for that.

1397
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:18,780
I'm going to veto that.

1398
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:20,460
They've been. They've been.

1399
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:21,980
I know the songs I like.

1400
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:23,340
I like some songs.

1401
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,700
They've been on letter.

1402
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:29,180
They were just they were doing Birdhouse in your song Letterman.

1403
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:31,580
You could say that about any artist, though.

1404
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:34,260
Been on Letterman. So funny.

1405
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:36,260
You know, you know who could do it? Ronnie Spector.

1406
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:38,060
She's been on Letterman.

1407
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:38,980
That's true. She has.

1408
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:40,140
I mean, she would be good.

1409
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,100
She would be. That would be cool.

1410
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:43,940
Well, what if this was more of a Phil Spector sound show?

1411
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:48,620
Well, yeah, Phil Spector kind of sound a little bit, you know, in his wig mode.

1412
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:51,500
He looks a little bit like PT Quantum. Yeah.

1413
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,140
Yeah. If his if the trial had gone one more day,

1414
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:58,380
he would have come out in a big robe and a crystal staff and a beard.

1415
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:01,540
Phil Spector pulling a gun on PT Quantum.

1416
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,820
PT Quantum pulls out a ray gun.

1417
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:05,820
Oh, very good. It's a standoff.

1418
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:10,260
Yeah, I could think of more modern things, I guess.

1419
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:12,780
But yeah, I'm trying to think of actual era appropriate.

1420
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:15,460
I didn't even know her. I swear I didn't even know her.

1421
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,500
I didn't blow her brains out, OK?

1422
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,380
Their brains were blown out when I got here.

1423
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:21,700
I don't even know her name.

1424
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,340
It's Melody, sir.

1425
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:28,260
And I think you know that you are very interested in the sexual dimorphism at foot.

1426
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:33,500
When does when does a love and when is Brian Wilson put out Love and Mercy?

1427
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:34,780
What year? Eighty eight.

1428
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:36,660
Hey, OK, it's a little early, I guess.

1429
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:37,980
This era of Brian.

1430
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:41,420
I thought I thought you were going to say Brian Sensor.

1431
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:43,780
Oh, Brian Sensor. Yeah, straight cats.

1432
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:45,780
I'm going to veto it, sadly.

1433
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:46,900
I'm going to veto it.

1434
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:49,580
It's not what I want for this.

1435
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:51,740
This this also I would like to make.

1436
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:52,860
I would like to make the music.

1437
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:53,820
I just like to do it.

1438
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:55,500
I just like to do it now for fun.

1439
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,180
That's what's happened.

1440
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:58,780
You're in the you're in Imagineering in this year and like, Danny, I don't know.

1441
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,780
Elfman, I mean, is he to blend?

1442
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:01,740
You're there. Like, what does that mean?

1443
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:03,140
I don't know. He's like a little bump.

1444
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:03,980
What does that mean?

1445
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:05,860
Mike, are you trying to say that you just want to do?

1446
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:07,380
All right. Fine. I've done it already.

1447
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:08,260
We dance around it.

1448
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:10,140
Why just started? Just do it then.

1449
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:11,620
I've done it already.

1450
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,020
Here's the CD.

1451
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:15,940
I've been working on it for the last two weeks, nonstop.

1452
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:17,660
No sleep here.

1453
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,460
If we are trying to figure out what was going to be happening musically here,

1454
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:23,340
there's one little clue.

1455
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:26,140
And this these seem to be official Imagineering documents

1456
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:29,820
that indicate that maybe an element of this would have been

1457
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:33,900
cyborg versions of actual rock stars.

1458
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:37,460
And I will now show you two photos.

1459
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:41,980
One is some sort of very bendy.

1460
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:45,900
Yeah, first of all, somebody with a version,

1461
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:48,540
a robotic Mick Jagger with very bad posture.

1462
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,700
Yeah. Which I guess is fine if you're a robot.

1463
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:53,460
So we got a would have had a robot Mick Jagger.

1464
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:58,060
And then just below that, we have what seems to be a robot Tina Turner.

1465
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,580
Now, I start to doubt the show a bit here.

1466
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:04,940
These I don't know about original characters.

1467
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:09,300
Sure. But I think we might have might have started to feel a little bit dated,

1468
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:12,060
even though those are still relevant.

1469
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:15,220
Yeah. You know, like you you go to I was about to say,

1470
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:18,420
you know, you go to see a Legends in Concert and that's he'd see that

1471
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:22,660
the ultimate test of relevancy, that weird guy in his show Legends in Concert.

1472
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:25,820
But, you know, I mean, like legendary. Right. Figures.

1473
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:27,580
I think they would have gotten in trouble if it was like,

1474
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:30,260
and now the new bots on the block.

1475
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:34,420
Yeah. Well, the new chips off the block.

1476
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:37,540
Also considering Mick Jagger's like like eight days away

1477
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:41,540
from playing SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, like he's still doing it.

1478
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:44,860
So that at least wouldn't have been so far fetched.

1479
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:46,820
You would have known maybe who that is.

1480
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:50,820
But you but I guess besides that, there's the issue of does this suck?

1481
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:54,620
Oh, it's it's the chances of it sucking are very high.

1482
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:57,220
Yeah, because it's not you know, it's not going to be them.

1483
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:01,540
Like, look, we're this is now where we end up in Food Rocks territory.

1484
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:06,620
Yes. Now, I'm you know, would I if they brought back Food Rocks,

1485
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,900
would I be there as soon as possible? Absolutely.

1486
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,980
Do I think this is the highest caliber of show?

1487
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:15,540
Not necessarily, you know, if we're because I mean,

1488
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:18,260
I think some people voiced themselves in Food Rocks,

1489
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:21,180
but I don't think Mick Jagger was going to be one of these people.

1490
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:28,260
Probably not. And like I, you know, him like just so so an impersonator like,

1491
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:31,220
hey, you get off of my shit.

1492
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:36,700
I don't get no stratosphere action.

1493
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,540
Uh huh. Yeah, yeah, no, it's bad.

1494
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:42,380
That that version of it is bad.

1495
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:46,500
I guess if it's just sort of like, you know, they resemble those people,

1496
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,620
but their original songs.

1497
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:51,460
But no, I don't need a Rolling Stone parody in this show.

1498
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:52,860
I don't want that.

1499
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:55,620
I don't think that I don't think that's good.

1500
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:58,620
I can't imagine a version of it where that's good.

1501
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:00,780
And still like I would still like like it as much.

1502
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,540
She just does. She just uses alien nonsense.

1503
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:07,500
Like, what's Blurg got to do with it?

1504
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:11,660
I mean, it would be fun to talk about that show for a few hours

1505
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,060
and see once or twice, but it's not last.

1506
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:16,140
It doesn't last in our hearts that way.

1507
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:20,980
I came up with a few ideas for like songs about nuclear reactors.

1508
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:25,860
And they're like, no, Three Mile Island is still fresh in everyone's mind.

1509
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:29,460
Chernobyl has just occurred.

1510
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:33,700
And now a musical salute to nuclear reactors.

1511
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:38,100
I feel like the power system could power the flying saucer.

1512
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,340
Jason's hanging out with Taylor Swift and the bros.

1513
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:43,300
And he's like, Three Mile Island, have you fellas heard of this?

1514
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:46,540
You know about this? Pennsylvania.

1515
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:49,500
You know, this was his before he had 9-11 to go to.

1516
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,820
This is what it was.

1517
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:53,220
Because you have to remember that three days earlier,

1518
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:56,780
there had been a little incident called Three Mile Island.

1519
01:13:57,620 --> 01:14:03,260
Everything is centered around a tragedy or a disaster.

1520
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:07,020
Well, the boy genius is at it again.

1521
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,020
Oh, boy.

1522
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:11,260
And what's the thing that started where you referenced it recently?

1523
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:13,420
Like, keep in mind what had just occurred.

1524
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:15,740
The assassination of Archduke.

1525
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:17,980
The Archduke transferred it in.

1526
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:20,740
Like the cool band.

1527
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:23,900
If somebody, I know Van Art,

1528
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:28,540
if someone wants to draw Jason telling the the ladies from Boy Genius

1529
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:32,500
about Three Mile Island, I would like to see that.

1530
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:34,380
You don't waste your time, though.

1531
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:36,860
I don't. A lot of people to draw. Yeah, yeah.

1532
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:41,100
So anyways, I mean, I still think overall from what we've seen

1533
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:44,660
and from how the the exterior would have looked, this would have been

1534
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:47,220
superior to what ended up going in here.

1535
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:49,580
Nothing for six years.

1536
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:53,180
And then a giant ad for Compaq.

1537
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:57,060
Yeah. I mean, it is so insulting that that's what it ended up being.

1538
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:01,260
I even ended up at literature that was saying how the people in charge.

1539
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:04,740
This is what's heartbreaking is that, like, OK, Tony Baxter,

1540
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:07,900
who we love, obviously, and another great imagineer.

1541
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:10,660
Oh, what's the name?

1542
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:11,980
Bruce Gordon. Oh, yeah.

1543
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:14,260
These were the people who, you know, they stayed on the part.

1544
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:17,900
They had to oversee the weird cheapo overlay of tomorrow. Right.

1545
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:22,060
Because they were on the Tomorrowland project from this when it was blue sky

1546
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:26,500
and crazy, you know, and sort of wild and experimental.

1547
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:28,940
But and then cut to them years later.

1548
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:32,780
And apparently, I think it was Bruce Gordon, who was apparently saying, like,

1549
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:39,100
like that, like in a quiet way, like you're just internal people

1550
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:42,740
that, OK, we've announced that it is in inventions.

1551
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:44,740
We don't actually know what's going in there.

1552
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:49,780
And it opens in a year that they they they were so scrambling to figure out.

1553
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:52,180
They just said interventions as a placeholder.

1554
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:53,860
And then, like, I don't know.

1555
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:54,740
And there were models.

1556
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:57,340
You can look at models from imagineering showing like, well,

1557
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,820
it is the kind of thing we could do.

1558
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:01,100
And they had like six months to go from then.

1559
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:04,860
So and, you know, you could feel it, I would say.

1560
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:07,940
Feel that they were just like, I don't know, maybe.

1561
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,940
Yeah. Did a good job for the time when they had.

1562
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:12,500
But they did it with what did not happen is Plectu's

1563
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,940
fantastic intergalactic review.

1564
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:16,580
I really wish we could have seen some version of this.

1565
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:21,460
And then here's the real heartbreaker is that apparently

1566
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:24,380
this idea ultimately did not.

1567
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:28,140
They didn't sell it all the way through to Michael Eisner.

1568
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:32,820
And that he said, this just seems too cutesy and like something you'd see

1569
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:33,460
at Chuck E.

1570
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:38,260
Cheese restaurants around the country, to which I say, yeah, fucking right.

1571
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,700
Yeah, exactly.

1572
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,380
But it's you guys doing it.

1573
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:44,500
Yeah, it's going to be even better with the best damn Chuck E.

1574
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,580
Cheese that ever happened.

1575
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:46,780
Plectu is going to blow Chuck E.

1576
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:51,860
Cheese out of water. Michael, this is the one time that you messed up.

1577
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:55,900
The one time was the the were the robots at the Malibu Chuck E.

1578
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:58,140
Cheese and disarray and disrepair.

1579
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:00,460
Like, why did he have such a negative connotation with Chuck E.

1580
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:03,220
Cheese? Like it's the sea air.

1581
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:05,860
It's getting in the circuits, Michael.

1582
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:06,740
There is there a mall.

1583
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:07,700
What's the closest of Chuck E.

1584
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:09,940
Cheese to the to Malibu?

1585
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:12,980
I were probably I don't know, we're probably in Ventura,

1586
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:14,580
but this would even blow that way.

1587
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:16,420
Yeah, true. Maybe there was a thousand oaks.

1588
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:18,140
I'm not sure.

1589
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:22,340
But or this one I don't know about the current Nobu in Malibu.

1590
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:23,820
What's the story? That was a Chuck E.

1591
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:25,300
Cheese. Yeah.

1592
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:27,740
So, yeah, I don't know.

1593
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:31,300
He and maybe this is where unfortunately, maybe Michael Eisner

1594
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,460
didn't really get to Marlin.

1595
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:38,220
I think he because he it was his like overnoting and over worry

1596
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:41,060
that made Alien Encounter kind of a problem.

1597
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:42,140
And then he pulled the tree.

1598
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:45,780
He he caused the cheap version of Tomorrowland.

1599
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:47,420
He didn't get Plectu. Right.

1600
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:49,860
And he wanted something faster than people movers.

1601
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:52,500
So we get dumb rocket rods.

1602
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:57,020
So maybe this is where Rubber Meets the Road kind of with Eisner.

1603
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:58,060
Like Eisner, right.

1604
01:17:58,060 --> 01:17:59,860
Eisner and Tomorrowland, maybe.

1605
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:00,660
Wait, I'm saying that.

1606
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:02,780
But then he caused Star Tours and Captain EO.

1607
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:03,820
So I don't know.

1608
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:05,580
He just lost it in the older.

1609
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,660
It was younger back then.

1610
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:10,780
Yeah. So maybe he lost his passion for space.

1611
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:14,500
Maybe he lost his vision for what a fun,

1612
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:18,740
futurey show or ride would be something we can never do.

1613
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:23,140
And especially as we dive into soon, our depictions of Tomorrowland.

1614
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:27,140
And Scott, you're the only one who can bring Plectu back in a real way.

1615
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:30,460
No spoilers. But would you believe I would?

1616
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:32,940
I would maybe there's a yeah.

1617
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:35,540
Yes, this may be a key part of my plan.

1618
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:38,340
Jason, you can paint Plectu on a sign somewhere.

1619
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,060
That's the budget you have.

1620
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:42,020
Paint costs a lot of money, brother.

1621
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:47,300
I was going to say, thinking about them not having

1622
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:51,260
interventions like vendors set up and it's just like, all right,

1623
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:53,700
we're working the weekend, put a pot of coffee on.

1624
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:57,260
We just lost the fucking Dippin' Dots people.

1625
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:59,420
They went with Six Flags.

1626
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:02,020
The ice cream of the future is not ours anymore.

1627
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:05,380
We're not going to be able to demonstrate what the ice cream of the future will be.

1628
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:08,260
If we're trying to convince people that the ice cream of the future

1629
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:11,180
is the ice cream of the present, that's going to bomb them out.

1630
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,980
What kind of future is that?

1631
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,420
Jason does your proposal.

1632
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:16,740
Can I ask for a spoiler? Does it involve Dippin' Dots?

1633
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:18,660
Well, it's food.

1634
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:20,860
Food may come into play.

1635
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:22,340
Good. I better. I better. Yeah.

1636
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:24,820
OK. Yeah. That's one of the main things you have to work with, I think. Yeah.

1637
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:28,540
So I think that the lack of enthusiasm for Plectu might have, you know,

1638
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:31,940
along with all the other stuff going on, you do well, blah.

1639
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:34,220
So it all goes away.

1640
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,180
And that was going to be one of the centerpieces.

1641
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:39,300
So when that goes, the whole thing went and we had to figure out the cheaper version.

1642
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,900
There's one more element of this that would have been cool.

1643
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:45,100
I think we've referred to this in the past when talking about light magic,

1644
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:49,420
the weird, very much disliked replacement for Main Street Electrical Parade.

1645
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:51,380
But as part of like whatever.

1646
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:54,860
All right. It's the the summer of New Tomorrowland.

1647
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:56,380
We're launching this thing.

1648
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:59,540
And as part of that, we're going to celebrate Tomorrowland parkwide

1649
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:03,900
with our new high tech replacement for the Main Street Electrical Parade.

1650
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:05,540
Light keepers.

1651
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:07,860
Jason, I know you learned about light keepers.

1652
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,820
I yeah, I saw this mentioned.

1653
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,660
It's mentioned on the fandom page for this.

1654
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:15,700
And then some blogs had picked it up.

1655
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:18,780
Like you said earlier, like, oh, there's a lot of comments.

1656
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:23,220
I saw people like quoting the press release for this.

1657
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:27,820
But I'll just read this chunk from the park lore post.

1658
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:32,300
Um, here we go.

1659
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:35,260
Now, when it was time for Disney's nice time parade,

1660
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:39,100
an announcement throughout the park, which is weird,

1661
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:43,900
would suggest that a strange flying object had been spotted

1662
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:46,540
flying toward Disneyland.

1663
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:50,940
Then fireworks projection and sound effects would signal

1664
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:54,740
that a spacecraft was indeed hovering above the park.

1665
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:58,700
That's so, you know, Copperfield, Copperfield,

1666
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:03,860
as blue 32 as after a few moments of anticipation,

1667
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:07,940
the gates to that backstage area would swing open as brilliant

1668
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:12,620
white light flooded out this nighttime parade called light keepers

1669
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:16,940
would feature a tall, elegant, ethereal alien race.

1670
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:21,380
So giant six or eight feet tall, like

1671
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:24,820
glowing creatures that were walking around.

1672
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:27,660
I'm going to say this. It sounds scary to me.

1673
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:31,900
Yeah, it sounds like the Spectremen. Yes.

1674
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:35,700
And they used to you used to be able to get away from there on top of the big balls.

1675
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:39,500
But what if the Spectremen hopped down and started following you?

1676
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:42,380
But what if their faces were beautiful?

1677
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:46,180
What if the aliens had beautiful faces and they were eight feet tall?

1678
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:48,220
What if the faces were just pure light?

1679
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:49,460
Maybe that's the only way to get around it.

1680
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:50,500
You can't even see their face.

1681
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,060
That's creepy, though, too.

1682
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:53,060
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

1683
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:55,860
A lack of face has never been used for warmth or comfort. Right.

1684
01:21:57,220 --> 01:22:00,140
What if they're just their faces are just all tens?

1685
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:03,140
It's beautiful faces.

1686
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:07,300
They can have kind of weird bodies, but like their faces to a human eye

1687
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:10,340
are attractive. Would that be OK?

1688
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:15,580
I think you put an attractive real woman's face on a big beam of light.

1689
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:16,900
I think it's going to be scary.

1690
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:20,060
You're describing like cosmic sirens.

1691
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:21,660
They don't have to be sirens.

1692
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:23,820
Like luring you to the rocks, to the crystals.

1693
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:27,300
You can choose to be lured by them, but they're not actively trying to lure you

1694
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:28,420
like a siren would.

1695
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:31,940
I guess that there's ropes and stanchions that wouldn't get very far.

1696
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:35,260
Yeah, I'm just saying that like, you know, I'm trying to appease Scott in this.

1697
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:38,780
We're in this brainstorming session on how to make this a little bit more appealing,

1698
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:43,300
because like we all think of like the gray, you know, your gray alien face

1699
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:45,860
when you think of just sort of aliens or weird.

1700
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:49,900
I'm trying to think of a like, I guess, Wookiees are like eight feet tall.

1701
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:52,020
So but that's not what this is.

1702
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:53,500
That's not what they're describing here.

1703
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:57,660
Yeah. So I feel like we're in the territory of those,

1704
01:22:57,860 --> 01:23:03,820
the like crazy advanced robots at the end of A.I., which are scary.

1705
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:05,980
Yeah. Yeah. All doesn't help.

1706
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:09,060
Spinley doesn't help.

1707
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:12,300
OK, these are these are we're describing space groups.

1708
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,900
This is going to be a race of space groups.

1709
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:17,420
Here's OK. They would never do this.

1710
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:19,540
And this is a reverse of what I'm saying.

1711
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:24,740
But in concept, does the idea of an alien invasion

1712
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:28,140
at Disneyland sound awesome for a Halloween event or something?

1713
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:29,740
Yeah, definitely. That sounds awesome.

1714
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:31,860
A gate opens and a bunch of aliens come. Yes.

1715
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:35,540
Or they're hiding in different spots and like the whole thing is scary.

1716
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:38,620
I don't they would never do it because I don't think they want to like

1717
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:42,580
have you leave a castle park having a creepy feeling.

1718
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:47,300
But with like the right lights and soundtrack, I think it would be really awesome.

1719
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:48,540
What if they're friendly?

1720
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:50,700
Hoo hoo. You found me.

1721
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:52,540
It's like the Mr. Burns.

1722
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:55,180
Now, can you define friendly?

1723
01:23:57,100 --> 01:24:00,180
What if they're hot and friendly?

1724
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:02,820
Combine the two.

1725
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:07,020
Please touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto.

1726
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:11,100
Yeah, and they're funny and they're topical to play no modern music.

1727
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,900
So it's very they're very inviting.

1728
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:16,100
You you understand these people, you relate to them, these aliens, excuse me.

1729
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:18,980
So it's an ethereal, glowing light life.

1730
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:23,380
But you need like you're doing the bar stool like sports like,

1731
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:26,060
oh, and then it's perfect ten in the face. Yeah.

1732
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:29,740
I'm grading them on the bar stool scale. Yeah, for sure.

1733
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:31,180
It's not something I do in my real life.

1734
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:34,540
I'm just again, I'm trying to make this seem more fun or inviting

1735
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:36,020
and make the aliens less scary.

1736
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:38,540
No, none of the light keepers are fours.

1737
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:40,900
You need them to be. You need them to be ten.

1738
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:43,100
Yeah, I like this. Yeah, I am.

1739
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:45,940
I am made of pure light and energy.

1740
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:51,460
In through me flows all information and images throughout all of time.

1741
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:54,540
Yeah. Looking at your face, though, kind of an eight.

1742
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:59,620
Well, you got any people that looked like they'd be hanging out

1743
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:03,060
with Spud's Mackenzie, the dog.

1744
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:05,260
Any bikini beads back there?

1745
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:07,700
Well, when you thought of like what a lady was a ten,

1746
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:09,780
you think of like Spud's Mackenzie.

1747
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:12,180
I think beer commercials. I see what you're saying.

1748
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:15,740
I think in like a bikini clad tenders to Spud's Mackenzie. Yes.

1749
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:19,740
I'm thinking of like Fabio face to like a Fabio type of a guy

1750
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:22,780
who's just like a romance novel cover. Yeah, a class.

1751
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:25,940
Your idea of a ten is Fabio.

1752
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:29,500
Well, he's technically I mean, I guess you would more consider a Brad Pitt

1753
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:31,060
a ten, I suppose.

1754
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:34,580
But in my mind, you know, I'm a pro wrestling fan.

1755
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:38,660
So I think more of the the bulkier man is being a ten, I suppose.

1756
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:41,060
Didn't impress Janiah Twain much.

1757
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:43,900
It's true. So there'll be a variety of tens.

1758
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:46,660
OK, so you're a light keeper.

1759
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:48,380
That don't impress me.

1760
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:50,700
There's different flavors of tens in my pitch.

1761
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:52,820
OK, it doesn't have to be the specific.

1762
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:55,100
There's a beer commercial ten.

1763
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,980
It's a pro wrestling ten.

1764
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:59,180
It's all a variety of tens in this scenario.

1765
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:02,620
You know, to make you I hate to make you grade

1766
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:06,540
Melo Melo D. Oh, yeah.

1767
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:08,700
Oh, D Melo, I got to pull her up.

1768
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,620
I had her before. Right here you go.

1769
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:12,540
Sorry, you got to get Melody.

1770
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:16,900
This is trickier because she's not a human woman.

1771
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:19,060
There would be a light keeper.

1772
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:23,780
But I'm let me compare her to Jenny from Bucky O'Hare.

1773
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:27,100
Who I can only imagine is a ten.

1774
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:28,860
Jenny, I guess is a ten.

1775
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:31,220
Yeah, probably.

1776
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:36,180
So I'm this is the only this is the most sexist thing I've ever done on the show.

1777
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:38,300
I just want to be clear that I know what I'm doing here.

1778
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:41,020
I'm going to say she's like an eight.

1779
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:42,500
I'm going to give her an eight.

1780
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:43,500
OK. All right.

1781
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:46,820
Well, you know, still in the top, still in the top five.

1782
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:49,940
Let me see. That's a B.

1783
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:51,660
It's a B minus.

1784
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:53,620
Jenny from Bucky O'Hare.

1785
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:55,020
Here she is.

1786
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:59,860
Obvious. Obviously.

1787
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:02,780
Very serious. I'm very serious.

1788
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:06,540
Yeah. So that's even even ascribing a score to this character

1789
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:10,020
who has weird notes all over her, as mentioned before,

1790
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:13,740
including like female fingers are more delicate.

1791
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:17,380
Oh, God, it says sexy pelvic tilt.

1792
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:20,420
This is the weirdest part I've ever seen.

1793
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:22,700
It has the word sexual on it.

1794
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,100
And there's lots of weird notes.

1795
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:25,340
And we're given a number.

1796
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,140
I think we're in a strange area here.

1797
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:28,580
Maybe maybe this is all you think.

1798
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:29,780
Why should we?

1799
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:34,420
We're like to is canceled because the series Bible was just like,

1800
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:35,740
oh, no, that's too creepy.

1801
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:38,100
We're not building this right.

1802
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:41,300
Jason, what would you I hate to hate to ask you the question now.

1803
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:42,260
One to ten.

1804
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:45,220
How would you rank Bucky O'Hare character Mimi LaFleur?

1805
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,500
I those pictures are so small.

1806
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,100
Oh, I saw you want me to bring her over here.

1807
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:52,380
Yeah, bring her up.

1808
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:55,500
Yeah, bring her over this way.

1809
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:58,020
So maybe to send me me right this day.

1810
01:27:58,020 --> 01:27:59,820
Maybe it's very pretty.

1811
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:02,780
She's in her like work uniform, though.

1812
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:05,740
Well, yeah, she's got her like general stuff.

1813
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:12,180
Yes, her army space army is I can't even I can't process Mimi LaFleur

1814
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:14,260
on a scale of one to ten.

1815
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:16,300
Well, that was my problem, too.

1816
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:17,100
That was my problem, too.

1817
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,500
When you quiz me, I guess.

1818
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:19,300
Yeah, yeah.

1819
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:20,060
Well, yeah.

1820
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:23,340
But I think you got there more easily than me because I think maybe you have

1821
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,340
thought about a number for Bucky O'Hare character.

1822
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:28,020
Do you want to see Mimi in her prison outfit?

1823
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:31,380
Because this is her in her like orange prison suit.

1824
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:34,820
That doesn't change much.

1825
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:35,660
All right.

1826
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:36,900
It covers everything.

1827
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:39,380
Yeah, these are all very modest outfits you're showing.

1828
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,460
Yeah, OK.

1829
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:42,060
Let's let's let's wind this down.

1830
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:45,980
I mean, so, yeah, we didn't get to meet Melody and the light keepers

1831
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:48,420
and we didn't get to ascribe numbers to them.

1832
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,740
And it's all said, I really quickly just want to say

1833
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:55,860
sci fi city in Tokyo, which maybe we can't get into a ton.

1834
01:28:55,860 --> 01:29:00,180
But I wanted to shout out that really cool sounding ride called UFO Encounter.

1835
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:03,100
And the idea of this, this would have been a tower of terror.

1836
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:08,060
But that going up, the up and down nature of it is getting abducted.

1837
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:09,340
That's a beam.

1838
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:10,460
Oh, track that.

1839
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:12,100
Isn't that a good idea?

1840
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:13,100
A tower of terror.

1841
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:14,460
But you're in a tractor beam.

1842
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:16,300
Awesome. That is really good.

1843
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:19,900
That's really it is that ride system like you would like.

1844
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:20,460
There's what?

1845
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:22,780
Only two versions of it, really, now at this point.

1846
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:27,180
But there's there's the Geyser Mountain, too, which is the tower of terror.

1847
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:30,980
That was just like you were going down to see like robots doing like mining.

1848
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:33,580
And then Geyser bursts and shoots you up.

1849
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:36,700
That's another great version of that, too, that never got built.

1850
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:37,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1851
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:41,220
So it might have also had something called a version of the rock and roller

1852
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:44,100
coaster, but where you're launched into an alien computer system.

1853
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:48,060
And it is called the place that you're launched into is called the cyber mid.

1854
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:49,500
Perfect.

1855
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:53,460
Which is it's tough to unhear the current use of mid, but you know, it's pyramid.

1856
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:54,700
It's not right. Right. Right.

1857
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:57,260
It's a cyber mid.

1858
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:59,340
Great. The opposite of Pira.

1859
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:00,860
That's that's really good.

1860
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:04,060
Cyber mid. So anyway, and like and this would have had something cooler

1861
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:05,860
than rocker rods, rocket bikes.

1862
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:09,700
They would have cracked the issue of a fast ride system moving all around.

1863
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:13,300
And this looks very much the concept are in this look very much like the

1864
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:17,580
like by way of fifties Dexter Jester future.

1865
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:20,540
Yeah. So just another cool unbuilt.

1866
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:22,900
I would have taken either

1867
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:24,940
is the thing that we're pining for the most Plectu.

1868
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:26,380
Is that the saddest loss?

1869
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:30,380
I believe so. Yeah, that for sure is my biggest regret.

1870
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:35,380
Yeah. Yeah. Well, let's see if any of these ideas end up factoring into

1871
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:40,660
that episode or do we just do we could cancel it and instead do

1872
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:45,260
a fixing our high school years.

1873
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:50,460
And we draw straw, we pick numbers again and we go, OK, so you have

1874
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:55,900
the same amount of sexual drive and libido that you did in high school.

1875
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:57,900
And then you have a middle amount.

1876
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:02,060
And then one of somebody gets a blue sky amount of self.

1877
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:05,300
And I guess confidence you would need as well. Of tea.

1878
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:07,020
Yeah. Yeah. OK.

1879
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:08,860
So there's a there's a supply of straw.

1880
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:10,580
You only get a little bit.

1881
01:31:10,580 --> 01:31:12,580
OK. Yeah. Yeah.

1882
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:15,820
And we'll see. But, you know, ultimately, the blue sky does end up with you

1883
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:19,340
making out while bros big grand theft auto in the other room.

1884
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:20,780
This much we know. OK.

1885
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:21,740
Yeah, we could do that.

1886
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:24,980
At least went to another room that's much more polite for everyone.

1887
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:28,060
Well, I would say I was going to say at the very least, reading a Bucky O'Hare

1888
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:30,180
comic with this photo of Mimi LaFleur.

1889
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:33,420
It's a full body shot of Mimi LaFleur.

1890
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:36,620
Revised lyric.

1891
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:41,820
Read me a Mimi LaFleur comic while your bros play Grand Theft Auto.

1892
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:46,180
Yeah, no, no activity, no body activity, no body count is occurring.

1893
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:48,460
No, we are not adding to my body.

1894
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:52,780
Every room in this house is all the dorky shit's happening.

1895
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:55,100
OK, well, I think we did it.

1896
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:57,700
I think you survived podcast the ride, the second gate.

The song I was trying to place was missing persons.

1902
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:14,620
No one is thinking about it now, but I just wanted to declare that I got there.

1903
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:15,940
OK, I did think of it.

1904
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:18,620
