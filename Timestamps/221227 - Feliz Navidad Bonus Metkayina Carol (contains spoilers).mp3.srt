Welcome to a little bonus, Feliz Navidad, the way of winter, a Yuletide celebration of all things

5
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,920
Avatar here on podcast the ride the civico gate. I'm Scott Gardner and it's just me. I'm doing this

6
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,840
without Mike and Jason and frankly without their permission. But I needed to do it because I have

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,600
some things to get off my chest. First of all I hope that you've had a wonderful holiday season

8
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,520
and that you've taken some time out to reflect on the reason for the season, JC. That of course

9
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,280
being James Cameron and his new film Avatar the way of water. Let me say something about this movie.

10
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,680
I fucking loved this movie. Holy shit. I think it blows the first Avatar out of the water

11
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,200
appropriately. If you've been on the fence about Avatar this whole time as I used to be,

12
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,760
this is the place to get in. I think it's fantastic and I've been thinking about the movie non-stop

13
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:53,520
since I saw it and especially one scene in particular that is so instantly iconic and

14
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,720
instantly way up there in the James Cameron great moment, Spantheon. And if you've seen the movie,

15
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,800
I think you know which scene I'm talking about. And that's kind of why I'm here is that I wanted

16
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,520
to process this moment and I figured what better way to do it than with a carol, with one more

17
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:21,520
carol. But let's be clear this is not an Emoticaya carol. This is a Metcaena carol because they are

18
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:29,680
the water people. That's who this new film focuses on. And really quick, I have to issue a sincere

19
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:37,360
spoiler warning. If you have not seen Avatar way of water yet, there are spoilers in this carol.

20
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,560
So if you haven't seen the movie, let this motivate you to see it because I know how much you want to

21
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,720
hear this song. It's going to start in several seconds. So pause it, go buy an expensive movie

22
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,880
ticket and drive to see the movie for four hours, then come back and listen to the song. But here in

23
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,800
real time, I'm going to start the song. Please enjoy the first ever Metcaena carol, a tribute to

24
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:14,000
my favorite scene in Avatar way of water. Out of all the space whales, you know you're the mastermind.

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,280
Jump, jump, Pyocon, Lowoxys that you are kind.

26
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,280
Jump, jump, Pyocon, Quaritch wants to burn up the town.

27
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,280
Sully's on the ropes and only you can take the poachers down.

28
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Jump, jump, Pyocon, time to crush them into the ground.

29
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,280
Now I know that you were banished by your species and the water.

30
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,560
I know that you were banished by your species and the water clan.

31
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,560
But the poachers killed your family and your family is your fortress man.

32
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,560
You are my brother, flatten them as fast as you can.

33
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,560
Jump, jump, Pyocon, wisest of the great Tol'kun.

34
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,560
The stupid poacher thinks he's smart cause he's the one with the harpoon.

35
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:17,340
Jump on those fuckers, splat them like a water balloon.

36
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:23,340
Where the evil Aussie hunter only thinks about financial gain.

37
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:29,340
He's gotta meet his quota and suck all the goo right out of your brain.

38
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,340
Yank that cable, chop his arm off like a samurai blade.

39
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,340
Let's three brothers rock!

40
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Damn, Pyocon, you are a composer of songs.

41
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,120
Jump, jump, Pyocon, revenge is what you gotta get.

42
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,120
When the soldiers see you coming, all their camo pants are gonna get wet.

43
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,120
Jump, jump, Pyocon, time to kill Jemaine Clement.

44
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,120
You survived Feliz Navidad the way of Winter Civico Gate Mini Met Kiana Carol Edition.

45
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,120
