00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
Aloha! Podcast the Ride is doing its first live show August 9th in Sherman Oaks, California

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,160
in a beautiful abandoned sports authority with special guest Tony Baxter. Can you believe,

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,040
I still kind of can't believe it, you two.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,040
Yeah, I can't believe it.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,240
It's our hero who we've talked about on most episodes and a guy I've been obsessed with

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,480
since I was 10 years old and he did all my favorite things and we're gonna talk to him

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,480
in front of people.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,440
Yeah, and it's going to be embarrassing for us but also hopefully sweet. So like, please

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,000
come out, like this is gonna be fun, it's 10 bucks, I mean come on!

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,440
Gotta do it. And you'll get to see this amazing gallery, the collection of Richard Kraft who

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,840
we're also gonna talk to as well. You get to take photos with Dumbo cars and monorail

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,440
innards and gears, gears probably too.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:55,480
Yeah, you know, severed limbs from sea serpents from the submarine voyage, I don't know exactly

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,080
what's there, things like that.

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,800
The exhibition is free and is running for most of the month of August, tickets for separate

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,680
events, like our show, again, $10, or there's a signing with the artist Shag, Paul Scheer

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,200
is doing a show, Alan Menken is doing a show at the end of the month.

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,640
This is starting to sound desperate. I think we should ease off the throttle and just let

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,560
people enjoy going to our site, good look in the show description, you're gonna come,

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,160
it's gonna be chill, you're gonna have a great time. And now you're gonna have a great time

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,160
listening to our regular episode.

22
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,120
Warning, the following podcasts may contain neck damage, heel turns, and an aggressive

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,280
look at Houston's astral world with guest Nick Mundy. Grab your cool teen friends, it's

24
00:01:39,280 --> 00:02:01,400
podcast the ride.

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,200
Welcome to podcast the ride hosted by three guys who in high school did way less coming

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,320
out and socializing than the grim grinning ghosts.

27
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:17,720
They come out and socialize, what's that? What does that mean? Joining us, hey, I'm

28
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,240
Scott Gardner and joining me as always Mike Carlson.

29
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,400
Hey, yeah, those ghosts partied hard and I did not.

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,480
They know over 900 other ghosts.

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,160
Yeah, and they're like, they rode bikes, they did a lot of fun, they popped up behind gravestones,

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:41,480
and yeah, they knew girls, they were real cool and I was not real cool.

33
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,920
Yeah, I bet another ghost admirer is Jason Sheridan.

34
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,960
Hi, yeah, I love those ghosts. I don't know, I was reasonably social and then there would

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,880
be times where it's like I wouldn't leave the house all weekend. And when I did, I usually

36
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,960
had a handwritten list of what comics were coming out and on what dates, just so I didn't

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
miss anything.

38
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,800
You had a handwritten list, really?

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Yeah, sure.

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,200
Huh, because I would, look, I had it all up here in my brain. I never wrote it down what

41
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,360
comics I was getting. I knew on Wednesday, I knew which date the uncanny X-Men would

42
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,560
come out and I would just know and then I would go there.

43
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,120
That's true. Some years I had subscriptions, so they would just come to my house.

44
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,240
I had subscriptions too for a few months, but they would come after the release date

45
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
of the comic store.

46
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,760
Usually after the release date, yeah.

47
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,320
And I hated that, so I canceled my subscription because I could not wait for the new issues.

48
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Yeah, that was annoying. I mean, nowadays people would be up in arms because I think

49
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,880
if you pre-order a new release video game, it arrives the day it comes out.

50
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,680
Right, so yeah, that was unacceptable. How did you guys order your comic books?

51
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,800
You guys keep going without me.

52
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,360
We don't have to talk.

53
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,680
When I was in detention, I was bored and I asked the kid sitting next to me if I could

54
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
read his.

55
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
Oh, sure.

56
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
That's cool.

57
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:10,280
Makes sense. In character. That was the voice of... I don't even know what that means exactly.

58
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,960
That was the voice of a highly anticipated guest. We're so excited he's here.

59
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
He's finally here.

60
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:21,280
From the Team Tiger Awesome Show podcast from Conan and The Rock's best friend, it's Nick

61
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,840
Mundy, ladies and gentlemen.

62
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,320
Hey guys, thanks for having me.

63
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
Hello.

64
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
Thank you for coming.

65
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,760
I'm a little under the weather, so I apologize if I sound nasally, but I'm sure you guys

66
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,320
can run a filter through that.

67
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:39,480
Yeah, I'll clean that up in post. Yeah, just like more bass or higher. Maybe both.

68
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,240
Whatever, I'm not even entirely sure these microphones are plugged in.

69
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
Yeah.

70
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,960
This is just we're luring you to hang out with us.

71
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,960
And we're pretending we're recording it.

72
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,160
We think if it's an official enough reason, he'll come.

73
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,240
I don't know why I said that. I think I'm like that you it because it felt like it felt

74
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,040
like a mild bully move. Like, hey, let me read your comic.

75
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,360
Hey, do you give me your comic?

76
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,600
No, it wasn't a bully move. It was just like, hey, I'm bored. What are you reading? Let

77
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
me read it.

78
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,640
To me reads as like business person on a computer train like, excuse me, reading the sports

79
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
section.

80
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,760
No, it wasn't that nice. But it was like, yeah, like I want to read it too.

81
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,400
But would you take it?

82
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,000
No. Did you ever take stuff from like dweebs in high school?

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,480
No, I never picked on dweebs. I picked on the popular kids.

84
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,920
OK, so you were like kind of in the middle?

85
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,520
Yeah, I was just kind of for the last two years of high school, like a burnout.

86
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,720
OK, but do you have like a good group of friends or was it you?

87
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Yeah, no, I had a good group of friends.

88
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,240
OK, and they were all burnouts or they were all kids?

89
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,560
Yeah, it was like mostly burnouts.

90
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,960
OK, so you would harass cool kids.

91
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,960
I didn't harass anyone.

92
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,040
OK, I'm just saying like you would you would goof on the popular kids.

93
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Sure.

94
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,720
And it was kind of like you were a Robin Hood. You were stealing the coolest from.

95
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,440
I've been bullied. I made some jokes.

96
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,160
It's like just because I remind you of all of your bullies collectively.

97
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:08,200
I also avoided not just bullies, but all people so thoroughly in high school that I think

98
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,680
I maybe I put you on the bully end of the spectrum because I don't know any better.

99
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,040
I was gregarious.

100
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,880
Yeah, that seems true.

101
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,680
And you know, talk like Beavis.

102
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Oh really?

103
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Well, no, just like inadvertently.

104
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
OK.

105
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,960
It was like, let me see that comic book.

106
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,720
Is that like the cartoon?

107
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,640
So you were like the Pauly Shore character from a goofy movie?

108
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
More or less, yes.

109
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
That sounds fun.

110
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,240
Yeah, which I didn't watch until like a year ago because my wife made me because that was

111
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
just.

112
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
Who is Pauly Shore playing a Coonchoo movie?

113
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240
The friend?

114
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,240
Pauly Shore.

115
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
The guy who sounds like Pauly Shore who says.

116
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,720
I haven't seen it since I was a kid.

117
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
I got to rewatch that.

118
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
He's the cheese whiz.

119
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
He does.

120
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Oh, the cheese guy.

121
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Yeah, yeah.

122
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
Whatever that line is in it.

123
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
Sure.

124
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Yeah.

125
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
The goofy movie, of course, has the best Disney song, which is I.T.I.

126
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
The Paralyze song?

127
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
Yeah, Paralyze.

128
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,320
What do you think having not grown up with it?

129
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,720
Because it seems like there is like there's been this groundswell of people.

130
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,880
I feel like everybody was quiet about how much they love the goofy movie.

131
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,040
And it is just it is back full force at this point.

132
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,480
It's a cultural phenomenon that completely passed me by.

133
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,560
Yeah, right?

134
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
It's just shit.

135
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
You didn't like it?

136
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
It sucks.

137
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Oh, OK.

138
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,440
I don't get it.

139
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,440
You're bullying our audience already.

140
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,720
No, I just like, look, if you like it, cool.

141
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,120
I mean, you know, I'm not going to get all Carlson, Last Jedi on it.

142
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,760
But I just edit half hour tangent from podcast.

143
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
All right, we're back.

144
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
So you were saying about goofy movie.

145
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Yeah.

146
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,760
It didn't.

147
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
It did.

148
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,760
It didn't click.

149
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,360
I mean, yeah, it just I missed a lot of stuff out like when I was a kid, because my parents

150
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,240
were never like, hey, here's like a Disney movie.

151
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,240
Here's like a cartoon.

152
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,600
I remember the day before fourth grade, my dad was like, hey, I rented two movies and

153
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,720
there were total recop and Robocop to total recap.

154
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,840
I mean, total recall and Robocop to kick ass merger, though.

155
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,200
You were just all cool like action films from day one.

156
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,440
It's like that's all I had because my grandmother also had HBO and she would tape every movie.

157
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,760
And so she had this like unauthorized library of every single Steven Seagal Jean Claude

158
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,160
Van Damme Chuck Norris.

159
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,160
So like so just ultraviolence.

160
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,440
Yeah, she would get a class of 1999 day of the prayer of the Roller Boys.

161
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,520
It would be like it was completely organized.

162
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,760
Oh, yeah, no.

163
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Check out Prayer of the Roller Boys.

164
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,880
Do you not know about what a title the post apocalyptic movie that takes place in 1999

165
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,840
about Corey Haim taking down a white supremacist roller game?

166
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,840
I have never heard of this.

167
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,840
Oh, my God.

168
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Now, I've been watching the movie.

169
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,720
You're watching a goofy movie and you're watching Prayer of the Roller Boys, Cybercop.

170
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,040
The one that you made me watch and I fell asleep during No Retreat, No Surrender, No

171
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
Retreat, No Surrender.

172
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,960
I really felt like I disappointed you.

173
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,360
That was like your like philosophical core movie.

174
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,560
Yeah, that was a karate kid ripoff where instead of Mr. Miyagi, it was Bruce Lee's ghost.

175
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Well, weird.

176
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,240
And Jean Claude Van Damme was the Russian bad guy.

177
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,880
No Retreat, No Surrender is what I say when I get to the buffet portion, the dessert portion

178
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
of a buffet.

179
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,800
Like I'm already probably too full.

180
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,000
I shouldn't have more than just like one bite and I still come back with a dinner plate

181
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
full of treats.

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Because you paid.

183
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah.

184
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah, and you got to get the most out of it.

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,200
Well, I also don't know what you're going to like so I got to sample everything before

186
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
I see.

187
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
A quick note.

188
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,720
There was one time when you were working this old job and I went over and I was like, hey,

189
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
do you want to have lunch?

190
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
And you were like, yeah, yeah.

191
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,200
And I was like, hey, why don't we, it'd be funny if you go to that hometown buffet and

192
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,400
you were like, I don't want to spend eight dollars.

193
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,640
I think I more just didn't want to take the time.

194
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,480
That's why we do that a little bit on the show.

195
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,680
But he is like the heartthrob of the show.

196
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
I agree.

197
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
I am the heartthrob.

198
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,440
The internet response has certainly been that Jason is the scene stealer in the show.

199
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,600
Hey Jason, remember that time you couldn't afford stuff?

200
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Yeah.

201
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
He had a job.

202
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,480
It was eight dollars.

203
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Yeah.

204
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,800
You should see what he would spend on a dessert alone.

205
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,080
Speaking of bullying, what was that?

206
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,520
I'm a little I'm a heel on this show often.

207
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,760
I feel like the jerk.

208
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,560
I'm the one who was yelling at you guys about the amount of days to spend.

209
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,960
I've been trying to cool it ever since.

210
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,680
That was a real wake up call for me.

211
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,240
We all disagreed about how many days are the optimal amount to spend to the Tokyo Disney

212
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Resort.

213
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,880
You see, Nick, what's the optimal amount?

214
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,760
Well the fans have spoken, I think, and they resoundingly I think agree with Jason that

215
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,200
four days is the amount of days.

216
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,480
Scott believes it's two, which everyone except for maybe one person says is insanity online.

217
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,600
I said three.

218
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
That's what we were planning to do.

219
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,840
Did more than three people weigh in on this?

220
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,160
I believe like six people.

221
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
I would say around six.

222
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,560
It wasn't three, it was six.

223
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,560
The overwhelming majority.

224
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
Overwhelming majority.

225
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
It is deafening.

226
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
Yes we can.

227
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Four days.

228
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,840
It's a sample size in my mind.

229
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,120
So this is my last Jedi.

230
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,560
But I want to go.

231
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
I'm excited to go.

232
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,560
How many days do you want to go?

233
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,400
I think two is plenty.

234
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,360
One day for one park and you've done the parks.

235
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,760
There's two parks.

236
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,600
You're not knowing much.

237
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,880
No, I know.

238
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,000
What's the conversion rate from Disneyland to Tokyo Disney?

239
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,280
If you're talking money, it's just an extra hotel room because it's only I think 30 extra

240
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,840
bucks or something for the third day.

241
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,240
If Disney is like a hundred bucks, how much is like Tokyo Disney America?

242
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
It's less money.

243
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,160
I think it's like 60 to 70 because it's subsidized by the Japanese government.

244
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,320
I would only do two days but I can see why Carlson would do four if it's that amount

245
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
of money.

246
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,960
Now is this insanity that he says two days?

247
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,480
Yes, it's upsetting because here it's Tokyo Disney.

248
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,000
Fair enough, fair enough.

249
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
For you, yes.

250
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,560
I'm not talking about for me, two days, yes.

251
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
But for some nerds.

252
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
For you, yeah.

253
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,960
I can see why you would want to go four or five days.

254
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,120
Tokyo Disney is supposed to be the best theme park in the world.

255
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
That's all I'm saying.

256
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,920
Look, let's just compromise and admit that this makes for awful broadcasting.

257
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,240
To re-litigate the same issue over and over again with no understanding.

258
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,480
It's like a catchphrase.

259
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
It's a recurring plot.

260
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
Oh, okay.

261
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,760
Well, when you frame it like that.

262
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,360
Yeah, you're opening 90 minute play around.

263
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,640
Yeah, or play around.

264
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,720
You know, comedy is play, I say as I load the barrel of the gun into my mouth.

265
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:26,400
You know, these kinds of recurring arguments about days to spend at resorts, this is the

266
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,720
kind of fun that you, Nick Mundy, made possible.

267
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
Yes.

268
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,000
And allow me to explain the backstory.

269
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,840
This is a crucial piece of the backstory of this podcast that I don't think people know.

270
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,040
And feel free to give me your version of these events, Mike.

271
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
But in my mind.

272
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
We have four people.

273
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,640
We have enough to do a full Rashomon of how this happens.

274
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,880
You mean a full Arrested Development Season 4.

275
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
Yes.

276
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,480
So that just supplanted Rashomon.

277
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:02,880
Okay, so in my mind, the backstory of this podcast is that, Nick, you were doing a podcast

278
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,760
for a different network and a different network than No Network, which is what we're on.

279
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,280
And you just, you went to Mike and said, hey, do it, do a theme park podcast, theme park

280
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
podcast.

281
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
It's a home run.

282
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Do it, get it off the ground.

283
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,760
And then we ended up having that.

284
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
That sounds accurate.

285
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,760
Yeah.

286
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Well, I assume with a hey, Duder.

287
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,960
I don't know if you call me Duder.

288
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,920
I don't think you call me that.

289
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,280
But other than that, it's very accurate.

290
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,120
By the end of this show, I hope you'll feel familiar enough to start doing it.

291
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,520
Because yes, my memory is pretty similar.

292
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
It was Jason and I think.

293
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,200
Well, no, the reason I probably don't call you Duder is because you're probably going

294
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,920
to like, after I do it, you go up to Sheridan and be like, yeah, Mundy called me Duder.

295
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,920
I did it.

296
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
I don't get it.

297
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,240
I'm going to bully you behind your back.

298
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
I don't know why I did it.

299
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
It's weird.

300
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
It's uncomfortable.

301
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,480
Does he know dude isn't spelled with an R?

302
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,000
I think I would be fine with that nickname.

303
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,480
It would be fine if you called me that.

304
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,200
All right, Duder, tell me your side of the story.

305
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
It's pretty similar.

306
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,280
I believe Jason and I were over watching wrestling and I think you were like, oh yeah, you guys

307
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
should do the theme park podcast.

308
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
And you were like, oh yeah.

309
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
And you're like, yeah, yeah, do it.

310
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
I mean, you could ask God to do it.

311
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
You should.

312
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
You should do it.

313
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,320
And I'm like, does anybody really want to hear this?

314
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
Does anyone care about this?

315
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,800
Like, there's a lot of theme park podcasts where you're like, no, no, no, you should

316
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
just do it.

317
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,400
It's easy, it's easy, come on, it's a home run, it's a home run.

318
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
That's what I remember.

319
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Oh yeah, I guess.

320
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,880
And like I was thinking about it and like you were so insistent.

321
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,440
I was like, yeah, I guess.

322
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,560
I bullied you into doing something good.

323
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,240
Yes, that is what happens.

324
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,240
That's what happened.

325
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,320
And this is, that's what I'm not complaining to say something you did.

326
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,760
It seems like a bully statement.

327
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,480
That's how we became friends, I believe.

328
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
Sure.

329
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,480
Hey, Duder, we're friends now.

330
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,480
We're hanging out.

331
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
Yeah.

332
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
Come over.

333
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,480
And then four years of just apologizing to your wife for drunken antics that were just

334
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
silly.

335
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,320
Yeah, that's the thing.

336
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Nothing bad ever happened.

337
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,920
You just like spoke at like three times.

338
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,400
What's the opposite of three times speed?

339
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,720
You spoke at a third speed, probably the first five times you met.

340
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,440
Hey, Aaron.

341
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,660
But nothing bad was said at this slow pace.

342
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,660
So I met you after you were...

343
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,560
It's just bad impressions.

344
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,680
So I met you after you were like a reformed, you're like a reformed party boy.

345
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,000
Would you say that?

346
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,680
As I'm wearing a Hawaiian shirt and cargo shorts and Tom's.

347
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,280
Or more mature party boy, maybe?

348
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,840
You've matured into a party boy.

349
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,080
You pick your spots to be a party boy.

350
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
Yeah.

351
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:31,120
But I think party boy might have been a description that I've been referred to as.

352
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,120
Okay, sure.

353
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
Sure.

354
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
Right.

355
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,360
But you know, you pointing at things and making them happen has only led to good.

356
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
Oh, that's another one.

357
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,160
I think on your bachelor party, I think you...

358
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,960
I work a lot with you, Nick, and you have this guy Clint, part of Team Tiger Awesome,

359
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,640
directs you on a lot of things too.

360
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:55,200
And I think you pointed at both of us and then squished us together and said, you two,

361
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,640
be one person.

362
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,960
You are one now.

363
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,080
That's a moment that occurred.

364
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
Yeah, this is all true.

365
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,920
These are all true accounts of things that have happened.

366
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,160
I'm sorry that one we couldn't make happen.

367
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,320
We talked about it and we couldn't figure out how to actually fuse.

368
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,960
But we discussed logistics and tried to make it occur.

369
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,000
This all sounds very, very accurate.

370
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:25,920
No, I just thought like, look, you guys have this interesting love affair of theme parks.

371
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,200
And it's helped me because I had my nieces in town a couple of months ago and Carlson

372
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
made...

373
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,320
We got everything done in 12, 14 hours.

374
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
No, 14 hours.

375
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,320
Yeah.

376
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Because of the pass that...

377
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,320
The MaxPass.

378
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,640
And then as soon as I was like, the MaxPass is great, Carlson was like, Scott doesn't

379
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
like it.

380
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
It started causing controversy.

381
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
Scott doesn't like the MaxPass.

382
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,640
Well, let's keep relitigating everything that's ever happened.

383
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
But it was great.

384
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
I'm pro MaxPass.

385
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
We talked about this.

386
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
I'm not anti MaxPass.

387
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:58,080
I glaze over when logistics and lines and gaming the system is tied about.

388
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,800
I get the shit out of the system.

389
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
No, it was like...

390
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,280
It makes a world of sense to do.

391
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,280
There'd be no reason to not do MaxPass unless of course you're just going to the park to

392
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,960
drink white wine and go on one ride and then leave.

393
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
No, yeah.

394
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
No, I wasn't doing that.

395
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,480
No, but Carlson almost hacked the planet and I looked like a hero in front of my nieces.

396
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,680
We're going on this again?

397
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Yeah.

398
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,400
You're not the only one also who has...

399
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,600
There are people on Twitter for sure have...

400
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,880
I think you have exposed people to this MaxPass situation who are listening to the show.

401
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Well, that's good.

402
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
So you've done a world of good.

403
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,360
No, it's one of those things where I thought it was really interesting.

404
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,960
You guys go to...

405
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,880
It's like you guys go to Disneyland like I would go to islands.

406
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
Even more than you guys would go to islands.

407
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
We also go to islands though too.

408
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,080
And I was like, well, you guys should do it and then maybe it'll distract you from you

409
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,360
complaining about Last Jedi and Scott complaining about people on Deadline getting jobs.

410
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,360
This was before...

411
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,360
Oh no.

412
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
Sorry.

413
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
That was meaner.

414
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:04,360
I'm happy for every single person on Deadline.com.

415
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
I would watch that.

416
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,560
There's some negative stories on there too, Scott.

417
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,320
If you're hired or fired, I'm pro everyone.

418
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,960
I'm just glad to see you up there.

419
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,320
I really love that Chase dude from Lethal Weapon, the TV show got fired.

420
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
Oh, that's right.

421
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Good luck.

422
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
You're free now, Chase.

423
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,440
Oh yeah, but he got replaced by Sean William Scott.

424
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,400
I'm happy to see that guy quite working again.

425
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
That guy seems fun.

426
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,720
If you don't know me, I'll just let you...

427
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,440
A good way to know who I am, I'm very excited for Sean William Scott to join the Lethal

428
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,640
Weapon TV show.

429
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
That's a step up.

430
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,640
That's a very good step up.

431
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
Well, that's nice.

432
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,640
That's nice for him.

433
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,280
No, and I thought you guys just podcast and it's successful and it's all to you.

434
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
Well, it's all to Sheridan.

435
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Sure.

436
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
I didn't know Sheridan at the time.

437
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
They call me the funny one.

438
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
I didn't know Sheridan at the time.

439
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
That's my nickname.

440
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,360
And then you guys are doing it.

441
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
Yeah, we are.

442
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:05,080
Hey, we're very thankful for this pointing out and demanding and we didn't end up on

443
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,840
the podcast network that you were talking about because it was important to us to be

444
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,400
on a podcast network that collapsed in three months.

445
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,400
We were really, really specifically in the market for one that would be decimated and

446
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,280
absolved and that then that worked out well and here we are now and the cycle of life

447
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
continues.

448
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
You're here.

449
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,080
You're in Mike's apartment, even though there is no wrestling event, unless there is later

450
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,080
today.

451
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
No, not this weekend.

452
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
Not this weekend.

453
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,080
We'll talk about it.

454
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,080
Yes.

455
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,080
Yeah.

456
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
There will be a post podcast.

457
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,280
Do you want to use our equipment and record for your podcast?

458
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,700
We all need to help each other out.

459
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
So we just wait for listeners.

460
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,800
If you like our podcast, thank Nick Mundy for that.

461
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,720
Give him a little thanks, you know, thank Dick Fundy.

462
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,360
Wait, is your Twitter name is Dick Fundy?

463
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,320
Not in its attic fundy.

464
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,360
It's not one is the name and one's the app.

465
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,080
If you search your name, it'll come up right.

466
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,080
That's what I think.

467
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,880
So OK, I agree.

468
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Everyone think Nick.

469
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Yeah, give me a look for threatening.

470
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,600
Everyone think like I don't know if this is like a podcast, the right inside joke where

471
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
thanking is like, fuck you.

472
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah, yeah, thinking's inverse here.

473
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,320
No, I was I'm that's you're right.

474
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,000
It did was an odd delivery, but I do want that to happen.

475
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,720
It sounded like a nice day on Twitter.

476
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,120
Everybody Cheshire cat like, yes, thank you.

477
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
I was sincere, though.

478
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,760
I thank you guys for putting out such great content.

479
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
Yay.

480
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,760
Thanks for calling it content.

481
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,720
Everyone's favorite word.

482
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Yeah.

483
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,480
Well, I guess the content we're talking about today, if theme parks also count as

484
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,320
content is Astro World.

485
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,320
Yes.

486
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
Do you?

487
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,200
I'm not even going to call it a member of the six lights.

488
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
It's yeah, I guess so.

489
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,120
When it was when it was retired, when it was shut down, it was a member of the Six Flags

490
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,120
family.

491
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,200
The wonderful world of fun.

492
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,520
The tagline for Astro World.

493
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Oh, OK.

494
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:08,120
I also saw ads that said it puts you in the middle of fun, which is kind of a lot.

495
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,800
There was like fun town and funville.

496
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Yeah.

497
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,880
I saw an ad that just said the middle of fun.

498
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,960
And I'm like, what does that mean?

499
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,680
In the middle of fun makes a lot more sense to me.

500
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,440
But I was just like, the middle of the middle of fun in Houston, Texas has always been six

501
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,040
ten and Kirby.

502
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,960
Like that is the cross section for for fun.

503
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
Yeah.

504
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
That's a lot of Houston references.

505
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Yeah.

506
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,960
We're getting a lot of Houston.

507
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,080
Houston is not in the middle of the state geography wise.

508
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
No, but no one.

509
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,360
Everyone in Houston doesn't care about the rest of Texas.

510
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,360
Yeah.

511
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,360
OK.

512
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,280
So it's a whole like it's a it should be like an island.

513
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
Yeah.

514
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,280
Like Houston Port City, correct?

515
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Coming in and out.

516
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
Yeah.

517
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
Yeah.

518
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
Tell us a little about Houston.

519
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
So I grew up there.

520
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,200
I moved there when I was like three from Virginia, where my dad was a cop.

521
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,120
But you know, it just had a great like normal suburban childhood.

522
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,920
I lived just outside the city, grew up going to Astros games at the Astro World.

523
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
No, grew up.

524
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,040
I mean, Astro Dome.

525
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,200
And then, you know, got older.

526
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,600
I went to Astro games at Minamate Park, which was formerly Enron Field, which is a Houston

527
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
home of Enron.

528
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,200
And the Astros themselves were once called Colt 45s, the Colt 45s.

529
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,080
To not know that fact until this week.

530
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,080
Yeah.

531
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,000
Only two years in the 60s.

532
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,520
That's on game with some of the stuff in this park.

533
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:41,880
So in the 60s, that's when Houston had its first like big expansion and it was NASA,

534
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,920
it was a space city.

535
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,480
And they built the eighth Wonder of the World Astro Dome, which is still standing, which

536
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,760
has just been sitting there for almost 20 years doing nothing.

537
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,760
So weird.

538
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,160
Has anything happened there?

539
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,480
It hasn't been used regularly since 1999.

540
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
Wait, really?

541
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,440
So it's just a giant empty stadium?

542
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
Yeah.

543
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,720
For a few years, there was like high school football games.

544
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,280
Like my brother played a championship game there and WrestleMania 17, the greatest WrestleMania

545
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,280
was there, which I was there.

546
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,280
In what year?

547
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
2001.

548
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,840
And that might've been the last major event in the Astro Dome.

549
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,480
And then it's just then for like 18 years, they've been just like, what are we going

550
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
to do with it?

551
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,800
And there's been like, do we tear it down?

552
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,800
No one wants to tear it down, but no one has anything to do with it.

553
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:33,640
So they built a, they're turning into like, you know, shopping center, parking lot, apartment

554
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,400
complex, maybe, who knows?

555
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
It's a boring shit.

556
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,640
I'll just see like on a random like Twitter post, like, hey, the new plan for the Astro

557
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,520
Dome, which is replacing the old plan, which is, you know, it's just every couple of days.

558
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:54,440
And so across the street from the Astro Astro Dome was Astro World, which I think Rafe Hoffines

559
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,040
opened it up in like 68.

560
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Yeah.

561
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
I look, I found it out about him.

562
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,640
Mostly the father of Houston.

563
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,640
Yeah.

564
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,200
He was, he was a judge in Houston and the mayor at one point in time before all this, before

565
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
the sixties revival.

566
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,040
But yeah, he became like a millionaire.

567
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
Yeah.

568
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,960
And he was responsible for, he helped, he was instrumental in starting the Astros themselves,

569
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,200
the Astro Dome, Astro Turf first used it Astro, the Astro Dome.

570
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,640
Oh, is that where that comes from?

571
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,640
That term comes from?

572
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,640
Yeah.

573
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,640
I didn't realize that.

574
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,240
The Astro Dome, when it was, you guys would have loved the Astro Dome.

575
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,240
Yeah, I bet.

576
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,600
Like rainbow seats, air conditioning.

577
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
That's it.

578
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
Cool fogs.

579
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
You had me at the rainbow.

580
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,640
Yeah, you had me at air conditioning.

581
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,640
Cigarette, neon ads, you know.

582
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,640
Oh man.

583
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,800
What's the, what's the scoreboard that people were fond of?

584
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:50,200
Oh, the big, yeah, the scoreboard was, it was this led light, you know, big ass light,

585
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,800
this black and white scoreboard that just like had Texas, like Cowboys shooting every time

586
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,480
like the Oilers or the Astros would score.

587
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,480
That's fun.

588
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
Maybe an early electronic scoreboard.

589
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,360
Yeah, no, it was like one of the highest tech in like 1964 or five.

590
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
Yeah.

591
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,640
But no, the Astro Dome was huge.

592
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,520
I mean, that was one of the most iconic, you know, symbols of Houston.

593
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,380
Now it's dwarfed by the giant football stadium next to it.

594
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,760
And then Minamate Park is downtown Houston.

595
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,680
They just stack all this stuff kind of next to each other.

596
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:25,560
The Astro Dome is, the football stadium, which I think is NRG stadium now, is right next

597
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,560
to the Astro Dome.

598
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,560
Okay.

599
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,760
And then which I was, when I was in college in downtown Houston, I watched it built.

600
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
Oh really?

601
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,120
And then Minamate Park is in like what's called downtown Houston.

602
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,640
Okay, sure.

603
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,960
This is similar in Philadelphia, where the 76ers play is next to the football stadium,

604
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,720
where the Eagles play is next to Citizens Bank Park, where the Phillies play.

605
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,200
And it's all just kind of in one traffic jammed area in South Philadelphia.

606
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,800
Though it's nice when all this can be the case, when they can actually design kind of

607
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,960
a consolidated area as opposed to.

608
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,960
Yeah, it helps with like giant parking lots next to each other and like.

609
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,840
Well, don't spoil the end of Astro World.

610
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
Oh yeah.

611
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,840
Oh no.

612
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,840
Well, sure.

613
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,840
I mean, that comes into play.

614
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,840
It's crazy because I didn't realize that the Astro Dome sat vacant for so long.

615
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,840
Yeah.

616
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:22,400
But that just adds on to the quagmire that is at the end of this story.

617
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,800
It's very confusing and I never, in my research, I did not really do a lot of digging about

618
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,880
why the Astro World went away.

619
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:37,200
And it seems like very just mundane, it didn't flame out in a super fun way like hard right

620
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
now.

621
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
Do we want to save it for later?

622
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,080
I guess save it for I guess we'll just leave that as a nice talk about the glory days first.

623
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,120
Is it true also that this whole zone was referred to as the Astro Domain?

624
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,800
Yeah, I believe so.

625
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Yeah, yeah.

626
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Because I like that name.

627
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,600
The name of like a book about everything I came across.

628
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,560
There was also the Astro Arena where like smaller bands would play and it would also

629
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,840
be like rodeo overflow.

630
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Oh, sure.

631
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,840
Because the rodeo is a huge part of.

632
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,040
Did Houston Livestock and Rodeo show play a lot into the story?

633
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:15,480
Oh yeah, no, it's like that in February, Houston is all about the rodeo.

634
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,040
Did you go?

635
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,280
I went once to see Earth, Wind and Fire.

636
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
Okay, nice.

637
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,080
I did not.

638
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,180
I love Houston.

639
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,180
It's great.

640
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,180
It's my home.

641
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,240
I did not get the rodeo, but the rodeo was a big, big deal.

642
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:35,160
The coolest thing I ever saw at the rodeo was this was I think I was in like fifth or sixth

643
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
grade.

644
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,160
I was with my parents and my brother and we were like saw Suburban and my dad was like

645
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,200
thinking about getting a Suburban.

646
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,200
So we were looking in it and had a Super Nintendo built into it, which I thought was the coolest

647
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,880
thing in the world in 1992.

648
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,160
And then I just, that's all I talked about when my dad like, yeah, I'm going to get a

649
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
new car.

650
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,160
My dad's from Long Island.

651
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,560
So it's a, are you getting the Super Nintendo car?

652
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,560
He didn't get those.

653
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,560
He did not get the Super Nintendo.

654
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,600
Why don't those exist today?

655
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,000
So childhood was terrible.

656
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Yeah.

657
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah, that sucks.

658
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,960
But everyone's going to go to Astroworld.

659
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
Yeah.

660
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,840
So how often would you go?

661
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:15,640
I didn't go a ton when I was a kid because we lived in North Houston and that area of

662
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,080
town was not great.

663
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,520
Downtown Houston in the nineties, early nineties, the crime wasn't good.

664
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
It wasn't good crime.

665
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,720
You know, well like it was a, there used to be the show that I watched as a kid when I

666
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,520
wasn't watching Disney movies.

667
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:36,120
It was on the Fox affiliate and at nine 30, the show would be called city under siege

668
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,920
and it was just all about the Fox affiliate.

669
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,720
That doesn't sound like them at all.

670
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,880
But it was like every single like murder, rape, arson, she's for half an hour show,

671
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,300
five nights a week.

672
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,880
And it was like, I was like, this is a war zone.

673
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,080
So like we didn't go a lot and my parents weren't big like amusement park people, but

674
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,360
from like junior high to a couple of years in high school, I ended up going to a whole

675
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,360
bunch.

676
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,360
But yeah.

677
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,920
But they also had Waterworld, which is the sister park to Astroworld.

678
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:13,400
So I went back a few times until Splashtown open, which is now, which then became a part

679
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,480
of Six Flags.

680
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,640
So it's all very confusing.

681
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,840
Where's then where, wait, where geographically are Waterworld and Splashtown?

682
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,040
Waterworld was right next to Astroworld.

683
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:27,560
And then eventually, like the last few years of Astroworld's run, one ticket got you into

684
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
both.

685
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,480
Before it was like a separate ticket thing, like Hurricane Harbor.

686
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,440
So but this falls into the line of like Six Flags.

687
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:42,320
Six Flags buys up parks sometimes or has a history of buying up pre-built parks.

688
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,840
I think this was the first one that they bought that they didn't.

689
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:53,120
Yes, because I actually didn't realize that Astroworld was a Six Flags park until like

690
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,080
19 the mid 90s when Warner Brothers bought Six Flags and they started integrating all

691
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,680
the Looney Tunes bullshit.

692
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,160
Oh, because there was there weren't a lot of signifiers of Six Flags.

693
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
I guess.

694
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,080
Yeah, no, like I thought like I remember getting to a fight with kids like, yeah, what's the

695
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,800
Six Flags like in Dallas?

696
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,360
It was like, yeah, Astroworld is better than that one.

697
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,360
Idiot.

698
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,000
This is like and not realizing that they were both Six Flags.

699
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Yeah, yeah.

700
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,160
Is that one Six Flags over Texas?

701
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
Yes.

702
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,360
Which is the original one.

703
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,440
And I learned I feel like I learned this in the past, but I had forgotten about the name

704
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:31,320
Six Flags refers to the flags of the six nations that once governed Texas, Spain, France, Mexico,

705
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,360
the Republic of Texas, the United States of America and the Confederate States of America.

706
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,360
Is that one of them?

707
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,360
That's one of the Six Flags.

708
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,720
One of the great Six Flags.

709
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
One of the great.

710
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Leave the flag up.

711
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
It's part of history.

712
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,640
So it should be five flags, really.

713
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,640
Eventually, they just probably just put up the D.C. logo on a flag and that became the

714
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,640
Six Flags.

715
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,400
OK, so they just said the other flag was a different thing.

716
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
I don't know.

717
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,600
Well, Six Flags over Texas, which I'm sure I know we had talked about doing an episode

718
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:05,080
about that one too, that did have an area like a land called the Old South.

719
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,960
This is why Dallas is trash and he's most great.

720
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,200
Was there a rivalry?

721
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Like would you mean?

722
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,400
Would you meet Dallas kids and be like, hey, get out of our get out of our town?

723
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
No, it wasn't that.

724
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,880
But it was like, you know, you would talk shit about the Rangers or the Mavericks or

725
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,880
the Cowboys.

726
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
Do you feel this tension?

727
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,520
We have a lot of mutual friends from Dallas.

728
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,440
Do you like do you sort of hold them at bay because they're Dallas people ultimately?

729
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,480
Not as human beings, but for sports teams, they like.

730
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,640
OK, it's more they're more their parents.

731
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,200
You put the blame on.

732
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,320
They managed to raise decent, better tax mechs.

733
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,320
You know, worse weather.

734
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,080
Better theme park.

735
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,760
Do we do you have any idea?

736
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
You've been to Six Flags ever, Texas?

737
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
I did once.

738
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,760
Yeah.

739
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,400
Have you been to Texas?

740
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,880
I never went to Fiesta, Texas.

741
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,960
And again, my parents weren't big like amusement park people.

742
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,600
Granted, we did go to Disney World.

743
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,280
I went to Disney World in Florida twice before I ever went to Six Flags in Houston.

744
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
Oh, interesting.

745
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
Oh, sure.

746
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,280
I mean, it is much more of like it's a whole thing.

747
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,280
It's a family vacation.

748
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,280
Exactly.

749
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,840
And you're like one exhausting day on the other side.

750
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,000
You'll be appreciated.

751
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,600
It was three days we went to Disney.

752
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,280
Well, you know, what year was it?

753
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,600
How many parks were there?

754
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,040
They had all three the second time.

755
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,120
Like OK, because now three parks, I would have said actually the optimum time is probably

756
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,240
five days to go because there's so many hotels and different things and water parks.

757
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
Call my dad right now.

758
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,240
I'll talk to him.

759
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,040
Put him on the phone.

760
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,200
You gave you gave Nick a bad childhood.

761
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,680
You gave your son a bad childhood, denying him the correct amount of days to vacation.

762
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,640
Then he just punches you through the phone.

763
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,760
That's his actual fist come through.

764
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:49,360
Did you as a kid, did you like Disney like the same like how were you when you would

765
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,640
compare the theme parks?

766
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,400
Obviously, Disney has much more money and theming.

767
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,080
But did you give a shit about that?

768
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,080
Were you into like the thrill rides?

769
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,480
Did you like the dark rides?

770
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,640
Like what was your overall feeling about that?

771
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,160
Disney was like an experience like so.

772
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,920
And I went when I was a little younger, I was like in kindergarten and not even maybe

773
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,360
when I was like five and like ten.

774
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,560
So Disney was like an experience and it was cool.

775
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:18,080
And I could take like magazine pictures of like in a pro wrestling illustrated.

776
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,240
Oh, do you have that?

777
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,240
Somewhere in my parents house.

778
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,240
Oh, they got to find that.

779
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,240
That's great.

780
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,680
So I was able to take that and that was like my big that was my big thing.

781
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,160
So yeah, no, I loved MGM at Disney.

782
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,880
And then when I went to when I started going to Astro World more regularly, like in junior

783
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:46,040
high, outside of getting like a Florida Marlins, Tasmania, Devil, Bugs Bunny shirt, because

784
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
those were all over the place.

785
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,040
That was a big deal.

786
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,040
All I just wanted.

787
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,160
I just cared about the roller coasters.

788
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
Right.

789
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Sure.

790
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,240
I didn't understand the point of ride like anything else, but no, just roller coasters.

791
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,760
You want to get this real thrill, baby.

792
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,440
Yeah, because I mean, Six Flags also like Astro World had this like.

793
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,680
There was a lot of reports of people dying or getting hurt.

794
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,680
Really?

795
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,360
I didn't come across that.

796
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:13,920
I remember seeing in the news, not Cindy Under Siege, but you know, theme park under siege.

797
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,920
Fun crime.

798
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:19,400
I wonder if they covered it all up or those were just rumors you were hearing like, oh

799
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,680
my God, did you hear about what happened?

800
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:25,000
No, well, I just remember and like I'm sure we'll get into the rides, but like the Texas

801
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:32,280
Cyclone just seemed the most like dangerous ride I've ever like been on.

802
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,520
The Texas Cyclone, kind of a copy of the original Coney Island Cyclone.

803
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,240
They considered moving the Coney Island Cyclone to Texas.

804
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,240
They not because that was would be incredibly expensive.

805
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,320
It's apparently very expensive and very cumbersome to relocate wooden roller coasters.

806
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,760
Well, here's the thing about wooden roller coasters built in the 60s.

807
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,720
Houston is a very humid place.

808
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
Yeah.

809
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,320
And there's a lot of rain and I don't know if you heard, but maybe some hurricanes and

810
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:13,080
wood when it's wet tends to, you know, rot and break and shake and contract and expand.

811
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,520
And this park has flooded before it flooded before it opened.

812
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,720
They were halfway through building it and there was a flood and they had to like push

813
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,680
the opening back a little.

814
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,720
So yes, the dumbest idea possible for a roller coaster.

815
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
It was fun.

816
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Yeah.

817
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,080
The fun was it wasn't even that much of an exciting roller coaster.

818
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,240
It was exciting because you just might die.

819
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,240
Mm hmm.

820
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,240
Mm hmm.

821
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,760
Like you could just like get in line and the whole thing's like the line was exciting because

822
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,480
you feel like you're creaking and cracking.

823
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,720
Oh, that itself is like like old creaky wood to you.

824
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Were you ever scared?

825
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Like in case you didn't know, the three of us were except for Jason, like a little scared

826
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,600
of these high impact rides.

827
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
Maybe still.

828
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,320
Were you a kid that was like scared or were you just like, hell yeah, going on the roller

829
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,720
coasters, like what was your because I would be freaking out if I was a kid and like I

830
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,720
was 13.

831
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,720
First time I went, I was scared.

832
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,360
I never really went on like a roller coaster outside of like Disney, which are like a little

833
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,360
milder.

834
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,120
Yeah, that's what that's a way to put it.

835
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:20,080
The thing about Astro World and Six Flags, these things are dangerous.

836
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:28,240
So the first time I went on Xelorate, Xelorate, XLR8 is how the titles are written.

837
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,320
It's straight, circle.

838
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,760
I don't know the technical terms.

839
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,920
It does a loop.

840
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,920
It's one of those.

841
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,280
It's like it's it's one straight away.

842
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,360
Does a loop goes goes up and returns.

843
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
No, that's Greece Lightning.

844
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

845
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,360
We'll get to that in a minute.

846
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
OK, great.

847
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,600
XLR8 is just a four person pod.

848
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,960
It goes straight, but the whole time it's twisting and turning.

849
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,160
Oh, XLR8 is the that's so that's a hanging coaster.

850
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,720
It's not even that, too.

851
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,720
That's the Batman ride.

852
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,400
No, the Batman ride is the stand up coaster.

853
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
You're getting these mixed up.

854
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,880
The Batman ride is the stand up one.

855
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,880
The twister.

856
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,880
Yes.

857
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
He's the one that twists.

858
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
Oh man, Jason owns your ass.

859
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,880
No, that's what I was trying to say.

860
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
I don't know the technical words.

861
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,880
But the XLR8.

862
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,560
You were being nice to him and not goofing on him and it came back to bite you.

863
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,560
He turned on you.

864
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,560
I'm not talking about how much money he had.

865
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:21,080
I'm just trying to cut down on the tweets we're going to get.

866
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,960
Hey, fans of the podcast, the ride.

867
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,880
I don't know any of the technical terms.

868
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,640
I said do the show so I can learn.

869
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,600
But thank Nick anyway, thank you.

870
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,600
The show.

871
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,840
He doesn't owe you anything more than that.

872
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,840
Yeah, thank you.

873
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
The worst guests on your show.

874
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
Creed.

875
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,240
XLR8 was a suspended coaster.

876
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:48,640
So which I believe is similar to the I think like the Big Bad Wolf in Busch Gardens Williamsburg.

877
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,160
And this I think was one of the first successful suspended roller coasters.

878
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,640
It succeeded in the wake of the Bats, which did not work out before Kings Island.

879
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,440
It seemed also, again, very dangerous.

880
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,120
And that was part of the appeal with Astral World because it was like a four person seat

881
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:11,800
cart that would it would go straight, but it would be like turning 360s like in it and

882
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
then doing loops.

883
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,200
And it would be it would be insane.

884
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,500
And I was scared with that.

885
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,760
And then when I got off, I was like, I almost threw up.

886
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,960
But then I was like, fuck it.

887
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,960
Let's go again.

888
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
I'm in sixth grade.

889
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:27,920
And interestingly, if you look up the term suspended roller coaster on Wikipedia, there's

890
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,120
a list of a partial list of suspended roller coasters.

891
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,600
And most of the status is listed as closed.

892
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:41,540
Yeah, it didn't feel like, OK, so you do Texas Cyclone.

893
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,640
This thing feels like it's going to fall apart.

894
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,800
And then you do XLR8.

895
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,460
And it feels like this was designed by the roller coaster game that came with like my

896
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,460
CD-ROM drive.

897
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,460
You mean roller coaster type?

898
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:56,960
Yes, like you like where you could just build a roller coaster and you could shoot the car

899
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
right off the track.

900
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,040
And then that's why they land and blow up.

901
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,080
There was no good reason for this.

902
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,820
And then as Scott mentioned, there was Greased Lightning.

903
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:08,280
This was the trilogy of Astral World rides.

904
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,580
And Greased Lightning was just a roller coaster that went straight as fast as it possibly could.

905
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,860
The fastest roller coaster I've ever been on.

906
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,120
It did a loop.

907
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:22,240
It went up to the top and then reversed it, causing everyone to get severe whiplash.

908
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,520
Just banging it back into the seat.

909
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,400
You could not not be sore doing Greased Lightning.

910
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,880
It would hurt.

911
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,100
It would just hurt because it didn't even have like I don't even remember having the

912
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,280
shoulder harness.

913
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,320
It just had the seat belt.

914
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,320
Right.

915
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:42,180
And maybe but and then it just went as fast as could, stopped on a dime and then pushed

916
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,240
you back, stopped on a dime.

917
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,240
The ride.

918
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,240
That's it.

919
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,000
My just here title.

920
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,200
All it was was to make it hurt.

921
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,160
I went out and there was I forget what it's called there.

922
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,040
There's a version, an old tiny version of this at knots that I went on when we were

923
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
there a couple of years ago.

924
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,040
Is that called?

925
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,600
It was once called Montezuma's Revenge.

926
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,800
I think that was right.

927
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,200
And it's not as big as this thing.

928
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,840
This thing is insane and it's tall and this is barely the size of it.

929
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,600
And it just wrecked my neck because you got whiplash when the thing zooms up and then

930
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,040
zooms down again.

931
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,040
It's crazy.

932
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,200
Astro World is the only theme park I've ever gone to where you would get sore every time

933
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
you went.

934
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,440
And like sixth grader was sore.

935
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,240
Yeah, no, like you're not an old football and rugby.

936
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,640
Yeah, like, you know, this is what I was like in shape and had pliability.

937
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,640
You know, ice down after a trip to Astro World.

938
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,600
Yeah, no, but I was a kid where I was just like, I have all these fluid like motions

939
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,360
and then like, no, just just wrecked wrecked.

940
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,840
I didn't go chiropractor.

941
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,240
Going to that Brock Lesnar ice bath.

942
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,800
Yeah, no, it was.

943
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:51,040
And so like Grease Lightning was again, because I was a stupid kid, was like, yeah, this is

944
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,040
awesome.

945
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,040
Faster.

946
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,040
Was that your favorite?

947
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,040
Yes.

948
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,080
OK, that one is the one you described as being the most painful, I feel like.

949
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,680
And that was your favorite.

950
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,680
That's Young Monday.

951
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,680
That's Party Boy Monday.

952
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Yeah.

953
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,560
There's a lot of very funny coasters here, like the one called Serial Thriller.

954
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,520
Play on the word serial killer.

955
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,720
That has a film canister, a giant film canister at the entrance.

956
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,600
So I don't know what the theme on that one is.

957
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:22,560
I think that one was just one side to side a lot and then just yeah, just try to hurt

958
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,560
you.

959
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:29,560
And then, of course, there was Dexter Freebush's electric roller ride, which was eventually

960
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:34,120
changed to Excalibur.

961
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,840
That is just a very funny thing of its times.

962
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,080
Like that seems like a very funny 70s.

963
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:45,800
And the font is very Americana by Centennial, old timey, which I love that.

964
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:52,560
I feel like Six Flags had a lot of that vibe in the 70s before the vibe of Six Flags became

965
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,560
bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam

966
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,560
rock and roll Batman.

967
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,240
Oh, and the dancing old man.

968
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,640
And then the Batman ride was called Batman the Escape and it was a stand up coaster,

969
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,240
but the naming Six Flags has very weird naming.

970
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,720
Stuff will be called one thing at one park, one would be called another thing like at

971
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,520
Great Adventure in Jersey.

972
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,200
There was Batman the Ride.

973
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,800
But then at another park, there was Superman the Escape.

974
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:24,040
This was Batman the Escape and the name Viper was used for any and all sorts of style coasters.

975
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,960
You watch all of them, it tells one shared universe.

976
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,280
That was the first shared universe.

977
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,600
Well, I yeah, if only in the shared that shared universe was called Tim Burton, Batman.

978
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:38,680
So the Batman the Ride was like the first like in the 90s and this is in the full on

979
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:45,000
WB integration was like, guys, guess what's coming to Six Flags?

980
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,400
Batman the fucking ride.

981
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,560
And then Motorhead was playing and it was like, this isn't just any other roller coaster.

982
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,240
This roller coaster, you're going to fucking stand.

983
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,320
Like it was like, and we were all like, standing in a fucking roller coaster.

984
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,920
But Marvel's have you dreamt up Six Flags Astroworld?

985
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,920
This is great.

986
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,560
It was like, just bring two cans of Coke and you're going to get in free on Wednesdays.

987
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,440
The scientists were as mad as Dr. Edward Nigma himself.

988
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,280
But no, they made they pumped that.

989
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,200
I remember it was a constant ad campaign.

990
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,200
Right.

991
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,200
About the stand up roller coaster.

992
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,440
Yeah, that that it became kind of the reputation of this part is that like this is where a

993
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,400
lot of prototypes like this.

994
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,400
It's like a skyscraper, one of the first stand up coasters or one of the first suspended

995
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,200
coasters or one of the first tubular.

996
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,520
But whatever the first rapids ride, I believe the first rapids ride.

997
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,520
Yeah, that's right.

998
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,520
River.

999
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,880
If it wasn't for Astroworld, Disney wouldn't have bad versions of them.

1000
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:55,400
Disney is not great at rapids rides, which gardens Six Flags pretty good at rapids ride

1001
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,760
or Universal Studios, which has no rides at all.

1002
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,160
Oh, the Popeye Rapids is great.

1003
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,720
Is really good in Orlando.

1004
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,800
Actually, that is a superior.

1005
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:12,160
That's like one of the only truly themed rapids experiences with animatronics and stuff.

1006
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,120
There's supposedly a good rapids ride in Shanghai.

1007
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,360
There's a big giant robot on that.

1008
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:24,520
Oh, and the the there's a rapid version of anything in Singapore of the Jurassic Park.

1009
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,520
Right.

1010
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,520
It's a rapid.

1011
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,520
It's a rapid.

1012
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,080
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

1013
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,280
Batman ride.

1014
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,000
Where would you all expect?

1015
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,840
What area of the park would you all expect a Batman ride to be it?

1016
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,120
Who I would like a Gotham City part?

1017
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,120
Sure, maybe.

1018
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,120
Mm hmm.

1019
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:48,720
Is the or not metropolis, but just some like, you know, the big city or something.

1020
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,520
Wasn't it wasn't like the old England town?

1021
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,400
It's in the European village, including the Batcave.

1022
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,920
The Batcave located in a mountain in the European village because they were repurposing the Alpine

1023
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:08,120
Sleigh Ride Mountain for like you walk through the Batcave to get on this ride.

1024
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,160
But it's very funny to me.

1025
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,520
It's finding an old map saying like hidden inside of a mountain is the famous Batcave

1026
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,280
in the European village section of the park.

1027
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,200
Well, you got to realize about Houston.

1028
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,600
There's a lot of new money there because of oil.

1029
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:27,400
So they just consider like, you know, Bruce Wayne old money is like, you know, from the

1030
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,200
call from like the old country.

1031
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,280
I'll allow that.

1032
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,560
And as you told us, there is you told me there's no zoning laws in Houston.

1033
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,760
Houston has no zoning laws, which we'll get into because there are just insane pictures

1034
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,040
of like.

1035
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,960
Like like porn shops next to churches and roller coasters behind houses.

1036
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,960
Wow.

1037
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,760
You could open up a Chili's in the middle of a neighborhood.

1038
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,760
In a street.

1039
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,760
Yeah.

1040
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,760
Blocking a road.

1041
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,760
Have you tried that?

1042
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,760
No.

1043
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,760
To franchise the Chili's in a neighborhood?

1044
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,280
No, I haven't yet.

1045
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,080
But maybe that's maybe we all quit show business and just go down and start opening up chain

1046
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,400
restaurants in the middle of a subdivision.

1047
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,400
We can do that.

1048
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,880
And then they would go in a like.

1049
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,360
So just take a house.

1050
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,480
It doesn't even have to look like a Chili's.

1051
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,840
You just put Chili's on like the mailbox like and then have people come in.

1052
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,840
No.

1053
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,840
Oh, shit.

1054
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,080
And then where we opened up streets where it's like the equivalent of having a house

1055
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,560
in the middle of sunset.

1056
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,560
Wow.

1057
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,560
Yeah.

1058
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,360
It seemed like it was a literal up situation where an old Shambley charming little house

1059
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,400
is next to a towering hospital or whatever.

1060
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Yep.

1061
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,400
It's very strange.

1062
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,880
So this is like on point then that it's like the Batcave is dropped smack in the middle.

1063
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,880
Yeah, it makes sense.

1064
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,880
I don't think there was.

1065
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,120
There was no American superhero is dropped smack in the middle of an old.

1066
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:51,440
I don't recall there being a lot of themes like, you know, there wasn't like European

1067
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,160
town or like, you know, Cowboyville.

1068
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,880
Even though they technically named areas these words, they were not committed to.

1069
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,440
It was like three posters.

1070
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,440
It was like it was like it was like decorating for a one year old's birthday.

1071
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,480
It's like, yeah, we'll try.

1072
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,760
But it's not that they're not going to notice.

1073
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,600
You're telling me in the middle of Texas, an area called the Oriental Village is not

1074
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:18,680
the most immersive theming experience you've ever seen.

1075
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,680
He's not.

1076
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,680
He is.

1077
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,680
I'm not.

1078
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,520
He's just staring at you.

1079
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,360
Look, product of the time.

1080
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:34,200
You can't said that we cannot force our guests to the godfather of the podcast to explain

1081
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,680
the errors of Oriental Village.

1082
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,480
I speak for all.

1083
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,680
This is also where you know, this is a park that has.

1084
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:48,120
This abandoned amusement park, Americana Square, USA and Western Junction, which is not the

1085
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,680
best planning for the map.

1086
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:55,040
I think I'm furious about Oriental Village and I say this park should be torn down.

1087
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,920
Well, Houston has a huge Asian population, Asian American population.

1088
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,440
So I'm sure it was changed in 2003 right before it closed.

1089
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,960
Yes, they did it with like a month to go.

1090
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,040
You know, I remember no one being impressed with the Batman ride, even though you could

1091
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,760
fucking stand.

1092
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,880
So what is your memory of going on that for the first time?

1093
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,880
It was too safe.

1094
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,880
Really?

1095
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,200
Because it was made with like new technology like metal.

1096
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,000
It was made in the 90s, not the weird creaky 60s.

1097
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,400
You had like a thing going over your chest.

1098
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,820
You know, it was just what is this?

1099
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,880
So you were like kind of like, ah, that was a let down.

1100
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,880
Yeah, big time.

1101
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,320
And it was shorter, too.

1102
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:35,840
Like I feel like more modern roller coasters, I guess, to pump people out.

1103
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,840
I don't know the economics of it.

1104
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,800
It might be pumping people out, it also might be like they figured out that you shouldn't

1105
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,880
have like head trauma for more than a minute and a half at a time.

1106
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,920
You know, like Texas Cyclone was like five minutes long.

1107
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,840
Yeah, like your brain shouldn't be jostled around that long.

1108
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:49,840
Sure.

1109
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,840
Like that's not good for it.

1110
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,840
That's what you're used to.

1111
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,840
Yes.

1112
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,840
Yeah, you were getting jostled over and over again.

1113
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,760
But no, I was used to going and getting CTE from a roller coaster.

1114
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,360
And like they also had the first like, I don't know what they're called, but like it was

1115
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:08,600
called Skyscreamer where all of these names just sound like like rated are like Decepticons.

1116
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,320
Is that the one you ended on your back?

1117
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,120
Like it was a drop and it was like an L shape.

1118
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,480
So you at the end, you're like on your what are those rides called like the Guardians

1119
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,480
drop?

1120
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,400
It's usually like dropped a drop rides.

1121
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,400
Yeah.

1122
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,880
So this drop ride, instead of having like breaks at the end, we were like, no, we can't

1123
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,800
we can't stop that speed.

1124
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:32,080
It goes straight and then slides down so you get off from your back.

1125
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,960
Oh, like a water slide.

1126
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,960
Yeah, kind of.

1127
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,960
Yeah.

1128
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,960
Weird.

1129
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,160
And it also had dungeon drop.

1130
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,240
Do you remember Dungeon Drop?

1131
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,880
That was a different way that they would pull you to the top and you would just kind of

1132
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,880
bounce down.

1133
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,320
But it seemed like a castle line that you would go through.

1134
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:53,680
That one was again, drop as fast, break instantly.

1135
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,120
Like neck trauma.

1136
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,120
Drop down.

1137
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,120
Neck trauma.

1138
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,120
And you love this.

1139
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,120
It was great.

1140
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,120
Yeah.

1141
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:08,840
Is there, do you have neck issues today from this or from your athletic career or from

1142
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,840
anything?

1143
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,600
How's the neck, Nick?

1144
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,960
I was fine before.

1145
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:18,200
One time I had a stinger in rugby.

1146
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,120
A stinger is where you jam your neck, like you compress your bones in your neck and shoulder.

1147
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,280
And you couldn't like not feel your arms.

1148
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:31,160
Yeah, and I lost like I was paralyzed for a second in the middle of a scrum.

1149
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,840
I was fine.

1150
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:39,120
But the next day at breakfast with my girlfriend of the time, I couldn't keep my head up.

1151
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,120
Geez.

1152
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,120
You just.

1153
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,760
And then since then, it cracks.

1154
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,000
So still there is a little something.

1155
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,400
Yeah, but it doesn't hurt.

1156
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,680
But it just cracks.

1157
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:55,800
Isn't it possible that Six Flags somehow wore you down, made you more susceptible?

1158
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,680
Or just toughen me up for this for this modern day world.

1159
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,120
After the stinger, how soon did you go to Astroworld?

1160
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,940
The next day.

1161
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,400
Maybe like a couple of weeks, actually, because the season that was ending.

1162
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,400
Yeah.

1163
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,400
Well, you got to go.

1164
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,880
The doctors say no Astroworld for you for a month.

1165
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,880
Oh, you're going to Astroworld.

1166
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,880
No way, man.

1167
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,880
Yeah.

1168
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,920
What did Dr. James Andrews?

1169
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,920
That's a wrestling joke.

1170
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,920
It's a wrestling joke.

1171
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,920
I don't know how it's been crossed over.

1172
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,920
That is how I learned what a stinger was.

1173
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,800
Edge got a stinger, I think, in like 1999.

1174
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,120
Yeah, I'm going to have to have a neck fusion one day.

1175
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,720
And yeah, you're going to have to have the vertebrae.

1176
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:34,840
I do remember in high school after a wrestling knee injury, I broke my knee and I went on

1177
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:39,920
Six Flags and I had a leg brace and crutches and they were like, you probably can't go

1178
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,920
on the ride.

1179
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,920
I was like, yeah.

1180
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,920
Interesting theory.

1181
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,920
See it.

1182
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,920
See it in the back end.

1183
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,920
You could do all of them.

1184
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,920
Mostly.

1185
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,200
I could do Accelerate because my brace wouldn't fit in.

1186
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,240
So did you try to get on the ride and they just like, you're trying to jam your knee

1187
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,000
with a brace on to it?

1188
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
That's funny.

1189
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,800
Could I get a handicapped shoulder restraint, please?

1190
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,280
Wearing Snap-on Adidas pants and a Ken Shamrock shirt.

1191
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,880
Do you have a photo of this Ken Shamrock shirt?

1192
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,880
Maybe.

1193
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,880
In my parents house.

1194
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,200
At least you at Astroworld with the Ken Shamrock shirt on.

1195
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:17,120
How did you sustain, how did your body hold up at the water parks?

1196
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,120
Any difficulties there?

1197
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,880
Well, I was a chubby kid so just, you know, that.

1198
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,880
Just having to be shirtless was an injury.

1199
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,880
Just societal shame.

1200
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,200
But also then it was like, fuck it.

1201
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,200
Sure.

1202
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,200
Yeah, you're at a water park.

1203
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,160
I put on a Hawaiian shirt on and I would be fine.

1204
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,040
But did you get the shit kicked out of you there like you did at Astroworld?

1205
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:41,920
Yeah, there was a couple of, yeah, no, there was one called Shotgun Falls.

1206
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:47,200
Where it was just a short roller coaster and it was just the most amount of water pressure

1207
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:52,480
in a water slide ever in a concentrated area that would just shoot you down into the water.

1208
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,200
Where all the Texas water slides named after guns?

1209
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,200
The six shooter fly.

1210
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,200
There was Screamicles, but that was Splashtown.

1211
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,800
I went to Splashtown a lot more.

1212
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,760
I used to have the Season Pass at Splashtown.

1213
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,760
Oh, okay.

1214
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,120
But Waterworld was a treat.

1215
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,840
I remember they had a hand, like the hand glider thing.

1216
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,840
I thought you were going to say hand grenade.

1217
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,000
They just gave you hand grenades.

1218
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I remember doing the hand glider thing and I went down it and I kind of like trying to

1219
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,600
jump off it more and my ankle hit cement.

1220
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,920
I was like, that's not great.

1221
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,920
Jesus.

1222
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,720
And then they had a lot of tube rides.

1223
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:31,880
So what me and my friends would like to do is those tube rides, a lot of the parts of

1224
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,520
the slide would be covered to prevent death.

1225
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:41,880
So what we did was we got out of the tubes, stopped the slide, got out of the tubes and

1226
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:47,560
then climbed and hung out for like an hour or two on the slide when people would go under

1227
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,560
us.

1228
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,560
Wow.

1229
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,360
And we would just like scream stuff.

1230
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,840
Wait, nobody stopped you from being there?

1231
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,120
Well, they couldn't get up to the slide.

1232
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,320
So were like employees yelling at you to get down?

1233
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,320
Sometimes they didn't care.

1234
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,760
Younger than you, barely getting paid more than you.

1235
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,760
Why is this place still not around?

1236
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,840
No, so we'd just be hanging out doing like, you know, yelling stuff.

1237
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,920
Just like banging on it like it's a cage.

1238
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,520
Well, yeah, because we'd be above them.

1239
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,760
We'd be like, give me a dollar.

1240
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,960
Let me ask you this.

1241
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:24,880
When you're like around 15 and 16, would you guys ever, were you into drinking yet or?

1242
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,880
This was all junior high.

1243
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,880
Oh, this is okay.

1244
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,880
Gotcha.

1245
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,280
So this was like 12 to 14.

1246
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,360
I don't, high school, I didn't go to water parks because you even knew like if you're

1247
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:39,040
older than like 12, it's weird for anyone to be at a water park.

1248
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:44,720
I don't know that that's an aphorism we say.

1249
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,200
We went to Noah's Ark when we were 18 after we graduated high school.

1250
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,760
Oh, a big water park up in the Wisconsin Dells, of course.

1251
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,360
Themed after the great man Noah.

1252
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,640
We put two of each animal on an ark.

1253
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,640
Wow.

1254
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,640
The Lord told him to.

1255
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,040
So we don't have to talk about that now.

1256
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:03,600
Well, it's always a good time to talk about the good book.

1257
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,600
The truth of the Bible.

1258
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,600
Yes.

1259
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,120
I can't wait to have kids and then go to a water park looking like me and just apologizing

1260
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,120
to everyone.

1261
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,840
Like I'm so sorry for what I did in junior high.

1262
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
I'm fine.

1263
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,840
Don't worry about me.

1264
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,120
They came with kids.

1265
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,200
Hey, knock off that horseplay.

1266
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,680
They had this one ride.

1267
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:24,320
I remember doing it when I was like 10 where you had to carry like a 50 pound raft.

1268
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,320
Oh, right.

1269
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,960
Cause yeah, there's still those rides where you would walk up like six flights of stairs

1270
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:30,960
with the raft.

1271
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:37,760
And I could handle it, but then like I remember like, well, why don't I surf down this?

1272
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,360
And then I slipped off that.

1273
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,360
Oh no.

1274
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,560
And you just landed on the slide and like slowly fell down.

1275
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,920
I was like, sorry, sorry.

1276
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,040
This is like a, like a highlight, like a jackass highlight reel you're describing now.

1277
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,040
A little bit.

1278
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,040
That's what it was.

1279
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,040
What is this?

1280
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,880
The plot of the new movie Action Point?

1281
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:02,080
Shut up, Sheridan.

1282
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,000
I knew you'd come around two hours with us.

1283
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
You'd be bullying everybody.

1284
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Yeah, you have to.

1285
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,720
I remember one time we went to Astroworld and we won like 60 basketballs, like college

1286
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,720
basketballs.

1287
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,720
How?

1288
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,720
60?

1289
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,800
Well, like, until they gave them to you?

1290
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:23,440
No, like it was like, if you like made the hoop, like, you know, if you shot the basket,

1291
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,440
like you physically constructed the hoop.

1292
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,840
No, you got 50 cents or a dollar.

1293
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,840
You get three shots.

1294
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,880
If you hit two of them, you get a basketball.

1295
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,640
So we hit a shit ton of them.

1296
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,640
Who's we?

1297
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,440
How big of a gang you got?

1298
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,560
It was, it wasn't like five dudes, four dudes, just buddies.

1299
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,840
And we got a shit ton of them, like 30.

1300
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,640
And we had two giant bags carrying around.

1301
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,120
We're like, well, this sucks.

1302
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,800
You stand like that was at the start of the day.

1303
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,800
Yeah.

1304
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,160
Would you throw them at things to like be mischief makers?

1305
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,480
Not like throw them at people or things, but like roll them.

1306
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,600
You know, like, hey, you know, just like shoot them, throw them around, play dodgeball.

1307
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:10,300
I'm picturing this and I'm picturing me in the park at the same time.

1308
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:13,960
And I would have been like so nervous that these bad kids that are throwing basketballs

1309
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,960
around.

1310
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,960
It was never like cruel stuff.

1311
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,960
It was just like chicanery.

1312
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,760
I'm more saying that this is the type of behavior that I think would make a few of us very uncomfortable

1313
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,040
on our spectrum.

1314
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,040
Right.

1315
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,040
Rolling basketballs down.

1316
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,040
That's the scariest thing we've ever seen.

1317
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,920
You'd be like, oh my gosh, like I would like not like try to make eye contact.

1318
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,200
I kind of like hug like the side of the rail.

1319
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,160
I'm going to hide in the bathroom for 45 minutes.

1320
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:40,400
I likely would have been busier, you know, enjoying the modern marvels of engineering.

1321
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,520
The coasters that people worked really hard on and I wanted to get my money's worth and

1322
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,520
ride all of them.

1323
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,000
You wouldn't let some rapscallions get you down.

1324
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,360
You might get pegged with a Michigan Wolverines basketball.

1325
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,640
You would be rolling the basketball and Jason be like, excuse me, sir, I'm trying to get

1326
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,880
past you to go enjoy this modern marvel of machinery.

1327
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,920
Hey, eat ball, bitch.

1328
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,080
Right in the head.

1329
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,040
Broke the glasses.

1330
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,040
You would do it.

1331
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,040
50-50-50-50.

1332
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,040
That would happen.

1333
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,040
50-50-50.

1334
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,040
You would do it.

1335
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,040
You're downplaying.

1336
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,720
And it would, by the way, be justified if Jason had said that.

1337
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,720
Heck.

1338
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,720
If he said that specifically.

1339
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,080
But if I just saw you cowering behind like, you know, Tasmania double cut out.

1340
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,560
You would have pegged me with a basketball.

1341
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,880
No, I never threw it at anyone.

1342
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,640
It was just like nonsense for nonsense reasons.

1343
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,160
I don't believe, I believe you at least one time in your life have thrown a basketball

1344
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,160
at a child's head.

1345
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,280
I think I have, like I'm a friend of mine.

1346
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,120
No, I've thrown it at other people, like a dad.

1347
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,120
And all dad?

1348
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:45,920
Yeah, I remember like this neighbor, like this kid was, I think this kid was making

1349
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,920
fun of me.

1350
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:52,520
And again, a husky fella, and he made fun of me and I may have pushed him down and his

1351
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:56,680
dad was like, why'd you push my kid?

1352
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,680
It was like, cause he's being a dick.

1353
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,800
That was like nine.

1354
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,520
Nine, really?

1355
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,880
And he was like, well, you shouldn't say that language.

1356
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,520
He was like, well, you shouldn't have a fucking stupid son.

1357
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,520
You said that to him?

1358
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,520
Yeah.

1359
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,520
Wow.

1360
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,520
It was at a baseball park.

1361
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,480
This is at Texas like, yeehaw, like Texas Ranger, like pew pew.

1362
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,680
And you threw a basketball at him then.

1363
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,960
The dad you said?

1364
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:18,960
Yeah.

1365
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:19,960
After, so you said that?

1366
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,960
No, no, no.

1367
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:26,720
I went up to him and I went like, I was like, are we gonna fight?

1368
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,160
I think you're the hero of this story, but the way you're telling it makes you sound

1369
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,160
like a villain.

1370
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,160
Did that happen?

1371
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:38,200
I remember, this is just apropos of nothing, but in third grade, I played catcher all the

1372
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,200
time.

1373
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,120
I was always the catcher and I was good.

1374
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,960
And my parents for my birthday, and it was the best birthday present I ever got, was

1375
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,240
brand new catching equipment, not like the team, like staff infection.

1376
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,040
Recycled, yeah, reused.

1377
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:57,280
It was brand new maroon catching equipment and it was awesome.

1378
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:03,480
And so I was catching and the coach was like, hey, you got the whole thing.

1379
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,480
So did you get everything?

1380
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,240
It was like, I just turned up to him and I was like, I got the whole goddamn thing.

1381
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,980
Because I'd watched major league nonstop as a kid, like every day I would watch major

1382
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,040
league.

1383
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:20,360
And then that same game, the pitcher was struggling and it was for like a championship and we

1384
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:26,040
had to get, we had to get an out, we had to get an out or, and the guy was really good.

1385
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:30,440
So I went up to the pitcher and I walked up to him and I was like, strike this motherfucker

1386
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:33,400
out, which is from the major league.

1387
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,380
He did.

1388
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:38,200
And then he started crying and he told on me.

1389
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,400
Whoa, wow.

1390
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,360
Well, you're the hero of that story.

1391
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,960
You are never be him.

1392
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,800
Man, this is great.

1393
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,600
Like the, you know, I, you were watching these adult movies.

1394
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,380
They were informing your worldview at such a young age.

1395
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:57,880
And then like, I'm more all watching like beauty and the beast and you're saying mother

1396
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:03,440
show and wondering how we would fall over Ottomans.

1397
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,420
Like you're, you're saying motherfucker and I'm playing baseball and I'm like humming

1398
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:13,280
be our guest in like right field and like, yeah, but I was also a weird whimsy kid too.

1399
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,880
Like, you know, I watched like, you know, I would like write my own thundercats spec

1400
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,880
scripts.

1401
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,880
Really?

1402
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:20,880
Yeah.

1403
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,880
I mean, but they were bad.

1404
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,880
They weren't great.

1405
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,880
But no, like today you can make.

1406
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:25,880
I was a nerdy kid too though.

1407
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:30,120
So I was underrated nerdy too, but I love sports as well.

1408
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,360
Like I watched the X-Men cartoon.

1409
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,360
I watched Batman.

1410
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:37,360
Like I watched all the stuff, but I also liked sports and action movies.

1411
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,640
Well, let me ask to bring back to Astroworld.

1412
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,980
Were you there the summer?

1413
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,320
I don't know how long it lasted.

1414
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:47,720
I would assume at least the summer, the police academy stunt show was there.

1415
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:48,720
Yes.

1416
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:55,800
So you saw this in 1994 ish Hollywood comes to Houston, according to this brochure for

1417
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,480
the police academy stunt show.

1418
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,720
It's clear as day.

1419
01:01:58,720 --> 01:01:59,720
That's how they advertised it.

1420
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,720
Yeah.

1421
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,720
Whoa.

1422
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:02,720
A few years after.

1423
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,520
When did the last police academy movie come out?

1424
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,520
There was four.

1425
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,640
The police academy seven was around 93, 94, but police got me six.

1426
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,280
I think it was the big one in 1991.

1427
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,280
They got to seven.

1428
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,680
I think they got sort of quieter in their release and prominence as they went.

1429
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:20,440
So as to be honest, but as a big police academy fan, I was very excited.

1430
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:24,800
Were you like, did you have, were you under any illusion that it would be your favorite

1431
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:28,320
stars from the film performing every day in the park for you?

1432
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,320
Okay.

1433
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,200
So 1994 I was 13.

1434
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,060
So I was at least worldly enough to be like, look, these guys aren't doing much.

1435
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:36,520
They could show up.

1436
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,520
True.

1437
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,960
No gigantic careers were launched out of police academy.

1438
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,160
I was like, well, certainly, you know, certainly tackle Barry could show up.

1439
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:51,720
And if there was a character favorite, or who was your favorite police academy?

1440
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,040
Bobcat Goldweight was my favorite.

1441
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,040
Okay.

1442
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,040
But he's not coming.

1443
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,400
He's not coming to Houston, even if Hollywood is.

1444
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:03,720
I really liked from the first one, the guy George, who pretended he was a Spanish guy,

1445
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,480
but to trick women.

1446
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:06,480
Hmm.

1447
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,120
And that seems like there's a couple of problems in there.

1448
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,120
Yeah, no.

1449
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,960
And then looking back now, if I had to pick one, it's Sweet Chuck.

1450
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:14,960
But you're going to have to, I don't know.

1451
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,960
He's a small, nervous guy who's unassuming.

1452
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,960
Oh, great.

1453
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,960
Well, I like this character too.

1454
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,960
I really like him.

1455
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,600
Something about him sounds like fun.

1456
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:27,000
I watch his movies, but I do remember there was a short-lived animated show.

1457
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Right.

1458
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,440
And like with action figures.

1459
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,840
That is my bearing for police academy.

1460
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:35,460
What occurred in the stunt show, do we know any specific?

1461
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:40,240
It seems like there was some sort of go-kart going off the art.

1462
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:49,400
I found a website called themeparkbrochures.net, which that was a big rabbit hole to go down.

1463
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,060
Here is, yeah, someone's on an ATV thing.

1464
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,240
There's a big strong guy.

1465
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,440
It looks like there's a pool of water.

1466
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,040
I bet your Thundercats drawings were better than this.

1467
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,040
No, I wrote them.

1468
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:08,280
This is from the era of when theme park maps had a very Where's Waldo, Sergio Aragonese

1469
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,280
style Mad Magazine.

1470
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:14,280
This was a real trend.

1471
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,280
Oh, sorry.

1472
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,280
Go back to the stories where you yell at children.

1473
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,200
I didn't yell at children.

1474
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,960
I yelled at contemporaries.

1475
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,800
Look at this.

1476
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:31,760
You said horrible swear words to promising pitchers, setting them off.

1477
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:32,760
Did we win?

1478
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:33,760
Yes.

1479
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,520
You scared him into submission.

1480
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,520
This is true.

1481
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,160
Now, do you want to hear my best Astro World story?

1482
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,240
Absolutely.

1483
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,760
Where I have a world record holder?

1484
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,360
Most basketballs thrown at the cast of the police academy.

1485
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,080
Or the Batman Forever stunt show.

1486
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,080
Oh yeah, we'll get into that.

1487
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,080
I believe that was there.

1488
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,080
Did you see that?

1489
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,080
I did not see that one.

1490
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,080
I'll come, I'll loop around to that.

1491
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,080
What's your next thing?

1492
01:04:56,080 --> 01:05:02,120
So I didn't, I wasn't a churchy kid when I was growing up, but like they sometimes the

1493
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:06,600
local church would rent out Astro World as one does for like a youth group thing where

1494
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:11,000
there'd be like a bunch of churches and like it would they rent out the park on a Sunday

1495
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,240
and it would be like youth group day.

1496
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:19,560
So the park would be like like two fifths full and it would be easy to go on lines and

1497
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:20,560
all this stuff.

1498
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:25,000
But the trick was the catch was at five o'clock you had to go where they did the police

1499
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,920
academy stunt show and have like a church service.

1500
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,920
Jesus!

1501
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,400
In like a like a fake New York like plywood walls.

1502
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,400
Yeah.

1503
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,400
Wow.

1504
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,120
Did you get communion there?

1505
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:41,960
Well no, because I was like nuts to that.

1506
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:42,960
I'm 11.

1507
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,480
I have free will.

1508
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,640
Yeah.

1509
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:50,480
This was my 95 thesis for like this is when I became, this was my protest against the

1510
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,480
church.

1511
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,720
Astro World had a ride named Tidal Wave.

1512
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:00,320
Which you've seen them all before but I think this is one of the first ones again.

1513
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:01,920
I think it's one of the biggest ones.

1514
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,480
It's like what they, it's like the Jurassic, it's the big cart thing.

1515
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,120
Big drop water ride.

1516
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,120
Yeah and creates a big tidal wave of water.

1517
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,120
Bigger than a log flume.

1518
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,120
Yeah, it's like the dress.

1519
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,120
The bigger boat.

1520
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,800
Shoot the shoot they call that.

1521
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:20,920
Imagine the Jurassic world, the Jurassic Park ride at Universal Studios Los Angeles times

1522
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:21,920
10.

1523
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,240
It's a big drop, it's like a couple stories.

1524
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,800
Very popular especially in areas that get very hot because you usually get drenched

1525
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,800
on these sorts of things.

1526
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,760
Yeah and I was, I loved that ride even though I was a stupid kid.

1527
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,400
It was like well it's gonna ruin your trip because you're gonna be just covered in chlorine

1528
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,160
of water and you're getting hollow lung but I was like I don't care.

1529
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:45,360
So I was like and this was January and I was wearing a hoodie and it was probably like,

1530
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:51,240
yeah it was like five o'clock and it was cold and no one was on tidal wave.

1531
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,200
Just because they were all at church.

1532
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,860
So I was like, yep I'm doing this.

1533
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:57,920
And they were operating this ride in January.

1534
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:03,280
Yeah and some kid, like some 15 year old was like, yeah you wanna get on?

1535
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,480
And I was like, yep.

1536
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,600
So I did it.

1537
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,640
Strapped in front in the row.

1538
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:12,080
It's only me and I proceeded to do it 14 times.

1539
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,080
Wow.

1540
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:20,600
One after the other, after the other, after the other and I was soaking wet.

1541
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,600
He was like.

1542
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,600
And you were alone all 14 times.

1543
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,600
By myself.

1544
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,600
Didn't ever got up.

1545
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,600
Wow.

1546
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,240
Just did the whole thing.

1547
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:30,400
And your pupils were just Game Boy green by the end.

1548
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,400
Light olive.

1549
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,400
Wow.

1550
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:37,760
That's funny you say it because I have a memory of like doing a Six Flags, being at Great

1551
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:43,120
Adventure in like an off weekend in the fall and like we rode a roller coaster and really

1552
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:46,920
liked and we pulled back into the station and they came over the allowed speaker and

1553
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:50,520
just went, you guys wanna go again?

1554
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,400
Because it was just so empty.

1555
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,200
There was no line and we rode it like three or four times.

1556
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,200
But not 14.

1557
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,200
14 times.

1558
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,200
Wow.

1559
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,200
Not 14.

1560
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,200
No.

1561
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,200
But you had no church to avoid.

1562
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,200
No I had no church to avoid.

1563
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:08,440
But it is fun when it is like fun to do a ride and like not get out of your seat.

1564
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:09,440
Oh yeah that's great.

1565
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,440
Once more.

1566
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:11,440
Once more old boy.

1567
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:14,160
Yeah no like the whole time and I was just like this the whole time.

1568
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,160
I was like you wanna do it again?

1569
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,160
I was like yeah.

1570
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:23,000
And the whole and like every time it happened I would scream like yeah.

1571
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,560
Is there any argument, the most religious listener listening to this podcast is there

1572
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:35,440
any argument that Nick was wrong to do like people sat through church at a police academy

1573
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,600
theater instead of going on a ride 14 times?

1574
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:42,320
Yeah technically you could have been baptized, you might have been bathed in the water by

1575
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,600
doing that ride so many times.

1576
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,600
This was testing God.

1577
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,520
I like to think that there would be like a you know when you're in church there's a couple

1578
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,080
moments where you're silent and you pray.

1579
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:54,760
I like to think they were a little silent and all of a sudden they heard.

1580
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,760
Okay.

1581
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,760
Funny you mentioned that.

1582
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,760
I read too much.

1583
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:58,760
Sorry.

1584
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,720
Funny you mentioned that.

1585
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:05,560
So I did it and after the 14th time he was like we gotta go.

1586
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,160
We have to shut down the ride because no one's using it.

1587
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,160
I was like well I'm using it.

1588
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:11,800
I was like yeah but still you're 11.

1589
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:12,800
Get out.

1590
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:17,280
I was like but hey man just know this you beat the record.

1591
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,280
Wow.

1592
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,280
Wow that's great.

1593
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,640
Well what do you know what it was before?

1594
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,720
He said it was like 11 but you beat the record.

1595
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:28,280
Oh so you had a little bit of buffer room too if someone tried to challenge yours.

1596
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,640
Looking back he probably was lying.

1597
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,120
It's possible.

1598
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,880
There's no way to know though.

1599
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,480
He didn't have an official Guinness book with him.

1600
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,200
No he didn't have a notary.

1601
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:43,160
There was a post-it note a faded post-it note on the wall of his like little operating cube

1602
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:47,520
that just said 11 and then they had to cross that out and change it to 14.

1603
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,520
You know what it's your record.

1604
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,520
You got it.

1605
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,520
That is a fun.

1606
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,520
That's a great.

1607
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,520
So well it's not over.

1608
01:09:53,520 --> 01:10:02,440
So I was soaking wet like you just see a water trail following me and the youth group lady

1609
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:06,080
the head of it who was like friends with my mom was like Nick where have you been?

1610
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:10,040
I was like I was in church.

1611
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:14,840
I was next to like the Mahoney poster and she was like no you're not you're soaking wet.

1612
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,280
I was like how do you know?

1613
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,280
It's from earlier.

1614
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,200
You were like you're writing the tidal wave right.

1615
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,920
I was like how do you know?

1616
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,560
We heard you.

1617
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,240
It happened.

1618
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:28,200
Also there's a trail of water.

1619
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:31,040
I was like nah.

1620
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,120
I was there we talked about Jesus.

1621
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:39,160
Go down to the river to pray.

1622
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:45,120
And she was like so I got home and they were all mad at me and I had to sit by myself on

1623
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,400
the bus mostly maybe because I was covered in chlorine water.

1624
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,600
Yeah that probably.

1625
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,000
So my parents were like hey how'd the thing go?

1626
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,800
And I was like it was good a lot of fun and then like a half an hour later my mom got

1627
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:02,040
a call and they were like Nick get down here.

1628
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,960
It was like did you skip church?

1629
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:13,640
I was like yeah but I beat the record for tidal wave and they were like okay.

1630
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,680
This is a great story.

1631
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:18,680
That is great.

1632
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:22,280
They were like okay just don't be a dick about it.

1633
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,560
Don't lie to them just own it.

1634
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,240
If you had been to church you would have learned about humility.

1635
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,640
Don't go bragging about that record.

1636
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:33,560
I mean that is most of Jesus's teachings don't be a dick about it.

1637
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:37,200
They framed it that way I'd go.

1638
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,200
That's incredible.

1639
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,840
We've joked about your dad not raising you right for dumb reasons.

1640
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:41,840
He raised me right.

1641
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,840
It was evident he did from this tale.

1642
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,120
He weighed one thing against the other.

1643
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,320
They were great parents.

1644
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,320
They just you know.

1645
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,320
Yeah.

1646
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,320
Well it was weird.

1647
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,320
I grew up in Texas.

1648
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,560
I had two parents from Long Island in this Long Island liberal bubble in the middle of

1649
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,200
Houston Texas.

1650
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:01,080
So I grew up like listening to Skinnerd and you know.

1651
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,080
Kiss.

1652
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,080
Listen.

1653
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,080
Well yeah and kiss but like also.

1654
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,080
Oh you.

1655
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,080
I used to listen.

1656
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,080
Enjoying progressive politics.

1657
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,080
Yeah.

1658
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,440
That's you today.

1659
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:14,760
And your parents are yeah because you don't get into it politically with them.

1660
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:19,840
My dad is they live across from a giant junior high and he puts a big Obama sign for every

1661
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,840
election.

1662
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:21,840
That's fun.

1663
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,840
So I think we should start.

1664
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,840
That's the current one.

1665
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,840
Yeah that's kind of useless now.

1666
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:26,840
Maybe still.

1667
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,920
He really liked him.

1668
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:29,920
Yeah.

1669
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,920
Well hey remember when we had a decent president.

1670
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,920
Let's not get political.

1671
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:33,920
Okay.

1672
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,360
Let's not let's not ruin it.

1673
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,360
No no.

1674
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,360
That's how this podcast is about.

1675
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:42,760
You know you were talking about renting out Astroworld for a private event and we should

1676
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:48,360
mention how the first Googling I did of Astroworld when we started talking about this topic

1677
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:56,880
that very recently Six Flags Magic Mountain was rented out by Travis Scott who is a rap

1678
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:03,600
guy and Kylie Jenner who is a name that I see in headlines from something called Just

1679
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:08,560
Jared when I scan past them on Twitter as fast as possible.

1680
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:13,800
These people ran it out Six Flags Magic Mountain here in Los Angeles to turn it into Astroworld

1681
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,680
just for a night for Travis Scott's birthday.

1682
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:17,680
He has.

1683
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:22,960
He has an album forthcoming maybe out by the time this comes out called Astroworld.

1684
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,440
So for one special night Astroworld was back here in Los Angeles.

1685
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,440
But you know.

1686
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:29,440
And I missed it.

1687
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,440
Yeah.

1688
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,080
I was gonna say Kanye West was invited.

1689
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,320
Nick Mundy was not invited.

1690
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,320
And with good reason.

1691
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,320
I guess they heard about it.

1692
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:37,320
I disagree.

1693
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,320
I think you have a record.

1694
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,120
They were the worst at throwing basketballs at everyone.

1695
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:45,600
With that oh the dream of Nick Mundy throwing basketballs at all these people.

1696
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,320
Or just climbing into the water slides and just hanging out.

1697
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,320
Hey.

1698
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:50,680
Give me a dollar Kanye.

1699
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:51,680
What's up?

1700
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:52,680
Stop tweeting Kanye.

1701
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:56,760
You should have been invited as a prominent Houston public figure.

1702
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:57,760
That's crazy.

1703
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:58,760
You should have been able to be there.

1704
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,360
Or at least Mattress Mack.

1705
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:02,360
What's that?

1706
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,800
Mattress Mack is the hero of Houston who opened up.

1707
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:09,320
He has this furniture store called Gallery Furniture who said like if you buy this furniture

1708
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,800
and the Astros win you don't have to pay for it.

1709
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,160
And he's also the guy during hurricanes.

1710
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:16,920
He'll open his store and let people just sleep in all the beds.

1711
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,600
He's the greatest Houstonian ever.

1712
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,600
He kind of looks like Ernest meets Mr. Rogers.

1713
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,000
But he's just screaming in all the commercials.

1714
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,080
Look up any Mattress Mack commercial.

1715
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,600
He's the greatest Houstonian ever.

1716
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,600
Oh nice.

1717
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,600
Houstonian.

1718
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:31,600
Wow.

1719
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,760
So it'll never be you and it'll never be Travis Scott.

1720
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,320
It will always be Mattress Mack.

1721
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,320
Yes.

1722
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,320
I want to make a Mattress Mack movie.

1723
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,320
Oh yeah.

1724
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,080
That's a good idea actually.

1725
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:44,160
There hasn't been like a good movie about any of these crazy commercial dudes.

1726
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,360
I didn't see movies about all of them.

1727
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,360
Oh Mattress Mack.

1728
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,560
Mattress is free.

1729
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,680
Every single one of these guys.

1730
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:50,840
The Question Mark suit guy.

1731
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,840
Matthew what's his face?

1732
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,840
Oh yeah.

1733
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:55,040
I'd love to hear the whole story of the Question Mark suit guy.

1734
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,920
The Empire Carpet Man.

1735
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,480
Yeah that too.

1736
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,480
Empire.

1737
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:02,720
Did you guys have Menards out here or were in Texas or was that only from Midwest?

1738
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:03,920
There was a Menards man.

1739
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:08,280
It was like a hardware store and they you know they sold mulch.

1740
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:13,040
And he was like he'd like say save big money at Menards and he was a very like kindly old

1741
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,040
man.

1742
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,040
Always like a local.

1743
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,040
I mean Empire is a little bit.

1744
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:18,440
Workbook Warehouse would be a great movie.

1745
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,440
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

1746
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,440
In the LA folks.

1747
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:23,160
But I don't want you know I've talked about the film The Founder.

1748
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:29,280
I don't want any like plot where you know the guys doing business chicanery and getting

1749
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,280
corrupt.

1750
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,920
I want a story that starts with a nice guy with a dream and ends with a guy whose dream

1751
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,040
came true and who helps hurricane victims.

1752
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,360
Yeah that's a match for smack.

1753
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:39,360
No drama.

1754
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,360
Yeah.

1755
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,360
Why do movies have to have drama?

1756
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,200
Why can't they be just a bunch of nice stuff?

1757
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,600
He used to promote a lot of the wrestling house shows.

1758
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,600
Really?

1759
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,680
Yeah buy a couch get like a house ticket show for free.

1760
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:50,680
Did you ever do that?

1761
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,680
I believe we did actually.

1762
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,440
You bought a couch so you could get wrestling tickets?

1763
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,440
Yeah.

1764
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,200
No do you guys remember with Six Flags at least with Astroworld?

1765
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,160
Like if you brought in Coke cans that were just.

1766
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:02,920
Yeah that is still a big promotional thing for them.

1767
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:08,920
I found a video on YouTube of like a bunch of old Astroworld commercials like strung

1768
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:14,280
together and you could just see the evolution of Coke cans like from when they used to be

1769
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:21,040
kind of squat where they're like bring a bring a recyclable 16 ounce glass Coke bottle bring

1770
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:27,280
the bottle cap to like the introduction of Diet Coke to like the introduction.

1771
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:31,880
And now it's like bring a thin millennial targeting Diet Coke.

1772
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:32,880
With a wild.

1773
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:33,880
Blood orange can.

1774
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:39,840
I remember that Pepsi okay so as you guys probably know Astroworld and Six Flags was

1775
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,400
a Coca-Cola distributed.

1776
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,400
Yep.

1777
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,400
Okay.

1778
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:48,520
But Pepsi set up a bunch of stands where you could do the Pepsi challenge and win license

1779
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,520
to chill cards.

1780
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,800
Oh wow that's really smart.

1781
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,440
And did you do the Pepsi challenge?

1782
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,280
And I was like this is gonna change everything.

1783
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,960
I got my first credit card and it didn't do dick.

1784
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:03,360
A license to chill card was a Pepsi oriented credit card.

1785
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:10,160
It was like a coupon card where if you scanned it at certain places like Blockbuster Music

1786
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,960
Plus you would get a dollar off like a tape.

1787
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:14,960
Wow.

1788
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,320
So it looked like Van Halen's Right Now would play when you scanned it.

1789
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,920
So it looked like a credit card but it was just a discount it was a coupon.

1790
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,920
Yeah.

1791
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,840
Oh and the cool thing about Astroworld 2 was it pumped music out.

1792
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:31,280
That's what right now Van Halen's Right Now I was like yeah I remember being like they

1793
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,280
played this nine times.

1794
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,400
I remember hearing live a bunch.

1795
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,400
Did you see concerts?

1796
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,960
Because Astroworld also had a concert venue.

1797
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,280
No Astro Arena was.

1798
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:43,760
So I'm reading here the Southern Star Amphitheater.

1799
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:44,760
Do you know what that is?

1800
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,760
Vanquish yes.

1801
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,640
So it seemed it was in the southeast corner of Astroworld I'm just looking from the Wikipedia

1802
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:50,640
here in 1980.

1803
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,640
In the venue I think there were a lot of different performers that came there.

1804
01:17:54,640 --> 01:18:01,440
This venue was frequented by performers including Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band.

1805
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,960
Oh man early days.

1806
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:07,160
The early days Jimmy frequently playing Astroworld.

1807
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:11,480
He apparently is associated with every different theme park we ever go to.

1808
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,080
He's a regular at Church Street Station.

1809
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,480
He has his footprint over all these places.

1810
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:20,120
So I think this was before you were obviously going there.

1811
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:28,480
Yeah look man if back in the days when I went to Astroworld a lot if the music wasn't either

1812
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:32,720
Kiss the offspring or Live I wasn't interested.

1813
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:33,720
A lot.

1814
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,280
It was in the mix.

1815
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:40,600
Oh yeah man Throwing Copper that was all 1994 was the best year of music ever.

1816
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,040
Did you throw at Copper?

1817
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:44,680
Did you go to like a Lollapalooza or something?

1818
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:46,600
No I went to BuzzFest.

1819
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,600
What was BuzzFest?

1820
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:54,280
BuzzFest was like the bullshit alternative music of like 1998.

1821
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,760
Okay you mean like Matchbox 20 and stuff?

1822
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:57,760
No it was worse.

1823
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,400
It was like I don't even remember a band.

1824
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:03,280
It was like like pre-Hoobe Stank bands.

1825
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:18,560
No but then the best show I ever went to was Skinnerd, Steve Miller, Survivor, Bad Company

1826
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:19,920
and Styx.

1827
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,840
And this was by Astroworld?

1828
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:22,840
No this was just.

1829
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,840
Oh you're just telling us about a concert you went to?

1830
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,120
Well he asked me like what concert.

1831
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,160
This is you're making Jason furious here.

1832
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:36,040
Yeah well it was the first time I ever did acid so.

1833
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,040
What?

1834
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,040
What?

1835
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:39,040
What happened?

1836
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,040
I was 15 I was at the show.

1837
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:41,040
We've never done drugs before.

1838
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,680
I was 15 at the show and I was like hey you want some?

1839
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:48,720
And I was like yep and then I woke up in Freebird with a cape.

1840
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,720
Whoa really?

1841
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:50,720
And that's all I remember.

1842
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:51,960
You were on the stage.

1843
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:52,960
You were singing it.

1844
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,600
I have found the lineups for BuzzFest if you're interested.

1845
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,600
Let's hear it.

1846
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,600
Look up BuzzFest 98.

1847
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,600

1849
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:01,600
Here we go.

1850
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,600
No wait 96.

1851
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:03,600

1852
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,600
96 okay.

1853
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:09,600
Here are the bands Gravity Kills which I believe they were on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack

1854
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,600
if I'm correct.

1855
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,320

Yeah that's the one.

1858

Yeah Atticus.

Atticus Finch.

1861
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,720
Weird choice.

1862
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:20,720
Weird choice.

1863
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:21,720
Weird choice.

1864
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,760

01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:29,920
Modern English.

Yeah the Nixons.

1872
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:35,040
Yep I remember that was a big draw.

1873
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,200
Poe.

1874
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,880
Too Much Joy and The Toadies.

1875
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,680
Oh I like this one.

1876
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:41,680
I know The Toadies.

1877
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,680
Sorry.

1878
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:45,120
But not Dexter Freebish.

1879
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,120
Right not the band Dexter.

1880
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,120
Not the band Dexter.

1881
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,760
And named after the rollercoaster.

1882
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:57,360
I remember having to pay older dudes $10 because I was like 15 but I looked like 12 to buy

1883
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,960
me beer.

1884
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,080
Oh really?

1885
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,080
For $5 beer.

1886
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,080
And how old were you again?

1887
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,080
15 or 14.

1888
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,080
Wow.

1889
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,720
So you were making those transactions back then.

1890
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:06,720
Yeah.

1891
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:09,880
Man you were doing cool grown-up stuff in 14 and 15.

1892
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,880
Can I um.

1893
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,560
It would be another decade before I had a beer.

1894
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:15,920
It's against the rules.

1895
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:21,700
I'd like to use this to transition into you were talking about the cool soundtrack Mortal

1896
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:23,400
Combat correct?

1897
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,760
Yeah.

1898
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:28,520
Another film of the mid 90s with a cool soundtrack Batman Forever.

1899
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,520
Of course.

1900
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,880
And there was a Batman Forever stunt show as we mentioned and the stunt show among many

1901
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:37,920
other I watched a video of the stunt show it seemed like a great one.

1902
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:38,920
I don't know if you went.

1903
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,280
I did it.

1904
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:41,280
It's fantastic.

1905
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:48,480
It's got a really good you know Houston actor pretending to be the Jim Carrey Riddler.

1906
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:55,200
But like and like amazing like inflatable sets that that Nigma brain stealing machine

1907
01:21:55,200 --> 01:22:01,280
is like not on this dock set and then it like explodes out of a box in an inflatable fashion.

1908
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,460
It's really cool.

1909
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:07,920
But one cool facet of the show is that they use the Batman Forever soundtrack which of

1910
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,880
course has you too.

1911
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:11,880
Hold me kiss me.

1912
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:12,960
Hold me thrill me.

1913
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:13,960
Kiss me kill me.

1914
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:14,960
Yeah yeah.

1915
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:21,160
And and you know the obviously the famous song Kiss Me Rose and I just want to play.

1916
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:22,720
I feel like I'm going to debate that.

1917
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:29,960
I feel like kiss me kill me hold me thrill me was the bigger song at the time.

1918
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:30,960
Maybe.

1919
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,400
They were both like the two biggest songs of the.

1920
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,520
I think I can look this up and see what they charted.

1921
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:42,800
My music teacher we had this was a thing they would make us do we get like these music school

1922
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:48,520
music magazines and he's like we're going to deconstruct a popular song and this month

1923
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:55,440
it's Kiss From A Rose deconstruct like like talk about like here's the medley and here's

1924
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,880
the bridge and here's the.

1925
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:03,200
And then he also did that with I Believe I Could Fly.

1926
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,960
Oh so and 90s soundtrack greats.

1927
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,880
Yeah there's all of these weird this is bringing up weird memories of like we taught we said

1928
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:16,720
the Pepsi challenge we did a few days of science class in fourth grade doing the Pepsi challenge

1929
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:20,800
and talking about how soda is made and the construct.

1930
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:25,920
We also that same teacher had us vote for the new color M&M like we would do all these

1931
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,920
weird corporate tie in.

1932
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:29,920
Makes a lot of sense.

1933
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,800
He's the first influencer.

1934
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:36,920
Yeah I picked right I picked blue and we still love the blue M&M to this day.

1935
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:38,800
You caused it yourself.

1936
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:44,520
Did you debate to let the Trix rabbit have finally have the cereal in the class.

1937
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:48,640
I believe that was always my stance that if we just let these creatures have a bowl of

1938
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:51,680
cereal or two they would calm the fuck down.

1939
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:56,800
Would you say the free market should have decided if Trix rabbit got its cereal.

1940
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,800
Pay for it rabbit.

1941
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:58,800
Interesting.

1942
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,760
So I just want to play really fast.

1943
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:05,760
This is from the beginning of the Batman forever.

1944
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,840
I don't want to get the name wrong because it's one of those good.

1945
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:13,560
The Batman forever water stunt spectacular water stunts.

1946
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:16,860
So at the beginning of the show the audience is settling in and they're giving a couple

1947
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:22,760
safety warnings and they you can tell they want to kick off the show with a clip from

1948
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:26,920
the Batman forever soundtrack but then they have more announcements they have to play.

1949
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,600
So it leads to this.

1950
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:29,600
Take a listen.

1951
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:36,280
Please assist those now entering the facility by sliding into the middle of your section

1952
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,480
filling in every available seat.

1953
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,480
Thank you.

1954
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:45,440
Additionally the cast and crew of Batman would like to thank you.

1955
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,440
Did you catch that?

1956
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:47,440
Bada bada.

1957
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,440
Bada bada.

1958
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:51,160
Wait hold on one minute seal.

1959
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:53,040
Stay in bay seal.

1960
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:58,560
I've looked up the chart positions and kiss from a rose is the bigger song.

1961
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,520
Don't be wrong it was a better song too.

1962
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:05,360
I just remember at the time MTV was playing the YouTube video more than.

1963
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,800
But maybe you just like to rock out a little harder with you too.

1964
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:12,200
No I liked seal because I knew this song could come in handy one day.

1965
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,200
What do you mean?

1966
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,200
Kiss from Rose was played at your.

1967
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:15,600
I knew what sex was in eighth grade.

1968
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,680
Oh well I didn't.

1969
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:17,680
I wasn't sure.

1970
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,840
Wait did you use it for seduction purposes?

1971
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,720
No but just I knew down the road.

1972
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,720
I will say that.

1973
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:23,720
When I was in college.

1974
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:28,540
This is a thing that I was kind of unearthed a few years ago because my girlfriend Lindsay

1975
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:34,120
will often like talk about how I won't admit to like having crushes or anything that I

1976
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:39,040
have like no like I try to like I don't know like wipe that part out of my memory or my

1977
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:43,400
history but I will say I remember that the first time I ever really had like a crush

1978
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:47,640
on an actress it was for sure Nicole Kidman from Batman Forever.

1979
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:50,600
That's a bit burned into my brain.

1980
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:51,600
Sure.

1981
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:55,000
Well you'll be able to hear Dr. Chase Meridian is in the snut show.

1982
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
It's not Nicole but.

1983
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Oh okay.

1984
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,680
But as long as.

1985
01:25:58,680 --> 01:25:59,680
She works as an avatar.

1986
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:04,120
I guess I am really more attracted to Chase than Nicole because Chase is a totally different

1987
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,120
character.

1988
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,120
She's very smart.

1989
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,120
She's very smart.

1990
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,120
She's very learned.

1991
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:09,120
But she does love.

1992
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,120
She likes bad boys.

1993
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:11,120
Yes she loves bad boys.

1994
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:16,120
She loves the car because chicks dig the car and she's also loves like grabbing those rubber

1995
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:19,720
muscles which is a thing she does in the movie.

1996
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:22,920
Oh she reaches up and yeah because this was this is the Batman.

1997
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:28,440
This is Schumacher Batman with the big old chests and big old cod pieces.

1998
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:30,000
Not the nipples yet.

1999
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,840
Not nips till Batman and Robin.

2000
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:32,840
Right.

2001
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:35,800
Can we all admit Val Kilmer is an underrated Batman?

2002
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:36,800
I think so.

2003
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,800
I'd say so.

2004
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:38,800
Val Kilmer rules.

2005
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:39,800
Sure.

2006
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:40,800
I like Val Kilmer.

2007
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,800
I think he's the best Bruce Wayne there's ever been.

2008
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:43,800
Yeah.

2009
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:44,800
Because Clooney's distracting.

2010
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,800
Well no why would you even.

2011
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,800
We all know.

2012
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:48,800
Barely in it as Bruce Wayne.

2013
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:49,800
No.

2014
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:50,800
As the best Bruce Wayne.

2015
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:51,800
Okay wait no.

2016
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,280
As Keaton but never mind.

2017
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:57,560
But he's not bad is what you're saying and should be kept.

2018
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:02,400
It's also a movie that I like but is maybe not the best movie in the world so maybe the

2019
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:07,680
material if he was in a movie with maybe some better dialogue he would have popped a little

2020
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:08,680
bit more.

2021
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:09,680
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.

2022
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:10,680
Sultan C. Sure.

2023
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:12,040
There's some 2000's stuff that he's great in.

2024
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:13,040
Oh MacGruber.

2025
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,040
Yeah.

2026
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:19,400
I this is you talk about the goofy movie Batman Forever is one of those.

2027
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,080
It might be horrible.

2028
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:25,520
I don't know but it's impossible for me to unravel it from how much I loved it when it

2029
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:26,520
came out.

2030
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:29,600
I will never be able to totally remove my experience.

2031
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:34,680
McDonald's cups that I still have the glass McDonald's cups of the characters and like

2032
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:38,600
every time there would be a Batman movie it would be Batman Summer Batman Fever.

2033
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:42,840
You know McDonald's and you feel like you were eating Batman.

2034
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,760
So that is your sacrament.

2035
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,760
That is your church.

2036
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:46,760
Oh yes.

2037
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:47,760
You're taking the host.

2038
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:48,760
Eating Batman.

2039
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:51,680
You're like a quarter pounder that had a little bat symbol on it or something.

2040
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:55,800
Had to eat it in because if you remove the sacrament from the McDonald's it's not Batman

2041
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:56,800
anymore.

2042
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,040
It's just like the body of Christ.

2043
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,320
Take this gray meat.

2044
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,120
It is the body of Batman.

2045
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:05,880
This actually just reminded me of a weird story I remember growing up.

2046
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:09,320
My parents my mom was sick for a couple years in junior high.

2047
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:12,780
Like there was something they couldn't tell what's wrong she ended up going to Mayo Clinic.

2048
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:13,780
She was fine.

2049
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:17,560
She ended up being fine but they were doing a lot of testing and they're like they were

2050
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:21,000
still kind of keeping me and my brother out of the dark and they're like hey we're gonna

2051
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:27,200
go to a normal doctor's visit and which was weird that they said it that way.

2052
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,760
Why don't you guys go to the movies?

2053
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,560
Why don't you go and then we're like okay cool.

2054
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:37,960
So we saw Batman Forever for like the fourth time and then my dad stopped by and he was

2055
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:39,900
like look we're still at the doctors.

2056
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,160
Go to another movie.

2057
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:46,280
So we saw Apollo 13 and then we saw the Power Rangers movie and then he was like look just

2058
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:47,640
go one more movie.

2059
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:52,360
So we saw Batman Forever again and we were like yeah this was the best day ever while

2060
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:55,880
my parents were like chasing mortality.

2061
01:28:55,880 --> 01:29:00,920
Yeah everything ended up being fine but like the worst day for my parents life was probably

2062
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,640
like my favorite day ever.

2063
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,640
Wow.

2064
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:08,520
Can you imagine if today you were stuck in a movie theater and had to see four in a row.

2065
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,240
I couldn't choose one.

2066
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:13,080
I would just play with the claw machine for eight hours.

2067
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:14,080
Sure.

2068
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,080
There's no bigger nightmare.

2069
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:16,560
I guess we'll go see.

2070
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,560
You were never really here again.

2071
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:25,760
This is so totally weird how my brain just did this but you said Batman Forever again

2072
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:30,320
and I imagine the movie Batman Forever again that doesn't exist.

2073
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:35,040
That's just the same characters and I was like whoa I want to see Batman Forever again.

2074
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:42,000
I like the idea of splitting off specific sequels into separate cinematic universes.

2075
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:48,640
Something that is almost only tested by National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2 Uncle Eddie's

2076
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:49,640
Island Adventure.

2077
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:52,800
Don't forget The Rise of Taj Van Wilder.

2078
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:57,120
But that's still that's a spinoff of a character but it could still there wasn't a different

2079
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,440
Van Wilder was there.

2080
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:59,440
Was there a Van Wilder too?

2081
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,400
I think Van Wilder had graduated.

2082
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,440
Oh I see.

2083
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:10,120
Is the vacation movies just in a multiverse and like Clark and Ellen are the same constant

2084
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:12,360
but like that's why how you explain.

2085
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:13,360
Rusty.

2086
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,400
It's in the same multiverse but it's in different dimensions.

2087
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:23,600
It's sort of like how Judy Dench is M in some of the James Bond's no matter how many James

2088
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,880
Bond's there are.

2089
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:30,440
And Michael Goh is Alfred and it's the same for different Batman movies.

2090
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,280
See I'm a nerd.

2091
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:34,000
Yeah you can do this stuff.

2092
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
You can hang with us.

2093
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,760
Anyway yeah all the vacation movies are their own separate universe and which one would

2094
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:46,080
you most if you were stuck in one if you were stuck in a vacation verse which one is like

2095
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,680
the most pleasant to you.

2096
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:53,000
Which which if you were like related to which set of Griswolds which one would you stick

2097
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
with.

2098
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,200
Probably Christmas because the European one is just spooky as shit.

2099
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:58,200
It's very unpleasant.

2100
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,200
That's a weird movie.

2101
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:03,000
I don't want to hear that Dr. John song about new looks ever again.

2102
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,200
Oh god damn it.

2103
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:09,240
That plays every day in a constant loop in that multiverse.

2104
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:10,840
Here's a weird fact about me.

2105
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,880
The first vacation movie I ever saw was Vegas.

2106
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:17,840
I have a lot of affection for Vegas vacation.

2107
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,520
Yeah I like that too.

2108
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,640
How come?

2109
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:21,640
We just saw it.

2110
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,120
I think we saw it like a couple times.

2111
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:25,840
It was one of those movies I think it was an HBO every day.

2112
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:31,240
Yeah it was a VHS release when it was just like everyone just always had new release

2113
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,600
VHS's or rentals or whatever.

2114
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:37,440
It's definitely not as bad as it would be today.

2115
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:42,320
Yes the version of it that would come out today would be unbelievably bad.

2116
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:47,320
It would be in tight you could tell that Sid Caesar section that they just like let him

2117
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:51,040
he's a comedy legend so let's just let him do too many takes and be too broad and go

2118
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:56,760
too nuts which is how every movie is now with people who are not comedy legends.

2119
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:59,520
Just let this play out for 25 minutes.

2120
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,520
That is what happens.

2121
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,320
But since you that's Sid Caesar death is very funny.

2122
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:04,320
That is funny.

2123
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,360
Wala Sean great little yeah.

2124
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:10,800
I just enjoyed him in book what I'm calling book trip because I can't remember the name

2125
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:11,800
of the movie.

2126
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:12,800
Book club.

2127
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,400
Okay I'm gonna still call it book trip.

2128
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:18,120
Real quick how do you guys get to two hours every episode?

2129
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:21,640
With tight concise analysis of great attractions.

2130
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:26,480
I was about to just launch into a big Wala Sean chunk but we won't do that.

2131
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:29,480
That is conversely I have never seen Princess Bride.

2132
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:30,480
Oh wow.

2133
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:31,480
I haven't either.

2134
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:36,560
Yeah I just like my goof like you were saying you didn't see the goofy movie until recently.

2135
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:39,000
Okay don't compare Princess Bride to fucking goofy movie.

2136
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,800
Well at a certain point it just hits so mass saturation people would say the lines were

2137
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:49,320
like to the point of like Holy Monty Python the Holy Grail where it's like oh it's tough

2138
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:50,640
saying the fucking lines.

2139
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,440
Yeah that didn't happen with the goofy movie.

2140
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:57,440
The goofy movie came out and then Twitter happened last year and people just started

2141
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:58,440
talking about it.

2142
01:32:58,440 --> 01:32:59,920
I completely forgot it existed.

2143
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:04,560
Because a lot of our culture is millennial certain age range of millennials are hitting

2144
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:11,280
disposable income level of adulthood and so culture manufacturers are like yeah we'll

2145
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:13,680
shove out some Disney afternoon merchandise.

2146
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:14,800
Hell yeah.

2147
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,960
Millennials will buy like goofy movie merch but they won't spend eight dollars on a buffet.

2148
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:24,440
Hey I didn't think we had enough time to properly enjoy the buffet on my lunch break.

2149
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:25,800
You said it was eight dollars.

2150
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:26,800
I thought it was more.

2151
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:27,800
Every place is eight dollars.

2152
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:30,000
I'll tell you our Astro World story if you want to hear it.

2153
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,960
No I think we'll turn our backs from you Monty.

2154
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:33,760
We haven't even gotten to Marvel yet.

2155
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:34,760
Oh God.

2156
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:35,760
Okay well then let's.

2157
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:37,760
We're all vibrating to talk about that.

2158
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:38,760
Let's get back on track.

2159
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:39,760
Here we go.

2160
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:43,440
All right I have one last Astro World memory that just you know a lot of this stuff is

2161
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:50,920
just flooding back but there was one instance at Astro World that changed my life.

2162
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:56,960
You know the recording booths where you and friends can record a song.

2163
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,800
Yes together like and you get a cassette tape.

2164
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:00,800
Sure.

2165
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:07,800
So me and three of my buddies some of my best friends we did one we did Metallica's one

2166
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:08,800
you know.

2167
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:09,800
Yeah.

2168
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:13,280
And we were like the whole time we were like this is pretty good.

2169
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,560
This is pretty good.

2170
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:21,720
I'm going to quit football start playing drums and we're going to start a band.

2171
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:26,720
Oh and that affected the next two years of my life.

2172
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:27,720
Oh really.

2173
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:31,280
Because you were in spite you thought like we're fucking kicking ass.

2174
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,280
Yeah.

2175
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:33,280
At this Metallica one.

2176
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,720
This is how we're hearing it back.

2177
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:39,240
How goddamn stupid that do you have it.

2178
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:41,560
Again there's shit that might be in my parents bar.

2179
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:44,240
You want to hear your cover of Metallica's one.

2180
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:50,120
The version that presumably does not include drums because they did not give you a tiny

2181
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:51,920
drum set to fit in the recording.

2182
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:54,880
We're just singing acapella but they they put the instrumental version.

2183
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:58,320
So you would hear the acapella track in your headphones and sing with it.

2184
01:34:58,320 --> 01:34:59,600
No there was no guiding track.

2185
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:00,600
No what.

2186
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,280
It was just the recorded song.

2187
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:08,080
It was just like no it was just the instrumental.

2188
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:14,760
And you then you're here in this recording and like man I'm pretty good at drums.

2189
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:15,760
That's insane.

2190
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:19,440
So then that caused you to now you've now you feel like you don't have drive.

2191
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,880
Now your parents mad at you.

2192
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,240
I feel like I know what's that.

2193
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:23,240
But they were like you're not.

2194
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:26,640
You have no musical ability and I was like yeah well I'm still going to do it.

2195
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:27,640
Yeah.

2196
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:28,640
And you bought a drum set and stuff.

2197
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:29,640
I bought a drum kit.

2198
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:30,640
Did two years of drum lessons.

2199
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:33,360
Tried to had one show.

2200
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,960
It's just one.

2201
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,960
So you never got good at drums.

2202
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,040
No I was terrible.

2203
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:39,940
And how hardcore were you practicing.

2204
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:40,940
Like almost every day.

2205
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:41,940
Really.

2206
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:44,360
But it got you into the arts.

2207
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:45,920
Incredible drive.

2208
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,000
If I had no ability.

2209
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,960
I don't have a drum set but if I did you couldn't.

2210
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:54,400
I could play like some but like I never got any.

2211
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,400
Wow.

2212
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:56,400
Yeah.

2213
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:57,400
That's crazy.

2214
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:58,400
You didn't play the Southern Star amphitheater.

2215
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,240
The damn Wiener kids never made it.

2216
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:04,920
You were not there with Scott Baio and the TV Stars Tour brought to you by Pizza Hut.

2217
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:05,920
We were not.

2218
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:06,920
Huh.

2219
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:07,920
I missed that.

2220
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:12,720
That's in the string of Astroworld commercials Pizza Hut sponsored a music series.

2221
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:16,600
So it's like this Friday Scott Baio and the TV Stars Tour.

2222
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:19,840
Next Friday Wolfman Jack.

2223
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:25,320
And then just a bunch of country you know lifers country music lifers who I never heard

2224
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:26,320
of.

2225
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:28,000
You could just see on Friday nights at Astroworld.

2226
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,240
Yeah so Astroworld was big for me.

2227
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:35,140
And then I was crushed when I found out in 2005 I was living in LA that they closed it

2228
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:38,440
down to create parking for the rodeo.

2229
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:42,200
This is the dullest reason that anything ever.

2230
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,400
That parking is worth a fortune.

2231
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,960
And like the rodeo you don't fuck around with the rodeo.

2232
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:50,960
But so the rodeo is only sometimes during the year.

2233
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:51,960
Yeah.

2234
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:52,960
But it's that crucial.

2235
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:53,960
Yes.

2236
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:54,960
Once a year.

2237
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:55,960
Five.

2238
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:57,160
Yeah for five weeks like four or five weeks.

2239
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:58,640
It's like a fair but even shorter.

2240
01:36:58,640 --> 01:36:59,840
It's like the Olympics or something.

2241
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:02,680
We're willing to like demolish things for this one event.

2242
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:03,680
Oh totally.

2243
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:07,680
Well that's what reading about the closing it seemed like they thought like this is an

2244
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:10,080
incredibly valuable piece of property.

2245
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:12,840
We're going to close it and sell it for a fortune.

2246
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:15,760
We're going to sell it for one hundred fifty million dollars.

2247
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:18,840
And then they sold it for half that much.

2248
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:24,720
And that led to the guy in charge being fired from the from I think the six flags.

2249
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:28,680
Between the football and you know the rodeo which I mean football again it's only like

2250
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:31,040
12 dates a year.

2251
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,040
I mean yeah.

2252
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,040
Wow.

2253
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:35,960
And I think six it was not making money and no one was going.

2254
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:39,280
Yeah it didn't seem like it was due it wasn't one of the best six flags.

2255
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:43,920
I think I read it was like eight or something.

2256
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:45,240
Throw a basketball at him.

2257
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:50,200
There is an argument to say that it's the best because of a certain character.

2258
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:53,000
Yeah you know let's to not end on a bummer note.

2259
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Yeah.

2260
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,160
The sadness of the park disappearing.

2261
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:04,000
Let's go backwards to the glory days to the early days when Astroworld was home to a marvelous

2262
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,420
man named Marvel McFay.

2263
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:12,320
Do you know about one of the greatest discoveries I think we've made doing this podcast.

2264
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:18,080
I had no knowledge of this and now I have all the knowledge of it.

2265
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:22,400
Now it is like one of the best things I think we've come across.

2266
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,200
Want to explain Marvel McFay.

2267
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,200
He.

2268
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:28,720
Nick here and I do have a phone.

2269
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:34,840
So he was an original character made for Astroworld.

2270
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:37,280
Marvel McFay and his enchanted animals.

2271
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,160
Oh shit.

2272
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,160
That's him.

2273
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:41,160
Yeah.

2274
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:44,440
He was a big bearded man with a gigantic hat.

2275
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:51,720
Found out through doing research a couple of sources say that he was designed as were

2276
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:54,720
the animals by Disney legend Raleigh Crump.

2277
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:58,400
Long time Disney imagineer.

2278
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:03,120
And Marvel McFay is an enchanted animals were walk around characters in big suits.

2279
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:10,080
You get your pictures taken with and they put on a show and it's an incredibly catchy

2280
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:11,080
song.

2281
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:13,360
I was on.

2282
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:14,360
You saw him around.

2283
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:15,360
He was like still up on Merchant.

2284
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:16,360
He was walking around.

2285
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:17,360
Yeah.

2286
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:18,360
He went away.

2287
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:19,360
Yeah.

2288
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:20,360
All right.

2289
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:21,360
So here's the song.

2290
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,360
Oh boy.

2291
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:23,360
It's just wonderful.

2292
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:24,360
Yep.

2293
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,360
From a magic land.

2294
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:26,360
On a magic day.

2295
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:27,360
Past the twinkling stars.

2296
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,360
And the milky way.

2297
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:41,360
Came a magical man.

2298
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:56,360
And he came to stay.

2299
01:39:56,360 --> 01:40:24,520
You would hear that song in like the restaurant and like different times.

2300
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,800
Wow.

2301
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:33,400
He makes a lot of sense why that didn't play well in 90s Houston Texas.

2302
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:38,960
Well I think it went away in 84 or late 80s as they started folding in more of the Warner

2303
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,360
Brother of the Looney Tunes.

2304
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:41,360
Sure.

2305
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:42,360
Looney Tunes were around.

2306
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:43,360
Yeah.

2307
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:46,160
But Pac-Man seems to have lived in harmony with Marvel McFay.

2308
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:47,160
Yeah.

2309
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:48,160
They were all running around together.

2310
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:50,240
Pac-Man was apparently running around too.

2311
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:56,440
There was a great picture from like a remembrances of Astroworld article and it's just these

2312
01:40:56,440 --> 01:41:01,760
70s teens early 20 something with big hair and they were the cast and I'm just like well

2313
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:05,440
all of these Houston theater kids were definitely hooking up with each other.

2314
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,080
There's no doubt about that.

2315
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:10,920
Marvel case of wonderful animals were hooking up with each other.

2316
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:12,400
I would assume.

2317
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,800
Apparently Marvel McFay's head and hat combination.

2318
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:20,480
There was like a one of the stories was like yeah this teenage girl was he she was one

2319
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:24,720
of the people that would do Marvel McFay and the head and hat combination is 30 pounds

2320
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:25,720
alone.

2321
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:26,720
I saw that.

2322
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:27,720
Just sitting on your shoulders.

2323
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:30,960
So if you don't do anything at Astroworld that's not dangerous it's not worth it.

2324
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:31,960
That's a good point.

2325
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:33,520
It's in keeping with the philosophy.

2326
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:36,120
But like the costumes I think look great.

2327
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:40,040
These are like great designs instantly lovable characters.

2328
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:44,780
I didn't even like stare at each of them but I love them just on quicksights so much.

2329
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:48,880
Here's a mouse that I found a photo of.

2330
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:51,360
I think it's Pierre Lerat who is French.

2331
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:52,360
Yes.

2332
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:56,640
And I found a little still where he has a caption underneath and it says Mondo time

2333
01:41:56,640 --> 01:41:58,040
for a cheese break.

2334
01:41:58,040 --> 01:41:59,840
I found that as well.

2335
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,640
Most adorable delightful thing.

2336
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:03,440
Did you find the one about the pig?

2337
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:06,200
Oh wait what is the pig?

2338
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:09,760
So I found a list of one sheet about all the animals.

2339
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:10,760
Great.

2340
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:13,760
It says here come the animals Astroworld has them all.

2341
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:21,120
And it says like furry ones fuzzy ones animals that snip snarl and smile all just for fun.

2342
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:24,720
You'll meet Astroworld animals at every turn so jump in and join the fun with Astroworld

2343
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:28,520
animals they're just for you just to make you happy.

2344
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:32,560
Do you have their names?

2345
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:35,900
So and it's very like this is a very low res.

2346
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:38,960
So it's Samantha she's a skunk.

2347
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:42,420
Sneak a flower too from Samantha the sweet smelling skunk.

2348
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:45,560
At the something I can't read in children's world.

2349
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:47,440
There's Nero the lion.

2350
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:49,520
There's Goldie the gorilla.

2351
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:53,840
There's Beethoven who I have a list without some of these.

2352
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:54,840
There was tons of things.

2353
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,320
It couldn't even fit it on one list.

2354
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:58,320
Flapper.

2355
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:02,200
Now there's also Winston who is not a punk rock dog.

2356
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:03,920
Like other Winston's.

2357
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:05,840
A wolf and then there's Pierre.

2358
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:08,600
I have his name is Pierre Reynard Lerat.

2359
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:09,600
Oh.

2360
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:14,880
See I got a question for you did every like Six Flags do this because I always remember

2361
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:19,080
Astroworld being a step above other standard like theme parks like they were trying to

2362
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:20,080
Disney fight.

2363
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,080
They were trying to go.

2364
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:22,560
This was before the Six Flags.

2365
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:23,560
Sure sure like.

2366
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:27,160
But it seems like even when it first started they were trying to put in extra effort like

2367
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:31,560
the outdoor air conditioning the air conditioning pipes that ran underneath the park and would

2368
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:33,280
blow cold air into the lines.

2369
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:36,640
That's why I think Astroworld haven't been every Six Flags but the Astroworld is better

2370
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:37,640
than every Six Flags.

2371
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:38,640
I think so.

2372
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:42,680
It's been like a hack not an ill attempt at trying to be Disneyland.

2373
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:43,680
Yeah.

2374
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:46,560
I mean the Alpine Sleigh Ride looks very similar to Matterhorn Mountain.

2375
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:47,560
There was Rio.

2376
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:48,560
They're trying theming with that.

2377
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:49,560
You know.

2378
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:52,960
Rio Miserio looks a little like the Jungle Cruise.

2379
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:56,560
Even just having characters.

2380
01:43:56,560 --> 01:44:01,680
Even just having like themed characters like this that costs money to record the song and

2381
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:05,720
have people play these characters in that heat.

2382
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:09,000
Having a mythology any theme park that did that.

2383
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:14,800
And it also I think you may have said in a text to me that Raleigh Crump was also involved

2384
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,400
in these things the trolls at Magic Mountain.

2385
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:23,040
In the 70s there was a similar set of psychedelic sort of Sid and Marty Croft adjacent characters

2386
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,120
named the trolls.

2387
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:30,320
And this is another thing I feel like is lost in the Venga boyification of Six Flags.

2388
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:36,680
These like delightful little psychedelic worlds I think are so charming and it's this specific

2389
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:38,680
little world you could only go to there.

2390
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:41,360
What was that word you said though?

2391
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,360
Which one?

2392
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:43,360
I said a lot of words.

2393
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:44,360
Venga boys.

2394
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:45,360
Venga busification.

2395
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:46,360
Yeah.

2396
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:49,200
If there's any syndrome I'm most upset about in this world.

2397
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:50,200
Here is another.

2398
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:52,920
That's the song that the old man dances to.

2399
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:54,480
He's the Venga boys.

2400
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:58,720
The Venga bus is coming.

2401
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:00,600
It is not Axel Beff.

2402
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:04,920
I thought it was a conglomerate that took over Six Flags and is homogenizing them.

2403
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:06,880
Like a Westfield type organization.

2404
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:07,880
No, no.

2405
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:08,880
They are their own already.

2406
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:09,880
Does Westfield have an amusement park?

2407
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:10,880
No, I bet someday.

2408
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:15,440
They'll start to take over Six Flags I bet as time goes on.

2409
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:20,640
I found a caption picture and it's Marvel and one of the characters and it just says

2410
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:22,480
okay Marvel hand her over.

2411
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:24,280
The frog legs are mine.

2412
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:27,640
And I don't have any context for that.

2413
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:28,640
But it's a lion.

2414
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:29,640
Oh yeah.

2415
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:34,920
Yeah it's a lion and then there's another one with the pig and it says that damn pig

2416
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:38,000
is too much of a ham for me.

2417
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,600
See I think you guys would have dug 70s 80s Houston.

2418
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:41,920
It was just bright colors.

2419
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:43,520
It was trying to get people there.

2420
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:45,240
The Astros had rainbow jerseys.

2421
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:46,240
You've seen them.

2422
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,240
Oh yes.

2423
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:50,840
You're retro because you have a hat from every era of the Astros.

2424
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:53,320
And the retro hats are wonderful.

2425
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:58,560
Those old logos and the old we haven't said I don't think the Astro world logos are fantastic.

2426
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:02,720
Here's Marvel and friends riding the Texas cyclone.

2427
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:04,840
It's so McDonaldlandy.

2428
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:05,840
It's very McDonaldlandy.

2429
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:08,840
All of their necks hurt.

2430
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:11,160
Their necks are all drooping.

2431
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:12,160
They're all heading for concussions.

2432
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:15,600
Here is a creature it's just captioned hey hey Marvel McFay.

2433
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,660
I don't even know it looks like a corn man.

2434
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:20,520
He looks like an unpainted Mayor McCheese.

2435
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:22,360
It's just raw bread.

2436
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:24,960
And I also there's a lion who I think is named Lester Lion.

2437
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:25,960
Look at that.

2438
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:28,800
I'm wearing an Astros hat just like our buddy Nick Mundy.

2439
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:29,800
Yeah.

2440
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:32,440
So there's Nero the lion and Lester Lion.

2441
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:33,440
Maybe that's Nero.

2442
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:34,440
I don't know.

2443
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:37,640
They did do a good job of all this branding but they tried.

2444
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:39,040
Oh that's a different lion.

2445
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:40,040
That's Nero.

2446
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:41,040
That's Nero the lion.

2447
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:42,040
This one is orange.

2448
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:43,760
So he's Houston Astros orange.

2449
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:46,080
So he's different I guess.

2450
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:52,040
One of Lester became a baseball player and Nero quit to play Metallica covers for two

2451
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:53,040
years.

2452
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:58,920
Did you come across Percy the Penguin.

2453
01:46:58,920 --> 01:46:59,920
He's on my list.

2454
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:00,920
I don't know anything about him.

2455
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:05,840
Well he's the only animal in the park wearing a black tuxedo is what it says about him.

2456
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:06,840
Fun fact.

2457
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:13,800
It just feels like a real half assed not half assed but like just a real bad attempt at

2458
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:17,360
making Disneyland like hey how do we advertise this guy.

2459
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,400
He's wearing a tuxedo.

2460
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:21,160
What a weird thing.

2461
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:26,480
It's hard to have dense mythologies when the characters are not in dozens of animated shorts.

2462
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:31,980
I admire anybody's attempts because like this assignment is passed down from some corporate

2463
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:34,640
mucky muck to like we need a Mickey Mouse.

2464
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:36,400
This time it was like Roy Hoffines.

2465
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:40,200
It was just like some old cowboy just trying to.

2466
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:42,880
Give me a pig and a lion and a skunk damn it.

2467
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,560
I don't want to go to California.

2468
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:47,040
The way to find Marvel and face up.

2469
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:50,920
There's not a lot of great archives up but there's a lot of video collages online with

2470
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:52,320
all these pictures.

2471
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:59,160
One of which ended with like a very charming like video of what was clearly like a gathering

2472
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:04,040
of people who used to do that show and they're just sitting around drinking beer and the

2473
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:08,920
music comes on and everyone cheers and the one guy can still do the full dance.

2474
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:13,800
And like people give a round of applause at the end and I felt like moved watching this

2475
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:18,280
like in the same way of people talking about their memories of where the park closed because

2476
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:24,080
it's so rare for like a whole theme park to not just close but be demolished unless there's

2477
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:30,480
a natural disaster or a massive financial quagmire like Hard Rock Park.

2478
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:35,560
This is a rare closure that's not for some that wasn't in the first year to make it like

2479
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:37,720
40 years and then be done.

2480
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:40,200
Strange were you sad when it happened?

2481
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:41,200
It was weird.

2482
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:46,040
It felt like oh that sucks but I'm also in California to make my dreams come true.

2483
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:47,040
Yes.

2484
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:52,400
You're not unlike us you're not primarily concerned about theme park happenings at places

2485
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:54,900
that you can't regularly go to.

2486
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:59,320
But now no now I'm just thinking about am I Astroworld?

2487
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:00,320
Is my dream now I'm just.

2488
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:03,160
You're gonna shut down.

2489
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:04,960
Well we'll all be in the ground one day.

2490
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:09,520
We'll all be parking lots for the Rodeo, the Houston Rodeo livestock show.

2491
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:10,520
Also.

2492
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:15,200
Yeah it was it was weird but it was also like oh yeah I hadn't been there since like I was

2493
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:16,200
17.

2494
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:17,200
Yeah.

2495
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:20,720
Yeah so hey you gotta grow up.

2496
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:24,920
Here's an image of Marvel without his head or like you can take the head off like the

2497
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:27,440
body is still moving and it looks like a trick.

2498
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:28,440
That's fun.

2499
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:33,720
What I think the problem was the biggest problem I think Astroworld had like in hindsight was

2500
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:38,020
it wasn't owned by the people for a while who owned the Astros.

2501
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:41,800
If they could have done like a double header thing like that would have been better like

2502
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:44,000
oh buy a couch get a ticket.

2503
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Yeah.

2504
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:49,400
Was there any correlation ever between the Astros besides this lion wearing this hat.

2505
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:51,200
I think originally it was.

2506
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:53,160
It was all at once.

2507
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:55,160
Hawfines created both.

2508
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:59,800
And everything was Astro related then and then it just kind of split it all split off.

2509
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:00,800
Sure.

2510
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:05,600
Because I think just looking at it they had Astroworld for like a year and they're like

2511
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:06,880
oh we don't know what we're doing.

2512
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:08,640
And then they sold it off.

2513
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,640
Right.

2514
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:10,640
Interesting.

2515
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:13,760
Real quick back to because I all I want to talk about is Marvel McFay.

2516
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,440
Well quick point maybe you guys had the same thought.

2517
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:19,960
Marvel McFay looks like he is related to Dreamfinder.

2518
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:20,960
Yeah.

2519
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:21,960
He looks very Dreamfinder like.

2520
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:22,960
And he predates Dreamfinder.

2521
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:27,120
He predates Dreamfinder and he looks like he's his cousin or he looks like he's his

2522
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:28,120
brother.

2523
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:29,120
We're done with you.

2524
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,120
Thanks.

2525
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:31,120
So that's a wrap on Nick.

2526
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:33,920
So I'm just I'm wondering if he was any sort of like if they saw that Marvel and they.

2527
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:37,360
Do you know who Dreamfinder is Nick?

2528
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:38,360
From Epcot.

2529
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:42,600
That's the thing I forget that we're talking to this audience of people as of course let's

2530
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:44,400
go straight into Dreamfinder.

2531
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:48,400
He's like a guy who flew around in a magic flying machine at Epcot Center.

2532
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:51,320
He's a different magical man from theme parks.

2533
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:55,520
It was a big like 70s 80s.

2534
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:58,480
He isn't quite as his hair is in his red but like he's this guy.

2535
01:50:58,480 --> 01:50:59,480
You've seen this guy before.

2536
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:00,480
Yeah that looks familiar.

2537
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:01,480
Yeah Figment.

2538
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:02,480
He was.

2539
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:03,480
I remember Fig.

2540
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:04,480
I had a Figment doll.

2541
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:05,480
Yeah.

2542
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:06,480
Oh you did.

2543
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:07,480
OK.

2544
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:08,480
Yeah.

2545
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:09,480
Here's what I think about Marvel McFay.

2546
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:10,480
Which is why would they ever make a Figment movie or TV show?

2547
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:11,480
I know.

2548
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:12,480
You know.

2549
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:13,480
I've been on a few volumes.

2550
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:14,480
I've gone on a floor with this podcast.

2551
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:15,480
That's why we're doing this.

2552
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:16,480
Yeah.

2553
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:20,360
Give us the rights please.

2554
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:21,360
Some podcast.

2555
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:28,400
Here's what I what I think about Marvel McFay is that I immediately like all this and sometimes

2556
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:32,640
I'm not charmed by some set of theme park characters I didn't grow up with but I think

2557
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:34,520
these guys are a step above.

2558
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:35,920
Great design.

2559
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:36,920
Incredible song.

2560
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:37,920
Wonderful song.

2561
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:39,640
That's like a that's like a Nilsson song.

2562
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:40,640
Yeah.

2563
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:41,640
That is so well done.

2564
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:42,920
I like that nice little 70s bounce.

2565
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:47,360
It reminded me of the song Girl that Davy Jones sings on the Brady Bunch.

2566
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:48,360
Excellent.

2567
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:53,040
So maybe my favorite theme park song that we've that we found in that I didn't know

2568
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:54,040
already.

2569
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:55,800
I've been singing it for two days now.

2570
01:51:55,800 --> 01:52:00,320
Like in my head.

2571
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:04,480
So I while I like this a lot I'm relieved that I didn't grow up in Houston because if

2572
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:08,360
I grew up in Houston and was aware of these characters I think I today would be the full

2573
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:14,560
time unpaid editor of the Marvel McFay GeoCities fansite.

2574
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:17,520
I think all I would do is archive this.

2575
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:25,640
I feel like I dodged a bullet by not being born not being six in like 1974 whenever Marvel

2576
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:26,640
was running around.

2577
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:27,640
Your hero Marvel McFay.

2578
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:31,800
Yeah I would have because like because and they feel so much like the rocket fire explosion

2579
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:34,640
or the the the Chuck E. Cheese characters.

2580
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:39,880
It would have been a awful alternate to another much worse multiverse.

2581
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:42,400
I would have been a much worse Rusty or Audrey.

2582
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:44,840
I'm too obsessed with Marvel McFay.

2583
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:47,880
Do you think Six Flags owns the Marvel McFay rights?

2584
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:49,480
Well that's what I was wondering.

2585
01:52:49,480 --> 01:52:52,040
How much could we get the Marvel McFay rights?

2586
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:54,040
Yeah can we buy Marvel McFay?

2587
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:55,040
Good question.

2588
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,880
It might be dirt cheap.

2589
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:57,880
It probably yeah.

2590
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:00,840
I'll put a couple hundred bucks to buy that.

2591
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:01,840
Yeah.

2592
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:04,840
If anybody has any info on the rights please DM us.

2593
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:05,840
Sure.

2594
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,800
We'll start licensing him for things.

2595
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:10,880
If I just blow my hair out I could probably be him.

2596
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:12,720
When are we going to find him?

2597
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:16,880
We should all play him at a different different different times like how Dream Fighter was

2598
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:18,000
played by different people.

2599
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Oh sure.

2600
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,480
No I'm I'm Pierre Lerret all the way.

2601
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:25,240
I'll pull myself out of the room.

2602
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:27,600
Samantha Skunk Lester Lyon.

2603
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:32,000
There's Chiquito Pig, there's Harpo Pig.

2604
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,080
I'm just realizing I had the list of names.

2605
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:35,360
I thought I didn't have a list.

2606
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:37,400
I have the because they're all in the image.

2607
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:41,840
Oh Nick we all wrote down the list of the Marvel McFay characters.

2608
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:44,280
Aren't you proud of us?

2609
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:48,600
Does it make sense that we instead of devoting time to like roller coasters we were all like

2610
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:52,000
let's find the names of the pig and let's find the names of the roller coaster.

2611
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,920
Yeah we got through the roller coaster stuff because you guys got scared how dangerous

2612
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:54,920
they were.

2613
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:55,920
Yeah yeah yeah.

2614
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:58,640
I might hurt my neck just hearing about it.

2615
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:02,480
But we wanted to be basically we didn't want to go on rides we just wanted to have friends

2616
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:04,040
animal friends.

2617
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:05,040
Enchanted animal friends.

2618
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:09,560
What so you guys know some water parks to like hang out on top of them?

2619
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:11,680
No we would never do that.

2620
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:16,400
If you have any information about how we three guys can get the rights to either write the

2621
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:23,560
figment movie or on a much smaller scale just own Marvel McFay and lease them to local pizzerias

2622
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:25,280
and massage parlors.

2623
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:30,480
The intellectual property of Marvel McFay is like buried the paperwork is buried in

2624
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:31,480
a file somewhere.

2625
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:32,480
Get a massage.

2626
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:33,480
Get a massage.

2627
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:34,480
Also if you ever got.

2628
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:39,800
Well massage envy is part of that national chain is part of a massive scandal right now

2629
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:42,000
so they'll need to clean up their image.

2630
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
We don't need to.

2631
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,000
If they don't shut down the entire.

2632
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,160
What better way than Marvel McFay.

2633
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:52,320
If we're making apologies if I ever if you ever felt a penny drop on you on a water slide

2634
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:55,960
my bad it was just for fun.

2635
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:57,680
But what's the fun in that.

2636
01:54:57,680 --> 01:54:59,520
What is the gimmick there.

2637
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:02,320
They're going and you drop it a penny on them while they're going down a water slide.

2638
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:03,320
You would do that.

2639
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:04,320
Yeah.

2640
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,320
So you're just annoying people.

2641
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:09,900
Yeah it's just playing you know you know funds.

2642
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:15,640
You don't have any recollection of dropping a penny it picking up so much speed that it's

2643
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:16,640
sliced the whole person in half.

2644
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:21,680
No no because we were on top of them like imagine like me straddling your head right

2645
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:22,680
now from the couch.

2646
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:26,080
I have to imagine it's going to happen if this podcast goes any longer.

2647
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:28,800
I feel like there are worse stories you're not even telling us.

2648
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:31,600
No that was it's those are Patreon exclusives.

2649
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:35,200
Yeah well when we get the Patreon there'll be a whole 45 minutes of you telling us just

2650
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:38,160
how you like dunked a kid in a toilet at Astro.

2651
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:39,840
I never did that.

2652
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:43,320
You and that racist baseball player from last year's series.

2653
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:45,360
Oh did you.

2654
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:49,480
Oh you that's you're asking for a lot of basketballs in the face.

2655
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:50,480
Too far Jason.

2656
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:54,320
No he's not going to talk the rest of the Monday's retiring from speaking.

2657
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:56,560
He'll be the first guest you didn't say goodbye.

2658
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:59,400
No Jason fucked up.

2659
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:01,240
What did he do what he did.

2660
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:02,240
No shit.

2661
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:03,240
The city needed to win.

2662
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:05,760
Look they didn't need to win after that hurricane.

2663
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:08,120
We're all we've all been thinking about it.

2664
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:10,120
It had to be said.

2665
01:56:10,120 --> 01:56:21,080
They apologize and went through sensitivity training.

2666
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:24,920
Just listen to the song.

2667
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:25,920
We've all come down.

2668
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:26,920
I saved a kid in a wave pool.

2669
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:27,920
They say.

2670
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:28,920
You saved a kid in a wave pool.

2671
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:29,920
Was that at one of these parks?

2672
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:30,920
Yeah this kid he just kept getting like do you guys have wave pools?

2673
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:31,920
Yeah.

2674
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:34,760
Yeah like the kid just couldn't get up and I just like and his mom was looking for him.

2675
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:35,760
What?

2676
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:36,760
Like he just was like the wave just.

2677
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:37,760
Pulled him up.

2678
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:38,760
Yeah let him grab him.

2679
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:39,760
Well that was nice.

2680
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:42,320
Well that kid should thank you on Twitter too.

2681
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:45,320
I probably dropped a penny on him later.

2682
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:49,440
Hey well Nick Mundy you survived podcast the ride.

2683
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:50,440
Thank you guys so much.

2684
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:53,360
It's not as scary as the rides I like.

2685
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:55,400
My neck feels fine.

2686
01:56:55,400 --> 01:57:01,080
If people want to thank you for saving their life or for creating this big time wasting

2687
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:03,600
podcast where can they find you?

2688
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:05,800
Well they can check out my big waste of time podcast.

2689
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:06,800
Oh yeah.

2690
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:10,160
If you want to tag your awesome show just check it out where podcasts are.

2691
01:57:10,160 --> 01:57:11,160
Uh huh.

2692
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:15,040
You know two of the three hosts of this show have been on your podcast.

2693
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:16,040
Yes.

2694
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:18,160
And one glaringly has not been.

2695
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:21,160
Now I don't think he's helped his kids today.

2696
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:22,160
That's fine.

2697
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:26,440
Isn't it funny that Scott and I were the heels at the start of this.

2698
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:28,000
The biggest heels in your eyes.

2699
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:33,640
And then at the end this guy did the biggest heel turn since the double turn the Steve

2700
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:37,080
Austin Bret Hart match at WrestleMania 13.

2701
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:38,520
Can you believe you didn't see it coming?

2702
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:39,800
Yep I'm still the baby fish.

2703
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:44,520
You know that's a lesson we learned from comedy that if you end a show on a strong note people

2704
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:46,920
forget any weak points from earlier in the show.

2705
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:49,280
What do you mean by that?

2706
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:50,280
Huh?

2707
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:51,280
We do an improv.

2708
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:56,600
If the show ends strong people forget like the time they were in the show.

2709
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:58,800
If your show has weak parts.

2710
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:00,280
That's a big if with us.

2711
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:01,280
Yeah no we were.

2712
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:02,280
No not strong.

2713
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:03,280
This is doing the opposite of that.

2714
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:09,440
You're just accentuating all the other bad parts right now with all your gibber jabber

2715
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:10,440
nerd.

2716
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:14,520
You're giving people a bad taste on their the way out and we maybe just need to demolish

2717
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:18,440
this episode right now and turn it into a parking lot for a rodeo.

2718
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:21,160
I think we should just keep listening to this wonderful song.

2719
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:22,160
Hi everybody.

2720
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:23,160
Play us out.

2721
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:28,160
Follow us at Podcast the Ride.

2722
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:33,680
And this is a 14 ending Astros game that we lost.

2723
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:35,200
Aren't you glad you spent it with us?

2724
01:58:35,200 --> 01:58:36,200
Yeah.

2725
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:37,200
An old Marvel McFay.

2726
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:38,200
Well now I am.
