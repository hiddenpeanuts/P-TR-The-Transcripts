1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Club 3

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Boy, we really gotta come together this month, us Club 3 voters.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We gotta come together and find a way to combat the aggressive male energy of Bugman, right?

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We gotta find a topic that makes sure that Club 3 doesn't have any of that over-the-top, that loud, masculine energy.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How do we do that? What should we pick? I don't know. How about restaurants?

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Restaurants would be the way to... Let's punish Bugman by voting for his favorite thing in the world.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What happened to our little podcast?

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We're all trying to figure it out. Where are we?

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't know. As is always important to say, no rules have ever changed. No scales have ever been pressed.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is democracy, and what is happening is... It is, yeah.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, it has been, to some extent, beyond our control, but that ends today.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Today is the day, and there's been a little bit of a shift in policy, and we have come to a decision about the future of Bugman in the Club 3 poll.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And we will reveal that at the end of the episode, so that'll be a little tease.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We're doing an executive order, I guess, and we'll see what the order says.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It has come to this. The whole thing is, it's been wanting to let democracy play itself out, and to not step in, and to just make a brash decision.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But duty calls, I guess.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Sometimes democracy doesn't work, quite frankly.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It doesn't work, and that's why you need a bold, powerful leader, three of them, frankly, to take initiative.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If there were descriptors for the three of us, I think people would say bold and powerful.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If you had to describe Mike, Scott, and Jason, the good boys, bold, I would say, boys found their presences to be extremely bold.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Sometimes too bold, honestly.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
They describe so many bold interactions in their lives.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh my God, bold at every turn is generally how I describe my interactions in life.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Bold with women, bold with strangers, bold with people they run into.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's who we are. What can I say?

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Sometimes they say, uh, and yeah, and nervous laugh to cover the boldness.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And I appreciate that they do that, just as kind of a way to relate to me, the non-bold common man.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Right, right, right.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm so bold that a lot of times cars have pulled over when I have been on the sidewalk.

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It went, hey, do you know how to get to this road?

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I guess I just have one of those faces.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Wait a minute.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Where like, hey.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I was curious where that was going.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I was like, is this going to be like a you mama so fat joke?

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Right.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But with I'm so bold.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm either walking along or I'm on the street and people are like, hey, do you know how to get back to the freeway?

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And it's like, yeah, just go three blocks over and two blocks up.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're saying that's bold.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But it's especially bold because he told him the wrong way to go.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's how bold this guy is.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You know what I thought it was going to be?

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I thought it almost felt like you were about to start rapping, like you were in a shuffle.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Like, I'm so bold, I'm here to say.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm so bold.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I like my tuna mac cold.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I think I was more like I am diminutive and non-threatening.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh, I see.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So they're like, hey, do you know where BJ's is?

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Do you know where BJ's is?

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Are people coming up to you on the side of the road and looking for BJ's?

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Usually it's just.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Not that kind of BJ.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No, no, not that.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Not the Scripps like restaurant or something.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The home of the Pizooki is what you're talking about.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Well, yeah, it holds something for us.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It doesn't necessarily hold that weight for everyone.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The home of the Pizooki?

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You're saying.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What's wrong with the people for whom it doesn't hold weight?

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What's wrong with them?

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm assuming they just haven't had one yet.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Were they at one that was too well done?

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's why they're asking you on the street.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Sir, you look like someone who might know the location of a dessert that will blow my mind.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That will change my life forever.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Would you be so bold as to point me in the direction of such a place?

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Talking about a solid restaurant that has never got me sick before a restaurant that has only ever got me sick.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh, interesting.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
OK, yeah.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, we'll talk about our history there because here's what we've been voted into.

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Thanks to Josh Reese Club 3 suggestion.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The semi recently mentioned restaurants Hooters must have some weird lore.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
There are some commenters who chimed in to talk about other things that are part of the weird lore that we can and should and will talk about.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
When did we talk about this?

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What episode did we talk about this?

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I think it was that we were figuring out what to put in the fake office final floor.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, by Frank Luntz's office.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah, it's the discussion that led us to Frank Luntz's Oval Office in his house.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And I threw out, well, what about all of the many great fake Oval Offices across this nation,

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
such as the one in the George W. Bush Presidential Library, which is a view out the window of the sign of a Twin Peaks,

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
which is one of the chains of restaurants that we will talk about now.

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I saw a comment say that that location has unfortunately closed so you can no longer look upon the best of America from the fake window of the best president of America.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But besides that, the chain is definitely on the grow.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Another one we'll talk about is not on the grow.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I watched an interview with the CEO of Twin Peaks.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Why did I do it?

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You wanted to see what a bold CEO and leader was like.

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I was searching for something.

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm like, OK, maybe this will be funny.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And I'm like, after hearing him talk about the core principles and the fact that the beer is 29 degrees cold, that's our innovation when it comes to Twin Peaks.

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And I was just like, oh, no, I just wasted 40 minutes of my life.

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Was it 40 minutes?

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I mean, I was doing some other things as well.

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So it wasn't like I was solely focused on this man in his interview.

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah.

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:01,000
First off, it's so often men behind the scenes of these places and they're always either very boring or very nasty.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Like, it's gross.

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There's so much gross stuff.

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But it's also if there is a flaw in this episode concept.

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And by the way, I think there's plenty here.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I found a lot of fun stuff.

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I think some of the issue could be you do go like, oh, it's good.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Well, these chains are so like crazy and lascivious and to make the good boys have to talk about.

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And then in reality, for the most part, they're kind of like boring restaurants.

109
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And the people who run them are definitely boring, especially in the year 2025.

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes. They're certainly just like, what are we doing here?

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And Twin Peaks seems like kind of the post 2010 refresh of the concept to sort of take it to a slightly more homogenized place.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Because while they have sexy, skimpy outfits on the girls, it is like not, I would say, at the forefront of what's up with the chain as opposed to Hooters,

113
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
which rose in the 80s and 90s where it was absolutely the forefront.

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That was the point of it.

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But now I think what's happened to Hooters is that it's gotten sort of homogenized as well, sort of chasing the homogenization of all chain restaurants,

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
which is I think led them sort of to nowhere, almost like to a loss of identity.

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That is my take.

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That is like something you would hear on one of the different restaurant YouTube channels I watched and the different restaurant podcasters that were very excited to talk to the various CEOs.

119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
While what you described sounds boring, this also sounds like the kind of thing you or any of us would do for entertainment all the time.

120
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Talk about sort of what has happened with like a different chain restaurant is what you're saying?

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yes. Yeah. That's true.

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Jason was just talking about he's excited to crack into his book about the rise and fall of Kmart.

123
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's true.

124
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I mean, this is very much in our wheelhouse.

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
My favorite relaxing YouTube channels to put on is called Company Man.

126
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And he tracks the rise and fall, like the rising fortunes and falling fortunes of different brands, restaurants, telecom brands, stores.

127
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Company Man did a Hooters, correct?

128
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
They did two.

129
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And is the verdict, would it be called a rise and fall?

130
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Are we not yet?

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah.

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Are we only at the kind of at the precipice of the fall?

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Oh, no.

134
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's to be determined.

135
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
They declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and I don't know that that's the one you come back from.

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Well, the thing is, though, I mean, yeah, it doesn't look good, but there are 400 locations worldwide.

137
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Now, if they all disappear, then that's something.

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And Chapter 11 is never.

139
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah, it doesn't sound good.

140
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And that's this year, correct?

141
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Jason, I'm going to speak your language here.

142
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Marvel was in Chapter 11 and they sold.

143
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, maybe it's one.

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It can be a restructuring.

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And perhaps then, like, Universal makes a Hooters land because they make a deal with Hooters.

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We might all be in line to see all the films of the Hooters cinematic universe.

147
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's possible, yes.

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Soon enough.

149
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So anything's possible.

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Well, supposedly, in the one video, they talk about the founders, which still ran like 20 Hooters locations.

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I think they branded the original Hooters.

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Well, you're talking about the Hooters Six.

153
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah, from Clearwater.

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The Hooters Six, I had to learn about as well.

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The Hooters Six, which sound like they did something bad.

156
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And I guess to some people they did.

157
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I guess if you think about it.

158
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
They started the restaurant Hooters.

159
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
They started a restaurant where a bunch of old guys are like, hey, honey, how are you?

160
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So, like, I guess you could say they were villains.

161
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But the Hooters Six is what they called themselves, I believe.

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes.

163
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Pre-crimes.

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
No crimes.

165
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
No crimes.

166
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, one key and one case.

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Actually, one was absolved of the crime, that's what all.

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
A lot of lawsuits in the history of Hooters.

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But, yeah, I don't know about these.

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
These guys all look like bad guys in the old arcade game Lethal Enforcers.

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh, Lethal Enforcers.

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Now I know what you mean.

173
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Because they were like human beings that posed.

174
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
They were human beings and they all had like big hair mullets who were like.

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's really funny.

176
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Sunglasses and stuff.

177
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That is what the Hooters Six reminded me of.

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The Hooters Six.

179
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The Hooters Six.

180
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Well, yeah, you learn about Hooters Six if you go to the restaurant.

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I went to the restaurant.

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We'll talk about that.

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But let me, I'll close out the Hooters Six, the people to whom we really owe the episode.

184
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The men, which you believe.

185
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The heroes, yeah.

186
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
To whom we owe the episode.

187
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes, they opened the first Hooters in Clearwater, Florida on April Fool's Day 1983 as an inside

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
joke because they were sure they would fail at the venture.

189
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Even going so far as placing tombstones bearing the names of the previous tenants who failed

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
in that location outside the entrance of their new establishment.

191
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Did you guys come across pictures of the first Hooters in Clearwater, Florida?

192
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I believe so.

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It is.

194
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yeah.

195
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's been refreshed over the years.

196
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Now it's kind of like a modern to code building.

197
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Right, right.

198
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
In the early photos, it looks like three steps onto the porch and you will be in the ground.

199
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Like that thing is just going to crack apart.

200
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It is a truly cursed looking spot.

201
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It looks like somebody like just assembled, like out of like a hurricane, like knocked

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
a bunch of patio furniture almost off or pieces of houses off and then somebody reassembled

203
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Hooters with all of that raw material.

204
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Or that it was accidentally reassembled by the hurricane itself.

205
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It took pieces from many different buildings and just threw them together into a new one.

206
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yeah, yeah.

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah, no, it looks like such garbage.

208
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
One of the guys said, I had every intention of being broke in six months, but somehow

209
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
they were profitable in four.

210
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
This came out of the gate so huge.

211
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So it worked out beyond their wildest dreams.

212
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Let's name the Hooters six.

213
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
All right.

214
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm willing to name one of the Hooters six.

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm coming forward.

216
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't care about the repercussions.

217
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't care.

218
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't care if Dennis Johnson, a brick mason by trade, buries me and then covers me up

219
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
with bricks.

220
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm willing to take that.

221
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I want Dennis named.

222
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I want to speak Jason's language real quick.

223
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The Hooters six is a lot like Spider-Man's foes, the Sinister six.

224
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh, yeah.

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Why don't we like, all right, this next guy, he's a liquor salesman.

226
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
He started selling a little more than that.

227
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
He started selling a bit of his skin.

228
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's Gil DeGion Antonio.

229
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
This guy is a retired service station owner.

230
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I know what kind of service he liked.

231
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Uncle Billy Ranieri.

232
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Is his name Uncle Billy?

233
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
He's Uncle Billy.

234
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
He's an Uncle Billy.

235
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
He's an Uncle Billy.

236
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Not Uncle Baby Billy, but Uncle Billy.

237
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Not Uncle Baby Billy, but Uncle Billy.

238
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He was called that because he was 30 years older than all the rest of the men.

239
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't know how the Hooters six met.

240
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't know.

241
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't want to know.

242
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah, I don't want to know.

243
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Ken Wimmer.

244
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
He was a partner in a painting business.

245
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Further questions?

246
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
No.

247
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
All right, that'll close out.

248
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Ken Wimmer.

249
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah.

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I looked into all these guys.

251
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I was like, oh, there's going to be something big.

252
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And they're like, no, a painter.

253
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
OK.

254
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
No, pretty much.

255
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But that's the thing.

256
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's important to say they are not criminals.

257
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
This is not, they just started a restaurant.

258
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
They just started a restaurant where ladies would get like catcalls.

259
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
OK.

260
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah.

261
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's all I'm saying.

262
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Well, they would basically encourage the catcalling.

263
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
With the corporate, with like the attitude of the plate.

265
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Waiting tables is like kind of a place where that happens to be, like it's a harrowing

266
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
job anyway.

267
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Sure.

268
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Well, yes.

269
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Of course, it was a different time when they weren't thinking of things like this, I assume.

270
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Sure.

271
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
They were just some fun loving painters and whatever the other thing was.

272
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Well, yeah, he was in a, Ken Wimmer was in a painting business with L.D. Stewart, a painting

273
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
contrast contractor.

274
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
He was a college football player alongside Dick Butkus.

275
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I know Dick Butkus.

276
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
His own name, kind of a sexual double entendre.

277
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
One of the greatest double entendres of all time, Dick Butkus.

278
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He's a real life.

279
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
His own name is a living Bart prank phone call.

280
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That's true.

281
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I mean, I can't think of, there's some people with great names and that is just still the

282
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
top, I feel like, Dick Butkus.

283
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Wow.

284
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Just the top name ever named?

285
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Well, in the genre of-

286
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I have no disagreements.

287
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
In the genre, I guess you're right.

288
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I was going to qualify it by saying it was like a prank call name, but I guess in all

289
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
names, it's the best name.

290
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I can't think of a name.

291
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
My name is one of the most boring names, quite frankly.

292
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah.

293
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Michael Carlson.

294
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't mean to just agree, but you've done yourself no service saying it right after

295
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Dick Butkus, the best name of all time.

296
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Michael Carlson.

297
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
My parents almost called me Miles, and I wish that was the case.

298
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I was almost Peterson.

299
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The first name?

300
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes, the first name.

301
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I guess the way with it.

302
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Peterson.

303
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Really?

304
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And then because I was a little wiener kid who took a briefcase to kindergarten, like

305
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
a brown briefcase-

306
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Oh, you should have been Peterson.

307
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
My parents always say they were glad that that didn't end up being the name because

308
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
they could picture me showing up to kindergarten.

309
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Hello, I'm Peterson T. Gardner.

310
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Oh, boy, that is so good.

311
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Encountering the worst six years of my life to follow.

312
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That is so good.

313
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
At least you got out of your system before high school.

314
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
That is so good, though.

315
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I can't get over how like what a perfect-

316
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No, after that, I was only admired as a bold, cool guy.

317
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Right.

318
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I meant the briefcase, but yeah.

319
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The briefcase, yeah, yeah.

320
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Maybe I'd bring it back, though, as a professional to show him.

321
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Sure.

322
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
That's about become my new podcast pseudonym, or when I start a business like the Hooters

323
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
6.

324
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Are you in SAG, Scott?

325
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I am in SAG.

326
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Oh, so you already chose your name?

327
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

328
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I mean, I could shift it.

329
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah, you could change it, yeah.

330
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I think.

331
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

332
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Or I could change my SAG name to Peterson.

333
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Or if you know ... Well, here's the ... I've completed this movie that I shot, and I'm

334
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
very proud of it, and I like it a lot.

335
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
If many horrible things happen, if some distributor buys it and says, like, fill it with fart

336
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
sounds and record scratches, and then you see it released under the name Peterson T. Gertner,

337
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
then you will know that it has been re-edited, not to my liking.

338
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Okay, well, we'll keep an eye out.

339
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Peterson will be the tell.

340
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Well, if it's bought by the current Hooters Corporation, Hooters presents.

341
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I don't know if I want to reveal the name yet, but-

342
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Oh, yeah.

343
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Does Hooters have a streaming service?

344
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I wouldn't be shocked.

345
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I wouldn't be shocked either.

346
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It seems like-

347
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
A lot of their other ventures have gone under.

348
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Hooters TV.

349
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
A lot of their other ventures have failed, so I doubt that would last.

350
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
There was a time, and that's the stuff that I'm the most excited to talk about, and the

351
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
stuff where I would reassure any listeners who have any trepidation at this point.

352
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
If there was any fear of, like, oh, no, no, in the restaurants episode, the guys are suddenly,

353
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
they're going to get so gross, this will be the point where they finally let out what

354
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
they've been hiding the whole time, as if we weren't just going to go, ooh, an airline,

355
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
ooh, a video game, ooh, Hootie the Owl.

356
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
An attempt to get into the past casual market.

357
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Ooh, a weird ghost kitchen brand.

358
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Hey, we're ourselves, no matter where your place is.

359
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The rise of chicken wing popularity across the country.

360
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Hank Hill?

361
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Huh?

362
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Was that Hank Hill?

363
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
There was a little Hank Hill in there.

364
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I know he lives in there.

365
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It was a very exciting time in the 90s.

366
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's just place after place, chain restaurants all added hot wings, you know?

367
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You're saying that when the hot wings craze swept America?

368
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
There was, like, Hooters, that was one of their things.

369
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
They tapped into, like, specializing in wings.

370
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
They were one of the first big franchises that had wings.

371
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Where wings was kind of the main.

372
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Right.

373
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The focus.

374
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
They didn't create wings, but they maybe popularized wings to some degree.

375
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This is some of what the Hooters 6 were after, was that they wanted an establishment that

376
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
was filled with the good old 50s and 60s rock and roll music they love that makes you feel

377
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
good.

378
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Can't object to that one.

379
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Can't object to that part of it.

380
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Can't object to the wings part.

381
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
They wanted, like, finger foods.

382
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
They wanted just, you know, stuff for dudes.

383
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And the fine people of Buffalo had just the thing ready for them.

384
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
They had an idea wild enough it might just take wing.

385
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I think that Hooters, I've been, like, Hooters maybe four times in my life.

386
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That's more than me.

387
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm only at two.

388
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I think that eating Hooters wings early before I'd ever really had wings put me off wings

389
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
for years.

390
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Because I think I had it when I was, like, 20 or 19 or maybe even a little earlier, but

391
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I was just like, oh, yeah, the food here is awful.

392
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I guess wings aren't so good.

393
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah, that had been, well, yeah, we should talk, and we could come back to the Hooters

394
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
6, but we should talk a little about our Hooters experience.

395
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So what was that?

396
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
When was that?

397
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Where was that?

398
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I was really trying to track, because I've told this story before, a creepy high school

399
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
teacher tried to get all the graduating seniors to go with him to Hooters.

400
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yes.

401
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And we knew that was weird.

402
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We knew we didn't want to do that.

403
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And you have to, I think that every time that this story comes up, you should reveal

404
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
another letter of his name.

405
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Just drop the first.

406
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
T.

407
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Okay.

408
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And that's not, we don't know first or last.

409
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
His first name is Tom.

410
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Oh, we got the whole name.

411
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Wow.

412
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Got the first name.

413
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Geez, I feel like there's a rubric.

414
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I suddenly, I just, you revealed the prize on the full board on Wheel of Fortune.

415
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Well, that's a lot you gave us, but will you give us first initial?

416
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Of the last name?

417
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah.

418
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yeah, E.

419
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Wow, Tommy.

420
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I mean, there's no way you can't figure the, if you really wanted to be like a Googler.

421
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
They called him Tommy the pervert.

422
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't think, I don't even, I don't even know if I had gone to Hooters at that point.

423
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It was, look, it was not, we were not going to places to feel comfortable.

424
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
We weren't going to feel comfortable around women at Hooters when we were 18.

425
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
We weren't comfortable around most of the women that didn't work at Hooters when we were 18.

426
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But I think at some point early in college, it might have been in college that we went there and the food was awful.

427
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And then maybe I went 10 years later in L.A. somewhere.

428
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I don't really have a good memory.

429
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Now, I will reveal now on Podcast the Ride.

430
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Oh, boy.

431
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That.

432
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You were Tommy the whole time.

433
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I know.

434
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
No, no.

435
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Fucking Tyler Durden situation.

436
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But you tried to pick a boring pseudonym to try to get away from being Tommy.

437
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I caught this.

438
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I didn't even realize I did this.

439
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I caught this a couple of weeks ago.

440
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
We were doing the American Gladiators episode and we were talking about our Orlando trip.

441
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And I was on I Drive wandering and I was like, I'm going to go eat somewhere funny.

442
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm just for the show, for content.

443
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And I started walking all the way down I Drive.

444
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And I at a certain point hit kind of a wall, not a real wall, but a wall of just like I've walked too far.

445
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And where did I end up at Hooters?

446
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Wow.

447
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And I ate at this Hooters restaurant.

448
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You just did it.

449
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I just did it.

450
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Was this before the vote had even occurred?

451
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
This is before the vote even occurred.

452
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You went to this hellish spot before.

453
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I don't even want to run a reveal to the listeners that I had gone.

454
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The listeners are going to hear that I went to Hooters.

455
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm thinking this is more about me than it is about.

456
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
This is the kind of thing that's in your brain, Michael.

457
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That's what I'm saying.

458
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
They'll know that I went to a restaurant that everyone in the world goes to.

459
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm explaining my neuroses.

460
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Haunted the cheat too because they've tried to go like we need to be more family friendly.

461
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
We need to be sexier.

462
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
We need to appeal to the guys with massive mental complexes about being in this room.

463
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Here's the situation though.

464
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Also part of it was there was absolutely nothing interesting happened.

465
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The food was not good.

466
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
No one was in there.

467
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I was polite to everyone.

468
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I ate a sandwich and I left.

469
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Part of it also was like not really a story there.

470
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I didn't realize there was a Bahama Breeze past a bunch of trees.

471
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Oh no.

472
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Of course.

473
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I would have much rather gone to the Bahama Breeze.

474
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The next time you see a bunch of trees know that behind it might be Bahama Breeze.

475
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Well that could be in part of what Jason's rap earlier.

476
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We could put that in the same thing.

477
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm so bold when I see trees I start thinking Bahama Breeze.

478
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Right. That's good.

479
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That's great.

480
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,000
My man when we have some downtime I'm going to download this app called Yelp and it's going to change your life.

481
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Now he was trying to explore without his phone.

482
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
He's trying to get off his phone.

483
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Trying to unhook from the device.

484
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Trying to just be in the world.

485
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Be on iDrive.

486
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Discover.

487
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Although I guarantee you were on your phone that entire time for 70 different reasons.

488
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Yeah.

489
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Well there were alerts happening for deals.

490
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Now I admit I have been to a Twin Peaks in Las Vegas.

491
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And I've been to a Tilted Kilt in San Diego.

492
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You're emboldened by this.

493
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You said those much louder than you said the Hooters.

494
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Well now I've said my piece and now I'm just explaining to you the situation.

495
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Twin Peaks I think.

496
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Can you hear the sound?

497
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Click click click click click click click.

498
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
That's everyone canceling their Club 3 memberships.

499
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I understand they are disappointed in me.

500
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I climbed the rock wall though.

501
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Have I said this on the show?

502
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
That I climbed the Twin Peaks rock wall in Las Vegas?

503
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I didn't know they had a rock wall in Las Vegas.

504
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
They have a rock wall in Las Vegas.

505
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I was dared by my friends.

506
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
We went in and I climbed and competed against.

507
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I was probably in my early 30s.

508
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I competed against I'm sure someone who was 21.

509
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Obviously she works at the restaurant.

510
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So she knows how to climb.

511
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
This is like American Gladiators.

512
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You went up against the pro.

513
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It was very much like American Gladiators.

514
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I could not climb for shit.

515
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I couldn't make it past five feet in the air.

516
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
There's a video somewhere.

517
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm desperately trying to find it.

518
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
There's a video of me looking like the biggest loser of all time.

519
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm wearing like kind of like a dress shirt too.

520
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I don't know why we were wearing a dress shirt.

521
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I don't know if we went to like a show.

522
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I guess we were doing like Normie Vegas.

523
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I am struggling.

524
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's the most loserish video you've ever seen in your life.

525
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Find it.

526
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I exist and I'm trying to find it.

527
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I think it's there somewhere.

528
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Maybe a friend of mine has it.

529
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Mike, rock wall climbing is incredibly difficult.

530
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
There's gyms just for it like that.

531
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I understand that.

532
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I had never done that before.

533
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
But at the very least I should have been able to get a couple more feet up.

534
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I literally look like I can't get off the ground.

535
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It is so humiliating.

536
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It makes me want to try a rock wall not to say I could beat you.

537
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I really don't know.

538
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I think the only time I did anything similar was in like a really cheapo arcade in the Indian Empire.

539
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Which might not reflect how actual rock walls are.

540
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
But you found it is like even though like you're helped by certain aspects it's still really difficult.

541
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It was still really difficult.

542
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But then my friend did it who doesn't have any rock wall experience and made it very far.

543
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So that is really what.

544
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Is that Strong Guy?

545
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Or is that?

546
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Or is that one of us weak guy?

547
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It certainly is one of us weak guy.

548
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
There's no doubt about that.

549
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
But one of us strong.

550
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I guess both my friends were stronger than me.

551
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
One of them was much stronger I think.

552
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
They're like arms and glutes and hip.

553
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
They might have just had a more developed muscle in the parts that are really flexed.

554
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
That's nice of you to say.

555
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
We know exactly what it is.

556
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Higher T than Mike.

557
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
There I said it. They have higher T than Mike.

558
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
That's what I'm trying to do.

559
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But it was maybe outside of being like a kid when you feel like you're humiliated.

560
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It was the closest I've had that in my adult years.

561
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
To just feeling like oh my god.

562
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I have just been destroyed here.

563
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Not that there was a whole group looking.

564
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But it's a big restaurant.

565
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It's above the Taco Bell Cantina.

566
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Is this in the area that I think I refer to it as the shit stack?

567
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It's every crazy chain.

568
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's one of the big intersections of Las Vegas Boulevard.

569
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So it straddles two floors of the shit stack.

570
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yes.

571
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I've done that.

572
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I don't know if I've said this before on the show.

573
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
My friend asked me to be his best man at the Tilted Kilt in San Diego.

574
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
We were walking.

575
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
This is no longer there in San Diego.

576
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You know Jason knows this certain friend got into a verbal fight with Jason.

577
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
While we were looking for food the whole time.

578
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
We were really hungry.

579
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
We were both really hungry.

580
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Overheated.

581
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And rammy.

582
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
But they didn't know each other very well and all of a sudden they started arguing.

583
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
A fight of people who didn't know each other.

584
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I was like oh no what's happening?

585
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
They were fine.

586
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It was fine.

587
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
We're good friends nowadays.

588
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
When we do Wisconsin Dells he's coming on finally.

589
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
My longest friend.

590
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Or one of my longest friends.

591
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
We'll do Wisconsin Dells and then he'll probably humiliate me in other ways.

592
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Saying other things.

593
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But we were walking and we were walking in the same zone.

594
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It was not the same year.

595
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But we were walking so long to find.

596
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Comic Con you know in the radius of the convention center.

597
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Everything is like 30 minute wait or something.

598
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
45 minute wait trying to eat.

599
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But when you get in the outskirts by the Tilted Kilt.

600
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It's a lot better.

601
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
That's where it is slash was.

602
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I think.

603
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Was.

604
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
We've eaten there together.

605
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Yes.

606
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Before with about 15, 20 other people.

607
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Oh we did.

608
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
There was a big group.

609
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
You're right so I ate there at least twice.

610
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So Tilted Kilt has not made me sick.

611
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Cooters has.

612
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Both times I've eaten there.

613
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Which coincidentally also with like 10 to 20 people.

614
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Okay oh giant groups.

615
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Giant groups.

616
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And so they were very nice.

617
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
That was fun.

618
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
No because I immediately got a stomach ache.

619
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I was eating like wings.

620
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And a side salad.

621
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
The one time I had just gotten over something.

622
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
So I'm drinking club soda.

623
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And I just felt awful.

624
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I will say.

625
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I mean I don't think it's a surprise.

626
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But I'm going into like these restaurants.

627
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I feel like then.

628
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm like well I'm going to be very on my bet.

629
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm going to be very nice to everybody.

630
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm not going to make anything weird.

631
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I do have a complex now.

632
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Not just because of climbing a rock wall.

633
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But I do have a complex where I'm just like.

634
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You are a normal man.

635
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You just say thank you very much.

636
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And you look straight ahead.

637
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You are eating your meal.

638
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Like I do have some of this in my head.

639
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I swear.

640
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Yeah I'm kind of right there with you.

641
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Gentlemen how are we doing today?

642
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I am doing quite well.

643
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I am doing polite and I am doing respectful.

644
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
How are you and how is your inner life?

645
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Too many questions.

646
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It's like the BBC clip.

647
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
We're just normal men.

648
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
We're just innocent men.

649
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm coming off normal.

650
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
When I'm in there.

651
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
The more you think about being normal.

652
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It's like when you are super high.

653
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And you think a lot about how I have to convince people.

654
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
That I am not super high.

655
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
That's how you level out to being extremely normal.

656
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I always picture that like.

657
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I'm going to be perceived.

658
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And you see an older man talking to a cashier.

659
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And it's clear he's talking a minute or two longer.

660
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Than that cashier is interested.

661
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I always have a paranoia in my head.

662
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I'm talking too long.

663
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I mean that's not just at Hooters.

664
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
That's in general where I'm like oh shit.

665
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Did I just talk two or three minutes longer than I should have?

666
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Well you know what I have seen you do it.

667
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It's like where have I seen it?

668
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
When you're on a podcast and you're talking about CVS.

669
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And apps and peels.

670
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Actually that's more like two hours too long.

671
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
That's a safe space though.

672
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I don't know if I'm coming from my droning on about something.

673
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
That's a different scenario.

674
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Yes but I'm the cashier you see.

675
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I guess that is true.

676
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You are the cashier in that scenario.

677
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
But it's content.

678
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Oh is that so?

679
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's a whole different story.

680
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So I've been to the Hooters.

681
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
There was one in Santa Monica.

682
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I don't know if it's still there.

683
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It is not.

684
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It is not.

685
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
So we had a senior week in college.

686
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
A bunch of us went to Syracuse.

687
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
About an hour from Ithaca.

688
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
The bigger city.

689
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And I think we were going to do this big mini golf.

690
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And it was closed.

691
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So we went to the Syracuse zoo.

692
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Very sad.

693
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Then we went.

694
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
What happened to that zoo?

695
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It was just small and not kept up well.

696
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Is it still there?

697
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I don't know.

698
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I will have to.

699
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
We're turned into wings at the Syracuse Hooters.

700
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I mean it was just weird to see outdoor pens.

701
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Because it's like.

702
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's always.

703
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
There's like two or three months of the year.

704
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It's not cold in central New York.

705
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And so we were at the Carousel Center.

706
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
At some point.

707
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
One of the top five biggest malls in America.

708
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And then we went to the Hooters.

709
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And then went to the minor league ballpark.

710
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So the Syracuse.

711
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Did you get sick?

712
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Is that the sick one?

713
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Yeah I did not feel well.

714
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I did not.

715
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You said it was trice and you were sick both times.

716
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Do you have any idea the culprit?

717
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Well I ordered wings both times.

718
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I think one time I just had a side salad.

719
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
That probably got me sick.

720
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Improperly washed produce.

721
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
How often do you think a year

722
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
you would get like stomach sick?

723
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Well I'm carrying Pepto Bismol

724
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
in my pocket right now.

725
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Not right now.

726
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Like five years ago.

727
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Ten years ago.

728
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Because so many of your stories do revolve around

729
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
getting sick to your stomach.

730
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It's usually just

731
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
poor combinations of overly rich food

732
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
and too much dairy.

733
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Like banana and no other food.

734
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
That's like an allergy or something.

735
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
That's different.

736
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
That's something with the enzyme.

737
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Just an enzyme.

738
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It could not be more common banana enzymes.

739
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I'd say like a few years ago.

740
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Maybe like six times a year.

741
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
When you tell the stories on here

742
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
it does feel like it's like 30 times a year.

743
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
No it's just

744
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
yeah you heard about it.

745
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
If there are six yeah.

746
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I don't know it'd be a tall order

747
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
for the listener to count them.

748
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
But I'm sure there have been 30 all told

749
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
over the years.

750
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
So maybe it just seems especially high.

751
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
But like Hooters was one where I'm like

752
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
eating the wing.

753
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And I got the bone and wing.

754
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Normally I'm a boneless man.

755
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
But I like just eating chicken nuggies

756
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
at restaurants.

757
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Of course you say nuggies.

758
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Of course you say nuggies.

759
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Or tendies.

760
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I don't say nuggies regularly.

761
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
But I would say it.

762
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm comfortable saying it.

763
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I've recently been discussing out loud how I'm annoyed

764
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
by the word tendies.

765
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I knew it was only a matter of time

766
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
before this would come up on the show.

767
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I don't love tendies and nuggies.

768
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I don't really love it.

769
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
In the next episode we record I'm a little

770
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
nuggie tendie boy.

771
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Fire up Scott.

772
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
If I do it I'm going to be, I'll say this,

773
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
in the future if I ever say tendies or nuggies

774
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I am being a little scamp.

775
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
So just know that.

776
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But that's not where my heart lies.

777
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
That's your devilish alter ego.

778
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Kind of like a bugman buzz buzz.

779
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Yes that is.

780
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm Mr. Nuggie.

781
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Well my voice but I'm just like

782
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
5% turned up.

783
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm Mr. Nuggie.

784
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Maybe just like a positive.

785
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I've found that a lot creepier than anything bugman's ever done.

786
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
What do you mean? I'm Mr. Nuggie.

787
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm Mike's alter ego.

788
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What are you talking about?

789
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm just sweet Mr. Nuggie.

790
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I'm going to kick open the door to Hooters and go

791
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Hey everyone Mr. Nuggie's here.

792
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You'll be the first arrested one in the last two years.

793
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Get him out.

794
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
This guy's bervert.

795
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
It isn't dissimilar you're right.

796
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It's a similar voice.

797
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I will say this. It fits Jason's whole

798
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
thing better than yours.

799
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Jason I'm like of course Nuggies.

800
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
You I'm like

801
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
send yourself to jail pervert.

802
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
He gets

803
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
to play in the sandbox too.

804
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I can't have all the fun.

805
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Come on in the sandy is finey.

806
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Jason's trying to help me out here.

807
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Nuggies isn't my vibe.

808
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
That is true.

809
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Thank god one of these words has to be

810
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
not someone's vibe in this room.

811
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
If I'm feeling like a little scamp

812
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
maybe I will.

813
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't know.

814
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Tendies are a wonderful treat.

815
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Am I a bigger scamp on the show than you are?

816
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I think I am.

817
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Do you think so?

818
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I think my T is high.

819
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I think I'm the biggest scamp.

820
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I think I have regular T.

821
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I think the T thing is mostly a bit.

822
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
But I think I am more of a scamp than you are on the show.

823
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You might be but my zero might be set

824
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
to scamp.

825
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Wait, what?

826
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
My baseline might be scamp.

827
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Like if you were looking at a plane flying level

828
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
the level would be scamp.

829
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
This is a different Club 3 poll I guess.

830
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Listeners, who's a bigger scamp?

831
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Is it me or Jason as far as the show is concerned?

832
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
This is hard for me

833
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
to declare.

834
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I just need further definition

835
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
of what scampishness entails.

836
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Well, probably you want no part of it.

837
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Fair enough.

838
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Well, I regard certain

839
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
possible guests on the show

840
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
as being something of a scamp.

841
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
But I guess a lot of people would

842
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
violently disagree with that definition.

843
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It's possible.

844
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
But to me, don't you think he has scampish qualities?

845
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Wouldn't you?

846
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Yes.

847
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I'm trying to think what other...

848
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Is there more like an impish?

849
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Is impish and scampish similar?

850
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I know that his pal Coca Peli

851
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
is a trickster god.

852
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
That's what I'm getting at.

853
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
But scamp...

854
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I think you would think scamp is a little rascal.

855
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And you would immediately think Jason.

856
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
But I sometimes feel like I'm actually

857
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
not all the time, but sometimes more of a scamp

858
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
than Jason is, at least in recent years.

859
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Is this something you thought about middle of the night you wake up?

860
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You know what? I think I'm a bigger scamp than Jason.

861
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And I don't think I get credit for it.

862
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Well, I do want credit. I do want glory for it.

863
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I haven't seen one comment say that Mike

864
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
is the biggest scamp of the show.

865
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It's just a thought I've had just right now actually.

866
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
In real time you're hearing it.

867
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
So I'm interested in what the listener thinks.

868
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Well, that's the decision that we've come to.

869
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
There will be no Club 3 poll

870
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
after all the divisiveness, and the poll will just be

871
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
who is the biggest scamp.

872
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Yeah, okay, sure.

873
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Top 10 scamps episode.

874
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Well, scamps in life, no.

875
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Top 3 scamps on Podcast the Right Hosts.

876
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
As far as...

877
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
That's what a topic would be good.

878
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So the food.

879
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Hooters has always been bad food.

880
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
The other two, unmemorable as far as

881
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
a meal is concerned.

882
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So my history...

883
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I mean, I think it bears mentioning in all of our history

884
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
there has been a Burbank location

885
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
for many years.

886
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I think in the whole time that we lived in or near Burbank,

887
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
but I don't think it sounds like none of us went.

888
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
This has been closed since 2019

889
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and it was replaced by nothing.

890
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's sitting there.

891
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And otherwise,

892
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I guess there's a lot of empty spots in that zone.

893
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
But that specifically has been

894
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
the most nothing.

895
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It's a weird spot in a parking garage.

896
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's right by the...

897
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It's a tad depressing, I would say.

898
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Next to a second parking garage.

899
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Surrounded by nothing but parking garages and the freeway.

900
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Close to the third

901
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
best AMC in a

902
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
five mile radius.

903
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I believe on Podcast the Right,

904
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
years ago...

905
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
By the way, in a four block radius.

906
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Five miles is way too big.

907
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I believe on Podcast the Right,

908
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I told the story of using the bathroom

909
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
in that Hooters.

910
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Feeling weird about using the bathroom in that Hooters.

911
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I think I told the story on this show

912
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
seven years ago.

913
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
That's the last time I was in there.

914
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And when you said it, did I encounter you

915
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
with cashier energy?

916
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Possibly.

917
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I think I was made fun of

918
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
for the way in which

919
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I told the story.

920
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
If it was seven years ago,

921
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
it's not a remarkable. I just remember being like,

922
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I need to use the bathroom.

923
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
When does that ever stop stories from being told before?

924
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That's true. It's Podcast the Right. I forgot where I was for a second.

925
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Unremarkable. Tell it again.

926
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I thought I was in a grocery store for a second.

927
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I'm trying to figure out your

928
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
decision making process there.

929
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Because there's a Barnes & Noble around the block.

930
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I don't think of Barnes & Noble as a place to pee.

931
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Really?

932
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I know what you're saying. It's probably fine.

933
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
The telling with that one is you've got to go all the way

934
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
into the kids section.

935
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Just use the bathroom and then leave?

936
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Yeah, but I think I used the bathroom.

937
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I think I was really stressed

938
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
about using the bathroom and not

939
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
paying for anything.

940
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
In general, you could just go to the mall.

941
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
There's so many places to pee.

942
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Well, the mall bathrooms aren't really

943
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
convenient in the Burbank Town Center.

944
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
What are you talking about?

945
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
They're centrally located.

946
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I've never had an issue peeing in the mall.

947
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You can't imagine how much I've peed in the Burbank Town Center.

948
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I know. It's a bit of a trek from there.

949
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm trying to remember if I came out of the

950
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I don't remember. I'll have to go back and look.

951
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
But now that I remember it, that is the last time I was in that Hooters

952
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
and it was not to eat.

953
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I felt like I was on some sort of

954
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I think I was made fun of because I was on a spy mission

955
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
to try to just get into the bathroom and get out.

956
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I think that's what it was.

957
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
That sounds right because you operate

958
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
in all these scenarios. People are looking at me.

959
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
People are thinking that I'm not bold.

960
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
People are thinking that I'm not a scamp.

961
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Everyone is thinking these thoughts

962
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
about me all the time.

963
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Yes, I do think that. I think everyone

964
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
when I was in the Hooters in Orlando, I was like

965
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
everybody is thinking, what is this guy doing here?

966
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Old guy in here.

967
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Why is he here?

968
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
This guy is the first of all

969
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
the first single guy I've ever seen in a Hooters.

970
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Second of all, the oldest guy I've ever seen.

971
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
This man, this old man

972
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
could not be more of a geezer.

973
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Sometimes it feels like that.

974
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
There was no one in there.

975
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Maybe that's really why I didn't want to bring it up.

976
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I was coming into this episode

977
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
thinking the audience's thought is

978
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
let's have them talk about

979
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
restaurants like this because

980
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
they'll be so uncomfortable with everything.

981
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Then I was coming in ready to go

982
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
jokes on you.

983
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It's not actually uncomfortable to go to these places.

984
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Cut to Mike with nothing but

985
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
very uncomfortable tales.

986
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Thank you for fulfilling your end of the bargain.

987
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I did. I'm being honest.

988
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
We went to the places.

989
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm guilty of going into most of these places.

990
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You are guilty.

991
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Audience decide his prison sentence.

992
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I still have a normie

993
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
heterosexual man chained somewhere

994
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
in the recesses of my mind.

995
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I'm still guilty of going into the places.

996
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
But it always comes with

997
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Send him to the same jail as the people

998
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
who run Spencer's Gifts.

999
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
That's where Mike belongs.

1000
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
He should rot.

1001
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
He walked into a Hooters, peed and left.

1002
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Prison!

1003
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I do want you to go to jail but it's because of

1004
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
using the word nuggies.

1005
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Yeah, yeah.

1006
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
This is the weird

1007
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
thing that my brain does.

1008
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I'm trying to illustrate what I do

1009
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
go through.

1010
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
What it is, it's a heterosexual man

1011
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
trying to go through a door.

1012
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Then you encounter the spirit of your mother

1013
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
and then relive

1014
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
30 years of awkward memories

1015
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
and then try to go through the same door.

1016
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
It's much tougher to go through the door.

1017
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
That's a good way to put it.

1018
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I will say the going to Hooters

1019
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
at iDrive was not

1020
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
based on any sort of

1021
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
heterosexual instinct.

1022
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It was literally like, I'm so tired.

1023
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I need to eat something for cheap.

1024
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I don't want to walk anymore on iDrive.

1025
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I'm just going to do it here and then leave.

1026
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Well, heterosexuals can be so tired, can they not?

1027
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I think they can, as far as I know.

1028
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I think we can all speak to that.

1029
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
All three of us have been tired

1030
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
heterosexuals.

1031
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
That's true.

1032
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It's like, all right, you're going to act.

1033
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Everything's fine. Everything's all right.

1034
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
You've heard my tales on this show many times.

1035
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
There's plenty of times when everything is fine.

1036
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
When I'm eating a big meal

1037
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
at Liberty Tree Tavern, everything's fine.

1038
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I don't know. I do work

1039
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
myself up in different ways.

1040
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I was on The Haunted Mansion several days

1041
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
ago and I was thinking about how in our

1042
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
live show, you said that you thought

1043
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
that the old man who's shaking

1044
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
because he's scared, is scared

1045
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
because he's looking at you.

1046
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
He's looking at you in the eye,

1047
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
which I thought was an encapsulation of your

1048
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
paranoia. This guy in a room

1049
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
of a thousand ghosts is scared

1050
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
of how you personally look.

1051
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And I was thinking about that right before I passed

1052
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
the guy, and then as I passed him,

1053
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I saw his eyes don't line up

1054
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
with any perspective that you could

1055
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
possibly hit on the ride.

1056
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Why do you think he's looking at you?

1057
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
That's funny. I've never

1058
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
noticed that he's not looking.

1059
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Maybe he's looking at you because you're taller.

1060
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Except with your eyes, specifically.

1061
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Yeah, that's a good point. I don't know.

1062
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
He's so intimate.

1063
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
He's so close. He's not as close

1064
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
as the dragon on

1065
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
the Harry Potter ride.

1066
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I'm intimate with the dragon.

1067
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
The intimacy on the Harry

1068
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Potter ride is a little bit

1069
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
uncomfortable.

1070
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Wait a minute.

1071
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
You were asking me how many stomach

1072
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
aches would I get in a year.

1073
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
But I'm realizing now, just from you mentioning

1074
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
the Scooters meal and the Liberty Tree

1075
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Tavern meal.

1076
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Do you eat meals where

1077
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
you're not uncomfortable?

1078
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Just in different ways.

1079
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
His discomfort is he has

1080
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
psychological aches.

1081
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
He has brainty

1082
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
aches. Absolutely, I do.

1083
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
When we were younger,

1084
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I did watch Mike

1085
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
eat a number of

1086
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
ham sandwiches or peanut butter

1087
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
sandwiches wrapped in a paper towel.

1088
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
At once? Or just over the years?

1089
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Over the years.

1090
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You didn't invite Jason.

1091
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
What are you up to? Want to watch me eat a bunch of ham sandwiches?

1092
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
You don't think that's what we would have done

1093
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
when we were younger? When you were young?

1094
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I like that too. When we were young.

1095
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
When we were young.

1096
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
2010? 2011?

1097
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
But in lieu of

1098
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
a plate timey.

1099
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Everyone's a mess

1100
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
for various reasons.

1101
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I'm trying to tell

1102
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
the listener what's in my head.

1103
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I'm trying to illustrate for them.

1104
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It's taken a lot of years and it's still not all out of there.

1105
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Oh no, it's not.

1106
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
In that case, the perfect

1107
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
episode was picked for letting stuff

1108
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
spill out.

1109
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Let me say some of my experience. Never made it to

1110
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
the Burbank location.

1111
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I just haven't been around them

1112
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
terribly much to the point where I found it

1113
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
unusual to see one when I was on a family trip

1114
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
in 2011 when I was young.

1115
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I put it all together

1116
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
because I was like

1117
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
isn't there one that had

1118
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
two giant wooden owls outside

1119
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
of it that were built in the 80s

1120
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
so they have that Disney

1121
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
wood quality. I remember thinking

1122
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
that's awesome. I did a street

1123
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
view and I think they're gone which is unfortunate.

1124
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
The big Dallas Hooters

1125
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
owls were, oh Hootie I should say.

1126
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
That's the name of the mascot.

1127
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
So they had two Hooties.

1128
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
What I remember about it is that that was

1129
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
where I parked. That's where our whole family

1130
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
parked in order to go take our tour

1131
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
of Dealey Plaza and the book

1132
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
depository.

1133
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
So

1134
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
that's a great, that's like

1135
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
which is also Dallas.

1136
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So you can't see

1137
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
you can no longer see the Hooters out of

1138
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
the Twin Peaks out of George W. Bush's window.

1139
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
You can pass by two

1140
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Hooties and go learn about the two shooters.

1141
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And all

1142
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
the stuff painted on the ground

1143
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
like this is where the car was.

1144
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
This is where agents ran to.

1145
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
X marks the spot.

1146
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
And then I don't know if you've

1147
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
ever been there but

1148
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
you can go up in the depository and that's a museum

1149
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
that you take a tour of and go see the window

1150
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
and go see the spot. But then you go hang

1151
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
around and then some guy will walk up to you like

1152
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
hey you want to know the real deal?

1153
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And we followed this guy

1154
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
around and he took us behind up the fence

1155
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
and up on the grassy knoll and said

1156
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
we're like does this cost money? And he said

1157
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
no hey it's only you know pay me what you think

1158
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
the information is worth at

1159
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
the end of it. And we

1160
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
did it and we followed him around for half an hour and I was kind of

1161
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
creeped out but my dad was leading the charge because he

1162
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
liked stuff like that. And then he finished and like

1163
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
okay and my dad said alright well I'm going to go.

1164
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And the guy was like

1165
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
what do you think that might have been worth?

1166
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Well he said I didn't have to pay you right? Okay

1167
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
bye. And then we were like dad

1168
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
what are you doing? He said what?

1169
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
That was what he said. I'm like Jesus

1170
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
we're with this weird guy talking about the

1171
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
second shooter on the grassy knoll for two hours

1172
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
and then you don't pay him anything?

1173
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I'm still mad at him about that. My breath

1174
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
kind of like made that noise. I feel like

1175
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
when you just finished that story. You follow

1176
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
a guy around with uneasy energy

1177
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
who said pay me what it feels

1178
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
worth and then you don't do it

1179
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
and then you do a walk of shame

1180
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I'm ashamed of my dad on the whole walk

1181
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
back past the two hoodies. Whoa.

1182
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Perhaps it's no coincidence this was the last

1183
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
family vacation I ever went on.

1184
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Whoa really?

1185
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I don't know if that had anything to do with it.

1186
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
That's fascinating.

1187
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Maybe I'm done with

1188
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
old mom and dad.

1189
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
The weirdest thing of all was Donald

1190
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Sutherland doing his JFK

1191
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
character.

1192
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
He was working a lot at the time.

1193
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I don't understand.

1194
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
He was method. He was in disguise.

1195
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Anyway so there's a random

1196
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Hooters memory.

1197
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Then I went to

1198
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I'm sure I talked about it on the show

1199
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
but when I went to this Orlando bachelor party

1200
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
a couple years ago we all went

1201
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
to the Lake Buena Vista Hooters

1202
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
which has stayed in my mind ever since

1203
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
because you pass by it going back and forth to Disney

1204
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
if you're at Universal and whatever. That's not on my drive.

1205
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
It's not on my drive. No it's like

1206
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
10 minutes away from Disney

1207
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Springs area and I

1208
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
said this on the show but I was with a lift driver who

1209
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
pointed out that like see that pond over there

1210
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
by the Hooters? Somebody drowned in there.

1211
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
So I will never

1212
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
not think about that. Did he say it with like

1213
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
glee? You said that right? Like it was a little bit like

1214
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
see that? I don't think he was

1215
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
happy about it but I think he thought it was interesting.

1216
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
He definitely thought it was interesting. He wasn't like

1217
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
thrilled. And you know what? He in general

1218
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
saved me when I had very little phone battery

1219
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
and took me a long way and I

1220
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
made a point of tipping him well

1221
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
just to say that I did not pick

1222
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
up my dad's jeans when

1223
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
you're with weird guys telling you about deaths.

1224
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
You owe

1225
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
the weird guys money.

1226
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
The tipping just reminds me real quick because I took

1227
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
a lift to I Drive

1228
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
which would eventually be my

1229
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Hooters meal and I didn't

1230
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
the lift driver spent the whole time telling me about how

1231
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
he's getting like ripped off by the app

1232
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
basically because it was some discounted

1233
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
whatever fare because I looked

1234
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
oh three dollars whatever blah blah

1235
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
and he spent the whole time and I was

1236
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
he's like trying to convince

1237
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
me by like showing me and he got out of the car

1238
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
to show me and give me a hug afterward.

1239
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And I was like

1240
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
because like all lift

1241
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
driver has to do and I'm not I'm not trying to pretend

1242
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I'm like a hero here. I'm just

1243
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
like he goes he's like I go yeah oh yeah

1244
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I'll give you a good tip like

1245
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
that sucks yeah that's crazy. Of course this app is

1246
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
ripping you off or whatever but he wanted to show me

1247
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I guess he wouldn't approve it and he's showing me and

1248
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
then he gives me a hug thanks so much man

1249
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
and I was like okay that's nice but also I don't

1250
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
need a stranger to hug me.

1251
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Wow. Really intense.

1252
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Really intense

1253
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
and I don't he wasn't even hugging me because I like

1254
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
he saw it I tipped him or whatever he was just like

1255
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
he wanted to get out of the car show me

1256
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
how bad he was getting ripped off but then he

1257
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
wanted to hug me. He just needed a hug I guess.

1258
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And we were in the I was in the car for seven minutes.

1259
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
It was enough time

1260
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
for a hug to be married. Yes it was

1261
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
enough I totally forgot that until this moment

1262
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
that I got a hug before I did

1263
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
my long wander down

1264
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
iDrive alone. Wow we

1265
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
well he must just he sensed

1266
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
that you were somebody extremely comfortable

1267
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
with personal interactions

1268
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
physical interactions. Yeah yeah yeah. This guy seems like

1269
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
a hugging guy. He got it

1270
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
he got it loud and clear. He thought to himself

1271
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
what I see here is a little

1272
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
huggy boy.

1273
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Well that actually is my

1274
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
lift name if you go into the app

1275
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
that I'm little huggy boy so. But you had to do

1276
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
it with a one and a four in there

1277
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
because. Yeah yeah somebody Jason took a little

1278
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
huggy boy the regular one. Yeah yeah yeah he

1279
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
got his license plate too.

1280
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Yeah. Anyway so

1281
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
that was one and I

1282
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
in Orlando I had a good time

1283
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
there and it was so boy

1284
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
the pandemic had not been over for it wasn't over

1285
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
then. The culture shock

1286
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
of being in the Lake Buena Vista

1287
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Hooters was like wow I can't

1288
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
believe this. So then but I felt

1289
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
like I maybe hadn't had also I

1290
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
it was just like we just ordered en masse

1291
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
tons of appetizers and I found it all to be

1292
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
pretty gross and not great.

1293
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Just like you know so

1294
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
breading heavy fried heavy

1295
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I don't think I dug the pickles I don't think

1296
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I even dug the way I was not into the food.

1297
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
It is a universally like hated

1298
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
food. Yeah. I don't know that anyone

1299
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
really I mean maybe

1300
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
one person. Well let me say

1301
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
where it went then. Yeah.

1302
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And I will say it with a little

1303
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
trepidation because

1304
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
here's what occurred.

1305
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Last week I would

1306
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
say I went

1307
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I looked up where is the nearest Hooters that remains

1308
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
to us here in Burbank.

1309
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
It turns out to

1310
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
be the Long Beach one near the

1311
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
kind of weird. Wow that's the closest

1312
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
one. That's the closest one.

1313
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
There was consideration given to Costa

1314
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Mesa which had more of the old

1315
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
school wood vibe which I'm going to say

1316
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I like I like the old what

1317
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
was the one in Orlando. Is it still the wood vibe?

1318
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
No it's a new like it looks like

1319
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
it looks like they wish they were chilies

1320
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
in there like a new chili. Yes that is

1321
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
the new that's the thing it is just

1322
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
like a it's yeah it's just that kind

1323
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
of like shiny. Yeah.

1324
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I like I just want to say I like the

1325
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
aesthetic of the old

1326
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
brown. The wood yeah. It feels very

1327
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Florida boathouse

1328
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
and I like the orange. I'm a fan

1329
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
of the orange. It's like definitely

1330
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
in your face and obnoxious

1331
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
but it's just not a color combo you see

1332
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
a lot and I'd rather be in the like heavily

1333
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
orange one than just kind

1334
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
of a like shiny wall looks

1335
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
like Applebee's looks like everywhere.

1336
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I get I mean I'm a big orange fan.

1337
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
My two favorite purple number one

1338
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
orange number two. I always as a kid I would

1339
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
say I want I would I would I wanted like

1340
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
purple carpeting and orange walls.

1341
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
That was not a request that was granted

1342
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
by my parents unfortunately

1343
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
and my wife probably

1344
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
would not like that either

1345
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
despite the fact that I wouldn't mind

1346
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
pitched it recently recently

1347
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
she doesn't want to live in the

1348
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
laughing set.

1349
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I mean when you put it

1350
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
that way maybe I could get away with it.

1351
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Would you mind if we knocked out the door and

1352
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
replaced it with just nine tiny

1353
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
splat shaped windows?

1354
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
You could open them whenever you

1355
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
want say a little pun and then shut it.

1356
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Then I'll go go dance.

1357
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So I do like orange.

1358
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Honestly I never really thought to

1359
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
analyze the logo in a way but

1360
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I do like the orange.

1361
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I like that there's an inherent

1362
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
80sness to it. I just like

1363
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
the logo which is also kind of gone.

1364
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
They've tried to rebrand. They've tried to get rid of

1365
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Hootie and I could feel a sense

1366
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
and I think more and more they're just

1367
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
if they're not doing well and if they're in Chapter 11 land

1368
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I think they're going to start re-embracing

1369
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
the old vibe.

1370
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I don't know. It's a really

1371
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
in the year 2025 I don't really know

1372
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
how

1373
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
there's no way Hooters starts now

1374
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
and is this big.

1375
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
It starts at a certain time and place

1376
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
and now it's like

1377
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
a shadow of its former self

1378
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
in probably good ways

1379
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
but I don't know

1380
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
they go like hey we're back to the 80s

1381
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
if that plays well in 2025.

1382
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I don't think in a huge way but I think

1383
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
they would probably more often than not

1384
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
find that people are fond of the old

1385
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
logo of the old Hootie.

1386
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Well people

1387
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I'm interested in the Pizza Hut situation

1388
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
because people I think

1389
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
especially in the last decade have

1390
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
shared their fondness for the

1391
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
old aesthetic of Pizza Hut. I mean Pizza Hut

1392
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
maybe of all the chain restaurants

1393
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
going to as a kid other than maybe

1394
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
like I'm trying to think maybe

1395
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
old McDonald's because of the Play Play

1396
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
stuff. Old Pizza Hut is just

1397
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
so warm and comfortable.

1398
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
The lamps, the glasses.

1399
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Everything about it.

1400
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
You see the lamps in other restaurants that are not

1401
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
pizza. That is how much people want.

1402
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Right. You can get a made

1403
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
custom on Etsy. People make you a lamp

1404
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
that says Pizza Hut.

1405
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Etsy or Aliexpress

1406
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
you can find them.

1407
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I have a set of the

1408
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
plastic cups.

1409
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Cups are good too.

1410
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Cups are good. They're like four or five bucks

1411
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
online. So there was this chatter

1412
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
of like we're going to bring some of this

1413
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
back to Pizza Hut and that's already a couple years old

1414
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
and I don't think that ever really came to fruition

1415
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
but you know we used to

1416
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
go to the Pizza Hut buffet in high school

1417
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
in the old school Pizza Hut on

1418
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Roselle Road and man

1419
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
it was

1420
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
certainly dirty in there by that point. I feel

1421
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
like when I was a kid and like the turtles coming out

1422
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
of a shells tour was going on when you would go and get

1423
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
the cassette tape and

1424
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
whatever the big book. That's what I got

1425
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
with the turtles on it.

1426
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
That was a nicer Pizza Hut.

1427
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I forget where it was. At a certain point they

1428
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
started decaying and then they changed Pizza Hut into

1429
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
mostly to go at this point.

1430
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I don't think they have the room to do a lot of big

1431
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
sit down. I think so many of them

1432
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
are just other places. There was some rumor they were going to

1433
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
reopen because there was one that still was open in

1434
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
LA maybe a decade ago or less

1435
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
and they were going to reopen. I heard there was chatter

1436
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
of it but I don't think it ever came back.

1437
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
But I do feel like, just to make my long

1438
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
winded point, I do feel like

1439
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
old aesthetics in restaurants

1440
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I think that

1441
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
people are finding that people have fondness

1442
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
for non

1443
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
boring looking stuff.

1444
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Yeah because everything just looks

1445
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
It's actually occurring to me that

1446
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
the Hooters that I ended up going to in Long Beach

1447
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
just is kind of like

1448
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
it's pretty bland and it's

1449
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
newly built. So there's like

1450
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
the custom based one from Yelp photos

1451
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
looked like dirty. I didn't really want to be there.

1452
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
At least this is like a nice

1453
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
you could feel the

1454
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
establishment being kind of new but then

1455
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
aesthetically it's kind of boring

1456
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and it's just like plain walls with

1457
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
splashes of orange and I'm like

1458
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
that's exactly what happened to god damn

1459
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Ralph Brennan's Jazz Kitchen.

1460
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
That's the same aesthetic. They turned it

1461
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
into a modern boring Hooters which

1462
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
is such a shame. It was so

1463
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
weird for something built in 2001

1464
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
which is kind of when a lot of the blandening happened.

1465
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
But that place had character

1466
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
and whatever this is just stinks.

1467
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
They gotta stop it. The Ralph Brennan's Jazz Kitchen

1468
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
redo to me doesn't

1469
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
even match the like

1470
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
mid century modern or whatever retro

1471
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
not retro future, retro look

1472
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
of the rest of downtown

1473
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Disney now. It almost looks much more

1474
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
boring than the like

1475
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
retro like whatever the new places are building.

1476
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
So I don't know why

1477
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
they went with that. No it looks like a Ross

1478
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
or something.

1479
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Non-aesthetic I associate

1480
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
with like

1481
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Cajun Creole food

1482
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
or even the upscale

1483
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
like New Orleans restaurants.

1484
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
There's no personality whatsoever anymore with it.

1485
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Let me show you what they do got

1486
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
here though is that it didn't even occur

1487
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
to me that what they have is big

1488
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
giant orange water glasses

1489
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
that are not dissimilar

1490
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
from the red pizza cups.

1491
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I found this like ooh

1492
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
this glass like it was worthy of a photo.

1493
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
It's also right next to

1494
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
a thing saying that it was

1495
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
BOGO. I have learned.

1496
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
BOGO Tuesday. It was

1497
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
a BOGO day and then

1498
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
a hazy IPA that I got that

1499
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
was very nice.

1500
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
So this is perhaps leading

1501
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
to me saying that I had a really good time

1502
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
at the Long Beach Shooters.

1503
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Maybe some of it was due to the company

1504
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
that I was with. Everyone

1505
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
take a deep breath. Hold something

1506
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
next to you. Hold the hand of a loved one

1507
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
when I tell you who I was at

1508
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
the Hooters with. Was it your priest?

1509
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
The new pope? The Chicago

1510
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
pope? Leo?

1511
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Yes it was Father Loftus

1512
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
who my mom said

1513
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
what would Monsignor Loftus think about the video

1514
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
that you just made? I decided

1515
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
can I make it up to you with a trip to Hooters?

1516
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Right. Well was it my

1517
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
teacher Tom from

1518
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
school? Only a weird guy like Tommy

1519
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
would join me for it. No.

1520
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I went to this establishment with

1521
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
a friend of the show Bugmane

1522
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Puss Puss. I'm so sorry everyone

1523
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
please don't burn

1524
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
your phone. Don't take a lighter

1525
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
to your phone because of what I have

1526
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
just said. We will get through this. We'll discuss

1527
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
it at the end.

1528
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
This was a delightful time.

1529
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Maybe something about being

1530
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
with now. Could you imagine?

1531
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Could you imagine that Bugmane

1532
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
is perhaps a little bit more comfortable with these

1533
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
places? It doesn't shock me

1534
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
to hear that. Would you be shocked

1535
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
to learn something that he told me while

1536
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
we were there which is that he

1537
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
over the years

1538
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
has dated not one but two

1539
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Hooters calendar girls?

1540
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
This is

1541
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
not shocking to me at all.

1542
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Was one of them

1543
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Lynn Austin the original

1544
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
calendar girl?

1545
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Not the original. I learned about Lynn Austin.

1546
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
That's who everybody would be after.

1547
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I have some Lynn Austin.

1548
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Great.

1549
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
He did make a point. I was like wow

1550
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
calendar girls even. He said

1551
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
white sock era.

1552
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
This is the thing.

1553
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
White socks are important.

1554
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
That was when the uniform was a certain way.

1555
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
That's what he's saying.

1556
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Then

1557
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
it's time

1558
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
for the actual meal.

1559
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
When our Hooters

1560
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
girl came up

1561
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
whatever she was wearing left no impression

1562
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
on me whatsoever. I don't know that

1563
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
it even was revealing.

1564
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I just don't remember it. It is just

1565
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
a total black hole.

1566
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
They have gone away from

1567
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
that vibe.

1568
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
They got in trouble a few years

1569
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
ago because they tried to

1570
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
make the shorts

1571
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
an even shorter

1572
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
kind of shorts.

1573
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Then people who worked there or had

1574
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
worked there were

1575
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
complaining.

1576
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
What year was that?

1577
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
It was sooner than you'd expect.

1578
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
It was the late 20s

1579
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
or maybe early 20s.

1580
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Was it when we were older or when we were young?

1581
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Where's the demarcation?

1582
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
There's a different line for each

1583
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
of us when that occurred.

1584
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It was just like a totally

1585
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
fine, it was a restaurant.

1586
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
It was not

1587
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
bizarre in the least.

1588
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
For the first time, maybe the first of any

1589
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
of our stories,

1590
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
we did a BOGO boneless

1591
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
wing situation. I loved

1592
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
every bite of it. I actually

1593
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
had a good food experience.

1594
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I was going to dance.

1595
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I think it felt like

1596
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
juicier,

1597
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
whiter meat.

1598
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I could feel the actual chicken in it.

1599
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
That's not even

1600
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
what I typically would eat.

1601
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
It was that and curly fries, great beer,

1602
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
frosty beer. I loved

1603
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
everything. This is a bigger shock than

1604
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
your dad not tipping that guy.

1605
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I was going to ask

1606
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
what you found to eat.

1607
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Maybe that's part of it, but in general,

1608
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
so rarely, if you ever

1609
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
hear an anecdote about people eating at Hooters,

1610
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
the food is awful.

1611
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I think it was the bug magic.

1612
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
The bug knew how to do it. He buzzed his way

1613
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
in there. I'll order for the table, he said.

1614
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Yeah, kind of.

1615
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
He always

1616
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
used to be with a server anywhere.

1617
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
What's good here? You go to them and

1618
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
she didn't steer us wrong with

1619
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
anything.

1620
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I love Buffalo Wild Wings.

1621
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I think those are always pretty

1622
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
consistent.

1623
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I am surprised that that

1624
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
tasted good. For the first time, fully positive

1625
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
experience, while it was not an old school vibe

1626
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
of this location, it was this nice, breezy

1627
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
zone.

1628
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
It's this row of

1629
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
full houses.

1630
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I just call them full houses.

1631
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I just like when a restaurant has its own.

1632
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It's not attached to anything else.

1633
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
It's its own little house. Next to it is a different

1634
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
little house.

1635
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
What a row.

1636
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
It's Hooters, Chili's, Outback, P.F. Chang's.

1637
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
All in a row, all along the water.

1638
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
And then we end that entire strip.

1639
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I looked it up because I was curious.

1640
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
In an alternate universe, all of those restaurants

1641
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
would just be a small portion of what

1642
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
could have been Port Disney.

1643
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I looked on the map of Long Beach.

1644
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
They have owned, if they had bought all of that stuff,

1645
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
and that would have been a small part of a massive

1646
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
hotel that was just part of that massive

1647
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
complex they were going to do there.

1648
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
That's right by the convention center in Long Beach?

1649
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Because the Queen Mary would have been

1650
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
one of the centerpiece of it.

1651
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I've seen a couple New Japan wrestling shows down there.

1652
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
If we do that, we always go to

1653
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
that Chili's.

1654
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Justin Donaldson and I are

1655
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
the biggest Chili's heads.

1656
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
We always go to that one over there.

1657
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
That's right.

1658
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
What's the quality?

1659
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Because it's new-ish.

1660
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Chili's is always good.

1661
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I don't know what it is. It's the way they reheat

1662
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
the food in the plastic bag.

1663
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I don't know what it is. Microwaving?

1664
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I'm aware that there is this recent improvement

1665
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
in Chili's, and the fact that I did have a good

1666
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Hooters experience made me think, oh, this must be

1667
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
what people are talking about with Chili's.

1668
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Because nobody's been saying this about Hooters, but I liked

1669
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
everything I had. Chili's must be...

1670
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I got to go Chili's and took it

1671
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
to my parents, and my mom

1672
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
was very skeptical of almost every place.

1673
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
My mom likes one place. It's Culver's

1674
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
in Schomburg, Illinois.

1675
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
You can't have Culver's here.

1676
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Oh, I hear about it every week.

1677
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
When are they going to open a Culver's?

1678
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Culver's City. They don't even have one Culver's.

1679
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I didn't know you had Culver's when we

1680
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
were in Schomburg. I've never had Culver's.

1681
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Oh, yeah. Culver's is good.

1682
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
You would love Culver's. No sit and don't stomach ache

1683
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
from Culver's. Well, no.

1684
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Go find a way. That's true. You're right.

1685
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Maybe the custard. Too much custard.

1686
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I had a concrete. I should have just had a cup.

1687
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
My tummy's in trouble. I had too much custard.

1688
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I had a butter burger.

1689
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
So, yeah, I...

1690
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
It's just what...

1691
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
All that to say, my mom was like,

1692
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
the corn on the cob is actually pretty good

1693
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
and the broccoli is pretty good too.

1694
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
My mom was even kind of impressed with

1695
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
75% of the food.

1696
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Chili's does a pretty good job

1697
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
for whatever. I don't know what it is.

1698
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I don't know what... I would be interested

1699
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
to know all the different philosophies,

1700
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
like, again, when I watch a 40-minute

1701
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
boring interview with

1702
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
the guy, the Twin Peaks guy,

1703
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
his whole thing was like,

1704
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
the big reason we're so successful

1705
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
is the food and the 29...

1706
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
the 29-degree beer

1707
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
you can get. And you can get an old

1708
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
fashion with cube ice in it.

1709
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
So I wonder if, like... This is all...

1710
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Everything you're saying sounds wonderful. No, I know that.

1711
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I'm just saying he's, like, touting, like,

1712
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
the big draw of Twin Peaks

1713
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
as the hamburger.

1714
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
And I just don't quite believe...

1715
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Probably not the hamburger, no.

1716
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I think it was good I stayed away from burgers

1717
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
at least suspicious of burgers.

1718
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
You just gotta not

1719
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
fuck around. You gotta do the thing that they're known for.

1720
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
And maybe there's something about the boneless

1721
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
as opposed to the...

1722
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I'm a boneless guy in general.

1723
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
For whatever reason. I think it's just easy.

1724
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I mean, it's all gonna be, like, a little bit weird

1725
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
because it's all reheated.

1726
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
So I'm just like, give me the nugget.

1727
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Give me the little nuggy.

1728
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Yeah, it's already been cooked.

1729
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
When it's in the bag.

1730
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
So it's getting cooked again.

1731
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Less of a chance to get it fucked up in the restaurant.

1732
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
So a bottled sauce

1733
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
tossed in a bowl like that.

1734
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
So I guess I would love to know

1735
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
the difference is really what I'm getting at.

1736
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I would love to know what the

1737
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
difference is with chilies versus

1738
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
like, sometimes you go to an Olive Garden.

1739
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Most Olive Garden

1740
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
experiences suck.

1741
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
So why? Why can't they get...

1742
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
No.

1743
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Jane really got me on Olive Garden.

1744
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Comment after comment.

1745
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
He's rubbing his hands together.

1746
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
He's rubbing his hands together like he's...

1747
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
And you know what? Olive Garden

1748
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
just started doing deliveries.

1749
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
So you can get a good chicken

1750
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
parm

1751
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
in the comfort of your own home.

1752
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Just started doing deliveries?

1753
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
They just started.

1754
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
No, no. They only did take out

1755
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
before.

1756
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Only recently. Yeah.

1757
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
But we've eaten in.

1758
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
We've eaten at home.

1759
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
You get Olive Garden to go at home

1760
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
and it's good?

1761
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I got chilies to go so I shouldn't laugh.

1762
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I like tutors boneless.

1763
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
So it's really...

1764
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
We're splitting hairs here I guess.

1765
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I've never had one bite

1766
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I liked at Olive Garden.

1767
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I've had okay stuff. I just have never

1768
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
loved Olive Garden.

1769
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I'm wondering why there's differences in

1770
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
chain restaurants. Shouldn't they all have the same model?

1771
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
If only a podcast would get down

1772
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
to the matter of figuring this out.

1773
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I don't want to talk about that though.

1774
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Yeah, you're right.

1775
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Much like us, the main topic

1776
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
is not typically...

1777
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
I think we're a lot more on point actually.

1778
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
It's possible as far as food and aesthetic.

1779
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Well when we talk about restaurants,

1780
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
weirdly we started doing restaurants

1781
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
so they veered away. That's a good point.

1782
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
But we all talk about

1783
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
uncomfortable sexuality.

1784
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
That's a hallmark of this.

1785
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
It seems like Hooters

1786
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
has opted to remove

1787
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
any tinge of that

1788
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
further of past casual

1789
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
and to go establishment hoots.

1790
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
You mean the sexuality is what you're saying.

1791
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
They've removed the sexuality. People wear

1792
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I think normal clothes.

1793
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Is there a uniform though at hoots?

1794
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I just saw a quick

1795
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
shot of it.

1796
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
It's just kind of regular.

1797
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
They eased off. They relaxed.

1798
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Now if you do want just wings

1799
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
without the rest of the Hooters fun,

1800
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
you could go to the Pasadena Hoots.

1801
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It just seems like a fine...

1802
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I don't know.

1803
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Or not fine. I'm not sure.

1804
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
So that's Hoots Wings by Hooters.

1805
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
But this is different

1806
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
than the Ghost Kitchen that they somehow

1807
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
established before the pandemic.

1808
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
In 2019, they were ahead

1809
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
of it. And Marnie Sher, who is a

1810
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
supporter of this show, wrote an article

1811
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
on The Takeout about all this stuff, that somehow

1812
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
they teamed with Uber Eats

1813
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
in 2019 and had

1814
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
a Hooties Burger Bar

1815
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
ready to go.

1816
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
So somehow they pre-anticipated.

1817
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Maybe Eiger found out and CEO of Hooters

1818
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
found out. They were the two

1819
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
who were told, something is coming, get ready for it.

1820
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
So they started a Hooties Burger Bar.

1821
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
But then Hooties Burger Bar is different

1822
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
than Hooties Bait and Tackle.

1823
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Which I had to stare at for a minute

1824
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
before realizing, okay, that must be the shrimp

1825
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
aspect. That must be the seafood.

1826
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
And then Hooties Chicken

1827
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Tenders. Not Hooties Chicken

1828
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Tendies. And all of this

1829
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
coalesces as part of...

1830
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Because they're all different, because that's very confusing.

1831
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
And then Marnie explained, no, this

1832
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
is all part of, collected

1833
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
under the umbrella of Hooters Digital

1834
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Food Court. But Hoots

1835
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Wings by Hooters is not part

1836
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
of Hooters Digital Food Court.

1837
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
That's different. Oh, that's okay.

1838
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Yeah. This...

1839
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I feel like... So if you want, and did none of those

1840
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
places offer wings? Chicken Tenders

1841
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
is not wings.

1842
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
It sounds like they're just throwing shit at the wall here.

1843
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I think they are. I think they're just trying to compete with

1844
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Wingstop?

1845
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
How many hours

1846
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
spent people in a boardroom trying to

1847
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
square this circle of

1848
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
what is Hooters in 2025?

1849
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Well, maybe it's just the owl and it's

1850
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
wings. Or maybe it's just the owl and it's burgers.

1851
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
And people are like, yeah, let's try that.

1852
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
And you're like...

1853
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Well, this is the impossible

1854
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
assignment that they have of trying to

1855
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
like... How do we

1856
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
pull Hooters away from what everyone thinks

1857
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
of when they think of Hooters? And this is

1858
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
an issue that was faced on the second

1859
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
ever episode of Undercover

1860
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Boss, which I rewatched last

1861
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
night. Which largely

1862
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
takes place in the Dallas

1863
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
double Hootie establishment.

1864
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
The second episode

1865
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
of this. So they're doing all this stuff that they stop

1866
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
doing on Undercover Boss.

1867
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
There's a Tilted Kilt on Undercover Boss as well.

1868
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Yes. I was trying to find it, but weirdly Paramount

1869
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
and Hulu don't have the entire series.

1870
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
So the only of the restaurants

1871
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I was able to find. There's a clip of it on Facebook.

1872
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
There's a clip of one. Anyway, you continue.

1873
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
But it was an

1874
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
unenjoyable watch.

1875
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Except for the part where there is a disgusting...

1876
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
There's an

1877
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
associate manager, somebody who makes the girls

1878
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
do unsettling things.

1879
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
His name is Jimbo. He is terrible.

1880
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
And there's that part in Undercover Boss

1881
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
sometimes where like, this thing is so bad

1882
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
that I gotta break cover. I have

1883
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
to say who I am

1884
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
so that this stops immediately.

1885
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And in this case he was like, I

1886
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
thought about doing it and did

1887
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
not. What I will do is bring him

1888
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
to the office and I'll say, stop doing

1889
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
that. And then the guy will say, I'd

1890
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
like to keep doing it. And he said, well I'll stop doing

1891
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
some of it. Go back to your staff and

1892
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
apologize and then make sure that you are not

1893
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
doing all of it anymore. And then the titles

1894
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
at the end said, he

1895
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
went back, apologized to his employees

1896
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
and then resigned for his own

1897
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
reasons. Oh man, that could be

1898
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
a hundred things. Yeah, yeah.

1899
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
No, Jimbo, this fella

1900
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
didn't look like he had a lot

1901
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
going on in his favor.

1902
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I think the Jimbo's thrived in the 90s.

1903
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I think that's for sure. This was definitely

1904
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
for a Jimbo to rise to that

1905
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
position. Yeah, yeah.

1906
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
No, not a good feeling from Jimbo.

1907
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
And ultimately not, I don't think this guy does not

1908
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
run the company anymore. He's

1909
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
the son, he was, he describes

1910
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
how he was just handed the company

1911
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
by his father unexpectedly.

1912
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
So can you come up to the boardroom please? Oh yeah, yeah, I've read this.

1913
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
You are the CEO now, goodbye.

1914
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Which not just the CEO, but he

1915
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
also inherited the title

1916
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
which I guess any

1917
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
future CEO has from now on,

1918
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
World Wild Wing Commander.

1919
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
And in the episode you see

1920
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
him park in his parking space and it says

1921
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
World Wild Wing Commander 2.

1922
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Number 2?

1923
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Yeah, yeah. Did the father die

1924
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
in a plane crash?

1925
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
No, the father,

1926
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
this is all strange.

1927
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
The father died the same year

1928
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
that they stopped owning

1929
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
planes. We'll put a pin in that

1930
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
and come back to it. 2006,

1931
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
airline ends and World

1932
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Wild Wing Commander dies.

1933
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
He had

1934
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
two sons, one took over the company,

1935
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
the other son died in a crash

1936
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
on one of their private planes, not

1937
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
their airline. It is very sad

1938
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
and very upsetting when you're watching it

1939
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
on the show. So,

1940
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
yes, like one dies in a company

1941
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
plane and the other takes over the company?

1942
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
What a Shakespearean

1943
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
tragedy.

1944
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
I guess also very dramatic

1945
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
that even on

1946
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
television the son is

1947
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
not able to say that

1948
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
his father was a nice man.

1949
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
He was

1950
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
a guy.

1951
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
This guy was, and he by the way

1952
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
is not one of the Hooters Six. Robert Brooks

1953
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
is the guy's name. He took it

1954
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
over and ran it like an actual business

1955
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
because those knuckleheads, they didn't know.

1956
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
The Six didn't know what they were doing.

1957
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
So the explosive growth of the company

1958
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
through 80s, 90s, 2000s was all

1959
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
due to World Wild Wing Commander

1960
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
here.

1961
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
We should also, we never finished

1962
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
The Sinister Six.

1963
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
The guy who played with

1964
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Dick Butkus, which distracted us

1965
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
understandably, he later

1966
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
was part of a million dollar tax evasion

1967
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
trial. Oh yeah, I saw that.

1968
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Which ended in a mistrial.

1969
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
So, we don't know.

1970
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Maybe it was a comedy

1971
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
of errors, you know?

1972
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Accidental tax evasion.

1973
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
We forgot to pay.

1974
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
No, you got the wrong guy, you see?

1975
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
That's L.D. Stewart

1976
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
and then Ed Drost, a real estate

1977
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
executive, went on to be one of the developers

1978
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
of Splitsville. We know Splitsville

1979
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
from our time in

1980
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Downtown Disney and Disney Springs. Both there, yeah.

1981
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Both locations. And that turns

1982
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
a corner on The Six. What else

1983
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
in terms of this stuff and the lore?

1984
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I mean, we could certainly

1985
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
talk about, I mean, I got a couple

1986
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
directions to go, but

1987
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
what are you thinking?

1988
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Well, I mean, did you ever go to the Hooters Casino

1989
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
in Vegas? It's been rebranded.

1990
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
That's a viable, let me shout

1991
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
out, who mentioned Hooters

1992
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Gilder on our

1993
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Patreon said, mentioned the Hooters Hotel in Vegas.

1994
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
That was across the street

1995
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
from the MGM Grand, not

1996
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Stripwise, but Tropicana.

1997
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
It is not Hooters

1998
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Today. That was what? That was from

1999
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
2007 to

2000
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
2019,

2001
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
and now it's called Oyo.

2002
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Yes, Oyo. But it still has a Hooters

2003
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
inside it. That was part of the contract

2004
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I read, that they retained the Hooters inside,

2005
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
but the whole branding would be different.

2006
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I believe I went in there in one, I don't know

2007
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
if it was the same Twin Peaks

2008
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Vegas, I think it was a different one, but

2009
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
it was depressing in there.

2010
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Yeah, one of those. It was not a

2011
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
hot spot. No, no.

2012
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Jason never spent any time in the place.

2013
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
We were, one time

2014
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
when we were at a bachelor party in

2015
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Vegas, Mike, someone in the

2016
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
group said,

2017
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
oh, I'm staying in Vegas

2018
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
another night. I got a room at the

2019
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Hooters Casino Hotel for

2020
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
like $25.

2021
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I do remember looking at websites

2022
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
around the time. I mean, it went,

2023
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
it was rebranded recently, but I remember it would be

2024
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
like, oh, do you want to stay for $30 a night

2025
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
at Hooters Casino? But this

2026
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
was before I was like, oh, for like

2027
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
another $20,

2028
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
you might, could have at least upgraded

2029
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
to the New York, New York, or

2030
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Excalibur, or MGM Grand,

2031
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
or something. The cheap prices.

2032
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
You gotta go the cheapest, yeah. There's a

2033
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
kind of better quality.

2034
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
So that, I mean, I don't know,

2035
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
that ran for a long time, and there's still

2036
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Hooters in there, but not a,

2037
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
not an unqualified success, you wouldn't say.

2038
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
No. Much like the airline.

2039
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Let's talk about Hooters Air.

2040
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Which was

2041
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
referenced in our initial pitches by

2042
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Christopher Vasca. Thank you, Christopher.

2043
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
So yeah, they had Hooters

2044
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Air. This is from 2003

2045
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
to 2006.

2046
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
That guy, worldwide

2047
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
flying commander. He bought

2048
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
something called Pace

2049
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Airlines, I believe, like a small,

2050
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
a small batch. A small

2051
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
commercial airline.

2052
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Which was seven planes. They went to 17

2053
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
destinations.

2054
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
They were centered in

2055
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

2056
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
And in a video that I watched

2057
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
about it, the current head of

2058
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
the

2059
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Board of Chamber of Commerce of

2060
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Myrtle Beach speaks as if

2061
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
the CEO and the airline

2062
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
are like,

2063
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
that's, that's, it's

2064
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
God, and these were his little clouds he flew

2065
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
on, because he said the amount of good it did

2066
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
for Myrtle Beach, who it brought to Myrtle

2067
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Beach, and then it went away, sure,

2068
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
but it like got so many

2069
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
families in the tradition of

2070
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
We Love Myrtle Beach, and the fun started

2071
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
on Hooters Air. He's like,

2072
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
he's so deferential to everything

2073
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
that Hooters Air did for Myrtle Beach.

2074
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Would you believe that Hooters Air had a good effect on

2075
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Myrtle Beach, South Carolina?

2076
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I would believe that, I guess, in some ways.

2077
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
You could fly to Orlando

2078
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
on Hooters Air.

2079
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Not the big airport, but the

2080
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Sanford, the smaller one.

2081
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
The,

2082
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
you maybe flashed

2083
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
to, oh, so the flight

2084
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
attendants must have been Hooters

2085
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
girls. That's what I would have assumed, yeah.

2086
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
And that's not exactly it, because they

2087
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
had, because like the amount of

2088
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
training that flight attendants

2089
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
require, they did still want regular

2090
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
experienced flight attendants.

2091
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
But they didn't make them

2092
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
wear the shorts. In this video, they

2093
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
said, oh, they pointed out like it's like blazers,

2094
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
that were like in a very classy way

2095
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
embroidered with a little hootie

2096
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
owl, and it said Hooters Air.

2097
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
It is,

2098
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
it's hard not being a server, but then like

2099
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
imagine you have to like help evacuate a plane

2100
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
and you're like in your Hooters outfit. I mean,

2101
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I'm surprised they didn't try to force them

2102
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
to do that, because that feels like

2103
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
that show where people point to the belts

2104
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
and everything, suddenly people are paying attention.

2105
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Right, but you're like in the middle,

2106
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
you've seen, I mean, we've all seen the videos of people

2107
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
like just screaming at flight attendants,

2108
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
and you're like, this is the worst job in the world, sometimes.

2109
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
But on top of it, you're like,

2110
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
well, is your, you know, is your

2111
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Hooters uniform on before you get to work?

2112
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Yeah, that would not particularly help the situation.

2113
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Well, they thought of this. It shocks me, though.

2114
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Isn't it amazing that that is not the way

2115
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
that they went? No, they actually didn't have

2116
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
the primary Hooters stuff,

2117
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
because they had free food, and it was just

2118
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
set price. It's always $129,

2119
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
no matter what, no matter how far you're going,

2120
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
just flat rate. And food is free.

2121
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
That's a nice gimmick, right? I think it was

2122
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
well regarded, honestly.

2123
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Was it better than Frontier or Spirit?

2124
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
The Spirit and Frontier have the bad

2125
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
reputations now as far as commercial airlines.

2126
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Well, they've had the times, I mean, I'm sure

2127
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
those airlines are worse now than these

2128
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
were, although this was sooner. Oh, I guess

2129
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
yeah, because everything's been so bad.

2130
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I don't know, I don't know. Maybe

2131
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Hooters was like, versus what it's like

2132
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
now flying Hooters, it's like you were in the

2133
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
60s of the prime flying time.

2134
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Yeah, this is a panhandle,

2135
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
happening, hopping. You were like having

2136
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
a cocktail with a pilot in the cabin.

2137
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Oh yeah, well I should say the Hooters

2138
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
girls did fly the plane. Oh, okay, good.

2139
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Yes, yeah, yeah. They weren't allowed to be

2140
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
flight attendants, but you want that, right?

2141
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
The union's strong. The flight

2142
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
attendants' union actually is stronger than the pilots.

2143
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Stronger than the pilots, yeah. They'll let

2144
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
whoever in there. Can you

2145
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
just yell we as often as possible?

2146
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Yeah, sure. Just flip the plane flight style

2147
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
on purpose and say we.

2148
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
If a commercial airliner would

2149
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
tout itself as like, we're the only

2150
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
airliner who will do a flip. Yeah.

2151
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
All right, everybody buckle up. We'll make sure

2152
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
it's safe for you. It's not going to be accidental

2153
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
and the pilot's not drunk and he's not going to go on a big

2154
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
trial with revelations about who

2155
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
he is. I think when I was little

2156
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
thought that that's what happened.

2157
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I thought when you were flying, obviously when you see

2158
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
cartoons, it goes up and down. I think

2159
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
when I was a kid and I didn't I didn't get on a plane until

2160
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
I was

2161
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
16, 17, 18. I was old.

2162
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I was old, yeah. So I really was only

2163
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
on one plane until. The same year

2164
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
you first went to Hooters. Basically

2165
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I went to Orlando. We took

2166
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
a plane to Orlando

2167
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
and then I guess

2168
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I was like 15 or 16 and

2169
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I think up until a couple

2170
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
years prior to that, I thought the planes

2171
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
might do a little loop-de-loop. You're

2172
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
in high school. It's possible I was

2173
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
a freshman in high school going, yeah you know you do your loop-de-loop

2174
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
on the way down when you land.

2175
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
It's possible. So you just

2176
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
took a trip to Columbus,

2177
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Ohio, did you? Well did you get nervous

2178
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
when the plane did the loop-de-loop?

2179
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
When they did the opening loop-de-loop?

2180
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Did it make you sick to your stomach?

2181
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I got on a plane when I was three years old.

2182
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
A lot of people did.

2183
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
That's a funny one. No plane.

2184
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
We always

2185
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
mostly just went to Orlando and

2186
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
we drove to Orlando up until this one.

2187
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
It's a long drive. You'd be exhausted

2188
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
when you get there.

2189
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I've questioned my parents to some degree.

2190
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Were you

2191
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
not doing well financially so much that

2192
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
you saved a couple hundred bucks?

2193
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
They needed Hooters Air.

2194
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Hooters Air existed when I was younger.

2195
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
It started right after.

2196
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
That would have changed

2197
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
everything. You and your

2198
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
mom happily flying on Hooters Air.

2199
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
All issues resolved for you across

2200
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
the board.

2201
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Yeah, no problem there.

2202
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
The first one I remember opening was

2203
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
in a big shopping area

2204
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
close to

2205
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
the Pennsylvania-Delaware border

2206
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
and the Company Man

2207
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
video, the one kind of alludes to this

2208
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
that it's like when you're

2209
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
a kid, you think

2210
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
we all thought something

2211
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
really lascivious was going

2212
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
on there. We all thought something

2213
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
really forbidden was going on.

2214
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Mike thought that until a month ago.

2215
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
He still thinks that.

2216
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
He thought it as he was opening

2217
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
the door on iDrive.

2218
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Can I ask this question? What was your perception

2219
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
when you were a kid of this place?

2220
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
When you were 8, 9, 10?

2221
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I don't know that I ran into it

2222
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
when I was a kid because they aren't near me.

2223
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I think they were maybe more near you.

2224
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Just a little story.

2225
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
My friend's dad went to

2226
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Hooters and for his birthday,

2227
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
all the waitresses

2228
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
took a picture with him.

2229
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
That's a thing.

2230
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I'm sure that happened in a lot of places.

2231
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
It was displayed in part

2232
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
of their house in a corner.

2233
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
It felt weird

2234
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
to me. It felt strange.

2235
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Aren't you upset that your dad

2236
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
cheated on your mom 12 times?

2237
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Right.

2238
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I was like, oh, Hooters is kind of a naughty

2239
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
place. That's probably

2240
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
the way I felt about it.

2241
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
And feel.

2242
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
No past

2243
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
tenths of it.

2244
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
That really was

2245
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
my impression that you either had to be

2246
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
a certain age to go there

2247
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
or you had to have an adult.

2248
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I think my friend went with his

2249
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
parents once and I was

2250
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
shocked that there wasn't an age limit.

2251
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Did you go up on your dad's shoulders and did you

2252
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
put a big trench coat on? How'd you get in?

2253
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I think I was. I think you're right. I think I had the

2254
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
same thought. When I was looking at photos of the

2255
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Costa Mesa one, one of the things that turned me off

2256
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
was seeing two kids

2257
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
with their shirts off in there.

2258
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
In a Yelp photo. I am sure that's not

2259
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
uncommon for a certain period of

2260
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
time. The shirts, the kids do what

2261
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
you want. The shirts, maybe

2262
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
keep the shirts on. Just for restaurant hygiene,

2263
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I would prefer. Just for general

2264
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
ickiness. Now if it's on a beach,

2265
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I saw pictures of a

2266
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Hooters on a boardwalk

2267
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
somewhere. I don't know if that was

2268
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Myrtle Beach or that was like

2269
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Wildwood. I'm telling you, the breezy nature of the Long Beach

2270
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
There's no way

2271
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
you wouldn't have a nice time at that.

2272
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Being in Long Beach is not. I like

2273
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Long Beach a lot. And I think a lot of

2274
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
As long as I'm eaten by that water,

2275
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I'm certainly going to... And when you got

2276
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
good company, when you got a good pal

2277
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
with you, who's talking about

2278
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
the entire time, we're talking about the kind

2279
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
of things we love on the show. Weird

2280
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
old hotels, dead malls, theme

2281
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
parks. This is all I'm trying to say.

2282
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
He's one of us, you see.

2283
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
A good pal. And he was like

2284
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
your Sherpa. Click, click, click, unsubscribe, unsubscribe.

2285
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Sherpa. Yes.

2286
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Hooters Sherpa. Yes. He helped

2287
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
me be 1% more

2288
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
comfortable in a place where there was no

2289
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
need to be uncomfortable. Yeah.

2290
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
The most normal

2291
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
restaurant. It is not, no.

2292
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
It certainly is different

2293
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
than it was when we were little.

2294
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
There's no doubt about it.

2295
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
It is so bland and nothing and I assume

2296
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
the incidents are way down

2297
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
as far as like... Can I play a couple of

2298
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
things that kind of allude to the vibe

2299
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
and how they were presenting themselves? When they

2300
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
had the money to do television

2301
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
commercials. Oh, right. Yes, please.

2302
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
There's channels exploding

2303
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
with these and there's a lot of delightful stuff

2304
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
because not only did they

2305
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
at some point they got like big budget

2306
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
TV nationwide commercials

2307
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
but before that when they were still more local

2308
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
and primarily in Florida, they would

2309
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
sponsor, they would do like

2310
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Goularty Elvira type

2311
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
were sponsoring this weird trashy movie

2312
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
on Florida TV.

2313
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
They called it Hooters Night Owl Theater.

2314
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
This was syndicated to

2315
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
13 markets and they would do little

2316
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
skits in between and I think the original

2317
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Hooters Girl was in the skits.

2318
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Lynn? Yes, Lynn was in there.

2319
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
So there's a lot of clips

2320
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
of that on YouTube but then this

2321
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
is shot like a film. This is, this had

2322
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
money. I want to find a question Mr.

2323
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Park Hill. Oh, let me say the context.

2324
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Sorry. The context is that there

2325
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
is a very tense

2326
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Senate hearing going on.

2327
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
One final question Mr. Park Hill.

2328
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Have you ever been to a Hooters restaurant?

2329
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Not to the best of my recollection.

2330
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Never had Hooters nearly world famous chicken wings?

2331
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Or the Big Hoot salad?

2332
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Spoiler audience, they are cutting to

2333
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
the would-be senator doing all of these things.

2334
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Not to the best of

2335
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
my recollection.

2336
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Mr. Park Hill, we simply cannot

2337
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
confirm anyone for this post who has never

2338
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
been to Hooters.

2339
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Dupont Circle. Yeah, come to Hooters on

2340
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Dupont Circle. Imagine

2341
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
the notion of a senator

2342
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
being so scandalous that a

2343
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
senator...

2344
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Well, certainly times have changed as far as

2345
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
what you can get away with

2346
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
as far as publicly as being a politician.

2347
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I found several

2348
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
two hour long clips of clearly

2349
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
you attending different high school dances

2350
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
at 45.

2351
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Alright, fine. Confirm, confirm,

2352
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
confirm. Most Democrats confirm as well.

2353
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Yeah, right.

2354
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
No problems here.

2355
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
But here's another. I guess they liked the juxtaposition

2356
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
of Hooters and politics.

2357
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
And speaking of doughboys, when this starts playing

2358
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
you're going to think Mitch is doing the voice.

2359
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Fellow Americans, recently

2360
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
it's been reported in the national media that I am

2361
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
preoccupied with Hooters.

2362
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I wish to state for the record that I have not

2363
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
been sneaking out in the middle of the night

2364
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
and going to Hooters. Reports that I have

2365
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
been seen eating a big plate of nearly world

2366
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
famous chicken wings are simply

2367
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
not true. It's just another

2368
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
attempt to discredit the policies of this

2369
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
administration. Thank you.

2370
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
That's so

2371
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
funny. I mean, it's so like...

2372
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Hooters is such 90's culture.

2373
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
It's so ingrained

2374
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
in the 90's. And I'm sure

2375
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
it was a lot, obviously

2376
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
it was a lot grosser at that

2377
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
time because we're in its early

2378
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
iterations.

2379
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
The world was like, we've talked about that with

2380
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Six Flags Live and stuff, the world

2381
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
was just different.

2382
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
I mean, things are still, there's plenty of it.

2383
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Hornier, but not in a

2384
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
progressive

2385
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
body positive. Yes. Everyone's still

2386
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
horny. I just feel like people

2387
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
hopefully, the more people are putting

2388
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
it in a better place.

2389
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
It's about where you round your horniness.

2390
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
What to do with your horniness. But it's so

2391
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
it does feel, you just feel

2392
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
the Bill Clinton of it all.

2393
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Obviously politicians are doing

2394
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
just weird stuff, bad stuff, or

2395
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
whatever. Sometimes worse.

2396
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Sometimes worse. We don't do anything about it.

2397
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Right, right. So

2398
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
let's talk about, maybe that's a good

2399
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
transition point too, and we could

2400
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
come back to Hooters. We can go back to Hooters and

2401
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
wherever we want.

2402
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
We should talk about some of these other places

2403
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
because we were given the, by the way,

2404
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
also in choosing this, I don't want to

2405
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
endorse the,

2406
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
there is, I think a lot of the ickiness anybody felt

2407
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
about this winning comes from the term

2408
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
restaurant. It is definitely weird.

2409
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
There was an article I found in GQ

2410
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
calling it the worst portmanteau in the

2411
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
English language. And I would have to

2412
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
agree with that.

2413
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
It was coined by one of the, a different

2414
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
guy, I believe.

2415
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
No, I have to find my tab. Not one of the six?

2416
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Not one of the six. It was later.

2417
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Let us know. But it is like an office

2418
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
guy. It was like a guy

2419
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
trying to come up with a name

2420
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
for a segment of

2421
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
a sit-down

2422
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
casual restaurant.

2423
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
With interesting

2424
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
clothing on the, but so the,

2425
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
you know, this, they try to expand,

2426
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
take this premise away from the 90s,

2427
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
maybe try to like, I don't know,

2428
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
what is the new version of this? And I think that's what

2429
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Twin Peaks attempts to do.

2430
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Now I have, I don't have,

2431
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I don't have a ton of thoughts about Twin Peaks.

2432
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
I think there's less lore in Twin

2433
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Peaks. I think it's like,

2434
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
first of all, the food seems better.

2435
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
The food, from what I can tell, I went to the Vegas

2436
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
one and just had a drink, I think, so I can't really

2437
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
speak to it. But it seems like it's

2438
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
more of like a yard

2439
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
house with 3%

2440
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
horniness. Is that a fair

2441
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
assessment? And plaid. I don't know

2442
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
percentage-wise. I don't know percentage-wise.

2443
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Wait, no, that one's not plaid. Plaid? Oh, wait,

2444
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
or is it Dorsey plaid? It's like

2445
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Pacific Northwest. Got it.

2446
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Similar to Tilted Kilt, but

2447
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
it's in this family. Well, look, I've just proven that I

2448
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
wasn't looking at a bunch of photos.

2449
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Aren't you proud of me? You proved it. You proved it. You proved you're

2450
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
not a pervert.

2451
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
The food was, my memory is just like, oh, this

2452
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
isn't as bad as Hooters. That's my memory of it.

2453
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
I don't remember having an amazing

2454
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
meal. Fine. I liked the,

2455
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
I liked it ambiance-wise, and sometimes

2456
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
if you look at photos, I did look at photos of the

2457
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
interior of the restaurants, and it

2458
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
seems like some of them do have some like, oh, this is kind of

2459
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
like a Pacific Northwest Lodge, kind of.

2460
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
It's like closer to our, it is closer

2461
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
to like you're eating in a themed environment.

2462
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Yes. Okay, so the guy, the CEO

2463
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
of Twin Peaks. Oh, he coined it.

2464
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Well, no, he didn't. I'm actually just

2465
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
bringing up, he says that

2466
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
the Twin Peaks girls are iconic,

2467
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
and they are brand ambassadors.

2468
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
He wants, he's making that, and there's some sort

2469
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
of pageant or something, so there's

2470
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Oh, Hooters, too. Yes.

2471
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Aaron and I, independently, years

2472
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
ago, have, we have definitely, because they used to air this,

2473
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
we have definitely watched full broadcasts

2474
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
of the Hooters pageant, where

2475
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
people go, and they, it's great, because there's more of them

2476
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
than, like, it's not just the 50

2477
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
states, it's people representing all of the restaurants,

2478
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
most of which are from Florida.

2479
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Forty-five of their 400 restaurants

2480
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
are in Florida. Oh, that,

2481
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
that doesn't shock me very much.

2482
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
From Daytona, too, I'm

2483
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Julie.

2484
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Does that still happen? I feel like they don't do

2485
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
that pageant anymore, do they? I'm not sure.

2486
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
But they, I don't know, there's a lot of, like, they do

2487
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
tout a lot of philanthropy,

2488
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
and things like that.

2489
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Like, there's scholarships. We're sending you to college

2490
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
is a big thing, I think. I think that was maybe

2491
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
some, I don't know when that stuff came to play,

2492
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
maybe that was to offset some of it. That must be some

2493
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
of the rebranding. Right, they're like, alright, here's the deal.

2494
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
They also, by the way, did a,

2495
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
and this is, you can read about this in the sign on the way

2496
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
to the bathroom, which is the,

2497
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
that they went into Bob Hope

2498
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
style, would do USO,

2499
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
kind of shows, during the Iraq

2500
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
War, a presentation

2501
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
that they called Let Freedom Wing.

2502
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
They also

2503
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
referred to, they also used the terminology

2504
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
weapons of mass distraction.

2505
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Okay, alright, that's

2506
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
what you're, I guess Iraq War?

2507
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
All the fun lingo.

2508
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Yeah, yeah.

2509
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
20 years ago, or 22 years ago.

2510
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
God, I, yeah,

2511
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
time-wise, I can't. George W.

2512
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Bush, this W stands for wings.

2513
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I'm surprised

2514
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
that, they should have done that in a commercial.

2515
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
I've never, I've been

2516
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
lying about what the W referred

2517
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
to. Right.

2518
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Time to come clean. I'm off

2519
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
the cocaine, but I'm still on

2520
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
the wings.

2521
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Was that Bush?

2522
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
George W. Bush, George W. Bush

2523
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
saying, I'm off the cocaine.

2524
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
That was Bush being like,

2525
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
you know, kind of bawdy, like

2526
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
those early 90s commercials.

2527
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
He remembered from when he owned the Rangers

2528
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
or whatever. Yeah, he was drinking

2529
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
a lot back in those, we've seen that video where he's like

2530
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
kind of wild and drinking

2531
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
at a wedding or something. I forget that was going around.

2532
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Mike, how do you feel

2533
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
that the new pope is from

2534
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Chicago, by the way?

2535
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Yeah, we brought him up earlier. How do I feel?

2536
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
And he's a White Sox fan. He was at

2537
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
the White Sox World

2538
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Series. People have a lot of questions

2539
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
online. None of these are Mike

2540
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
thoughts, but people like, you know,

2541
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
he's obviously had Lou Melnati's.

2542
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
He's been to Culver's. Somebody tweeted, this is the first

2543
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
pope that's probably been to Culver's.

2544
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
That's true. He went to Villanova,

2545
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
the suburbs of Philadelphia.

2546
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
He went to Villanova.

2547
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Does he like Wilco? That's a question

2548
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I've seen asked too. That's maybe the biggest one.

2549
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
That'll make you convert.

2550
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Who's his bozo?

2551
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Well, we could probably figure that out.

2552
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
We could probably figure that out. He's in the background

2553
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
of that Billy Corrigan performance.

2554
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Oh no, shocking photo has been revealed

2555
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
of Pope Leo hanging out

2556
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
at Hooters with Tom

2557
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
E.

2558
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Disgraced Mike

2559
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
teacher, Tom E.

2560
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
That's how he's billed now.

2561
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Has the holy C been

2562
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
to Hooters?

2563
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
You call him the holy C? The holy C?

2564
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Is that one of the terms?

2565
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
What does C stand for?

2566
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Oh, S-S.

2567
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I don't know. It's just a phrase.

2568
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I'm not religious enough to

2569
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
know.

2570
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Yeah, I'm still looking for the

2571
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
person who coined that term.

2572
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
That's important, but who cares?

2573
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Here's what I thought was the funniest

2574
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
from Twin Peaks nonsense

2575
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
is that there was a lawsuit

2576
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
between, because we're talking about kind of the three

2577
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
primary of this genre,

2578
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
but there were others and other upstarts

2579
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
and Twin Peaks

2580
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
sued another place

2581
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
called Northern Exposure

2582
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
that was going to be the same stuff

2583
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
where it was Mountain and Outdoorsy

2584
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
and the costumes were the same.

2585
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
They even claimed, I don't know

2586
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
how the suit settled, but

2587
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Twin Peaks claimed that this guy

2588
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
came to them and said, I want to open one in

2589
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Branson, and they said, okay, here

2590
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
is all of our secrets. Are you ready to open

2591
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
now? And he said, I'm going to open

2592
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
my own idea, I think.

2593
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
It will be Northern Exposure.

2594
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
It will be completely different. I will do it

2595
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
via my company, Grand Teton's

2596
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
LLC.

2597
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
And I think they

2598
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
stopped it from being open, but

2599
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
he also stole, because his tagline

2600
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
was great steaks, cold drinks, and free

2601
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
scenic views. And scenic

2602
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
views is in the standard Twin Peaks.

2603
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
These guys talk, just a couple

2604
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
interviews, some of these guys, especially in modern times,

2605
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
talk like they invented the iPhone

2606
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
when they're talking about these places, like

2607
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
with the phrases they've come up with and the philosophies.

2608
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
It's like,

2609
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
really, we've reimagined

2610
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
what a Hooters would be.

2611
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
So the hamburger's a little better.

2612
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
You just spend five minutes explaining.

2613
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
There's not that much to it.

2614
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
You really get a sense of the guys

2615
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
we like talking about.

2616
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Oh, that's something I forgot to say about that CEO, is that an undercover boss,

2617
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
so he determines, here's some of the problems, and here's some of the

2618
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
sexism, and there's people on the street telling me

2619
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
they don't want to go in there because they associate it with chauvinism.

2620
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
So then he goes back to the board, and he's like,

2621
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
we have to find a way to make sure that this brand,

2622
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
that we show that it's family-friendly, and that

2623
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
people can come here. Cut to no

2624
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
solution. Cut to episode

2625
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
ends. This is not addressed

2626
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
again. No idea was had.

2627
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
The end. Next week.

2628
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Tip and dots. Right.

2629
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
All that to say, too, that

2630
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I think we could

2631
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
open up a restaurant tomorrow,

2632
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
and it would be fine.

2633
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
We would have to hire people who knew how to do the

2634
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
restaurant stuff, but what we could do is the

2635
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
bullshit. Right, that's what I'm saying.

2636
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Because everyone's just doing

2637
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
invented the iPhone, like that

2638
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Steve Jobs kind of

2639
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
big talk,

2640
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
or the Disney

2641
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
story, what

2642
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
story are we telling here?

2643
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I'm saying the iPhone is an actual

2644
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
accomplishment.

2645
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I would have to agree. It is an accomplishment.

2646
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
More so than the family-friendly re-branding

2647
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
of Hooters, which seems largely unsuccessful.

2648
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Or the Twin Peaks guy talking about

2649
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
what he, because he worked at Hooters first.

2650
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
He was a franchiser of Hooters.

2651
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
And what I found was that their beer was 32

2652
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
degrees, and

2653
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
scientists said it couldn't be pushed to 29,

2654
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
and we found a way. Right,

2655
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
and you're like, this is an hour

2656
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
long, and all this guy has to say is that

2657
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
we made the food better, and

2658
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
there's women in different costumes.

2659
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Not like us, you let us

2660
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
talk for an hour, wait till you see

2661
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
all the twists and turns.

2662
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
We'll take it to some places, not like

2663
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
this loser.

2664
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
We could break down the philosophy.

2665
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
I was on Doughboys once, and then I decided to start

2666
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
my own podcast. What did I bring

2667
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
from that experience, and how did I change?

2668
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
What is the philosophy I have now?

2669
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I was at Doughboys, and I learned from them, and I appreciated

2670
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
it, but I thought, couldn't hosts be even

2671
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
wimpier? And that's what we reimagined.

2672
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Couldn't we?

2673
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
They're calling it the first

2674
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
master class they ever gave

2675
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
refunds on.

2676
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Couldn't we bore our audience

2677
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
more than them?

2678
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
That's an interesting innovation I brought there.

2679
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Longer winded, longer episodes

2680
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
more frequently. In fact, always.

2681
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
No segments.

2682
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Segments for three episodes, and then we bail,

2683
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
and just talk and talk and talk.

2684
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Our average tangent is five minutes long,

2685
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
and ours is 6.5 minutes long.

2686
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
That is an innovation we brought to this

2687
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
medium, and that's what's interesting about it.

2688
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
They've had

2689
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Bugmane on twice, and everyone moved on.

2690
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
What if we only talked

2691
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
about having Bugmane on for nine months?

2692
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
It would be worse than as if he was

2693
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
on every month.

2694
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
The specter of him was somehow

2695
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
worse than him saying a single word.

2696
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Let's do Tilted Kilt.

2697
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Let's get into Tilted Kilt a little bit.

2698
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Which I don't have much about.

2699
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
They are down to six locations.

2700
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
It really hasn't worked out for them.

2701
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
They started at the Rio in Vegas.

2702
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
I didn't know that.

2703
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
What is there?

2704
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
They're the same thing, but it's Scottish

2705
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
clothes.

2706
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
They seem the least defined and the least

2707
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
good or interesting.

2708
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I don't know.

2709
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
There was some wood in there

2710
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
though. There was some sort of brown

2711
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
aesthetic, like old

2712
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
time rec room.

2713
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I don't know.

2714
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Maybe it was fine. It just doesn't seem like

2715
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
fortune has been on the side of Tilted

2716
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Kilt. I know there was one in

2717
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Northridge, California, where I

2718
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
spent a little time near the

2719
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Northridge Fashion Center mall.

2720
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
In 2017, it burnt down.

2721
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Suspected of arson. Don't know if that

2722
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
was ever resolved.

2723
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
I remember going to the

2724
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Lazy Boy

2725
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
store next door, one of the best

2726
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
purchase decisions

2727
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
I've ever made.

2728
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
That was in 2019.

2729
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
That was pre-anticipated.

2730
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
If I'm going to have a baby, I'm going to need a Lazy Boy.

2731
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
I want that as an adult.

2732
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I did it. Then the pandemic hit.

2733
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I was like, there's a global pandemic

2734
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
and I have a Lazy Boy coming in three

2735
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
days. This morning, it ain't

2736
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
going to be so bad.

2737
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
I remember getting it in the shadow

2738
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
of a still charred

2739
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Tilted Kilt. I didn't know that was two

2740
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
years after the fact. I do remember

2741
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
just black wood. It was scary.

2742
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
That sounds scary.

2743
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Lazy Boy

2744
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
can you only get

2745
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
a recliner?

2746
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
You're talking about just getting

2747
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
a regular recliner. That is what I got.

2748
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
That's a good thing

2749
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
for kiddos. I don't know if you got one.

2750
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
We have a rocking chair

2751
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
in there.

2752
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
The rocking chair is great. The only danger

2753
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
was that first so many months when

2754
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
you're rocking that kid to sleep

2755
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
at 4 in the morning.

2756
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Boy is that hypnotic.

2757
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I would

2758
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
fall asleep

2759
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
and then wake up.

2760
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
But it freaked out because I had a little

2761
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
baby in my arms.

2762
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
That's the only danger there.

2763
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
It's good for them to fall asleep, but it's good for you to fall

2764
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
asleep, especially if you're tired.

2765
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
If you're holding a baby, yes.

2766
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Those are some of the most harrowing times.

2767
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Those first you know.

2768
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
You've done it twice.

2769
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I've blacked it all out.

2770
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
To some degree

2771
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
I have too.

2772
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
The only reason you'd go back for a second is if you don't

2773
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
remember any of the firsts.

2774
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
It wasn't so bad. Cut to it's so bad.

2775
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
And me now

2776
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
months later. It wasn't so bad.

2777
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
It's some biological thing there

2778
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
that really does kick in.

2779
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
It's what's needed for anyone to reproduce

2780
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
because why would you ever do it otherwise?

2781
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
It needs to kick in for us to live our

2782
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
lives. Yes.

2783
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
There has to be chemical surging in your brain

2784
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
so you don't think of all the shit.

2785
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Yes. Why would I have

2786
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
children when I could spend every afternoon

2787
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
at Hooters? I could be at Long Beach

2788
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
every day. That's right.

2789
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
That's all I got about Tilted Kilt.

2790
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Or anything else about

2791
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Peaks or Kilt?

2792
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
I mean nothing that

2793
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
interesting. Joe Hummel

2794
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
was the man I was listening to talk about.

2795
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
After all that time

2796
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
the boring man who said the boring things

2797
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
had a boring name. Hey don't sell Michael

2798
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Carlson short. Joe Hummel is

2799
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
extremely boring. And this was on the YouTube channel

2800
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Nations Restaurant News.

2801
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Also a boring name.

2802
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Every bit of this is boring.

2803
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
It's like a youngish man who was just

2804
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
so psyched to talk to Joe Hummel

2805
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
about the philosophy of

2806
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Twin Peaks. Freaking Joe Hummel.

2807
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
This was three months ago too this video.

2808
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Fresh Hummel. I for sure

2809
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
follow the Twitter account of

2810
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
convenience store

2811
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
solutions.

2812
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Which is just

2813
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
about new

2814
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
easy to prepare

2815
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
foods or new snacks or sodas

2816
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
coming.

2817
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Well anybody from that is welcome on

2818
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
this show. That doesn't sound boring in the least.

2819
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Do you have any recent things you're excited about?

2820
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I haven't checked in recently.

2821
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
I haven't seen many updates recently.

2822
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
We'll send each other new snack

2823
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
versions of

2824
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
something that's coming.

2825
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I believe the guy who drinks

2826
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
a lot of diet

2827
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
soda on Instagram

2828
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
alerted me that Dr. Pepper

2829
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
coconut cream is back.

2830
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Coconut cream. Interesting. I'm

2831
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
interested. I'm not a big coconut guy

2832
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
but I'll try it. It's real

2833
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
dicey in the sparkling water sector.

2834
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
So I'm refreshing. Oh yeah I have

2835
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
had a coconut. Yeah I don't like that

2836
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
necessarily. In terms

2837
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
of other ones there was a place called

2838
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
there still is a place called Show Me's

2839
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
which is in Missouri.

2840
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Oh yeah

2841
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
any others in this category?

2842
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Well so the guy

2843
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
you know how many tabs

2844
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I have open. I was ready to

2845
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
go with the guy who came

2846
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
up with the name and then

2847
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I went to the top ten knockoffs.

2848
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Let's start with the knockoffs first.

2849
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Oh it's Bikini's.

2850
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
That's the place that this guy who

2851
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
coined the term came up with.

2852
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Which also like apparently I mean

2853
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
apparently but like in the old

2854
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
days bikini bars is a big inspiration

2855
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
for Hooters. This is the

2856
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
early version. There's a way to corporatize that.

2857
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
They probably just existed independently.

2858
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
And slightly more

2859
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
cheap than just

2860
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
bikini bar. What do you mean?

2861
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Like Hooters. Oh because

2862
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
you're not wearing a bathing suit.

2863
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Perfectly classy. Perfectly dressy.

2864
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Does everybody know where the name

2865
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
is from?

2866
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Oh I missed that actually. The name

2867
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
is from a stand up comedy

2868
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
piece slash short film by

2869
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Steve Martin.

2870
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
There you go. Does Steve know he

2871
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
did this? Yeah I wonder.

2872
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Carry that around as a point of pride.

2873
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I don't think he would be so proud of that.

2874
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
When he's feeling down. When he's feeling unaccomplished.

2875
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Yeah.

2876
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Do you ever just wake up. Dude you

2877
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
named Hooters and got zero dollars

2878
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
for it. Yeah is it like a

2879
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
William Shatner thing with the

2880
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Michael Myers mask where like it's like

2881
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
I don't make any money off of that thing

2882
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
that's made so much money. Oh that's right.

2883
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Or does he not know about

2884
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
it? He has to know about it right?

2885
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Is he ever in his stone compound

2886
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
in Montecito dreaming

2887
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
of the further money he could have

2888
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
from Hooters? I kind of think he might be.

2889
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
He probably should be honestly.

2890
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
But you know he didn't

2891
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
make up his mind. Do you think Disney's mad

2892
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
because they had a character named Hooter?

2893
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
That was after the fact. That was after later so yeah.

2894
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
The next time we do an

2895
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
episode with Hooter as one of the

2896
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
bases it's going to be that Hooter. Yes.

2897
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Bombshells?

2898
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Did we talk about bombshells?

2899
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
No. Did we talk

2900
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
about Tallywhackers?

2901
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
That's the one I got. I don't believe we did.

2902
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Did you see Tallywhackers?

2903
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
I've heard the phrase.

2904
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Well sure you've heard the phrase.

2905
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
In reference to this kind of

2906
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
restaurant. Not in the long run.

2907
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Tallywhackers is a little bit different. You wouldn't call that a restaurant.

2908
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
No this is the

2909
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
this is the male version of it.

2910
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
It closed though but this was

2911
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
the attempt at a male version.

2912
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Coxtraunt.

2913
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
I think I read Chestraunt.

2914
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
That's alright. That's cleaner. But it should be like

2915
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Ab something too I feel like.

2916
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Testraunt.

2917
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Testicle run.

2918
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
All these things all have in common

2919
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
dangerous attire to

2920
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
carry heavy hot food with.

2921
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
That is very true.

2922
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
And cold food and cold beverages.

2923
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Ah my exposed skin.

2924
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
If you were working at Tallywhackers in college

2925
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
when you spilled all over

2926
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
you would have been in trouble.

2927
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Because you would have been shirtless and wearing little shorts.

2928
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
So when you were doing all that food service stuff

2929
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
and

2930
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
dropping tomato sauce

2931
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
and cutting yourself

2932
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
it would have been

2933
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
a nightmare.

2934
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
I wouldn't have been in a light blue work shirt.

2935
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
This was the outfit. Can you see?

2936
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
It's just little shorts.

2937
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Yeah.

2938
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
It's like the beefcake male version.

2939
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
And then

2940
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
something we haven't talked about is they'll call the areas

2941
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
like still today

2942
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
the appetizer zone on the Hooters menu

2943
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
is teasers.

2944
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
They try to be a little scandalous with the things.

2945
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
But it's a little harder

2946
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
I think they struggled a little bit

2947
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
with the male category

2948
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
to come up with these because

2949
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
in this case they called them appetizers.

2950
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Yeah.

2951
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I don't hate it.

2952
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Because I got abs on the brain.

2953
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
I guess like a rock hard ab

2954
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
should have been rock hard

2955
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
appetizers.

2956
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Scandalous. I don't know.

2957
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
This was definitely a little more

2958
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
aggressive.

2959
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
You're looking at more of a

2960
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Magic Mike live kind of

2961
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
line up I would say.

2962
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
There's less clothing being worn

2963
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
for sure than the Hooters girls.

2964
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Right.

2965
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
This place only

2966
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
lasted a couple years.

2967
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
They called them cocktails.

2968
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
They did that one.

2969
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
That one was already there for them.

2970
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
I'm on the Instagram of Tally Whackers

2971
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
which is still there. You can take a look at it.

2972
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
And then sometimes

2973
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
the guys look

2974
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
normal.

2975
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
And I say normal just in a regular physique.

2976
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
And then sometimes they look

2977
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
like they're bodybuilders or pro wrestlers.

2978
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Yeah. Some of those look like

2979
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
they look like bodybuilders from the 40s.

2980
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Like this guy.

2981
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
This guy is like a statue here.

2982
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
He's in good shape.

2983
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
This is a place where

2984
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
I would really have to work.

2985
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
If I'm thinking about working there is what I'm saying.

2986
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
I would really have to work.

2987
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Well it's closed so I can't.

2988
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
And I think I'm too old at this point.

2989
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Are those glass cups?

2990
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Or plastic cups in the bar?

2991
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
I don't think you can have that much

2992
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
exposed skin and have

2993
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
glass just willy nilly.

2994
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
That might have been the issue.

2995
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
It's dangerous.

2996
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
It's hard enough to get people to pour

2997
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
the blue curacao in the ice

2998
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
span of Bar Rescue.

2999
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Well they have. You know what? You can wear tank top.

3000
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
It looks like some of the dudes wore tank tops here.

3001
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
You could wear a tasteful tank top.

3002
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
So yes.

3003
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
What about Adam's

3004
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
appetizers?

3005
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Adam's appetizers.

3006
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
That's pretty good.

3007
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
This is for highlighting all the sexiest parts of the male body.

3008
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Is that for sure.

3009
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Give me that little chin pointy.

3010
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Handhelds. Big handhelds.

3011
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Handhelds. Jason. Good job.

3012
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Good job.

3013
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
You should be CEO.

3014
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
We have revolutionized

3015
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
the way. We have completely

3016
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
upended what you

3017
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
know when you think of Tallywackers.

3018
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
We bought the

3019
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Tallywackers IP.

3020
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Jason walking into a boardroom

3021
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
undercover boss style and he's in

3022
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
full nice shirt tie

3023
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
expensive jacket and then just

3024
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
little blue shorts.

3025
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Gentlemen you're looking

3026
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
at the new uniform.

3027
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
This is how a Tallywackers

3028
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
server will dress.

3029
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Lights up a cigarette.

3030
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
We're calling desserts a gentle

3031
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
kiss goodnight.

3032
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
I'm out of here. Work on it.

3033
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
That's why we pay him the big bucks.

3034
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Comes in he rocks our

3035
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
world. I was trying to think of like apataint

3036
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
sizers but that's to taint

3037
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
something. When you're going

3038
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
to ogle some sexy male bodies

3039
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
you're definitely thinking what if I get

3040
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
to see some taint tonight.

3041
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
The sexiest part of a naked man.

3042
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Well that should just be like taint messing around.

3043
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Classic dinners.

3044
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
There was a car wash happening

3045
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
here too. There's a kind of a cool

3046
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
like black and white. I like the style.

3047
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
It's like black and white but pink. You can see the pink

3048
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
car. Oh they color corrected just the pink

3049
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
up. Kind of a cool look.

3050
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
I would say overall it looks like it was

3051
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
some budget tallywackers.

3052
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Right in this expand. What happened?

3053
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Yeah I don't know. Are they

3054
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
trained car wash professionals

3055
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
though? Well you would go to

3056
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
tallywackers and you'd be like gentlemen

3057
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
did you pass a certification course

3058
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
to be cleaning my car? You've got to

3059
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
unscrew that antenna.

3060
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
You're going to knock it right off with

3061
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
your clomazinus. Gentlemen your groin is

3062
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
rubbing up against this rear view mirror.

3063
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
What are we doing here?

3064
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
That's not load bearing.

3065
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
If you aren't careful that antenna could snap

3066
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
right off and then bang it straightened your taint.

3067
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
A taint is not meant to clean

3068
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
a windshield sir. A sponge will do.

3069
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Shammy perhaps a taint

3070
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
no. Don't soap up your taint and

3071
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
rub it on my windshield.

3072
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I mean sparkling taint clean

3073
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
that's not a phrase in the proper

3074
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
car wash industry. You gentlemen seem

3075
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
more interested in lollygagging

3076
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
than polishing my

3077
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
other.

3078
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Sticking your tongue out does very little

3079
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
to clean the car. I would

3080
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
say it does nothing and no I don't

3081
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
want you to put it on the hood.

3082
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
That's filthy for you much less my

3083
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
car. Yes I do want you to jack

3084
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
up my car I need some new tires please.

3085
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Wait what are you using?

3086
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
You're jacking what up

3087
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
now? What is the meaning of

3088
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
this? That's not going to be strong enough

3089
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
I don't care how sizable.

3090
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Oh you took a pill eh?

3091
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
I guess it does work.

3092
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Well I am impressed gentlemen.

3093
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
I do have plenty of stains yes

3094
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
why some birds have recently left their

3095
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
leavings on the car and I would like if you

3096
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
whacked them off.

3097
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Go ahead I'll watch.

3098
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
I'll supervise.

3099
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
What? Put on my glasses to

3100
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
see better.

3101
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Wear my opera glasses

3102
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
and take a look.

3103
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
We'll see from far away I suppose.

3104
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
I can see the micro details of whatever this

3105
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
whacking off process was going to be.

3106
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Jason's Gail Gordon.

3107
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Gail Gordon going to Tally Whackers.

3108
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Normally I find

3109
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
the male body sinful

3110
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
and disgusting but these Adonises

3111
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
on display

3112
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
this popped up car wash

3113
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
are quite something

3114
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
else. Have we

3115
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
missed anything? Have we properly

3116
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
covered this area?

3117
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Or is there a strong desire

3118
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
for restaurants too?

3119
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Speak with your votes audience.

3120
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
I'm guessing there won't be but we'll see.

3121
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Maybe this thing will take off.

3122
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
I had a Philadelphia

3123
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
connection that I

3124
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
knew about when I was growing up.

3125
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
I knew

3126
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
there was something with

3127
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
one of the Philly's

3128
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
wives are like oh yeah we're

3129
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
okay they go to Hooters.

3130
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
But the Philly's

3131
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
spring training was in

3132
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Florida and currently in

3133
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Clearwater and the person

3134
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
who said that was

3135
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Lynn Austin the original

3136
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Hooters girl because she was

3137
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
married to 90s

3138
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Philly's like

3139
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
ace catcher Darren Dalton

3140
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
for a number of years.

3141
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Darren Dalton wow that's a great baseball player name.

3142
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
She was one of a word

3143
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
I've learned her out recently in an

3144
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
acronym the WAGS

3145
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
the wives and girlfriends.

3146
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
This is new?

3147
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
No I just wasn't familiar with

3148
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
I knew a lot of the families

3149
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
and the players.

3150
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
There were some reality shows

3151
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
but they do a lot of charity

3152
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
and community outreach nowadays.

3153
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Darren Dalton riding high

3154
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
on a what?

3155
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
His nickname was Dutch.

3156
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
He has it all

3157
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
he's married to the original Hooters girl

3158
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
is he still?

3159
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
No he's long dead.

3160
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Wow.

3161
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Yeah he played

3162
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
when they went to the World Series in the 90s

3163
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
played in like three all star games

3164
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
like Darren Dalton

3165
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
when I was a kid Darren Dalton

3166
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Lenny Dykstra and John

3167
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Croc were the big guys.

3168
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Lenny Dykstra is more your guy now.

3169
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Croc is the color

3170
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
commentator for the Philly's

3171
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
on NBC sports filled up.

3172
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
He's very fun.

3173
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
John Oliver did a segment about

3174
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
funny stuff

3175
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
because Croc just goes off

3176
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
on like

3177
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
not understanding

3178
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
his streaming services

3179
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
and like food stuff.

3180
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
I'm kind of a John Croc figure

3181
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
I guess.

3182
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Kind of an older man who doesn't understand

3183
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
what's going on.

3184
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Wow quote Jason about himself

3185
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
you're kind of a croc.

3186
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Yeah I'm croc like.

3187
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
You're saying you're the crocs of the show?

3188
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
John Croc is a wonderful ball play

3189
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
all star ball play.

3190
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Great commentator.

3191
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Alright well this episode

3192
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
then I guess dedicated to Darren Dalton

3193
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
which we will wind

3194
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
down I suppose.

3195
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
And it's been a long one so I'll try to be

3196
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
brief in handling this matter

3197
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
but as said at the top

3198
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
we have had decisions

3199
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
to make in the recent past

3200
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
and we need to discuss what is going to happen

3201
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
going forward in Club 3.

3202
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Okay so

3203
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
since September 2024

3204
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
the bug main battle

3205
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
has raged on.

3206
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
You know I think it started

3207
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
as you know

3208
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
a mild intrigue.

3209
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Some people don't like it and some people do want it

3210
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
and we'll see where it goes.

3211
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
And this has turned into a full on civil war

3212
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
that threatens to tear apart

3213
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
the very fabric of our

3214
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
what happened to our little podcast.

3215
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
I don't know.

3216
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
You know what we have now

3217
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
as if an exterminator is

3218
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
assessing it like you know what you got there.

3219
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
You got yourself a case of discourse.

3220
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
You got discourse all under the floorboards

3221
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
here. You're going to have to rip all that out.

3222
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
See I thought you were going to say

3223
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
a bug main infestation.

3224
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Like playing off a bug.

3225
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
We haven't had a bug main infestation.

3226
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
What we've had is a lot of

3227
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
people being upset about the threat

3228
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
of him even the notion of people I'm sure

3229
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
upset that he was even discussed in this

3230
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
episode. Am I not allowed to invite

3231
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
my friend to a fine establishment

3232
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
in Long Beach California?

3233
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
I'm not sure. There's no laws on the books

3234
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
in Long Beach as far as I know.

3235
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Of any kind? Yeah no it's

3236
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
lawless.

3237
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
It's martial law.

3238
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
That's why he likes it there.

3239
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Anyway if you were listening

3240
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
and you were not deeply invested in this

3241
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
or not like deep in the comments or you might need

3242
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
this explained to you a little bit. Basically we have

3243
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
always had this policy. Always!

3244
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
This has never changed!

3245
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
The policy has always been

3246
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
that the runner up in the

3247
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
prior month's poll competes in the next one.

3248
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
It rolls over and it gets another chance

3249
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
to gain a little bit of traction

3250
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
and then become the winner the next month.

3251
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
This situation

3252
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
has backfired because

3253
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
bug main has been locked in second position

3254
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
for many many months since September.

3255
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
It has kept rolling over because

3256
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
we have never had any sort of rule of policy

3257
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
in place. What would happen if this

3258
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
just went into infinity?

3259
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
I thought that maybe this would end up

3260
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
working itself out.

3261
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
We've recently discussed if it happens

3262
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
X amount of months in a row.

3263
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
You said a year. A year.

3264
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
If it happens for a year.

3265
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Well yes as of recently

3266
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
it is starting to feel perhaps

3267
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
a little bit long and perhaps the

3268
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
recent discourse around this

3269
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
matter has grown too tiresome

3270
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
to handle for even

3271
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
one additional month.

3272
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Decisions must be made

3273
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
and a decision has been made

3274
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
in order for things to flow

3275
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
because the situation of

3276
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
the buggers all rush

3277
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
to get him into second place and do so

3278
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
successfully and then the never buggers

3279
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
wait for something to kind of

3280
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
get a little bit of traction and then they all vote

3281
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
for that sometimes whether

3282
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
or not they want it.

3283
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
I think it has become kind of

3284
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
a strange situation and while we'd like

3285
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
democracy to just play itself out

3286
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
again strong leaders need to come in and take

3287
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
decisiveness. Well there's a bill of rights

3288
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
there's amendments you know that's what

3289
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
the system is built for.

3290
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
The electoral college

3291
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Mike's favorite.

3292
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Yeah.

3293
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
We love to

3294
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
gerrymander.

3295
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Alright so we are facing some

3296
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
founding father challenges.

3297
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Here is the decision that has

3298
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
been reached. Bug main

3299
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
does whatever he wants will hereby

3300
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
be retired from the club

3301
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
three poll.

3302
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
For the June episode poll for

3303
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
next month we will start fresh

3304
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
with five entirely new

3305
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
topics. Please leave your suggestions

3306
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
as always in the Patreon comments.

3307
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Nothing will carry over.

3308
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
It will be a clean start. Five

3309
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
entirely new topics. The winner

3310
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
of that poll the episode will be released on

3311
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
a Wednesday TBD in June.

3312
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
On that same

3313
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Wednesday in June

3314
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
that very day a second

3315
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
bonus episode

3316
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
will be released.

3317
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
That bonus episode will be

3318
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Bug main does

3319
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
whatever he wants.

3320
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
This will honor the loyal

3321
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
steadfast bug fans

3322
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
who for months have voted with

3323
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
their hearts with their beliefs

3324
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
who have broken no rules and committed

3325
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
no crimes. But

3326
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
this decision will also serve

3327
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
the never buggers who will be getting

3328
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
their own separate bug free

3329
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
episode. The bug episode

3330
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
is not your episode. It is a

3331
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
bonus. If you are the kind of person

3332
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
who says things like I pay my

3333
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
hard earned money for club three and I don't

3334
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
want to pay for a bug. You are not

3335
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
you are not paying for it. It is a

3336
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
bonus. The other episode which

3337
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
will be voted on which will be bug free

3338
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
that is your episode.

3339
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
I suggest that you consider the

3340
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
bug episode to be like a bear

3341
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
in the woods. If you don't

3342
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
bother it it won't bother you.

3343
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
No one is making you listen to it.

3344
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
If you do not want bug we have

3345
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
heard you. There will be another

3346
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
episode for you. Gentlemen

3347
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
how do you feel now that this has been fully made up?

3348
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I think this is you know

3349
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Henry Clay was the great

3350
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
compromiser they said of course

3351
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
in the old days and I think this is a

3352
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
So Jason is kind of the

3353
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
crook so I guess I mean all

3354
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
of us are kind of the clay. I actually

3355
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Mike stunts me. I do not remember

3356
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Henry Clay. Am I wrong?

3357
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
That could be right. I am just worried about saying

3358
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
anything further about we are like clay and then

3359
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
we learn a lot of bad shit about clay.

3360
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
There is no bad shit that you could

3361
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
say about this a perfect decision

3362
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
that has been reached. Henry Clay yeah I was

3363
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
right. He was a lawyer and

3364
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
secretary of state. Secretary of state.

3365
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
My father is a lawyer and while I

3366
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
did not inherit his

3367
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
beliefs about paying conspiracy

3368
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
weirdos at conspiracy sites

3369
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
I did inherit his notion of

3370
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
law and order of being firm

3371
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
of taking action and of trying

3372
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
to reach a compromise that makes

3373
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
everyone happy. Do we not feel like this

3374
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
satisfies everyone? I think it does.

3375
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
It is a buggy bonus if you want

3376
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
if you are that

3377
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
interested in that. You are so inclined if you want

3378
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
to skittle scattle over to that.

3379
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
But you do not have to. No problem. If you are not

3380
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
interested in skittling or scattling

3381
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
much less pootie sauce there will be an episode

3382
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
that honors your interests.

3383
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
There will not be the blockade

3384
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
in the poll and I think I have figured

3385
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
out another thing that

3386
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
I have not even discussed with you guys that I think

3387
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
will help in the situation

3388
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
of future blockades. Oh go ahead please.

3389
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
I find it interesting for something to get stuck

3390
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
in second place and like will it make it over

3391
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
the hill. You know the first time it happened

3392
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
with the mass magician it was a lot

3393
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
of fun. We were all having a lot of fun.

3394
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
So here is

3395
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
what will happen but just to keep the drama of

3396
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
the possibility of that happening

3397
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
I am hereby instituting

3398
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Bugs Law aka the

3399
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Putty Statute. Runner-ups will now

3400
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
compete in no more than four polls

3401
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
before being retired from the poll

3402
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
and considered for automatic second gate

3403
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
or even main feed.

3404
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Do we all take Bugs

3405
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Law and the Putty Statute? So you are saying that it is

3406
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
four and then we decide or it automatically

3407
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
goes? I guess that is a question of

3408
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
is it in four polls?

3409
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Yeah I thought it was four

3410
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
poll appearances. Does that include the first?

3411
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
I think the total of four

3412
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
so that there still is

3413
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
the notion of like oh is it going to

3414
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
because I think it can be fun. There is some fun to be had there.

3415
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
I found a lot of this

3416
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
to be fun until the recent

3417
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
past. So in order to keep some

3418
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
of the fun and that is what I would say in

3419
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
general is remember this is a

3420
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
comedy podcast. Comedy

3421
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
is fun. Sometimes we have a poll where

3422
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
we vote on silly fun topics. Fun

3423
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
is fun. Remember everyone

3424
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
fun is fun. I think that is a good

3425
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
tagline. Okay so

3426
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
here is what will happen on a Wednesday

3427
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
in June. I think it will be a very exciting

3428
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
day. You will have different

3429
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
paths much like the portals in Epic Universe.

3430
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
You can choose your path and you

3431
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
will go through the thing. What is

3432
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
the thing called?

3433
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
The Kronos?

3434
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Yes imagine when

3435
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
open your Patreon app.

3436
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
It will be like the Kronos and you can

3437
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
choose where you want to go. Do you want to go hang

3438
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
out in Club Bug Free?

3439
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Or do you want to go hang out in Club

3440
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Coco Peli? That is me.

3441
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
You can go either way.

3442
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Or you could go both.

3443
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
And if you as I believe

3444
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
a lot of listeners are if you

3445
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
either like all of it

3446
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
or don't know what the fuck any of this

3447
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
is about then you get two episodes

3448
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
that day. You are really the winner that

3449
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
day. It is going to be a bonus June

3450
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
if you want it. Yes.

3451
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Also you can just plug

3452
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
in your private R access reader

3453
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
into a podcast feed. You don't have to use

3454
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
the Patreon app.

3455
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
If you want all your podcasts in one place.

3456
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
People don't know that sometimes.

3457
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
That is the Kronos

3458
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
too. There are multiple Kronos. I don't know

3459
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
what to think.

3460
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Think of the one

3461
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
as the entrance from the Grand

3462
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Helios Hotel.

3463
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
You are right.

3464
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
And that is what I would say

3465
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
is that everybody it has been a long

3466
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
bunch of

3467
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
months. So everyone get a restful

3468
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
sleep as if at the new sparkling

3469
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Helios Grand. Everybody

3470
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
rest up because you are going to

3471
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
wake up to a refreshed poll.

3472
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
We need your topics and

3473
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
we will put all this behind us.

3474
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
And to quote one of Bug

3475
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Main's favorite songs.

3476
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Put faith in what you most believe in.

3477
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Two worlds, one family.

3478
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Trust your heart.

3479
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Let fate decide to guide

3480
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
these lives we see.

3481
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
I think. May as well have sung all

3482
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
of them.

3483
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
So that is that.

3484
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Now that said,

3485
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
while this does close out the matter of

3486
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Bug Main does whatever he wants,

3487
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
if this were ever to happen again with

3488
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Bugsy Bones does whatever he wants,

3489
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Beaumont G. Mannheim does whatever he wants,

3490
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
or Craig Healy does whatever he wants,

3491
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
those will be different things and we will deal

3492
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
with those at a later time.

3493
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
That will be another few different,

3494
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
we will have to do multiple amendments.

3495
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
And those unfortunately,

3496
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
the Putty Statute do not apply to those.

3497
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Because I thought of the idea first.

3498
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
He's slipping pork in at the last second.

3499
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
He's slipping these things into these bills

3500
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
right before they pass.

3501
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Henry Clay caught it!

3502
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
This is delicious boneless wings

3503
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
as if from the wonderful Long Beach Hooters.

3504
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
And with that,

3505
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
you survived Podcast The Ride.

3506
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
You survived The Bug Dilemma.

3507
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Thank you for subscribing

3508
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
to Club 3. Your bravery

3509
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
saved the podcast. Well done

3510
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
William Fighters. And you also

3511
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
survived an episode about restaurants

3512
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
that Bugmane did not secretly invade.

3513
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
What's that at the door?

3514
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
You said we were

3515
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
the only ones here!
