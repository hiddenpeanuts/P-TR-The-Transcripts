1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:27,360
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate where today we are saddened because the recently

3
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:34,080
re-elected Governor DeSantis and his cruel immigration policies have dealt a cruel blow to a sweet Russian mouse.

4
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,280
I'm Scott Gertner. Mike Carlson is mournful about this as well.

5
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:45,440
Yes, this is the number one thing, the bad thing that happened in the midterms is what happened to Fival.

6
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,520
Yeah, there was not a red wave.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,720
Was it a red wave? Was it a flood? What was supposed to happen? It was supposed to be a flood, it was supposed to be a tsunami.

8
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,680
The tsunami, they were all saying it was going to be this massive.

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,880
Joe Rogan said it was going to be like the elevators in the Shining opening up with the red coming at you.

10
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,960
That's what he said. He knew it. He knew what was going to happen.

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,840
So for some reason, he wasn't right. He wasn't right. What?

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,160
He wasn't right about something Jason shared and I.

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:24,440
Hi. Yeah. Now it is the norm in most midterm elections that the party that holds the White House loses control of Congress.

14
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,680
And this is like they said the most in like 20 years that it has not happened.

15
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,920
And when it happened 20 years ago, it was after 9 11.

16
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,600
So the Republicans like hell no.

17
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,320
It's like, where's Jason going with this?

18
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,760
Where is he going? The magic numbers.

19
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,400
It was after the World's Fair.

20
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,480
Actually, it happened.

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,400
Jason goes to Vegas, every roulette table.

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,520
You put down nine.

23
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,160
Where do I go with the other one?

24
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,200
Twelve? No, it doesn't feel right to me.

25
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:02,120
No, the only red wave is what swept away the red shirt of our beloved rodent pal.

26
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,960
Yeah, I can only assume that's what that's what happened.

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,360
And and it's a shame we're losing Fievel.

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,600
And that's why we're talking about Fievel's Playland today.

29
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,320
Here's the broader context is that a couple of weeks ago,

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:23,160
Universal Studios Florida announced a bunch of closures of kid oriented attractions that are right next to each other.

31
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,360
I'm going to go through the list.

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,880
You can mourn as much as you want or skip them or whatever.

33
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,920
Curious George goes to town.

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,560
He will go to town no longer.

35
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Shrek and Donkeys meet and greet.

36
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,560
I mean, already Shrek 40 is gone and now you can't meet or greet them.

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,520
I think you'll be able to meet and greet them in a different way in the future.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,200
I don't have any information inside information, but I believe Shrek and Donkey will still be around.

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,040
So I'm not so worried. I'm not so worried about that.

40
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,640
This one was just opened recently and they're already closing it.

41
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,760
Yeah, I think they're going to be so like the Blues Brothers are still around.

42
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,000
Universal Hall or Orlando.

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,520
Universal tradition is keeping things around and certainly a long time.

44
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,520
So I would imagine Dreamworks destination.

45
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,200
This was in a list that they put out.

46
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,480
And I asked Jason, what the hell is that?

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,800
And you knew somehow it's what it is,

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,680
a smattering of Dreamworks characters in the old Barney building,

49
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,560
just kind of moving around, dancing around.

50
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,240
Oh, in the... So they kept the indoor setting of that.

51
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,560
They didn't do a whole lot.

52
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,800
Yeah.

53
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,120
Moving around, dancing.

54
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,720
Is it like the Madagascar guy that you see at all?

55
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,960
That's at the American Dream?

56
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,240
Yeah, Madagascar guy, a troll or two.

57
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,320
Oh, yeah, that's good.

58
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,920
Did the farting glitter in there or no?

59
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,720
I don't know that.

60
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,600
What happened to the farting glitter troll?

61
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,320
Do we know?

62
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,600
I still think I think they have it on merchandise, but I don't know how much

63
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,200
per day, farts per day you're getting at the moment on either.

64
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,880
I don't think it's... Yeah, I don't know.

65
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,480
Was this a character in the park?

66
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,760
Is that what you're asking?

67
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,040
That is not there anymore.

68
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,640
That was in the park right now.

69
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Yeah, there was a... Yeah, they had figured out...

70
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,240
Finally, Imagineers, Universal Creative People had figured out how to make a

71
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,880
character fart glitter.

72
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,040
Rolly Crump had tried in 1965.

73
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,240
Trying to haunt him.

74
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,880
Ayahuasca didn't help him.

75
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,360
Yeah, Bob Gurr tried, killed a man.

76
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,480
The glitter ran inside the body of the performer.

77
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,520
Oh, God. Killed him.

78
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,640
Too tightly packed.

79
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,440
Like a bullet.

80
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:29,960
Yeah.

81
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,280
But finally they figured it out.

82
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,400
What did it do though?

83
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,080
Like, what was the glitter?

84
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,760
What did a glitter burst look like?

85
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,320
Like an explosion of glitter coming out of a walk around character's butt.

86
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,240
And it looked like a gender reveal party.

87
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,680
Like when those glitter guns or whatever things that shoot out colorful.

88
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,520
Like way above his head?

89
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,840
No, it went up horizontally.

90
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,920
Oh, wow.

91
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,360
It got some distance?

92
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,080
Yeah.

93
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,480
Yeah, it was really good.

94
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,280
I mean, it was naked glitter farting troll at Universal Orlando.

95
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,840
This is from the movie.

96
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,240
I believe it's in the movie.

97
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:03,960
Yeah.

98
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,400
It's not original park IP.

99
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,000
It's a little crass for my taste, but I have to appreciate the artistry.

100
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,360
I'm sending you the other video of it, but I actually just don't know

101
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,040
because I haven't seen a video of that dance party.

102
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,240
There probably wasn't a farting troll because I think it's too...

103
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,040
The effect probably is too...

104
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,440
Sounds dangerous and gorge.

105
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,720
Yeah, potentially.

106
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,440
Woody Woodpecker's Nuthouse Coaster.

107
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,000
Right.

108
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,160
And really what all of this is, is a gutting of one of Universal's main

109
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,960
lands, which is Woody Woodpecker's Kid Zone.

110
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,760
Right. That's what all of this is adding up to.

111
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,600
You know, this is we know that we know that Disneyland lands.

112
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,240
We know Adventureland and Frontierland,

113
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,280
and we know the Universal lands, World Expo, Woody Woodpecker, Kid Zone,

114
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,400
Production Central, and for any of these to disappear is gutting.

115
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,360
I'm gutted. We're all gutted.

116
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,040
And how can we how can this be done to Woody Woodpecker, Universal's Mickey?

117
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,560
We all agree.

118
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:11,240
And when I say we, I mean, the nation, the world agrees Woody Woodpecker is as beloved as Mickey Mouse.

119
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,600
And what now?

120
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,960
Now he has nowhere to prove it.

121
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,120
We can't see his nuttiness on display in his ultimate Nuthouse Coaster.

122
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,400
That's a good point.

123
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,720
Hopefully, when I add a Woody Woodpecker land to Epic Universe.

124
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,600
Oh, yeah.

125
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,880
Oh, yeah.

126
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,520
I got to look up now and more Woody in the future.

127
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,840
But we have to figure out because we all

128
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,080
realize we don't like Woody Woodpecker on the show, right?

129
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,560
Yeah.

130
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,760
Yeah. He's like one of the least liked of these characters.

131
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,000
We don't ever think about his catchphrase.

132
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
It's not even a catchphrase.

133
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,400
It's a noise.

134
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah, I like what he does that noise.

135
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,000
You like that? I like it.

136
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,680
But I also want to see how old he is because you sent me a tweet the other day

137
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,000
wishing Felix the cat a happy one hundred and third birthday.

138
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,840
It's got one hundred and three years.

139
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,680
I like Felix. I've seen barely any Felix the cat.

140
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,840
I feel like I've seen some, but I like him so much more than I like.

141
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,640
Woody Woodpecker.

142
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,840
I like every character better than what he would.

143
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,960
I like an offensive maybe maybe.

144
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,200
But Felix has the magic bag as a kid.

145
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,480
I remember the bags called Mary Poppins bag.

146
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,840
Anything come out of it.

147
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,720
What do you would have better?

148
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,320
I have no fondness for whatsoever.

149
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,560
Felix the cat is a better candidate for like 20 years ago that they should have

150
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,760
been like, we need a guy.

151
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,640
This is our guy.

152
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,040
To have a Nutt House coaster.

153
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,360
Well, to have like Felix the cat's kid zone.

154
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,360
Yeah, I feel like we'd feel more warmly to that.

155
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:41,840
Maybe.

156
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,120
Maybe.

157
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,120
But I don't know.

158
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,520
I think neither is relevant to children in any way.

159
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,600
That's 100 percent correct.

160
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,200
But I'm just saying that Woody Woodpecker will be all kind of what a couple,

161
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,840
what a month when we're talking about Universal Bucks, maybe.

162
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,360
And you asked.

163
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,600
Oh, that's why it came.

164
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,480
Like the their equivalent of Disney dollars.

165
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,560
Those are close three, right?

166
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,480
Which are very expensive.

167
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,440
The universal books.

168
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,960
I was like, oh, wouldn't it be funny if I found Woody Woodpecker dollars?

169
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,560
And they're like 30 or 40 dollars a bill.

170
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,000
OK, yeah.

171
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,000
But yeah, Woody Woodpecker.

172
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,920
I don't I don't think I even knew Felix

173
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,360
the cat was associated with Universal Studios until this moment.

174
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,760
But you're right. Why not?

175
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,960
I guess if it's arbitrary, why is he not?

176
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,120
Look, we're going to we're going to do an episode about that.

177
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,440
We're going to discuss Woody Woodpecker in full.

178
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,000
Absorb all the Woody Woodpecker culture and see if that makes us understand why

179
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,960
kind of in the 90s, Universal landed on.

180
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,160
Well, I guess this is our guy.

181
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,600
And I guess he's our Mickey.

182
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,280
Yeah, it's a good question.

183
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,480
Yeah, we need to get there.

184
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,960
There's a long exploration, I think, that needs to be done here.

185
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,440
Yeah.

186
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,040
Figure out what's going on.

187
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,920
What is that until we're shutting down

188
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,720
Woody Woodpecker until we can figure out what's going on.

189
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:06,440
But for now, the biggest well, well, I'll say this.

190
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,680
I mean, today's topic, if I was Playland, is part of Woody Woodpecker's

191
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,280
KidZone and it is going away.

192
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,000
And that's why we're we're talking about it.

193
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,160
But let's talk about what's safe in Woody Woodpecker's KidZone.

194
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,640
I know you're waiting to hear it.

195
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,440
You need a soothing voice to tell you

196
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,760
SpongeBob store pants is safe.

197
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,840
You can still shop at SpongeBob store pants.

198
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,080
The animal actors stage is safe, unlike in Hollywood, which is breaking pretty

199
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,800
recently, I guess a couple of weeks ago as you're hearing this.

200
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,240
But losing that stalwart in Hollywood, they're shutting a lot down.

201
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,200
But the main thing, E.T.

202
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,280
Adventure is in Woody Woodpecker KidZone.

203
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,280
And this has always been the fear that that the wrecking ball finally comes in.

204
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,280
It is not happening.

205
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,160
E.T. is safe.

206
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,280
And the pizza place that's over there by the store.

207
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,000
OK, that is safe.

208
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,760
What's the name of it?

209
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,960
Do we know what that's called?

210
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,000
Let me look it up.

211
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,120
Is it? I don't think it's a fun.

212
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,560
I think it was in a list I was looking at and I didn't write it down because I

213
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,920
assumed it wouldn't come up and now Jason.

214
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,080
No, well, I was going to ask, like, are you excited to, like, take your son one

215
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:21,160
day to Florida and share the most mid pizza you've ever had at the

216
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:27,240
or you can cross the park to the New York Street and probably have the same pizza

217
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,960
or you can get it with a big mural of the Fantastic Four looking down on you at

218
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,160
Islands of Adventure. Oh, sure.

219
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,280
Yes. Yeah. Kind of same piece.

220
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,000
And I think I may be your first use of mid on the show,

221
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,440
which I remember that you said mid in a text and I didn't know what you were

222
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
talking about. And you respond when I asked you

223
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,760
responded with it's a young person insult.

224
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,400
It is.

225
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,000
I popularized on TikTok,

226
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,920
but it seems to go back to the wrestler MJF.

227
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,440
Did he invent a lot?

228
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,400
I don't know that he invented it, but I think like it caught on after he there

229
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
was a lot of clipped. I love to give him credit for it.

230
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,920
I just didn't know if it was his.

231
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,160
I think he's a young person.

232
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,200
His 20, like 20s at this point.

233
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,920
So young. Yeah.

234
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,320
Well, I'll be younger than late 20s.

235
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,240
Can't fathom. Hard to think of any numbers.

236
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,000
You know, I can't fathom it.

237
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,520
Too young to say mid.

238
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,360
Too young to say mid.

239
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,920
Yeah. Well, no pizza will have to come.

240
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,240
Yeah. The mediocre pizza will have to come from elsewhere.

241
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,680
Oh, are you ready for this name?

242
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,400
Yeah. Yeah. Hit us with it.

243
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,200
Kids zone pizza company.

244
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,320
Wow. Kids zone pizza company.

245
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,880
So it's fine. So despite most of kids and disappearing,

246
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,400
their famous pizza company will be safe.

247
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,280
Yes. Great.

248
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,080
They haven't talked about there's no rebrand.

249
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,120
I guess there has to be a rebranding because Woody Woodpecker.

250
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,440
But kids zone to me sounds like Discovery Zone.

251
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,680
It sounds so very like, I guess, sort of generic in a way, too.

252
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,160
So base it probably a lot of things have been called kids zone.

253
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,200
Yeah. So you're probably a shoe store was kids zone at a certain point or whatever.

254
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,960
Kids clothing store.

255
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,840
So, yeah, losing Woody there.

256
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,600
I wonder if it'll be a new kids zone.

257
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,720
I guess this is maybe for the end of the episode, but there's maybe like Dreamworks

258
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,840
they're adding in, I'm not exactly sure.

259
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,320
But I wonder, yeah, if the kids own name will be complete.

260
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,040
And do they keep any of them?

261
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,640
Do they just redo the coaster?

262
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,360
Do they redo? Yeah, I don't know.

263
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,920
That remains to be seen.

264
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,560
So maybe even some of the things we're talking about today will be repurposed.

265
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:32,720
But it is all giant stuff that you would find if you were a mouse in the Old West

266
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,800
and it might be a little hard to repurpose a lot of that.

267
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,400
This all opened in 1992.

268
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,320
Fievel's Playland did rather not, I think, the rest of kids zone.

269
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:51,720
Not sure when all that was, but Fievel's Playland, it does feel like very

270
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:59,920
like grandfathered forever universal stuff goes way back in Hollywood as well.

271
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,960
I don't know.

272
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,080
When you guys heard this, did you feel like, well, that's actually a bit of a

273
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,320
classic universal thing that that's going on, or at least like from your childhoods at all?

274
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,320
Yeah, I have very warm memories, very clear memories of this.

275
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,600
I did find a picture.

276
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:21,320
I don't think I put it on my iPad today, but I do have a picture of me meeting Fievel

277
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:29,560
in this area, wearing a bright, wild, like paint splatter, orange Tasmanian Devil shirt.

278
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,000
It's a very 1993 picture, you know,

279
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,480
and I remember doing the slide with one of my parents.

280
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,400
But it is an area that when I've gone to Universal, I've got, wow,

281
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
it hasn't changed at all.

282
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,320
It's just like I remember.

283
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,000
It hasn't changed at all.

284
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,000
Because the other thing is I have very warm memories towards

285
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,240
Fievel and Wiley Burp and the whole Maskowitz family.

286
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:58,880
Of course.

287
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
And I am wondering.

288
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,080
We all got it. Wiley Burp.

289
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,480
No need to go further.

290
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:02,880
Yes.

291
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,800
I'm sure we'll talk about Wiley Burp planning.

292
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:13,280
But I know that is I looked up where can you stream the two American Tale movies

293
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,240
and you can buy them or rent them anywhere.

294
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,480
But the only place that Just Watch said was streaming is Stars.

295
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:21,960
Yeah.

296
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,960
So I want to know one ventures to Stars.

297
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,960
Are you crazy?

298
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,120
I don't think Stars is high on the like in terms of like streaming services people

299
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,720
have no no no that's a that's a free trial or nothing.

300
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,240
Nobody keeps something like Amazon.

301
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,440
You could get it through Amazon or like Amazon maybe is a stars like you could

302
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,640
get a stars trial via Amazon and I did watch the first one of these.

303
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,120
Yes.

304
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,760
OK.

305
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,920
And not to be too obvious.

306
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,720
But I as a kid really like the second one because it was very bright and it was

307
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:03,320
a Western and like I knew about like cowboy movies and stuff.

308
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,480
And so that was a little cleaner.

309
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,520
Whereas the first one is very melancholy.

310
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,520
The saddest movie.

311
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,400
Saddest.

312
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,920
I felt myself getting sad just watching the clip of the male singing somewhere out there.

313
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,400
Yeah.

314
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,120
Yeah.

315
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,720
It's a it's miserable for sure.

316
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,080
And it's very like

317
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,080
grimy and filmy and optical.

318
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
And I don't think that helps.

319
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,400
Like we we put it on and kind of only half paid attention to it the other night.

320
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,920
And we're and when it finished, we were like Aaron said it's weird.

321
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,880
I wouldn't there's things I wouldn't say this about from like the tooth or like

322
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:46,240
what she said. She just said like this feels like 60 years old to me.

323
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,320
Like there's things that are 60 years old.

324
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,720
I don't feel 60 years old.

325
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,480
And this one from 86 feels like ancient.

326
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,360
Yeah.

327
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,480
And it was I think it's from a time when

328
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,960
what was there was another thing I couldn't think of.

329
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,400
But like you you the American dream involved like Ellis Island immigrants,

330
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,040
your grandparents, your great grandparents, like this is a story told in a cartoon

331
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,080
with mice and I kind of got that as a kid.

332
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,080
Like I was like I was like I want these

333
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,960
mice to mice to come to America and have a better life.

334
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,680
Like I fully bought the premise

335
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,920
and now kids.

336
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,360
There's a lot of kids with parents who are insane and would have a stroke.

337
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,120
Keep the mice out. You mean telling them, describing to them what this is about.

338
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,880
Santas voters would see the first American Tale and be furious.

339
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,400
These films 86 was American Tale.

340
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,440
It is a film

341
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:56,040
produced by Steven Spielberg and therefore, yes,

342
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,560
Frank Marshall, Frank Marshall was one of the producers of this film.

343
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,320
Beautiful kisses.

344
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,040
The last time he came up, you called it cute that he plays guitar.

345
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,520
Yeah, this affection.

346
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,200
I swear you're more affectionate about Frank Marshall than I've seen you be about the baby.

347
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,560
Well, that's true.

348
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,920
Cute, so cute.

349
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,760
I haven't said anything about the baby, about being cute yet.

350
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,800
But Frank Marshall, yes, with his guitar.

351
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,640
So cute.

352
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:32,400
So I didn't realize the extent to which that I knew that there's that Steven

353
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,520
Spielberg credit and you're like, what does this mean?

354
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,560
Because his name's on a lot of a lot of stuff, but this completely was hand

355
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,080
delivered to Don Bluth, then Disney rival.

356
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,040
I mean, this is one of the things that made him a Disney rival.

357
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,080
He leaves the Disney folds because they were doing a very bad job in the late

358
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,840
70s, early 80s of holding on to promising talent.

359
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,160
They let everybody go out the door.

360
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,760
Yeah, Tim Burton and John Lasseter, chief among them.

361
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,760
Movies aren't good enough to keep them.

362
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,800
You're working on more mediocre movies and like, well, I wouldn't do that.

363
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
OK, well, bye. I'm out of here.

364
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,000
Surely this is not history repeating itself.

365
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,720
Would they have like 30 Imagineers on staff?

366
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,640
Yes, yeah.

367
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,160
Yeah. And Universal is announcing a zillion things and nailing it.

368
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,360
Just like if not, whom runs every Universal project?

369
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,160
They have a lot of RBI.

370
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,560
Yes. Yeah.

371
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,560
Just things are happening.

372
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,800
Things to announce and talk about.

373
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,520
Yeah, we might be in one of those in the old in the Imagineering world for sure.

374
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,640
But yeah, look, this is a this is a dark time.

375
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,840
It's a pre Eisner time.

376
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,960
This guy, if Don Bluth leaves, does odds and ends the video games

377
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,560
and the animated sequence of Xanadu, which is delightful,

378
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,120
ultimately makes Secret of Nym is the big movie.

379
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:06,080
Secret of Nym opens opposite E.T., the extraterrestrial, does horrible,

380
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,000
gets its ass handed to it.

381
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,440
But Steven Spielberg sees it, loves it, really wants to thinks Don Bluth

382
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,160
maybe his in because like Disney does it the way they do it.

383
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,600
That's not going to be my ticket to do an animated movie.

384
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,880
So he goes to Bluth, says we should do something,

385
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,680
leaves, Bluth doesn't hear from him for two years.

386
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,360
He comes back and he thinks, well, that was the end of that.

387
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,600
But then he does come back and just perfectly crystal.

388
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,600
It just exactly says immigrant mouse family, the Mousekowitz is.

389
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,240
And it's called an American tale.

390
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,600
And it's spelled like a mouse's tale, not like a story tale.

391
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,760
I think he was originally called Mousey

392
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,880
Mousekowitz is what I read.

393
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,920
And then then Spielberg came back and fiddled with it and said,

394
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,160
I think it should be Fievel.

395
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,480
And so he said, does anybody know that name?

396
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,200
And he said, that's my grandfather's name.

397
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,240
And that is why he is Fievel.

398
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,320
I did not know any of this stuff.

399
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,400
So before the fabelman's, before we all met and loved the fabelman's,

400
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,240
he invented the Mousekowitz.

401
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,760
Wow.

402
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,200
Yes, this was this was his most personal story.

403
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,040
I don't know. They're all pretty.

404
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,480
He's pretty personal. Sure.

405
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,680
So that's the secret there.

406
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,320
So this is like yet another one.

407
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,280
By the time it comes to the Universal Parks, it's yet another extremely

408
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:33,600
Spielberg property, just the domination he has over early Universal.

409
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,160
Even put next like it kind of wraps around the side of the adventure.

410
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,360
Build. Yeah, I saw one walk through where they're like,

411
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:47,640
that is the extended queue and it is like feet mere feet away.

412
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,800
Oh, gotcha.

413
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,080
If they need that, if they're using that.

414
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,120
Yeah. So the sequel, like the production of that had some interesting,

415
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,640
like I saw some little things because Don Bluth leaves.

416
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,880
I think Don Bluth not really involved in the sequel.

417
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,960
Not involved.

418
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,920
First American Tale, big hit, really outperforms Great Mouse Detective,

419
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,400
which Disney puts out the same year.

420
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,080
Another movie I watched a lot as a kid.

421
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,680
Yeah. And American Tale had VHS copies.

422
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,080
Yeah. So we had I didn't have a VHS copy of Secret of Nym.

423
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,960
I'd VHS copies of both of those.

424
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,040
And I probably watched them to death.

425
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,040
Yeah. Yeah.

426
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,120
So by the time you love Fievel, but I loved Fievel.

427
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:29,920
I love Fievel.

428
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,160
It makes so much sense to me so much.

429
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,000
And yeah, Mike, what was your your five?

430
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,240
I saw I don't think I saw the original American Tale.

431
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,800
Maybe I haven't seen all of it even to this day.

432
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,120
I saw Fievel goes west and I saw it in the Waterfall movie theater.

433
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,880
I talk about all the time.

434
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,920
So I remember as if I saw it like projected onto a waterfall, which is not how I saw it.

435
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,720
But then my memory there combined like we went under the waterfall and I went into

436
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,800
the sea, Fievel and it was a.

437
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,960
The theaters you see things in are very much part of it.

438
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,200
And when you saw the little pre rolls before the movie and the the company's

439
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,520
logo and the film strip man or the Regal roller coaster.

440
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,400
Yes. Did you go on the roller coaster or did you are in recent days?

441
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,280
You got on the Pacific trip through the Pacific.

442
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,080
Oh, yeah.

443
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,480
In the ocean, I see dolphins and I haven't been to Pacific theaters much.

444
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,240
I've seen multiple generations of the Regal roller coaster.

445
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,600
It like upped the CGI.

446
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,760
They all.

447
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,640
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

448
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,680
Regal roller coaster and film strip man, I think some of my fondest movie going

449
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,280
memories. Did you guys have Sony theaters?

450
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,720
I remember I can't remember when it started, maybe 96, 97, because I saw Star

451
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,080
Trek Generations there.

452
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,320
But I don't remember Sony theaters existing.

453
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,400
That might not have been everywhere.

454
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,360
Yeah, it feels like its own episode movie theater guys, movie theater.

455
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,240
Well, the Regal roller coaster, the Regal roller coaster.

456
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,720
Essentially, I mean, the one I rep is the General Cinema space candy,

457
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,040
which you guys are right back to watch things.

458
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,120
I have to I can't if there's a screen up, I have to watch the space candy,

459
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,320
something that's terrifying to me for whatever reason.

460
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,040
It's like, you know, it's just candy and popcorn and sodas popping up.

461
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,040
And it's like

462
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,520
there's no reason it should be terrifying.

463
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,400
But Aaron and I really bond over.

464
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,280
Yeah, you were scared of space candy, too.

465
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,640
And that's what it's called on YouTube.

466
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,880
Look up space candy.

467
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,960
Oh, yeah, that's probably something, though.

468
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:35,000
All the movie our friends before the movies begin.

469
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,440
But wait, where did that come out of the Pacific?

470
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,840
I mean, oh, my you asked me about five.

471
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,320
And I said, I said that's sort of my strongest memory of five.

472
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,400
I always liked five.

473
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,560
And I'm sure I did not go.

474
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,960
Of course, when I was a kid, I didn't go to Universal until I was a little older.

475
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,880
So it wasn't something on my radar.

476
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,920
But I was not that into five.

477
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,760
But I liked five.

478
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,920
I enjoyed him.

479
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,480
So

480
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,160
pretty big hit American Tale Land Before Time bigger hit,

481
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,440
which never super reflected in the parks, maybe here and there and some way.

482
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,280
But so they're really cooking with gas.

483
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,400
And then I don't remember why Bluth's not involved in Fylde Goes West.

484
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,920
I don't either.

485
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,360
I know Fylde Goes West kind of happened.

486
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,080
One of the reasons it was happened, it got rolling, is because

487
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,920
Steven Spielberg wanted the all the animators from who framed Roger Rabbit

488
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,680
to continue to have jobs was the framing I saw.

489
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,560
Just put them right into something.

490
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,680
Sure.

491
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,760
Dreamworks, not Illumination, that's the current company.

492
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,760
But Dreamworks

493
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,360
for a very short period of time, they had like

494
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,920
an animation

495
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,000
or Amblin.

496
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's something about it.

497
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,160
Like Amblimation or something.

498
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
It's very cumbersome.

499
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,920
I couldn't remember.

500
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,080
Yeah, I just remembered that it was cumbersome.

501
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,120
So Dreamworks animation that comes much later.

502
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,040
But Amblimation was not around for very long.

503
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,720
Yeah. Yeah.

504
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,800
But they make Fylde Goes West, which I agree I liked more,

505
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
more fun, poppy.

506
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,920
I didn't get to rewatch it.

507
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,560
Did you rewatch it? Have you seen it lately?

508
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,280
I haven't seen it lately.

509
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,120
I think the the I don't remember.

510
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,480
Did you watch it?

511
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,640
No. OK.

512
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,920
I was trying to remember.

513
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,440
I think the big songs were in the first one.

514
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,240
There are no cats in America.

515
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,240
I really loved it.

516
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,120
Yeah. Yes.

517
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,560
Yeah, I know. Well, like, what do you remember from any of it?

518
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,320
It's that there are no cats in America and the streets are filled with cheese.

519
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,160
Oh, I remember the showdown.

520
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,880
The high noon showdown at the end of the movie,

521
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,680
which is done with slingshots.

522
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,480
With is it Fyvill and

523
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,560
Cat R.

524
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,920
Wall, Cat R.

525
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,600
Wall voiced by John Cleese.

526
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,800
Well, and Wiley Burp pulls himself out of his stupor.

527
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,800
Voiced by the late Jimmy Stewart, I believe, last final role.

528
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,800
Jimmy Stewart's final film role is as Wiley Burp, which I don't want to say.

529
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,400
Look, I'm not trying to rewrite history.

530
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:12,080
I obviously didn't know who Jimmy Stewart was as an actor, but I knew every cartoon

531
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,120
had a character who referenced Jimmy Stewart.

532
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,640
Oh, so that character made sense to me.

533
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,160
Yeah.

534
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,240
In Little Did I Know.

535
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,120
Oh, no, it's the actual guy.

536
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,800
It's not the Looney Tunes doing a joke about the actual guy's voice.

537
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,480
Sure. This is the guy.

538
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,400
But you've heard some facts.

539
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,880
Oh, wow.

540
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,440
My feelings about these two and I guess I have I've seen a lot of the first five.

541
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,760
But I'm trying to think.

542
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,640
I always get them mixed up in tone wise with the rescuers movies because I feel

543
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,960
like there was a similar thing where like the first rescuers is a lot like

544
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,280
quieter and obviously there's a big break between the movies.

545
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,800
I forget how many years between those.

546
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,640
But like the first one is like a mood and it's a little more sad.

547
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,160
And the second one's kind of just like

548
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,440
feels to me like more of a straightforward.

549
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,480
Kind of a brighter, more of an adventure.

550
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,600
Yeah, yeah.

551
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,040
I think Bluthman would be part of rescuers.

552
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,920
It was because by the time I think he worked on that and then Secret of Nim is

553
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,880
about mice. So then when Spielberg showed up and said, so it's about mice, he was

554
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,640
like, I don't know, but he can't say no to the mouse guy.

555
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,040
Spielberg. Yeah.

556
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,760
And it's mice in a human world.

557
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:24,040
It's like the mice stuff mirroring what the like Great Mouse Detective, like the

558
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,640
thing with Ben Franklin, Ben and me.

559
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,720
I loved Ben and me as a kid.

560
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,400
Me too.

561
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,840
Oh, history.

562
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,360
I loved Ben Franklin from the park.

563
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,880
I was probably to me like Ben Franklin, a character from the Disney theme parks.

564
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,280
Yeah.

565
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,400
Well, then when that VHS went in during elementary school, oh, boy.

566
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:41,880
Yeah.

567
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,200
Second only to when they showed us Turtles and the New Line Cinema logo played.

568
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,760
Oh, yeah.

569
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,760
Oh, boy.

570
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,440
They can't couch that as educational whatsoever.

571
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,000
Hey, I bet if you showed Ben and me now, it would come back.

572
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,640
But I the faintest.

573
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,480
It was like a little mouse helped Ben Franklin figure out electricity.

574
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,080
He was up in his hat, way predating retatooie.

575
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,200
He like hangs out up there.

576
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:05,960
Yeah.

577
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,240
Wait, does he know he's that they talk, right?

578
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,000
Or do they not? Is it just accidental?

579
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,160
Good question. I don't know.

580
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,680
Does he leave items out to spark ideas and Ben Franklin?

581
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,560
The mouse is dressed, though, with like a tricorder hat.

582
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,600
He also has a hat.

583
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,840
I don't think he has like a tick up there.

584
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,400
Yeah.

585
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,000
Doesn't have a being whispering ideas to him.

586
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,440
Yeah.

587
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,880
At least they didn't show that.

588
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,520
Is it the voice of Winnie the Pooh?

589
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,000
Is it Sterling Holloway?

590
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,360
Man, I think possibly.

591
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,880
I didn't realize we were going to be talking about all of these questions.

592
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,960
They might. I feel like I can't be pulling these questions from nowhere.

593
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,160
That seems right to me.

594
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:38,560
Yeah.

595
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,080
I'll look at Benjamin Franklin mouse thing.

596
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,920
What is an official Disney?

597
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,640
Yeah.

598
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,760
It was like a feature at basically.

599
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,520
OK, so you'd see it paired with other things or I don't know what the release

600
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,720
of it was like and certainly in in schools, I would say.

601
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
Yes. Sterling Holloway.

602
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,640
Sterling Holloway is the mouse.

603
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,440
So good.

604
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,200
Always. I wonder if it's on Disney Plus.

605
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,440
Probably not, as I'm saying that sentence.

606
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,240
Yeah, I don't know if it was either it was in that initial glut when everything

607
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,400
came out or it's an awkward fell between the cracks because it's not a feature

608
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,400
length thing, I don't know.

609
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,800
But yeah,

610
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,520
I mean, we were we were wondering this like, what does anyone remember?

611
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,440
Because this is the main thing I would say.

612
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,560
Fievel, I don't think any, but they've done nothing with this.

613
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,280
These movies fell out of the consciousness.

614
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,680
I think maybe Fievel, the Fievel popularity had died down by the time

615
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,520
Fievel goes west came out then in the early 90s.

616
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,920
Right.

617
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,560
So talk about now it is kind of I don't think there's been many generations of

618
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,960
kids now who want to go to a playground and run around, but they have no idea what

619
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,880
Fievel is, what America who the Mousekowitz is are and the hardships they endured.

620
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,320
They don't know anything about that.

621
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,680
It versus like the land before time,

622
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,400
which we realized recently there's 17 sequels still being produced by that one

623
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,200
company. So if you're yeah, if your parents are like on the the cheap red box,

624
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,320
yeah, then they might still know who Littlefoot is.

625
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,840
But these, yeah, they did not milk these for endless.

626
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,120
So there's a couple of straights of video

627
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,640
sequels that I have no idea what happens in them.

628
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,760
And there was a TV show Saturday morning show also with the old West veneer.

629
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,560
Yeah, I remember that that I don't think was very good.

630
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,200
I think that might have occurred even then.

631
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,640
I thought might have like taught me that.

632
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,680
Well, Fievel every week. Oh, this isn't OK.

633
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,520
Maybe not every Saturday morning product is great and perfect.

634
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,440
But yeah, these are they're sort of lost to the sands of in a way, this entire

635
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,880
it has a lot in common with ET that ET and Fievel are right next to each other.

636
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,440
And these are both Spielberg characters,

637
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,640
properties, worlds that we have let decay.

638
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,720
Yeah. And there's a good side to that,

639
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,600
which is that there haven't been a mind numbing amount of terrible sequels or

640
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,760
retreads. Right.

641
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,200
But the flip side is we're losing these legends.

642
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,040
We aren't passing them on to the next generation.

643
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,160
Yeah. I wonder, curious George, how much lives like in book form?

644
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,160
I think he's around and like scary are still around.

645
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,280
But like I have mentioned, like, say,

646
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,120
Amelia Bedelia to people and just blank slate.

647
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,120
But then again, I like that was an old reference when you were a kid.

648
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,880
Was it? I mean, they making it even after

649
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,320
the author passed, like people took over.

650
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,200
That wasn't a thing that every kid.

651
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,520
And when we were kids, I knew it, too, because my mom would bring it up.

652
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,080
But I don't think most kids knew Amelia Bedelia.

653
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,600
We had a ton of Amelia Bedelia books sitting around in school and at home.

654
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,280
Like I don't I didn't.

655
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,640
But on the other side, like a lot more people know Eloise.

656
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,680
Jane grew up with like Madeline and Eloise.

657
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,400
I knew Madeline a little because there was a cartoon.

658
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,240
Yeah. But Amelia Bedelia, I just think was an old reference.

659
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,880
Then, yeah, I think, do you do you know?

660
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,280
Yeah, but that might have been that might have been another thing.

661
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,200
Our parents were passing to us.

662
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,840
I think so. Yeah. Yeah.

663
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,840
But yeah, look, there's there's no fire.

664
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,400
We kind of we remember vague details about these movies.

665
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,200
We know that the first one is sad.

666
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,200
We know that there is the song somewhere out there, which I realized something

667
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:24,400
about this, that here's the thing Disney straight up stole from the Bluth films.

668
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:30,000
Maybe only this one, but somewhere out there, version in the movie sung by kids

669
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,120
kind of like off key, I was going to say charmingly.

670
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,240
I'm not sure if that's true.

671
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,960
Having rewatched it, I was like, this is what's in my head.

672
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,560
Somewhere out there is the saddest song, like whatever people apply to Hallelujah.

673
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,320
I put on somewhere out there like there's no sadder song ever made because it

674
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,360
reminds me of being three years old and that you mean there's a there might be a

675
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,920
chance that the people I love won't be with me all the time.

676
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,920
Like it reminds me of the most raw emotions that are gutting.

677
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,040
And then I watched it and like Aaron, both of us were both like, this is the song

678
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,640
that's like wrecked us since we were children.

679
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,400
But there's the version of the movie and then they did the hit, the adult

680
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,120
contemporary hit with Linda Ronstadt and James Ingram.

681
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,200
And this is before Disney straight up

682
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,200
stole this, this idea of the movie.

683
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,640
The first time that has ever happened.

684
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,040
I think it's the first like modern hit.

685
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,480
It's the first post MTV hit from a kids animated movie.

686
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:40,200
Before they started doing it with Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, both Pibo.

687
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,520
I love Pibo.

688
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,000
I like Pibo.

689
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,480
But that became like the formula was interesting version in the movie.

690
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,160
And then we also get kind of a

691
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,360
syrupy adult contemporary hit out of it.

692
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,800
So I think they completely.

693
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,680
Yeah.

694
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,960
Can you feel the love tonight?

695
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,520
They really like a lot of the songs.

696
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,440
Yeah. I remember my music teacher in elementary school just always playing.

697
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,640
I was like, why aren't you playing as the one from the movie?

698
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,160
What is this other one?

699
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,280
What are you like?

700
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,320
I didn't know there was a soundtrack cut in the album, like the single.

701
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,000
That one's confusing because the one in the movie has like plot points in it.

702
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,240
So like the when you when you hear Elton on the radio, you don't want to hear him

703
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,920
singing like the king, he really is the king or this parts about where Timon and

704
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,880
Pumbaa are like their friend is leaving them.

705
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,800
Beware if Elton was singing from the point of view of Pumbaa.

706
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,520
Oh, yeah, that's true.

707
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,080
He wrote it. He did write it.

708
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,920
But you know, you want to like streamline it so that like it can be like a wedding

709
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,080
song, I guess, and it's but that's somewhere out there.

710
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,800
The the the hit version of it loomed large for me.

711
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,520
And also, I thought Aaron and I think both agreed like we when we're three years

712
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,120
old, we knew that as a hit song and we're like, wow, adults must be really sad.

713
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,080
Adults must listen to sad.

714
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,080
This was this must be as heavy as it is to be an adult, which is something she also

715
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,240
said about the song She's Like the Wind by Patrick Swayze.

716
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,800
You know, Patrick Swayze, yeah, yeah, I think we just heard that was Lindsay was

717
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,040
on Lindsay's playlist yesterday.

718
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,200
It popped up. Oh, well, yeah.

719
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,240
Did you did you get sad when she said the wind came?

720
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,400
I actually didn't.

721
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
But now I got to go back and listen to it.

722
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,680
Everyone put it on her little like kids tape player and then just sway around and

723
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,480
kind of like get law and like think like, so this is what it'll be like.

724
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,760
I better be happy now, because when I'm an adult, it'll be as sad as Swayze is.

725
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,240
Well, wasn't wrong in a lot of ways.

726
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,160
Not 100 percent wrong.

727
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,760
We all feel Swayze's burden here and there.

728
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,920
Yeah.

729
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,560
Anyway, all this is I'm just collecting like general

730
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,920
American tale memories.

731
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,000
But here's the strongest one I have is that we're talking about the Florida one

732
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,360
closing, but this was in Hollywood and I think in Hollywood before

733
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,000
Universal Florida was even open, I want to say 89.

734
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,760
And so it was a big part of my early going to Universal experience.

735
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,720
And not just that, not that it's this big,

736
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,760
foamy playground.

737
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:17,040
And we've talked about those not foam like foam at a foam party, but foam like soft

738
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,160
foam and and been soft slides and stuff.

739
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,840
So I love that element of it.

740
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,760
But what I also remember is

741
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:31,720
if you haven't been in L.A. and been past Universal Hollywood,

742
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,560
now I feel like people joke about the minion, that there is a big minion you can

743
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:42,160
see from the freeway with his big single eye and that that is like it's become kind

744
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,640
of an accidental L.A. landmark, maybe not accidental.

745
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:51,520
It's just our choice whether to like view that as is this our Statue of Liberty?

746
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,120
Does it have to be because we don't have a lot of choices?

747
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,000
It does. Yeah, I accept that.

748
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,520
It's fine. But like before you had the minion

749
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,520
peering out in the freeway, there's basically there's two freeways where you

750
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,520
could see Universal really well, the one I want and the one thirty four.

751
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,480
And just what I remember my whole childhood until 97 when they took this down

752
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,280
was that you could see Fievel's Playland clear as day up on the hill from either

753
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,840
freeway. So if I'm going to if I'm on a field trip,

754
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,520
if I'm going to the Gene Autry Museum or the zoo or if my dad's taken me into

755
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,720
Hollywood to see the Capitol built to teach me about Beach Boys lore,

756
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,760
just in doctorate early, I just like

757
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,960
it was just part of the L.A. skyline to me was Fievel stuff.

758
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,280
And I don't even remember what you could see exactly.

759
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,240
You know, it's probably like a big a big spool or I don't know,

760
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,960
the slide that's like a big banana.

761
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,960
I don't know what you could see from the freeway, but just my whole childhood,

762
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,880
I would go like, wow, there's Fievel up there.

763
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,280
That's like a dumb kid thing that I can see from the car.

764
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,160
And it made me happy every time.

765
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,680
And I'm glad you can see. I think kids get that with the minion.

766
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,360
I imagine how excited a four year old is to see the minion on just a drive

767
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,440
to the store or whatever.

768
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,960
So that's that's they get that now.

769
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,440
But this was like it was a part of my childhood not even going into the park

770
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,240
and going to the playland.

771
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,600
Do you think what

772
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,560
less of an effect on kids like look, see that building?

773
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,920
That's the Terminator 2 building and actually the mural on the side.

774
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,920
They took a frame and they blew it up

775
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,520
to such massive proportions.

776
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,160
It looks like abstract art.

777
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,840
You think a kid is saying?

778
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,800
Possibly less children.

779
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,880
I think less. Yeah.

780
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,840
What do you think Mr.

781
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,680
Cameron would have to say about that?

782
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,120
Yeah, less less child excitement about cyberdine systems.

783
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,400
But I'm glad that's back, I guess, to the minion is what I'm saying.

784
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,520
And I just I don't know, I did just buy all of this hook line and center.

785
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,200
And I like

786
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,640
that I feel like in my memory, I think the Hollywood one was bigger than the

787
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,920
Florida one. I think there was more stuff to do and it was a bigger

788
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,600
auditory or like an amphitheater for the little show they did.

789
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,920
Right. But the Florida one, despite I think having a smaller physical

790
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,880
footprint, loomed larger to me because of extra stuff.

791
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:21,400
It was more relevant because of the more recent Fievel goes West and the water slide.

792
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,920
That's one of the weirdest things.

793
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,000
If you're listening to this and you've never been over there, you go to

794
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,480
Universal Florida before it closes, which I think is January 15th,

795
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,680
twenty twenty three is the final day.

796
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,560
I think I feel like a lot of people do not know there is a water slide over there.

797
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,920
Raft water.

798
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,680
You do it on a really confusing type of water slide.

799
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,040
It's not swim trunks because you go, well, why would there be a water slide

800
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,880
in a non water park? How does that work?

801
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,680
Well, you just got to try to stay dry on this little raft, which kind of gets

802
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,160
ripping is what I recall, at least having the last done it when I was

803
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,360
10 or something. It was really fun.

804
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,080
It's not too long.

805
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,440
So you're not too excited or too scared.

806
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,080
You don't have time. You're going to get a little terrified.

807
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,240
You're not going to get soaking wet, but you might get a little splash.

808
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,240
I would equate it to like Pirates of the Caribbean wet.

809
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,800
It's there's a similar ride system at

810
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,120
Volcano Bay where you get on a thing.

811
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,720
Yeah, you get and it's not just an inner tube.

812
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,680
It's like a little piece of something.

813
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,120
And you're like, this is an odd way to go down a water slide.

814
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,120
So more like aerodynamic is in a tube.

815
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,880
Then you're spinning. It's kind of fat and it takes its time.

816
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,480
Yes, but a little sleek bobsled.

817
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,880
Maybe you can get it like that.

818
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,080
And it feels a little scary because it's a bigger slide than this.

819
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,200
Then we're talking about here. But yeah, I didn't know that this was here.

820
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,720
I didn't know until looking into it for this.

821
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,960
Yeah, I didn't know it was there.

822
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,080
I didn't know it was there. I've never really done this.

823
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,280
You didn't know about until looking into it for this.

824
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,480
Correct. Yeah, I didn't know that was there because you didn't really go

825
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,720
to this as a child when you were the right age to be in.

826
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,600
Right. And so, yeah, when I was more of an adult, more of an adult, I would.

827
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,240
Oh, there's a big playland like the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids thing.

828
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,000
Oh, that's cool. Take a look around anyway.

829
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,280
Back to the things I'm even though I wanted to go in like the rope,

830
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,520
whatever you call it, the thing that we walk up the ropes.

831
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,400
I don't know.

832
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,040
You always want whatever these like net bridges.

833
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,080
I don't know what the net bridge.

834
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,040
Yeah, I want to do that.

835
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,720
But rope is more accurate, actually.

836
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,920
But yes, rope bridge is probably where you go.

837
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,520
The Grizzly Challenge Trail of California

838
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:28,320
Adventure is much more welcoming to adults to do it than these other ones.

839
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,200
There's more space.

840
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,560
It's a pretty grand one.

841
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:36,160
But if you're in kind of a claustrophobic climbing space with mostly children,

842
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,840
that is not a good situation to be in.

843
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,720
No, I didn't notice.

844
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,120
This is wild to me because if I had known this full extent when we were down in

845
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,320
Florida and we like we I remember us all going on ET at the start of the day.

846
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,280
If I had known this, I would have been like, come on, Michael, we're doing the slide.

847
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,320
We're doing the slide.

848
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,440
This is a formative theme park memory for me.

849
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,640
Wow. And it is just a blank space for you.

850
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,440
Well, the play I don't have the I don't have it.

851
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,280
Yeah, I can see where it would have been.

852
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,400
But yeah, we didn't go.

853
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,400
We were so brand loyal when I was younger,

854
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,360
which is still like I talk to some people and there is still some like weird

855
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,440
Jiffy Skip brand loyalty for certain people.

856
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,120
So we're like we go to Disney World and that's it.

857
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,560
I go, yeah, but why?

858
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,440
What is this?

859
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,360
Well, I think we have to start breaking apart.

860
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,360
We can help break it apart because we know what's happening.

861
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,280
Universal Resort Florida is on the rise.

862
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:32,920
That's correct.

863
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,160
We get better. They're only letting Disney to.

864
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,480
Yeah, I'm starting to think it's the place I've said a thousand times.

865
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,440
But I think that's where I think it's where the base of operation.

866
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,520
That's what they're that's the strategy is to get people staying just there.

867
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,320
And then maybe they do a couple of days at Disney.

868
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,680
That's a long term Disney.

869
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,520
But the base is because the most the most the molten core of stuff to do.

870
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,960
Yeah, long term plan.

871
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,120
Makes sense to me.

872
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,960
My family did that a few times in the early 2000s and it was very fun.

873
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,640
Well, you guys were trendsetters.

874
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,960
Yeah. And it was it was not super built up.

875
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,160
It is crazy to think about, too,

876
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:11,240
that the last new theme park in Orlando from one of these big companies was

877
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,120
the Islands of Adventure and the next brand new theme park in Orlando is also

878
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,080
from Universal Florida. Wow.

879
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,680
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

880
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,200
Nothing not entirely new park from although I'm glad they should.

881
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,440
They should fix the ones they have.

882
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,120
Well, yeah, right.

883
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,120
Yeah. Less complicated to be there.

884
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,160
I don't know. But maybe take some prices down to while you're at it.

885
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,600
No, they're going to keep pushing it as much as they can.

886
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,960
As much as we can take.

887
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,440
That's right.

888
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:44,920
So the maybe some of the lack of awareness that there's a water slide here and

889
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,920
that it doesn't loom large to anybody really, unless you've been over there,

890
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,760
is that it doesn't really have a name.

891
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,600
I looked at a map and it's just called Fievel's Playland Water Slide.

892
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,680
Yep. How do you not?

893
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,480
How do you miss an opportunity to do like rip roaring?

894
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,840
Yeah, I give it some.

895
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,000
Yeah, yeah.

896
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,680
I feel like it would it would help.

897
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,080
I feel I think on the park map, it even just becomes lowercase.

898
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,560
That's how joyless it is.

899
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,640
Yeah, it was Playland Water Slide Water Slide.

900
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,360
I think it's an afterthought.

901
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,160
Name the thing. Name it for the last two weeks.

902
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,960
Do you think Steven Spielberg knows it's here?

903
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,240
Gosh, maybe not.

904
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,040
He might not have had a lot of eyes on.

905
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:30,040
He probably was not so hands on with the way to begin with.

906
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,960
And then I bet the Playland not either.

907
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,560
But it's interesting because supposedly

908
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,680
the rumors are that like Spielberg has some protection over.

909
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,480
Like he's at least keeping E.T. in Orlando.

910
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,440
I don't know if this is true at all,

911
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,320
but there's some feeling like he really wants E.T.

912
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:49,600
and he is a little more protective of E.T. than, say, the Jurassic Park franchise.

913
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,680
We'll maybe let whatever happen to it.

914
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,160
Anything you want to do.

915
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,360
Maybe he doesn't give a shit about the Jurassic Park franchise.

916
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,800
If they try to touch the E.T. adventure,

917
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:05,280
I think that I believe what will happen is Steven will get very pale and emaciated.

918
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,320
Oh, my God, you're right.

919
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,080
And having to get put into a tube and then only when they start plugging stuff back

920
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,560
in, will Steven spring back to life.

921
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,120
Right.

922
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,440
Sick Steven. No.

923
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,160
That scar.

924
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,240
No one who could take that.

925
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,480
The bulldozers, as soon as he's dead, will come out for E.T.

926
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,640
I'm worried.

927
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,400
I'm just I feel like it's simple.

928
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,440
I think the fact that it made this round means that it has become whatever the

929
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,880
Peter Pan's flight of it or the, you know, the Mad T part.

930
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,600
I don't know what you want to call it, but like it's become the Disneyland 55.

931
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,960
It's becoming that it's Universal 90, which is a long time ago at this point.

932
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,120
And it's like the one thing that's like

933
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,480
where you would say something that you say about Disney stuff way more often,

934
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,200
which is it's a little out of date, but it's so charming.

935
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,000
It's so charming.

936
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,200
And it's part of the part.

937
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,880
And it's been there since the beginning.

938
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,160
Like they have one of those and it's now and that's genuine history.

939
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,120
And they got to keep it.

940
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,080
That's the only thing.

941
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,840
Well, look, we were just talking about this on a text, but like I recently there's

942
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,000
a little more retro merchandise, there's a little more, I feel like embracing of

943
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,320
Universal's history.

944
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,560
And I also think the argument for like the Monsters land,

945
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,960
they're building an epic universe is a little more of like, yes,

946
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,440
this is Universal history type classic property.

947
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,520
So I'm hoping that they realize that about ET.

948
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,520
Yeah, they're so aggressive with everything else with demolishing it,

949
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,880
which we like in some way, really like.

950
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,240
But when it comes for a friend and by friend, I mean Botanicus ET.

951
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,520
I'm OK with I have no ill will towards ET.

952
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,360
But when I say friend, Botanicus is yeah, if they could just keep that there in the

953
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,360
line, whatever ride they replace it with, as long as Botanicus is still there.

954
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,560
They get rid of Botanicus.

955
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,360
We will all turn.

956
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,640
Oh, yeah, that's good. More white and sick.

957
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,160
Yes.

958
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:01,800
So so you're saying so as long as they just put him somewhere like hurry Hobbs

959
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,080
and Shaw need your help. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

960
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,560
They're worried they can't push 90.

961
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,760
Check this out.

962
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,120
It's the old rotating statue from the Universal Monsters Cafe.

963
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,480
They had to put us somewhere.

964
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,920
Yeah, whatever. Yeah.

965
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,080
They had the turntable sitting around.

966
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,120
So I'm here now.

967
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,760
He's just how you guys been?

968
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,440
They could just put they could just change that.

969
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,640
Put that into a bathroom or something.

970
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,960
I have them in one of the stalls.

971
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,680
Hi. Whatever occupied.

972
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,000
Come back later.

973
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,880
Sparkles on the door.

974
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,400
I'm making magic in here.

975
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,960
This is right now.

976
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,320
This room is the brown planet, if you know what I mean.

977
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,480
Then he goes back into the toilet.

978
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,080
You know, it's weird. It smells nice here, too.

979
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,840
It's still got the smell.

980
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,480
Did you have you read about the smell?

981
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,920
I know the smell change.

982
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:57,960
It changed.

983
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,200
You read this? I don't feel great about this.

984
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,200
Supposedly.

985
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,920
And there's a lot of speculation, but the smell is now different.

986
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,920
The classic ET smell is like more of a generic forest smell now.

987
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,960
And I saw speculation that the company who made the original smell went out of

988
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,920
business so they had to find a different smell.

989
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:21,760
We'll just talk to any of the great candle manufacturers across Etsy and other

990
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,840
stores, but they never got the formula just perfect.

991
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,600
Yeah.

992
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,480
So it's not safe to light.

993
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,640
I bet you light enough candles in that place.

994
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,640
The whole thing blows up.

995
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,960
That's going to know what they built that right out of universal.

996
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,600
It does have a relationship with some of those candle manufacturers now.

997
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,800
They do make official stores.

998
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,800
Oh, really?

999
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,920
I don't know which one.

1000
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,560
I don't want to get it wrong because there's a few of them now.

1001
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,520
Oh, really?

1002
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,400
Yeah. Wow.

1003
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,040
I didn't know that at all.

1004
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,360
I haven't seen that out here because I've been up to those stores recently.

1005
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,600
Like those rotating stores.

1006
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,160
Oh, my gosh. We got to look into that.

1007
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,120
Yeah. But yeah.

1008
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,280
So the smell is different.

1009
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,880
So look here, I'm going to play a little clip to get us back into Fievel

1010
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,720
World, which is this is from an ad.

1011
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,480
This is an ad from Hollywood from 1991.

1012
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,800
And this just exemplifies that it was, you know, look, the playground out here was

1013
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:17,280
built for the first movie, but then it's Fievel goes West mania.

1014
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:25,640
And I guess this is the context that then, you know, that propels Fievel into 1992.

1015
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,440
Kids are meeting Fievel face to face because now their movie ticket to Fievel goes west.

1016
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,040
Give them a coupon good for free.

1017
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,600
There's a little that was a little like

1018
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,480
standoff old West style where like close up on kids eyes, close up on Fievel's eyes.

1019
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,520
But then it's nice.

1020
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,840
Then they all run at him and hug him like this.

1021
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,440
Fievel going to shoot you?

1022
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,040
No, he's not.

1023
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,320
I would think that if I saw this.

1024
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,000
Yeah. So Fievel in real life is bad.

1025
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,200
He's mean, not like in the movies.

1026
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,160
And then, you know, and then you see all his friends like,

1027
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:03,240
I don't know, old West can can dancer mouse who no one on this earth could name

1028
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,760
and naming like more than three characters from American Tale.

1029
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,800
I guess that's not true because I can name Tiger

1030
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,280
and I can name Wiley Burp, but I couldn't name Wiley Burp until like three days.

1031
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,240
Is it doesn't she become a can can?

1032
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,360
Oh, that's right. Yes.

1033
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,800
Do you know her name? I do not.

1034
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,800
Yeah. The fan.

1035
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:21,840
I know the mask.

1036
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,200
I don't know names.

1037
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,480
I couldn't have named Katar wall until this till brand of research.

1038
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,800
Let's let me remember what else is in this

1039
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,080
admission to Universal Studios Hollywood.

1040
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,080
They'll see a spectacular new show and

1041
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,080
the magical

1042
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,040
Bible playland.

1043
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,000
So hurry on out, partner.

1044
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:44,120
Isn't that like that's what you think and hope it'll be that it's not just like

1045
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:50,000
I go on a slide that looks like a banana over and over and I have to wait in a line

1046
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,640
when I do it and I have to really get my mom's attention, who's already watched me

1047
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,600
do it nine times, so she would like to not watch.

1048
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,840
She's she doesn't care that I'm going in the banana slide again.

1049
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,640
But in this scenario, in this commercial,

1050
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,680
Fievel and his whole family and lots of other kids are cheering me on.

1051
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,680
I'm the star of Fievel's Playland today.

1052
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,720
Did you see that?

1053
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,520
There's a picture, a promo image of Fievel going on a slide with the kids behind him.

1054
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,640
Yeah, yeah. Yes.

1055
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,280
Uh huh. And he's huge.

1056
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,520
His face is really big.

1057
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,600
Yes. Yeah.

1058
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,720
That face is like this is as wide as four children stacked up.

1059
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,160
That's what you always imagine at any of these places at Chuck E.

1060
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,680
Cheese when they would show the commercial is like you're going to be like

1061
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,440
partying with the characters.

1062
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,320
Yeah. Yeah.

1063
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,320
But it was never disappointment like a Chuck E.

1064
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,840
Cheese would be like maybe the teen on on duty there would like mess with your hat

1065
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:44,440
if you were wearing it and you like not like it, it would be annoying if he didn't

1066
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,040
have like a shift cleaning the bathroom in 10 minutes.

1067
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,280
Right. Yes.

1068
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,320
He would maybe come over and like take your hat off and you'd be like

1069
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,760
uncomfortable and then he would leave.

1070
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,240
What is this? Why is this?

1071
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,480
I want my hat.

1072
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,800
Yeah.

1073
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,880
I mean, but what that looks like magic.

1074
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,160
And I felt some amount of this.

1075
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,640
I liked all the things.

1076
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,160
Do you remember, Jason, do you remember anything

1077
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,880
when you like there's a water slide for sure.

1078
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,960
But was there anything else that's like, oh, there's that thing.

1079
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,280
I would go on this slide or play with that

1080
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,920
in that like dense room of ropes or whatever it was.

1081
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,200
Well, I remember the actual slide.

1082
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,720
They kind of upgraded in Florida.

1083
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,320
It's big cattle skeleton.

1084
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,760
Cool. Like a skull.

1085
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,760
A big skull.

1086
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,960
And then the spine.

1087
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,080
Yeah.

1088
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,400
Right. The spine. You walk up.

1089
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,280
Yeah.

1090
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,440
You walk up a dead animal's spine and then you take a slide down

1091
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,760
the sinister massive skull.

1092
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,720
I

1093
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:47,200
you know, I rewatched a lot of walkthroughs and I remember going through the room

1094
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,800
with like, I'm pretty sure I remember going through the room.

1095
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,080
I may have convinced myself otherwise of the like hanging foam.

1096
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,400
Like, like mini punching bag, little punching bag.

1097
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,440
I know what you call it.

1098
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,160
Yeah.

1099
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,560
Do you think when Spielberg, when this opened, he went up to the top of the

1100
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,120
bleached cow skull, but he wouldn't go down it and he had to be evacuated off at the top?

1101
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,040
He had to walk back down the stairs.

1102
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:11,720
Maybe.

1103
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,480
No, they got people to carry him.

1104
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,680
OK.

1105
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,000
Be careful of this.

1106
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,360
That's a really good inside joke, by the way.

1107
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,640
You know, this

1108
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,160
Jurassic Park ride.

1109
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,560
I remembered the big newspaper.

1110
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,800
Yes.

1111
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,120
Fables Playland open at Universal Studios, it says.

1112
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,680
There's a few jokes, a few things in it that stuck out to me.

1113
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:36,480
One, it's dated July 4th, 1980 or 1892.

1114
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,720
I'm assuming this opened.

1115
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,200
Oh, yeah.

1116
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:39,920
All right.

1117
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,080
The other thing.

1118
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:47,160
I wish I could come here every day, says one child.

1119
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,160
It's very, it's Jason S.

1120
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,480
The there is the sentence.

1121
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,080
And don't forget the live stage shows.

1122
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,600
Universal did forget those live stage shows reasonably quickly.

1123
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,080
I feel like that has not happened in a long time.

1124
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,360
Yeah, I don't know when that stopped in Florida.

1125
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,320
It was a smaller show in Florida.

1126
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,880
It was an opening day thing in Florida.

1127
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,200
I didn't realize it moved.

1128
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,240
It was in San Francisco, which became

1129
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,200
Beetlejuice, which became Fast and Furious.

1130
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:18,920
Yeah.

1131
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,160
But it was smaller than the Hollywood one,

1132
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,560
which had which was like Waterworld size.

1133
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,800
There were big bleachers.

1134
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,600
So you'd like I watched a video.

1135
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,800
I watched a video from 1993 where the bleachers are the third full.

1136
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,240
But the coolest thing, because the characters come down for they arrive

1137
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,600
in America, walking past you go down onto the stage and off in the distance,

1138
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:46,280
you can see construction cranes building our future home city walk.

1139
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,400
Half built city walk a mess like in the movie.

1140
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,920
There's a lot of movies set around like it's the Statue of Liberty,

1141
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,520
but it doesn't have its full face yet.

1142
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,320
Oh, yeah.

1143
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,320
Yeah. It's like seeing the Death Star being built.

1144
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:57,960
Yeah.

1145
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,120
Just knowing the adventures that will come in that.

1146
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,320
Yeah.

1147
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:03,920
Yeah.

1148
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:10,760
The show what the show had that is pretty crazy was this giant tiger tiger.

1149
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,000
The Dom DeLuis voiced cat.

1150
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:19,120
If you don't know these movies, they think and assume in song that there are no cats

1151
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,960
in America, and this is some of the promise that America holds.

1152
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,880
These immigrant mice who come over, who sneak onto a ship and hope for a better

1153
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,840
life at Ellis. They also do Ellis Island, where also there's a thing where they have

1154
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,320
to get their names changed, even though they are mice.

1155
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,080
And this this system need not apply to animals as well.

1156
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,600
But

1157
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,000
so they think there's no cat.

1158
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,520
And then you quickly they do encounter cats and the cats are mostly pretty mean.

1159
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,720
But there is one cat who hangs out with the bad cats, but he's not a bad cat.

1160
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,040
He's nice. He's Dom DeLuis.

1161
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,880
And and he

1162
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:03,520
there's a gigantic version of him in this show that I never knew what it was and how

1163
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,320
it was. I think I thought it was a robot because the proportions are kind of like

1164
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,160
King Kong. It's a lot like King Kong, where it's just like chest up.

1165
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:11,480
Right.

1166
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,400
Like, well, this is a kid friendly version

1167
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,200
of King Kong, which I at the time was probably too afraid to see and go on the

1168
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,920
tramp tour.

1169
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,840
But I didn't know until prepping for this.

1170
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,000
That's a puppet.

1171
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,600
That is a giant puppet, which is incredibly impressive.

1172
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,320
Is it like that stay puff they had in that Ghostbusters show?

1173
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,720
I think that has to be a puppet, too, because it wasn't probably built a robot

1174
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,760
that would stay there.

1175
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,880
But I already don't remember how that was

1176
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:40,320
such several Halloweens ago, and I don't know what it was.

1177
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,040
That's true.

1178
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,840
I think it has to be some sort of puppet.

1179
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:47,120
I mean, there's no way they I don't think they build like robot, like pure robots

1180
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,040
for shows like this.

1181
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:53,080
No, that was a big deal on Broadway when they did the King Kong musical.

1182
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,960
I think they built more of a robot one.

1183
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,000
That's a reason.

1184
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,080
Yeah, it's closed now.

1185
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,280
But I think it was a mix of animatronic and robot.

1186
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:09,600
But like Universal also, I think the creature from the Black Lagoon musical,

1187
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,680
that fucking Nightmare Show,

1188
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,680
that someone was in.

1189
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:16,720
That we know you mean?

1190
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,840
No, you know what it was?

1191
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:22,440
I believe the actor Katrina Lenk, who was doing Company on Broadway,

1192
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,320
who had COVID when I went to go see it, is in a video.

1193
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:31,640
She is the creature from the Black Lagoon musical when she is younger.

1194
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:37,120
Anyway, there was a big creature in that on stage.

1195
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,200
Right. Yeah.

1196
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,920
They did spend some money on that production, which made its folly that much funnier.

1197
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,240
Yeah. Yeah.

1198
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,760
Really inexplicable.

1199
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,560
I don't know what that was about.

1200
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,000
Anyway, this thing, like I saw a diagram of it and it's crazy.

1201
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,160
It has animatronic part like the face has animatronic elements.

1202
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,080
But then there's somebody in the main body turning it.

1203
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,800
And then there's a person in each giant hand and two of the fingers move so it can

1204
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,880
hold stuff, it can hold Fievel. Really insane.

1205
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,160
I remember any iteration of this show.

1206
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,520
I must have seen it in Hollywood and Florida.

1207
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,560
Like really blew me away.

1208
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,040
Like everything you want as a kid of like,

1209
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,720
but the movie I like is coming to life before.

1210
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,880
Like there's nothing of that.

1211
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,640
I always liked the stage shows of Beauty and the Beast or whatever.

1212
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,440
But to me, getting to see a giant tiger

1213
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,600
like blew any of those, any of the Disney ones out of the water.

1214
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,480
Yeah. Were you afraid because it was a big thing in a smallish place?

1215
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,320
I was probably on edge, but no specific memories of being.

1216
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,920
I'm sure I would have been on edge because I was on edge when I thought Shredder

1217
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,720
locked us in the room for the Turtles show, the live Turtles music show.

1218
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,960
Junk. Yeah.

1219
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,400
I was like, the doors are locked.

1220
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,800
And then it was like it was intermission.

1221
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,160
And I was like, wait a minute. We left the doors.

1222
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,160
He told us it was locked.

1223
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,160
Go.

1224
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,840
Boy, we all outsmarted him.

1225
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,800
I think at that point I added another layer.

1226
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,640
He must have meant the outside of the theater doors.

1227
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,680
He's Shredder is no fool.

1228
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,520
There must have been a real plan here.

1229
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,560
Anyway, I liked the show.

1230
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,080
You get all the you get the hits.

1231
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,680
You get No Cats in America.

1232
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,200
You get somewhere out there and you get the other songs, which I

1233
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,200
do not remember nearly as strong.

1234
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,640
Yeah, there's one that's like that's like the West Side Story America,

1235
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,800
but it's not that we're here in America.

1236
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,600
Finally here in America.

1237
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,480
I guess I liked it enough to want to sing it.

1238
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,520
So I don't remember if it's in the movie or not.

1239
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,160
It's like the Neil Diamond song.

1240
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,240
It's kind of like that.

1241
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,520
It's like an impetuous.

1242
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:37,680
On the train.

1243
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,960
Yeah, it's kind of it's between that and West Side Story.

1244
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,520
Solid America song.

1245
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,920
Right.

1246
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,920
And oh, and then there's a lot of pyro.

1247
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:50,880
There's like it's a shocking amount of like so much goes on at the end.

1248
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,440
It ties together both movies.

1249
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,000
It's kind of like they arrive in America and then Fievel says he wants to go west

1250
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,240
and then they go west.

1251
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,400
So you get all of it.

1252
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,680
What happened? Why did Fievel?

1253
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,440
Oh, here's the I mentioned earlier

1254
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,560
poor Don Bluth.

1255
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,280
E.T. blows secretive name out of the water.

1256
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,280
Then what happened?

1257
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,640
Like, all right, this is a hit and maybe we can keep making Fievel movies.

1258
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:19,120
Meanwhile, Katzenberg has showed up on the scene and he's like, not on my watch.

1259
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,240
Disney animation gets back into shape.

1260
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,880
And by the time Fievel to Fievel goes west is ready.

1261
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:30,760
It opens on the same day opposite another animated film called Beauty and the Beast.

1262
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:36,000
And that might have something to do with why Fievel does not loom as large

1263
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,800
in our consciousness as he was.

1264
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,280
That's true.

1265
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,000
That's the bummer.

1266
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:46,040
I was trying to figure out the time range of like, could you have made a Fievel

1267
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:50,280
where he's grown up and fighting in the trenches of World War One?

1268
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,720
Could you have?

1269
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,840
I was trying to figure out what years were the first two supposed to take place?

1270
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,200
Do mice live that long?

1271
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,880
Oh, that's a good point too.

1272
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:02,440
He's sort of a more I was about to say he's more realistic mouse than Mickey,

1273
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,600
but that's maybe not true.

1274
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,160
Maybe you can make it to World War One.

1275
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,520
Yeah, you can make it to World War One.

1276
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,800
You can do it. Dunkirk with.

1277
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,800
Yeah, one single shot with Fievel.

1278
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,440
It's also just the companies that

1279
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,640
it's crazy. I think I'm sure I've said this before, like Toy Story is the best

1280
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:24,120
example of something that it's madness to think about me seeing it in 90.

1281
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,360
What? Five? Yes.

1282
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:29,960
How little I was and how the characters feel new ish to me still.

1283
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:30,800
Yeah. Yeah.

1284
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,600
Like there's no like the the the new Golden Age with Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.

1285
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,720
Like also feels like that.

1286
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:40,960
But I still really think of them as in my childhood, not Toy Story, though.

1287
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:41,360
Yeah.

1288
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:46,360
In some bizarre way where I go, wait a minute, I was 10 when I saw Woody for the first time.

1289
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,040
I know. Yeah, yes.

1290
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,160
The more than half your life ago.

1291
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:51,480
I go, that's not right.

1292
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,440
That isn't right.

1293
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,880
They feel so relevant still to this day.

1294
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,400
And I guess because obviously the sequels have been good and big hits.

1295
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,160
But yeah, I think as opposed to it,

1296
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:06,520
like a Bugs Life is maybe you got to like go back and remember what those characters

1297
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,320
you probably can't name all of them.

1298
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,520
You have a vague sense of it.

1299
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,400
I'm not against.

1300
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:11,960
I like stuff about Bugs Life.

1301
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,040
But yeah, sure.

1302
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,120
But but it's interesting.

1303
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,960
Yeah. With five, like it's interesting how

1304
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:20,880
certain things just like they die off quickly in the public consciousness.

1305
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:26,360
And even though the first one was a hit and we all have something, we all have some

1306
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:30,080
memories of five, but like just wasn't a well-oiled machine.

1307
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,400
Even Disney wasn't doing sequels yet.

1308
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:36,120
So like they took a little while to get it out and then Disney crushed them.

1309
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,960
And yeah, I don't know.

1310
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,600
It was not it wasn't polished yet.

1311
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:47,440
So what clearly, I mean, probably the easier answer is to demolish Fievel's

1312
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,640
Playland as they are going to do because it is very small and flimsy.

1313
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,040
And it will be a day's work.

1314
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,720
But

1315
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,160
you know, if they want to, they have this character, if they want to do anything

1316
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:04,560
with it, I just like, don't we want to see Fievel with very realistic hair?

1317
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,480
That's like we got it right.

1318
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:12,640
Like, clearly we as a culture are demanding to see every character we vaguely

1319
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:16,800
recall from any point in our lives, but with every follicle of hair,

1320
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,840
it's clear as day in a beautiful CGI manner.

1321
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,800
You're not talking about in real real live action.

1322
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,840
I'm not talking about you're talking about

1323
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,640
Fievel made with the modern Warfare 2 engine.

1324
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,320
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

1325
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,520
No. Yeah.

1326
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,760
Beautiful hair.

1327
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:36,920
Fievel.

1328
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,560
Yeah. Yeah.

1329
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:43,720
It's you know, it's what always held Pinocchio back is that like this draw,

1330
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,640
this vague shape of a cat, I don't even know what I guess it's a cat.

1331
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:52,000
But how do I know there aren't thousands and thousands of hairs that are

1332
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:58,480
especially clear if this cat leans up into the camera, which he does in every

1333
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:04,560
single shot, Fievel has not gotten the opportunity to be done to an incredibly

1334
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,680
photorealistic degree.

1335
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:06,600
We owe him that.

1336
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,760
We do owe him that because I want to like him as much as I like honest John in that

1337
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,280
Pinocchio movie. I want him in my face.

1338
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:17,760
You want Fievel looking at you and going, is that even a thing?

1339
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:21,080
Can't Fievel say some modern quips also?

1340
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,320
Can't we add that to his repertoire?

1341
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,720
Fievel doing the TikTok dance like the scary Megan

1342
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,640
robot for the new horror movie.

1343
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,920
I think I know that movie.

1344
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,480
I'll say that. I don't know the dance you're talking about.

1345
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,240
No, she's just doing like with the little kid.

1346
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,800
They're like filming like a dance on their phone.

1347
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,560
And later she's killing people.

1348
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,280
She's doing like a dance again.

1349
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,920
So Fievel will do the TikTok dance.

1350
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,120
Yeah. I mean, why?

1351
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,120
Why not?

1352
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,560
I really I don't know.

1353
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,520
Is the Fableman's? Is there been a premiere yet?

1354
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,480
Can we run up to Spielberg on the red carpet?

1355
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,360
Can we hop the barricade and go on Sir, Sir?

1356
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,120
Realistic fur. He's realistic fur.

1357
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,320
Let me show you on my iPad.

1358
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,280
Realistic fur. Fields of Flanders.

1359
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,400
Modern retelling for modern times.

1360
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,880
I like Jason's notion of let's see the rest of Fievel's life.

1361
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:14,520
Then what happens and like I mean, so does he have to experience history?

1362
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,560
Is the part of the stock market crash?

1363
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,000
Oh, yeah.

1364
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:23,760
Does he get really into spiritualism and like try to con people out of like,

1365
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,040
I can speak to your dead relatives.

1366
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,080
Is that timing starting to work?

1367
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,960
It works out. You know, what year is that start?

1368
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:34,280
That late 1800s, early 1900s.

1369
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,600
When people would start conning people.

1370
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,360
So many people died in the Civil War.

1371
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,760
There were so many people looking for an answer.

1372
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:42,960
Looking for. Yeah.

1373
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,400
So, whoa.

1374
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:50,880
So, so in your your pitch is it's still the Fievel we knew, but he is older.

1375
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,440
He found his calling in America as a sham psychic.

1376
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,800
He's a piece of shit.

1377
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,480
John Edwards style.

1378
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,320
Fievel meets Jamie Loftus's ghost church.

1379
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,360
Like, you know, there's a word with C.

1380
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,720
Is this how Fievel sounds?

1381
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,320
A word C, a name with a C I'm getting.

1382
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:08,440
Is there a C in the name?

1383
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,920
Maybe he's maybe he becomes like the Houdini of mice.

1384
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,120
Maybe he's debunking it.

1385
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:13,800
Debunking.

1386
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,440
He becomes a big showman.

1387
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:16,160
Right.

1388
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:19,000
And yeah, when he dies, he leaves a word with his wife.

1389
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,960
And if any psychic could tell what the word was.

1390
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,080
So we'll show that too.

1391
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:23,920
He'll die.

1392
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,720
But we'll watch him give the word to his wife.

1393
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,040
And then all the psychics try to figure out what the word is.

1394
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,320
And none of them can.

1395
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,800
Fievel prestige with Fievel.

1396
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,120
OK, it's got to be twins.

1397
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,280
No, it's not.

1398
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:36,320
It's got to be twins.

1399
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,920
What does Fievel's voice sound like?

1400
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,480
Like, geez.

1401
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,960
He's like a falsetto.

1402
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,200
We default to this.

1403
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:46,600
And I'm so like we just did an episode about babyland about Cabbage Patch Kids.

1404
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:51,760
And my cab I was aware in the moment, like here's my Cabbage Patch Kid voice.

1405
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:52,760
And it was Mickey.

1406
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,840
Yeah, I think it's something we all got to work on is better and shit because the

1407
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,600
voices fall into a lot of boxes.

1408
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,520
There's a lot of it.

1409
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,800
There's a lot of McGruff.

1410
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,880
Oh, maybe this is a New Year's resolution.

1411
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,200
We're getting towards the end of the year.

1412
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,040
Oh, yeah.

1413
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,880
But we've got to we've got to perfect our voice.

1414
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,520
Griffin, Griffin, will you charge us to do like a one day workshop?

1415
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,280
What you're asking him to do?

1416
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,520
We have to pay Griffin?

1417
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:17,800
Because he's a voice actor.

1418
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,880
He's booked a lot.

1419
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:19,440
I love Griffin.

1420
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,560
I'm not paying Griffin money to make a slightly different voice.

1421
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,560
I just want some tips so I don't always sound like Mickey.

1422
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,160
All right. So Griffin, you've heard it.

1423
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,640
Jason's open up the wallet.

1424
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,840
You can do you're doing a one day seminar.

1425
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,480
Does he do impressions?

1426
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,760
Does he do impressions?

1427
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,440
No, I just mean in the diss and chenis and Masters of the Universe.

1428
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,320
You're saying a variety.

1429
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:41,200
You want more variety of OK, I was thinking Scott was more talking about.

1430
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,920
We need to get our impressions sort of down more specifically.

1431
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,120
Oh, I see. Yeah.

1432
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,760
So let's test it right now.

1433
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,240
Let's here's the I'm going to find a clip of Fievel and everybody's going to try

1434
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,400
to figure out how to do him.

1435
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,760
I think I hope he talks in this so there'll be a lot of wasted time.

1436
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,960
He better not just look sad and start crying

1437
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,640
because I guess we can impersonate Fievel crying.

1438
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,760
You are in mouth.

1439
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,200
I can do it down the way.

1440
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,800
He's just smiling. God damn it.

1441
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,640
He's just smiling.

1442
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:07,640
Oh, you're my.

1443
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,000
I picked your mouth.

1444
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,160
Everyone smile for the microphone.

1445
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:15,200
Eloise voice. Of course, Dom DeLuis is the voice of the Roger Corman produced

1446
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,600
movie Munchy or not much.

1447
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,280
Sure.

1448
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,400
No, not much from the new Ghostbusters.

1449
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,480
Munchy, although it's got a different name.

1450
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:29,280
It's confusing because Munchy 2 is I feel like it's confusing when you look at it

1451
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:32,200
because it's almost like American Tale and Fievel goes west where it's like

1452
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,120
it doesn't sound like the sequel name.

1453
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,040
When did every fucking clip I pull up,

1454
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,120
Fievel is just gesturing and he doesn't talk.

1455
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,400
Does he talk mouse?

1456
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,760
Does he talk at all so we can do an impression of you?

1457
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:43,840
He doesn't talk at all.

1458
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,760
I love the talks.

1459
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:50,000
The soundtrack for the movie for

1460
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:53,040
Fievel goes west in the land is very fun.

1461
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,000
I like that as a kid.

1462
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:54,920
It's very sweeping.

1463
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,960
Yeah, kind of a fun Western Western.

1464
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,160
Munchy. OK, sorry.

1465
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,640
Munchies is the first one and Munchy is the second one.

1466
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,080
OK, so there's a it's it goes.

1467
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:09,320
The opposite like to like, you know, gives the plural like alien aliens.

1468
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,600
It's the reverse.

1469
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,400
This is I'm getting nowhere with this, but we're not going to look.

1470
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,360
We're not going to have a Fievel impression for you today.

1471
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,000
I'm sorry. That's too bad.

1472
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:20,600
Yeah. You could just look up Fievel talks and you would think it would be there.

1473
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,760
I put in Fievel. You think talks is going to help?

1474
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:23,960
Yeah, it talks to it.

1475
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,640
I think that'll be the key word that's missing.

1476
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,680
Well, what this has taught me, actually.

1477
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,080
Oh, well, first of all, you were right.

1478
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,040
And I apologize.

1479
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:36,960
So what it has also taught me is that for wow.

1480
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:40,560
Amazingly, from the YouTube user inspired figment, one little spark.

1481
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:45,560
Wow. What I have learned is that there was a Teddy Ruxpin of Fievel.

1482
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,640
So they do. Wow.

1483
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,840
They did the Teddy Ruxpin thing.

1484
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,960
You put tapes in him and he talks and tells you a story.

1485
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,280
So all right.

1486
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,480
Good job on that. You're right.

1487
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:54,840
Talking Fievel. Here's a clip.

1488
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,280
And if everybody would like to try to do this, here we go.

1489
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,160
All right.

1490
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,200
My name is Fievel Mousquick.

1491
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:05,080
I see that you're ready to hear a story and I have a good one for you.

1492
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:05,800
All right.

1493
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,800
Everybody want to go?

1494
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:08,920
All right.

1495
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:13,720
My name is Fievel Mousquick.

1496
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,120
And I've got a story for you.

1497
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,040
That's great.

1498
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,480
OK.

1499
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:24,720
Hi, my name is Fievel Mousquick and I hear you're ready to hear a story.

1500
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,760
He's a little nerdier than the regular Fievel.

1501
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,040
That's why I got to take one of these voice acting classes.

1502
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,360
I can do like three voice.

1503
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,320
You got to pay Griffin a couple of hundred.

1504
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,400
Just start dropping money in his Venmo.

1505
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,640
Don't say why.

1506
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,600
But I want you to commit and start to get on the book.

1507
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,600
We'll figure it out later.

1508
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:44,240
You know, I just recognize it's a craft.

1509
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,640
It's hard. Everyone I know does voice acting.

1510
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:47,640
My name is Fievel.

1511
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:52,920
Did classes and did like test reel and really had to work at it.

1512
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,080
So I was like, I don't believe this for one second.

1513
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,840
I think it's easy.

1514
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,320
Let's all just start.

1515
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,200
I it's just a thing.

1516
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:07,120
I am I have great admiration for it, you know, and I feel like if I if I really

1517
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:11,360
want to do it, I know I would have to do a lot of work to figure it out.

1518
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,520
I refuse it.

1519
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:16,160
That means you're refusing on this podcast to make your voices better.

1520
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,680
You're using the excuse of that.

1521
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,160
You have to take a class.

1522
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,280
I suppose I don't know where to start.

1523
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:25,400
I should probably just ask Griffin or Justin Michaels.

1524
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,240
I don't think you have to do any of this.

1525
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,240
I just start just try to do different voices.

1526
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,320
That's all I'm saying.

1527
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,280
All right. I don't think you have to do a class.

1528
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,240
I don't know.

1529
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:40,720
You you have auditioned for voice stuff and you've heard other people do it.

1530
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,840
I can just like just do a million of them.

1531
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,240
Not all of them know.

1532
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:46,960
Yeah, not all.

1533
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,360
Some people just do their voice and it's a little more energetic.

1534
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,240
I mean, that's good.

1535
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,400
Some people watch this voice master work.

1536
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,720
Here comes my Fievel.

1537
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:54,800
Here we go. Here we go.

1538
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:58,120
Here comes I'm Fievel Muskowitz.

1539
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,040
Ruff, ruff.

1540
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,480
I want to die.

1541
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:01,480
Why is he barking?

1542
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,000
Take a bite out of an American tail with me.

1543
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,520
Did you say I want to die?

1544
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:06,880
I want to die.

1545
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,480
I know what you said.

1546
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:11,640
I might have said it without realizing it.

1547
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,200
I want to die.

1548
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:13,800
Wow.

1549
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,520
Scott's dark thoughts manifested through a McGruff doing Fievel.

1550
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:19,240
Wow.

1551
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:24,080
Well, I guess that seems like a good sign as any to end the episode.

1552
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,160

All right.

1563
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:51,520
With that being said, I mean, let's just all run through a quick couple more

1564
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,600
impressions real quick.

1565
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,360
Don Deleuze.

1566
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,600
Wait, this said to Don Deleuze, this was not his last movie.

1567
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,520
He lived for a while.

1568
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:04,200
No, I think Munchies came out after this.

1569
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,560
Munchies came out.

1570
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,640
Well, I know also the Munchies came out.

1571
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,400
He's also a troll in Central Park, another Bluth production,

1572
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:16,840
which is something I do an impression of because there's a part where he

1573
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,800
the like the troll is very sad.

1574
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I have nowhere to sleep.

1575
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,440
I just need someone.

1576
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,320
I just need a patch.

1577
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:29,960
And then he puts his magic thumb out and it makes a little tiny bit of grass.

1578
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:34,400
And he says, there's my patch.

1579
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,360
I've been saying there's my patch for years.

1580
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,120
I'll try to find a clip.

1581
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,040
Dom Deleuze, he's dead in 2009.

1582
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,080
He lived. Wow, he lived a long time.

1583
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:43,880
He had time to.

1584
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,480
I was just making sure it wasn't like a buddy hack it.

1585
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:50,280
Jimmy Stewart, like, oh, in this big anime movie with their final role.

1586
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,640
No, no, it gave him a life.

1587
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,000
It gave him another 15 years.

1588
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,360
Yeah,

1589
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,880
we'll do the whole filmography.

1590
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,880
But for now, they'll do it. Bye.

1591
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:58,440
Bye.
