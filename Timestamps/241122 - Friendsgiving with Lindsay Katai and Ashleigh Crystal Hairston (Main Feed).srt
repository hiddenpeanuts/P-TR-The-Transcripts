1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hey, it's Podcast The Ride!

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a theme park podcast with facts that are drier than my family's Thanksgiving turkey.

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You know, you don't want to undercook poultry, it could get real sick.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's why it's all dried out.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's the main thing my mom taught me when I was growing up, is that we have to overcook chicken and turkey, so food-borne illness doesn't kill me.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Sure.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And that's in my head, and it's apparently in your head as well.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It is, yeah. Well, that's why I like dark meat, because, you know, it's so easy.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What do you mean?

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's naturally more moist, like naturally greasier.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So you're saying if you overcook a piece of dark meat, it'll still be juicy?

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It'll still be, yeah, reasonably juicy.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's the extra fat.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Is that true?

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's fattier, yeah.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, there's not much fat in a breast, and so they dry out more.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Wow, really? This is interesting.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Our guests are coming in already.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
A chicken breast, anyway, I don't know about a human breast.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Just a fact Jason shared enough.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He doesn't always have a bear dog.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I appreciate it.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No, I don't often get this.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah, a chicken thigh is a more reliable thing to cook, like a reliably yummy chicken breast.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Usually he'll get the business from me for a while, and then online, the people come to your rescue online.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I think that's why I jumped in.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I wanted to make sure.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Sure.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Justice for Jason.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm a big chicken condiment, so I appreciate that.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Dark meat enjoyer, Jason Sheridan.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
With me as always, dark meat enjoyer, Jason Sheridan.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's true, he has said that on the podcast before, so that is something that the fans know, the listeners know.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's bring the guests in though, so they can talk about turkey as well, fully with their credits.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
These are showrunners, Jason, and head writers.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
On the new, well, on new to Netflix show, Fairly Oddparents, A New Wish.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I've been familiar with them, known them both for years.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Ashley Crystal Harrison and My Love, that's the famous way I introduce her, Lindsay Katai.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Welcome back.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Welcome back to Podcast The Ride, both of you.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Thank you for having us.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes, of course.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
She's also My Love, I should tell you.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, well, that's good, yeah.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You know what?

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You have to say it though in a weird, like, I got made fun of because I said, My Love,

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
like I said in a weird, strange, like-

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Kind of cracked, and my lady love, Lindsay Katai.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I almost said it like Jerry, like nice lady or something.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Nice lady love.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Lindsay Katai.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think you're trying to be nice and sincere, and it just came out.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Squirrel-y.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Story of my life, brother.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Very squirrel-y.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Story of my life.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But they're here, we sent them on a mission, we sent our two guests on a mission, a Thanksgiving-ish

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
mission.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I was about to break out in a cold sweat because I was like, oh my God, what didn't I do for

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
the podcast?

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But we went.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We did go.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay, that's good.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It would be a big reveal if you actually lied to me.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No, that would be really funny.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's just that it was escaping me what we were here to talk about for a second, so when

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
you were like on a mission, I was like, oh no, I messed up.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This is ostensibly a Thanksgiving episode, but Thanksgiving is a little bit harder to

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
find big, specific Thanksgiving stuff in relation to theme parks.

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's here and there, so you really have to look-

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, this fits perfectly, I feel like.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So you look for it and then sometimes stuff will pop, like little temporary stuff, but

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Halloween and Christmas, so much stuff out there.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh my God.

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Over-saturation.

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I would have loved to come on for Halloween.

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I did so much in October.

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh really?

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Anything you want to shout out real quick?

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What's the, it's not called Delusion.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's the one in, it's in an old Burlington factory.

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh, in Buena Park?

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
In where?

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh, in Buena Park.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You did the crazy thing.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
A year, a year, a year, an hour away.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We should have had you want to talk about this.

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It was incredible.

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It was so fun.

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I would put it in my top one place, Tide.

101
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Really?

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Tide, yeah.

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It was tied with my not scary experience.

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Did they shrink wrap you or something?

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I saw a video of this.

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It seemed crazy.

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh my God.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
No, we didn't get shrink wrap, but we got in a claustrophobic, tiny, tiny like bridgeway

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
to connect us into the actual like experience.

110
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The maze.

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah.

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And it was just like the production quality was amazing.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We didn't know what to expect because it's like people who put it together, they're not

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
like, you know, they're not, it's not like, you know, one of the bigger, yeah.

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's not a big theme park.

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Universal Studios theme park.

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah.

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Am I thinking of the wrong, is there, were there like live bugs in it or something?

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Like there's a really intense one that friends of ours have said, no, never again.

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm just trying to make sure it's the same.

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That would be horrifying.

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Is that one downtown?

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Maybe.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You know what?

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm thinking of a different one.

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I think, I think you're probably describing one that's less intense.

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Is Buena Park an hour away?

128
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah, about that.

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Right by Knott's.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And it's in the mall.

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes.

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's in the mall right next to ice cream.

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Right next to ice cream.

135
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Cold Stone Creamery.

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I don't know.

137
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It might be a different one.

138
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There's a couple different Buena Park mall haunts, believe it or not.

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Wow.

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And one which Marissa and Justin both said, no, never again.

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And I looked online and they like, yes.

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And I think there were like live bugs.

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Reign of Terror.

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I think it is Reign of Terror.

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's the one.

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That is the one they said, never again.

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It was great.

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So you loved it.

149
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I loved it.

150
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah, I loved it.

151
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And you do this every year?

152
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah, I do.

153
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah, I have a friend, Patrick McDonald, shout out if he's listening.

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, of course.

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But yeah, we go.

156
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We do like Super Bowl Sunday of Halloween, the Sunday before.

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And we try to pack everything in all day.

158
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Well, next Halloween, maybe we'll send you to do something or.

159
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, you gotta do.

160
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I do the pumpkin run every year in Alhambra.

161
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah.

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's so fun.

163
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's cool.

164
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah.

165
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So yeah, next year, we'll keep that in mind.

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Sure.

167
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Jason also has said, because Jason's not a haunt guy, but he has sort of suggested possibly

168
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
going to one next year.

169
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I think my toes in.

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We're open to haunts these days.

171
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
His little toesies into the pool.

172
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Well, I.

173
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Get those little.

174
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What are you scared of?

175
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm easily startled.

176
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, yeah.

177
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Very easily startled.

178
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
With me as always, the easily startled Jason Sheridan.

179
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The easily startled chicken thigh induces.

180
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
One tart meat.

181
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No, I mean, we did get to talk to people at Knott's once in one or two mazes there.

182
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah.

183
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And you did.

184
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You did one.

185
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I did.

186
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I couldn't remember.

187
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I couldn't remember.

188
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We did.

189
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
OK, you got scared in the maze, but then you also got scared when we were walking through

190
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
a scare zone.

191
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You clung to me also.

192
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh, I mean, the scare zones are in some way scarier.

193
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I agree.

194
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I agree.

195
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
On their knees.

196
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah.

197
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes.

198
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah, they're scary.

199
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm more of a curse.

200
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So like, you know, Universal Studios has the chainsaws, which I thought that was so scary

201
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and not scary.

202
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
They have those sliders.

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The sliders.

204
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's what they are.

205
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh my God.

206
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I hate those sliders.

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Freaked me out so bad.

208
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I had no idea.

209
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Because you don't know if they have control, true control, you know?

210
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And that's my biggest fear is someone losing control at me.

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And they spark and they have the whole milk carton.

212
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And it's loud.

213
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
With the loud bolts in it.

214
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And that's a unnerving sound.

215
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And really my fear with those guys is one of them decides tonight's the night.

216
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes.

217
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't want to think about that.

218
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Because I'm in a position to.

219
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Of course.

220
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But they're all theater kids.

221
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That is comforting.

222
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes, that is very comforting.

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And I do it every year.

224
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's not just some nutball.

225
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
They're fellow theater kids.

226
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Right, they're theater kids.

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I just want to give you a nutball.

228
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
There's some camaraderie there.

229
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes, sure, sure.

230
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Some solidarity.

231
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I should remind myself of that when I'm there, yes.

232
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I was going to like dip my toes in board this year and I was like, all right, I'm going

233
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
to watch a bunch of horror movies around Halloween.

234
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Good.

235
00:08:44,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But we started with kind of an oddball, which is Halloween three season of The Witch.

236
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,440
Oh, that is one.

237
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,580
Which is the one.

238
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,960
Oscar Montoya was telling me and Kelly about that movie.

239
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
People love that.

240
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
One episode of Team Freaks.

241
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
I've actually seen it, yeah.

242
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
Yeah, it's beloved.

243
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,600
It is an interesting movie, but it was also very slow

244
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,360
to the point where Jane fell asleep halfway through

245
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,640
and I'm just sitting there, I'm like very intrigued by it,

246
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,280
but I was like, I gotta read all about this movie.

247
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,600
Like it is interesting, but I was like,

248
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,960
the director must be like a BBC guy.

249
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,840
No, very American.

250
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,680
Wow.

251
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,080
Like the director and the star both went on to be like

252
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,040
horror movie royalty, like they've done so many horror movies.

253
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,600
So was that the only horror movie you watched in October?

254
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,440
Yes.

255
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,200
Oh, then you were totally tapped out by Season of the Witch.

256
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,000
Drop the ball and then the world became horror movies,

257
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,840
so I've not gotten back on it.

258
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,600
That was in November though.

259
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,640
When did you watch Season of the Witch?

260
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,600
October 31st.

261
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,440
October 31st.

262
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,440
October, it was like the 30th, it was really-

263
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,800
You were getting a little bit of a late start there, Jason.

264
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,640
I was, yeah, no.

265
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,960
That's okay, that's okay.

266
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,080
You know, I had a lot going on.

267
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,400
It's like, this year I'm really gonna do it two days before the day.

268
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,240
Two days, we kept putting it off, putting it off, you know.

269
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,920
Horror movie procrastinator, Jason.

270
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,880
Horror movie procrastinator, you know,

271
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,080
we had to finish English teacher,

272
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,080
what we do when the shadows started.

273
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,920
Oh, nice.

274
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,040
As I was saying before the show, Dr. Odyssey,

275
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,880
we went all in on Dr. Odyssey.

276
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Oh yeah, tell us more about this Dr. Odyssey show.

277
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,880
A Dr. Odyssey, it is an ABC drama,

278
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,480
which I didn't know until a couple episodes in

279
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,000
that it is a Ryan Murphy produced show.

280
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,320
Oh my goodness.

281
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,160
Okay.

282
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,720
So it is about a luxury cruise ship.

283
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,560
Wow.

284
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,840
And the medical team on the cruise ship,

285
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,800
led by Dr. Odyssey, Joshua Jackson.

286
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,640
Oh.

287
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,480
What, Joshua Jackson?

288
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,080
The performer who was the original Eliza in Hamilton,

289
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,800
I think, I got her name.

290
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,040
Philippa something.

291
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,880
Yeah.

292
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,720
Good job.

293
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,440
And then the other guy has just been in a million TV shows.

294
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,440
He was in Rain and the show called, I think, Incorporated.

295
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,880
But the captain of the cruise ship is Don Johnson.

296
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,760
Oh, I have seen this advertised.

297
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,320
It is like a new love boat.

298
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,840
Like Tina, Rachel Drasher's guest starred.

299
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,680
Oh wow.

300
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,680
Jason's gonna list every actor that's been on the show

301
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,520
regularly concurrently.

302
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,120
It's like, so the guests.

303
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
Philippa Sue.

304
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,200
Philippa Sue, yeah.

305
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,800
And I forget who else.

306
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,720
There was another really good guest star.

307
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,080
Oh, Margot Martindale.

308
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,720
Oh my God, it's tagline is big deck energy.

309
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,560
No.

310
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,840
No.

311
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,960
This is very different than I was thinking.

312
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,800
Yeah, big deck energy.

313
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,920
Big deck energy.

314
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,280
Jason doesn't wanna talk about theme parks ever again.

315
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,080
He just wants to talk about Dr. Odyssey.

316
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,360
He wants this to be what's got,

317
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,480
this episode is Scott free.

318
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,600
Jason's new Dr. Odyssey podcast.

319
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,760
Dr. Odyssey podcast.

320
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,200
Every episode since Scott's been gone,

321
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,600
I've had to cut 45 minutes of Dr. Odyssey talk

322
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,880
from him just so we can hit a reasonable amount of time.

323
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,040
And that's from episodes of two and a half hours long.

324
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,520
Bethy Squire said the Vulture group chat

325
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,760
was all about Dr. Odyssey.

326
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,600
The Vulture.

327
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,440
You need to get in the Vulture group chat, I think too.

328
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,280
Yeah, I do.

329
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,920
I mean, I love a network television show

330
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,080
that's really just a showcase for guest stars.

331
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,920
Sure.

332
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,040
I fully support this.

333
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,800
And I assure you, it heightens zero to 60 very quickly.

334
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,640
I believe it.

335
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,160
And Joshua Jackson's like secret,

336
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,920
like his motivation is insane.

337
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,360
I gotta check it out. I cannot wait.

338
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,360
He's looking good.

339
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,880
Pacey's looking good.

340
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,720
Pacey's still got it.

341
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,440
Look, he's looking really good.

342
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,280
Don Johnson.

343
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,120
Don Johnson.

344
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,960
Lookin' pretty good too.

345
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,800
Yeah, okay.

346
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,640
Okay.

347
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,480
Hello.

348
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,320
Don Johnson and Joyer, Jason Sheridan.

349
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,120
Phillipa Hsu, still in her prime, so.

350
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,960
Oh, sure.

351
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

352
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,480
Jason pitched this idea that we would rate the attractiveness

353
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,400
of the cast of Dr. Odyssey on today's show,

354
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,040
but I said, no, we're not doing that.

355
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,880
We have to talk about friends giving.

356
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,880
You know I love rating the attractiveness of actors,

357
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,600
male and female alike.

358
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,440
That's right.

359
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,960
You wanna say one through 10.

360
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,800
You love this.

361
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,840
You love that scale.

362
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,680
Yeah.

363
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,520
I love my scale.

364
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,360
I have a thing.

365
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,520
Before we talk about the actual topic though,

366
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,360
we have been sent a gift.

367
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,240
And I thought it was for all of us.

368
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,320
I thought it was for the three hosts of Podcasts, right?

369
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,840
But it was actually just for Jason.

370
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,680
Oh, really?

371
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,520
Oh.

372
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,280
And I was so delighted by this gift.

373
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,120
And especially because, you know,

374
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,320
when this is Thanksgiving, you think of food, it's a lot.

375
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,560
So I felt like this tied in pretty nicely.

376
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,480
But I opened the box just thinking it was a gift

377
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,600
for three of us, but no, no, it's just for you.

378
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,000
And I am gonna give you this gift now

379
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,680
from a listener who's, there's a little note with it,

380
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,600
but here you go, Jason.

381
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,440
This is what you've been gifted right here.

382
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,280
Wow.

383
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,120
That's great.

384
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,960
Oh my God.

385
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,800
It is a hat of a minor league baseball team, I believe.

386
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,160
And it is, is that Scrapple on it?

387
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,200
I think that this is a Scrapple egg and cheese.

388
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,440
What?

389
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,240
This is a Delmarva Scrapple new era hat.

390
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,800
For Podcasts of Rides, Jason Sheridan,

391
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,000
thanks for all the meeteries.

392
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,600
There's a name on there too, in the bill too,

393
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,720
I think you should read, just a thank you.

394
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,960
Thank him on the air, on the top right there.

395
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,400
Top right.

396
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,800
Joseph Brokowski, thank you, Joseph.

397
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,920
Is that a real name?

398
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,240
Don't read his address.

399
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,200
Don't read his address.

400
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,360
Don't read his address.

401
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,200
From Massachusetts.

402
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,560
His name is Brokowski?

403
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,240
Well, you mean like cause of the bro in there

404
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,080
doesn't seem real?

405
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,920
It sounds like a nickname you'd say.

406
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,800
Sorry, it's Borowkowski.

407
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,200
Oh, sorry.

408
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,920
Jason misread it, so.

409
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,560
Ironically, I do have the-

410
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,760
I knew something was up.

411
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,160
Thank you for not sending me

412
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,040
the Reading Fightin' Phil's hot dog hat,

413
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,360
because I have a nearly identical hat

414
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,960
with a big hot dog on it.

415
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,800
Okay.

416
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,560
So, minor league baseball is very fun.

417
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,120
Honestly, I want this hat very badly.

418
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,600
I really like this hat.

419
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,720
We talk about Scrapple, it is an East Coast meat

420
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,320
that I have never come in contact with.

421
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,800
Okay, I was gonna ask.

422
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,960
And Jason has fond memories of it from his youth.

423
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,680
And anytime we have somebody from the East Coast

424
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,640
on the show, we bring Scrapple up,

425
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,360
they understand, they know what it is.

426
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,920
I just, it's not, it was a regional thing.

427
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,680
But now you have Scrapple on your head.

428
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,680
And it delights me that this has been gifted to you.

429
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,800
Well, I now, I have to look up to the,

430
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,560
is it the Delmarva Shorebirds?

431
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,760
Which is, yeah, it's a Maryland minor league team.

432
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,440
I knew about the New Jersey Blue Claws,

433
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,840
which is another, that's a North Jersey.

434
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,480
I think that's another Phillies minor league team.

435
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,480
Okay, so you don't have all your Phillies

436
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,840
minor league teams committed to memory yet.

437
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,480
Well, no, I have the Iron Pig Scrapple.

438
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,280
I remember it.

439
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,560
Oh, so you have a two second Scrapple, yes.

440
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,400
Is there?

441
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,120
If anyone was going to, it would be you.

442
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,240
Absolutely.

443
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,800
Well, here's what I say.

444
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,200
Or anyone in the agreement.

445
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,920
Yeah, here's what I say to the listeners,

446
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,760
keep them coming.

447
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,840
Why stop at two?

448
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,520
Let's get one for each day of the week.

449
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,000
One, you could wear one,

450
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,960
and then you could really coordinate with different outfits.

451
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,800
Yeah.

452
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,320
Are they all only food items?

453
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,280
No, I think a New York team did like

454
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,080
the Brooklyn Seinfelds one year,

455
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,080
and had like one of the, not putty,

456
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,120
it had one of the regular guest stars on.

457
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,960
Okay.

458
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,040
I really appreciate that the minor league teams

459
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,880
have some fun with their names.

460
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,000
Some creativity.

461
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,840
They are able to.

462
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,720
It's like an improv name.

463
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,080
Yeah.

464
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,280
Jason, for Thanksgiving,

465
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,120
have you ever had Scrapple back home

466
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,960
when you would be back home?

467
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,520
No, because maybe in,

468
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,640
well, stuffing, it's usually sausage,

469
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,480
but I don't think ever.

470
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,400
Sausage in your stuffing?

471
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,240
Yeah.

472
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,060
Yeah, that's done.

473
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,900
I've heard of that.

474
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,740
Okay.

475
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,560
Bacon?

476
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,400
That's not how, yeah, I've heard of that.

477
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
I mean, not in my family,

478
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,040
but I've heard of putting sausage in stuffing.

479
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,040
You've heard tell of it.

480
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,960
Yes, exactly.

481
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,960
I feel like we just would have stovetop

482
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,920
that would have maybe a little gravy.

483
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,760
Yeah, we were stovetop.

484
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,280
Yeah.

485
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,640
When it comes to cooking.

486
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,360
Which, you know, you've been there.

487
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,640
I have been there, yes.

488
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,480
Oh, right.

489
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,040
Because we are one another's loves.

490
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,840
We are one another's loves,

491
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
and don't forget it to the listeners.

492
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,800
So anyway, yes, you'll be wearing that.

493
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,360
We'll take a photo and we'll post it to the socials,

494
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,120
and that will inspire.

495
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,160
And then I'm gonna steal it.

496
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,360
Even if 10% of the listeners send you a Scrapple hat,

497
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,200
that's a lot of hats.

498
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,040
That's a lot of hats.

499
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,880
Scrapple hats.

500
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,720
That's a lot of hats.

501
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,560
We're niche popular, but-

502
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,720
Could you explain Scrapple

503
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,280
in a little more detail for Ashley and I?

504
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,600
Because I'm from Reno and then San Diego,

505
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,760
and Ashley's from the Great Pacific Northwest.

506
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,600
Right.

507
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,960
Hmm.

508
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,480
Scrapple is like a loaf.

509
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,320
It is a loaf of-

510
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,680
Oh, that's not what I was expecting.

511
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,600
Meats.

512
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,240
So it's like a spam type creation.

513
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,040
Kind of, yeah, but so you slice it,

514
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,760
and then you put it in a frying pan,

515
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,480
and the edges become crispy,

516
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,720
and the inside is like softer.

517
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,560
Okay.

518
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,800
And it's very salty, obviously.

519
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,640
Like, you go to an East Coast diner,

520
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,680
and you choose bacon, sausage, Scrapple, Italian sausage,

521
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,080
sometimes sweet and hot, pork roll.

522
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,720
Pork roll, that's what I've had.

523
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,560
Yeah.

524
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,400
Pork roll.

525
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,200
In New Jersey, I had it.

526
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,040
There you go.

527
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,920
You've been gifted Scrapple at a live show by listeners, too.

528
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,960
I believe I was also gifted pork roll.

529
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,720
Pork roll, yeah.

530
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,680
So people are whipping meat at him,

531
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,760
and clothing with meat on it.

532
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,600
Wow.

533
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,440
So, yes.

534
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,840
A king.

535
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,240
So yeah, we'll see.

536
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,880
By this time next Thanksgiving,

537
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,560
I hope you have every article of clothing on your body

538
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,800
with a picture of Scrapple on it.

539
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,280
Maybe like a workout pants with Scrapple on the butt

540
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,120
or something.

541
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,960
Yeah.

542
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,040
Instead of juicy, it says crispy.

543
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,880
Yes.

544
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,560
Yeah, oh, yes.

545
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,960
I wanted to say crispy on Jason's butt.

546
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,800
Yeah.

547
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,200
Thank you again to Joseph Borkowski.

548
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,440
I think I've said your name every possible way,

549
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,160
and I apologize, the print is very small.

550
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,840
And I will be calling you Brokowski.

551
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,680
Brokowski.

552
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,520
Brokowski.

553
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,840
Because he's a bro for sending Jason that hat.

554
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,080
Yeah, exactly.

555
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,480
But okay, on to the business at hand,

556
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,720
the Thanksgiving business.

557
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,160
The Friendsgiving business.

558
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,000
Yes.

559
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,160
So the term Friendsgiving is a newish term, I feel like.

560
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,320
Last decade, what, two decades?

561
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,400
Two decades, I'd say.

562
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,280
Okay, fine, I didn't check, so why would I?

563
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,120
You threw it out there.

564
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,960
I did throw it out there.

565
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,780
That's really solid though.

566
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,960
I was just picking one.

567
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,640
And a recent episode where we talked about

568
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,480
the Warner Brothers Lot had started a relationship

569
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,360
with the Warner Brothers Lot in Podcast the Ride,

570
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,200
which is very nice.

571
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,360
Oh my gosh, amazing.

572
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,200
We got invited.

573
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,360
They were all very nice there.

574
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,760
Yeah, everyone.

575
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,320
So they made us aware that there's something

576
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,920
in Warner Brothers Lot called Friendsgiving

577
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,040
that is based on Thanksgiving and the TV show Friends.

578
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,360
Yeah, because Friends is just very known

579
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,240
for its banner Thanksgiving episodes.

580
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,640
Okay, so that was a question

581
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,080
because I've seen maybe one episode of Friends

582
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,080
25 years ago. Thank you, I have two, same.

583
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,560
It was not my show.

584
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,360
They were young and attractive people

585
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,280
in their 20s and whatever, 30s,

586
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,520
and they were like dating.

587
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,840
I wanted none of that.

588
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,440
Not interested, I said.

589
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,940
It is so fascinating to me how the two years

590
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,720
that I have on you made a world of difference

591
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,160
in terms of how we interact with pop culture

592
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,680
because for me, that was the aspiration.

593
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,480
No, but I think you're thinking of it

594
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,200
in terms of like, oh, in a couple of years

595
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,960
then I would be somebody who wanted to watch Friends

596
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,400
and enjoy their lives.

597
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,480
False, I think. That is true.

598
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,880
You just want to be a little boy forever.

599
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,000
I wanted to be a little boy forever

600
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,320
and that's really what it's about.

601
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Like I liked Seinfeld because they were sillier ideas

602
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,440
and bigger comedic ideas and sillier performances.

603
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,880
Whereas I fantasized about being

604
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,400
like a 29 year old psychologist with my own apartment

605
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,240
and I would just like visualize my apartment.

606
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,800
Jerry would have a different girlfriend every episode.

607
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,640
I didn't care about that.

608
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
That was not on my radar.

609
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,200
I was much more into like, oh, wouldn't it be,

610
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,960
if I could be as funny as like Jerry and George talking

611
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
or Kramer.

612
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,040
What if Kramer was my friend?

613
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,880
Yeah. Yes.

614
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,720
That's really what I care about.

615
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,120
I did not, any of the adult stuff, no.

616
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,440
I wanted to be one of the Friends characters.

617
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,480
I wanted to be a little boy,

618
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,360
but as funny as Jason Alexander.

619
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,320
That was my feeling.

620
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,120
So I never watched Friends.

621
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,960
I was not into it.

622
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,800
Jason, you agree with this or you were a Friends boy?

623
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,480
No, I wasn't.

624
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,880
I was just a normal American adolescent who loved Frasier

625
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,480
and just shoot me in Seinfeld.

626
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,800
Okay, but not Friends.

627
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,240
Well, I-

628
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,800
Too cosmopolitan for you?

629
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,200
Well, I just, I remember like some adult cause it well.

630
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,000
Your issue is that they were too youthful

631
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,840
and your issue is that they were too adult.

632
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,720
I was the one going like, more Elliot Gould.

633
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,040
Add him to the Friends.

634
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,880
Exactly.

635
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,000
Add him to the regular cast.

636
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,200
And there are a lot of episodes with Elliot Gould.

637
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,160
There are a lot.

638
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,360
Not enough for me.

639
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,600
Not fair, yeah.

640
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,200
I, at some point in syndication started watching it more.

641
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,960
And I remember my freshman year in college

642
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,560
turning in like a term paper

643
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,120
that I had like pulled an all-nighter on.

644
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,040
And I had like dropped it off

645
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,560
and I was walking back to my dorm and I'm like,

646
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,760
oh, Serious Family of Friends is on today.

647
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,960
I guess I was just so brain dead.

648
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,000
And I was like, I guess I'll go watch some of that.

649
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,840
You know?

650
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,920
Must see TV.

651
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,080
I got caught up at the very end,

652
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,000
which is not that different from my Seinfeld fandom.

653
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,280
But I mean, the very end of Seinfeld,

654
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,440
I think I was about 12, so.

655
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,280
Yeah.

656
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,120
But have you seen all the Friends

657
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,040
or you're just saying you watched the end of it?

658
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,760
I have caught bits and pieces here and there.

659
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,160
I know about the Vegas arc.

660
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,760
By the way, the very end of Seinfeld was 1999.

661
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,920
Whoa.

662
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,440
So, a 99?

663
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,280
98 or 99.

664
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,120
I guess I would have been 14.

665
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,600
So you were a little older than 12, I would think.

666
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,600
Yeah, so I.

667
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Because Green Day's, you know, the graduation-y song.

668
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,880
Time of Your Life.

669
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,720
Time of Your Life.

670
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,560
Good riddance.

671
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,600
Yeah, thank you, good riddance.

672
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,920
1997. I knew it had a different.

673
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,400
Okay, so that was used in the finale.

674
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,560
We played that showing scenes from the tapings of Seinfeld.

675
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,400
So it had to exist.

676
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,720
On Green Day's Nimrod.

677
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,560
After that was released.

678
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,400
How do you know this?

679
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,240
The clip.

680
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,560
Welcome to Podcast Arise.

681
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,400
Oh my God.

682
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,240
In general.

683
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,640
We are really, so I'm not, I don't know,

684
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,520
I'm not a theme park expert, but you break up the television.

685
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,360
Yeah.

686
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,200
And I'm gonna have a lot to say.

687
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,720
Nobody binges like, nobody binges like Lindsay Kate.

688
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,560
That's true.

689
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,400
Yeah.

690
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,220
I'm not joking.

691
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,060
Amazing.

692
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,240
Now, first off, you were both right.

693
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,360
It's called Good Riddance, parentheses,

694
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,200
Time of Your Life.

695
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,040
Time of Your Life, yes.

696
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,880
I know that.

697
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,440
And also that montage was in the clip show

698
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,880
that preceded the.

699
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,720
The finale.

700
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,560
Finale, finale.

701
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,280
I just knew it was played the night of the finale.

702
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,120
It's also in the credits of.

703
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,960
I had a very specific memory of that.

704
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,960
Oh, absolutely.

705
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,800
In Wolverine.

706
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,640
Sure is.

707
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,460
Where they're eulogizing,

708
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,480
they're eulogizing the Fox era of Marvel.

709
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,300
Oh, okay.

710
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,140
And it's hard to tell.

711
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,960
I think it's sincere.

712
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,800
I don't think it's played as a joke.

713
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,040
I think it's pretty funny.

714
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,880
Ashley.

715
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,720
Yes.

716
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,540
You're 90s TV watching.

717
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,380
Oh yeah.

718
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,220
What was it like?

719
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,040
It was.

720
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,880
And did it include friends?

721
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,720
So what happened?

722
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,560
It didn't, you know.

723
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,380
Yeah, yeah.

724
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,220
It's okay.

725
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,060
I was watching like.

726
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,900
Okay, 1998 is one sign for that.

727
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,840
I'll just say that.

728
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,680
Go ahead, Ashley.

729
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,820
I think, like, I love, I knew of friends,

730
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,480
but I think, you know, similar to me.

731
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,580
You know, I was watching the black shows.

732
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,420
Sure, sure.

733
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,640
I was watching Fresh Prince of Bel Air

734
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,640
and Living Single, which we had a good chat about that,

735
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,880
you know, on the.

736
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,720
Yeah, that came up on the tour.

737
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,920
That came up on the tour.

738
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,360
Girlfriend was a big one, which was very similar,

739
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,600
you know, also about friends living life,

740
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,880
trying to make it, you know, in the world.

741
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,920
So those were like my shows.

742
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,720
But I definitely, I mean, I knew friends

743
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,360
and I loved Jennifer Aniston's haircut.

744
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,800
And I, you know, the Rachel.

745
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,400
Yes, exactly.

746
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,800
Yeah.

747
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,600
And I knew all the characters, you know,

748
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,960
and I just wasn't like, you know, I didn't watch.

749
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,280
I didn't sit down and, you know, seek out.

750
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,920
I have to watch friends.

751
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,360
Were you more of like watching, like being like,

752
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,320
oh, this will be my, like, who shows, like,

753
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,000
oh, I'm going to be a young adult soon.

754
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,840
Yeah.

755
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,680
That's fun.

756
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,520
Or were you more like me?

757
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,360
Or like, I want to be Pinocchio.

758
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,320
I'm wishing to be Pinocchio.

759
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,960
Oh no, I wanted the life.

760
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,040
I was like, I want to.

761
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Living Single was according to our tour guide,

762
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,360
the inspiration for Friends.

763
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,200
For Friends, yeah.

764
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,040
Oh, was it?

765
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,520
Which I had heard that before, completely forgot about it.

766
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
Yeah.

767
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,840
Yeah, so Ashley was saying she was watching that.

768
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,760
So she was watching the original Friends.

769
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,960
The proto Friends.

770
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,960
The prototype, yeah.

771
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,800
Wow, okay.

772
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,760
I know, right?

773
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,880
Sure.

774
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,840
So they did, Warner Brothers has done like

775
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,320
these different events over the years.

776
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,640
We've talked about, they did a Horror Nights thing

777
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,360
a couple of years ago, which we bring up all the time

778
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,080
because we didn't do it and I'm so upset.

779
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,680
Like there was an Arkham Asylum maze.

780
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,520
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

781
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,480
And there were a couple other different things

782
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,560
they did in the lot, but they're like,

783
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,440
I feel like they're experimenting on the lot,

784
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,280
which I like.

785
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,120
Yeah.

786
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,560
Yeah, I like, we were talking about that,

787
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,520
how it's nice that they're like injecting like

788
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,800
more events into the tour.

789
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,640
Because I did, they invited me to Batman,

790
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,400
this Batman thing I went to a couple,

791
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,240
like a month or two.

792
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,080
Oh, that's very fun.

793
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,520
And they did stop by that exhibit, really cool.

794
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,120
Yes, the exhibit's really cool.

795
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,040
They got all the costumes.

796
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,000
I think they have the Robin costume he was murdered in

797
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,400
in the Zack Snyder movie.

798
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,240
Oh wow, that's cool.

799
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,960
Which is a little dark.

800
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,400
He's not in, like you never see him,

801
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,040
but I think it's in Batman versus Superman.

802
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,520
You just see Robin's costume and he's like,

803
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,200
Joker has spray painted like something on it or something.

804
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,120
Yeah, so it's really, but then you see the Batmobiles

805
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,000
and that event had like a Batman screening

806
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,560
of the first movie in their big like movie theater.

807
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,560
And we did, we saw some Batman stuff on that.

808
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,400
Yeah, so there's a lot of cool stuff there.

809
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,480
And just, it's nice, if there wasn't enough

810
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,480
theme park stuff near us already, more please.

811
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,320
Yeah, we need it.

812
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,560
More themed experiences.

813
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,400
More themed experiences.

814
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,160
This is Hollywood, this is why people come here.

815
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,320
Like we want to, we want entertainment,

816
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,960
good entertainment, you know?

817
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,360
And also things like around the business of entertainment.

818
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,560
Like people come here to look at the Hollywood,

819
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,560
you know, the stars on the Walk of Fame and all of that.

820
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,120
So it's like, do more around like celebrate the studios,

821
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,120
celebrate the history for tourists to check out and stuff.

822
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,320
Yes.

823
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,520
So I was saying like more studio tours.

824
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,800
So yeah, and it is.

825
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,640
I agree.

826
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,320
Bring back the feud, Betty versus Joan maze.

827
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,160
Yes.

828
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,320
You would live in there if that was still there.

829
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,640
I would live in there.

830
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,840
That's the one maze.

831
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,480
Oh, what, I'm gonna get the name wrong, it's horrible.

832
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,480
Whatever Happened to Baby Jane is a very creepy movie.

833
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,680
What would you,

834
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,760
would you want like a Sunset Boulevard maze?

835
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,720
Like what would be your ultimate like scary maze?

836
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,880
What old movie?

837
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,480
What old Hitchcock?

838
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,520
Like that would, and honestly, as I say,

839
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,040
it's a good idea to do something like this,

840
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,240
like an old movie maze.

841
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,080
Yeah, yeah.

842
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,360
It's not like synergistic in the way they like.

843
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,200
So scary.

844
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,120
Yeah, yeah.

845
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,320
Marnie or something.

846
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,920
The ghost and Mrs. Muir maze.

847
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,920
Rebecca, Claude Rain, like a 20 something playing Claude

848
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,160
Raines in a maze.

849
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,320
Oh, that'd be great.

850
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,200
Yeah, your guy Claude.

851
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,240
I have a Claude figure cause he was the invisible man.

852
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,880
Oh, yeah, of course.

853
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,720
Hell yeah.

854
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,800
I would love a Sunset Boulevard maze.

855
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,480
There's a revival of the musical on Broadway right now.

856
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,560
I don't know that.

857
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,640
I did know that.

858
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,440
And it was in the news recently.

859
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,760
Well, one, because they do a thing

860
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,720
that I'm not crazy about musicals

861
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,600
where they follow an actor with a camera

862
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,400
in the lobby or outside the theater,

863
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,120
which is confusing for Sunset Boulevard.

864
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,160
Don't care for it.

865
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,960
Cause it takes place in Hollywood,

866
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,400
but you're clearly in Times Square walking around.

867
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,880
Yeah, that's confusing.

868
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,640
The Nicole Scherzinger from the Puzzle Cattles

869
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,840
is Norma Desmond in this production.

870
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,360
I know all the stuff going on with her,

871
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,200
but I didn't know it was a musical.

872
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,040
And she was talking about like a truck head.

873
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,560
We don't have to go too far into it, but she knew.

874
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,400
She's a truck.

875
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,040
She's a magnet apparently.

876
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,920
Yeah, I just saw something about that today.

877
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,160
I know all of that,

878
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,640
but I didn't know it was Sunset Boulevard.

879
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,640
And that's where all of our respective interests diverge.

880
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,400
You know about all of the pop culture.

881
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,760
I know all what Nicole Scherzinger is doing at all times.

882
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,120
Yeah, whereas I knew there was a Sunset Boulevard.

883
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,920
She's supposed to be good in it too, right?

884
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,760
Wow.

885
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,880
She is in it and the Patti LuPone

886
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,960
was going to see her in it.

887
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,800
Oh, and there's a whole thing.

888
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,240
Right around the time of that half comment,

889
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,880
everyone's like, did she post about this hat?

890
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,960
Cause she got a frosting reception from Patti LuPone.

891
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,560
That's become a meme recently

892
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,960
where people are posting photos

893
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,000
of people wearing funny hats

894
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,960
and then having her comment under it say,

895
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,080
where did you get that hat?

896
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,080
And I think today we've got an opportunity to make our own.

897
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,320
Yeah, to make our own.

898
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,240
No, well, to make our Photoshop,

899
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,240
Nicole's comment under a picture of Jason

900
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,080
wearing the Scrabble hat.

901
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,600
That's what we're doing today.

902
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,440
Might be the picture.

903
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,360
That's what I saw online.

904
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,920
I saw all those memes and I had no idea

905
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,360
what it was in reference to.

906
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,280
And I've seen nothing about any of this.

907
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,240
I just saw something, something MAGA.

908
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,240
She came out covered, like in the first performance,

909
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,920
she came out to greet the fans covered in blood still.

910
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,160
That was what people were saying.

911
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,040
She came out on the street and she was covered in blood,

912
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,120
not fake blood or whatever.

913
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,040
Okay, interesting.

914
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,480
Okay, now I understand that.

915
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,680
But honestly, a classic movie like Hornets would rule.

916
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,880
That is actually a really good idea.

917
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,920
Now that I say that out loud, that's such a fun idea.

918
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,920
Yeah, cause there's plenty to pull from.

919
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,000
They've always, the last few years,

920
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,400
they've done the Universal Monsters mazes

921
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,600
and they kind of change it up every year.

922
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,440
It always seems to be a big hit.

923
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,960
Yeah, so why not branch out a little?

924
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,800
Go beyond the monsters.

925
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
Well, the monsters are at least,

926
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,480
they're always trying to monetize the monsters

927
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,600
in different ways.

928
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,240
So that's the, you know.

929
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,600
I mean, I understand why I just think that they should.

930
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,840
Well, I agree with you.

931
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,520
But yeah, Warner Brothers, lot's doing like fun stuff

932
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,000
and they are doing an event.

933
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,040
I think it lasts till Thanksgiving-ish time

934
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,160
or whatever this month called Friendsgiving.

935
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,640
Friends X Thanksgiving finally happening

936
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,160
and we sent both of you to do this.

937
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,640
We didn't actually talk about how much I know Friends

938
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,840
cause I only recently, I only recently finished

939
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,120
the entire series up until just like last month.

940
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,920
I had only seen seasons one through four

941
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,880
and I love seasons one through four.

942
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,720
I still love seasons one through four,

943
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,680
but I have seen the other seasons now

944
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,960
and I don't love the other season.

945
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,680
You got through all seasons and I swear to God two weeks.

946
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,520
Yeah, two or three weeks.

947
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,960
Wow.

948
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,720
Because I'm watching while I'm cooking

949
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,520
and I'm watching while I'm breastfeeding

950
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,360
and I'm watching like whenever I'm like doing something else.

951
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,880
Yeah, she's saying it nonchalantly,

952
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,600
but I've never seen anything like it.

953
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,360
I've never seen someone binge like this

954
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,480
and she's binging in all whole new ways.

955
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,120
Like it feels like she goes, she's always like to binge

956
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,760
and that's always been sort of a disagreement

957
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,640
where I'm like, I like to watch one a week.

958
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,840
Yeah, that's how I am.

959
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,680
I'm not a binger.

960
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,920
Nuts, maybe two.

961
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,760
But it almost feels like, you know, in gravity,

962
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,800
if you go close to a black hole, time changes

963
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,960
and somebody ages faster.

964
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,840
It almost feels like she goes towards a black hole

965
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,760
and watches the whole show.

966
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,240
I'm able to binge faster.

967
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,320
Emerges from the kitchen.

968
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
She emerges from the kitchen 10 years older

969
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,040
and she's seen all her friends.

970
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,320
I've seen, yeah, the entirety of something.

971
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,920
Yeah, it's wild.

972
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,840
And you're able to hold that information

973
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,680
is what's fascinating to me.

974
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,480
Oh no, it disappears very quickly.

975
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,320
Oh, okay.

976
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,320
She remembers nothing about the show,

977
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,160
but she watched it all.

978
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,000
I couldn't tell you much about it.

979
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:21,040
Like I've seen The Good Wife in its entirety multiple times.

980
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,560
I could not tell you more than five specific episodes

981
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,520
of the show.

982
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,400
It disappears, but Friends I remember

983
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,760
because I watched it when I was young.

984
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,840
My problem is new memories being forged.

985
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,280
So I remember the first like four seasons or so

986
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,760
of Friends really, really well.

987
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,440
And then I couldn't tell you what happened

988
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,920
in all the ones I only just saw.

989
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,880
I can tell you some of them,

990
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,760
but I also, I have a lot to say about the show

991
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,400
and I know some trivia.

992
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,600
Ooh-hoo.

993
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,120
Well, I'm not gonna ask you the trivia.

994
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,960
Here's what else.

995
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,800
Oh, you're gonna say the trivia.

996
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,640
No, no, no, I'm not gonna just spout off.

997
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,480
You'll learn trivia on the thing as well.

998
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,640
Yeah, because I watched some of the behind the scenes.

999
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,320
We were supposed to have trivia on the show.

1000
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,720
That is one thing we can talk about.

1001
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,120
But I will just say my opinion on Friends

1002
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,000
is the reason the seasons one through four are very good

1003
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,440
is because it's more like a Nora Ephron sitcom

1004
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,040
and then five on it just like turns

1005
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,400
into like the goofiest, broadest sitcom

1006
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,720
you could think of and I don't enjoy that as much.

1007
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,880
The characters become very cartoonish.

1008
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,240
The fat jokes are coming fast and furious.

1009
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,000
They introduce a diverse cast of actors

1010
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,400
only to always have them be either getting

1011
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,240
the short end of the stick or like broken up with.

1012
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,040
I mean, that's like kind of standard

1013
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,360
because like any relationship on the show

1014
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,920
is gonna be a source of comedy,

1015
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,320
but it is sort of like I felt like they,

1016
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,920
like the black characters that they did have on the show

1017
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,160
or just non-white characters they had on the show

1018
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,040
always kind of got screwed over a little bit

1019
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,240
and so that's a critique I have.

1020
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,280
How do they treat Elliot Gould though?

1021
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,120
Fantastic, fantastic.

1022
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,240
Elliot Gould is highly respected,

1023
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,840
a very beloved character on the show.

1024
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,600
Got it, Jason can take a sigh of relief now.

1025
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,280
Breathe easy and then I always wanted Monica

1026
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,720
to end up with Tom Selleck's character, Richard.

1027
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,400
And the fact that she ends up with Chandler

1028
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,360
is still upsetting to me because,

1029
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,400
that's Courtney Cox's character

1030
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,480
and Tom Selleck's character.

1031
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,440
She was dating somebody like 30 years older than her

1032
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,880
and they were great together.

1033
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,720
It was like a really believable couple

1034
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,560
and they're only together for like two thirds of a season,

1035
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,640
but I still am like, she should have married Richard.

1036
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,800
And that inspired your two year age difference.

1037
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,880
The Stembo romance, yes.

1038
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,080
Because Mike wants to be a little boy forever

1039
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,520
and I've been an old woman since I was 10.

1040
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,520
Yeah.

1041
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,360
I love it.

1042
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,200
Ah, my two, my two modes.

1043
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,360
I love that side of it.

1044
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,760
Both little boy and old man.

1045
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,600
Yeah.

1046
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,680
So that's a brief overview of my thoughts on the show,

1047
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,720
which is that I am both a fan and not a fan.

1048
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,560
Okay.

1049
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,120
At the same time.

1050
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,960
Schrodinger's France fan.

1051
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,120
Right, so this was a perfect,

1052
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,520
so when I got this email I was like,

1053
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,480
I know who to send this to.

1054
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,520
Cause I just finished binging.

1055
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,520
Perfect.

1056
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,360
So yeah.

1057
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,200
My black hole binge.

1058
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,320
It's like every, it's like every,

1059
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,160
the Batman thing too, like it's almost kind of,

1060
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,480
they build these things into the normal studio tour,

1061
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,240
which is kind of like the universal train tour

1062
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,400
where you get on the tram and they drive around the lot,

1063
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,120
but then they point out different facts and stuff

1064
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,160
that are specific to whatever the movie or TV show

1065
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,200
your event is based on.

1066
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,000
Like they were showing me like where the Riddler

1067
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,360
in Batman Forever like drops,

1068
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,000
where Jim Carrey drops like invitation off of Wayne Manor.

1069
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,840
And tapes it to the-

1070
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,680
Yeah, we didn't get any of that.

1071
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,520
Yeah.

1072
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,720
Oh, well I got like, he was like,

1073
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,760
this is where Jim Carrey put the invitation

1074
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,040
on the gate at Wayne Manor.

1075
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,160
And I had like chills ran down my body.

1076
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,000
Oh my God, that's cool.

1077
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,960
And then the courthouse from the 60s Batman is there.

1078
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,120
And they were like,

1079
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,480
does anyone want to take a picture?

1080
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
And then like, I was like,

1081
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,160
I don't want to be the guy who puts his hand up first,

1082
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,320
but somebody else, somebody else,

1083
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,720
are you sure nobody wants to?

1084
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,040
No.

1085
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,800
And then finally somebody in front of me put their hand up

1086
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,200
and I go, yeah, oh, I'll do it too, yeah.

1087
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,360
So I have an awkward picture in front of that.

1088
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,800
And then what was weird is that we got off the tram

1089
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,480
and then their friend's couch,

1090
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,320
which I'm sure you've seen the fountain.

1091
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,160
Yeah.

1092
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,480
They have their, everybody want to take a picture

1093
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,280
with the friend's fountain and the couch.

1094
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,520
And it took all my energy not to yell at everybody

1095
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,560
and go, what's wrong with you?

1096
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,200
This is Batman day.

1097
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,560
This is not friend's day.

1098
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,800
That does strike me as strange because-

1099
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,880
It was a Batman event.

1100
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,720
It was a Batman event.

1101
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,880
It's not even a real couch.

1102
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,680
Right, it's not the real friend's couch.

1103
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,920
And they moved the fountain.

1104
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,160
So it's like, why are you at Batman day

1105
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,000
getting more excited about friends?

1106
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,240
I know, and the 60s Batman is one of the best Batmans

1107
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,320
and nobody was paying homage.

1108
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,000
They were not honoring that holy place

1109
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,400
where Adam West ran up to talk to Commissioner Gordon.

1110
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,480
So, and then everybody,

1111
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,080
we waited so long for everybody

1112
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,920
to take their stupid friend's picture.

1113
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,360
Oh God, I bet.

1114
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,160
And I was just like, I was like, I can't believe this.

1115
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,560
And I bet if it was like,

1116
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,320
I bet if it was a Heath Ledger Dark Knight,

1117
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,000
Dark Knight situation where it was like

1118
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,880
something from there that's more recent

1119
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,680
in people's memories and that's their favorite Batman,

1120
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,520
fine, but-

1121
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,280
There is a definite flavor of basic Batman fan

1122
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,920
that is only a fan of the like Christopher Nolan Batman.

1123
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,760
Yeah, you know what I call them?

1124
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,600
Fake fans.

1125
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,200
Fake, fake fans.

1126
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,840
And as we've established recently,

1127
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,480
you don't like fake friends.

1128
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,800
You don't like fake fans.

1129
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,640
I don't like users.

1130
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,040
You don't like thinkers, period.

1131
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,360
I've been using the term users a lot.

1132
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,200
Users?

1133
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,040
I'm using the term users.

1134
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,880
Look, we all have users in our lives, you know.

1135
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,720
Yeah.

1136
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,120
People who take advantage, yeah.

1137
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,960
Yeah, yeah.

1138
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,800
Yeah.

1139
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,440
But yeah, so I was like, oh man, Friends is so popular.

1140
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,240
And then when they, and I saw they were doing this,

1141
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,920
I was like, oh yeah, that makes sense.

1142
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,000
Friends is, I guess, still ultra popular.

1143
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,280
It's one of those shows that-

1144
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,880
Cause like a new generation is discovered.

1145
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,760
Yes, and it's just, you watch nine seasons of it.

1146
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,360
It's like the Office now.

1147
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,600
I'm surprised there's not an Office thing

1148
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,840
like this already. There should be.

1149
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,680
That'd be fun.

1150
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,800
That would be something.

1151
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,800
Does Universal not do show or IP specific tour?

1152
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,360
Well, they're, because that would be-

1153
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,200
Not really.

1154
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,040
Not a tour.

1155
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,860
Universal property.

1156
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,600
They're doing this like fandom nights.

1157
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,440
Oh yeah.

1158
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,280
Coming up.

1159
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,120
Yeah, so that's when they,

1160
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,280
but they're not covering the Office just yet.

1161
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,600
They didn't say they are.

1162
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,400
They're doing Star Trek and Back to the Future.

1163
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,240
Star Trek's not theirs either.

1164
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,080
I mean, that makes more sense.

1165
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,240
Honestly, we've talked about it before.

1166
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,000
An Office something would make a lot of sense for them

1167
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,120
because of how much people love Office.

1168
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,480
A show I have never seen.

1169
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,320
The American Office?

1170
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,140
Of the UK Office,

1171
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,080
I've never watched the American Office.

1172
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,920
Wow.

1173
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,740
Okay.

1174
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,720
It just feels like it's not for me.

1175
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,760
I think I've only watched clips,

1176
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,080
so you're not alone in that.

1177
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,920
Yeah, I've only seen clips.

1178
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,760
That's okay.

1179
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,580
Yeah.

1180
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,960
Something you might learn about me

1181
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,680
is that I don't get references.

1182
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,120
Because I don't watch a lot of things.

1183
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,960
Sure, yeah.

1184
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,680
It was like, when we were working

1185
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,120
on this show though,

1186
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,160
you certainly got enough references.

1187
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,320
Where it didn't feel like,

1188
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,080
oh, so it's not like Ashley's saying it's like,

1189
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,400
Ashley doesn't know anything about pop culture.

1190
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,520
So it feels like you know a lot about pop culture.

1191
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,760
I do know a lot, I should say.

1192
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,640
But in general, like in a broader understanding of it.

1193
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,480
Sure, yeah.

1194
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,840
Yeah, the main stuff I get.

1195
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,240
Is there a show you're watching now

1196
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,440
where you're like, this would be a good event?

1197
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,520
It could be a good.

1198
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,800
Watching currently?

1199
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,640
Sure, yeah.

1200
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,440
No, I'm not watching.

1201
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,640
What am I watching right now?

1202
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,560
I watch pro wrestling,

1203
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,160
that's mostly what I watch at this point.

1204
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
Yeah, that's the only thing you watch consistently.

1205
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,600
And I'm behind too.

1206
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,160
Yeah, yeah.

1207
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,000
It's okay.

1208
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,680
Well, I was going to say Twin Peaks

1209
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,520
would be a fun one to do.

1210
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,320
There are a lot of Twin Peaks things.

1211
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,160
I don't know why that popped in my head

1212
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,240
when we were talking about like,

1213
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,960
what would be a fun maze to do.

1214
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,200
I feel like that would be something

1215
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,800
I would be interested in, right?

1216
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,520
Twin Peaks immersive on a lot.

1217
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,160
Oh my gosh.

1218
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,160
I got the blue rays for my birthday

1219
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,560
and I get to crack it open.

1220
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,400
Cause I was trying.

1221
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Are you scared to do it?

1222
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,560
Are you a little scared?

1223
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,400
I've seen the first season.

1224
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,640
It is a little scary.

1225
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,560
There's a scene in Mulholland Drive

1226
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,160
that is probably the most I've ever been scared

1227
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,240
in a movie, cause it's so startling.

1228
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,080
Which scene?

1229
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,640
The diner, they go behind the diner

1230
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,640
and like a scary man just kind of slides out

1231
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,000
from behind the diner.

1232
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,240
And I saw it like 15 or 16

1233
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,480
and I had to like leave the room and calm down.

1234
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,640
Were you upset because you think the diner

1235
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,440
is such a holy, sacred place?

1236
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,280
Yeah.

1237
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,640
How dare you turn my beloved nation

1238
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,680
into a place of horror.

1239
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,640
And now you can't go into a Johnny Rockets ever again.

1240
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,480
I can't, no.

1241
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,600
Someone might be behind the building

1242
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,440
and startle me.

1243
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,080
No, I was excited.

1244
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,640
I was like, oh, I can blank check

1245
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,160
it's doing the David Lynch series.

1246
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,200
I can follow along.

1247
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,680
I'm already very behind.

1248
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,560
David Lynch.

1249
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,240
So you know how Last Culture East does.

1250
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,440
They ask the question, like,

1251
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,880
when did you realize culture was for you?

1252
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,720
David Lynch is one of those things where it's like,

1253
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,720
I go, that culture is not for me.

1254
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,240
I don't get it.

1255
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,160
I don't get the David Lynch.

1256
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,200
But I'm such an offbeat,

1257
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,640
a lover of offbeat things.

1258
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,320
You would think I'd love him.

1259
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,160
Yeah.

1260
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,000
It's just, I don't, it's not for me.

1261
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,160
It's a little twisted offbeat.

1262
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,600
When I view Twin Peaks as more of a comedy than a drama,

1263
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,000
I enjoyed it more that way.

1264
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,040
But I just don't.

1265
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,080
Yeah.

1266
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,560
There's something I don't get about it and don't love.

1267
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,360
Something's preventing you from binging.

1268
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,240
It's keeping me at arm's length.

1269
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,080
Yeah.

1270
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,320
I tried to, early, early pandemic,

1271
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,880
I was like, oh, we should find a show, Jane.

1272
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,400
We should find a show to watch.

1273
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,840
And we watched the pilot of Twin Peaks.

1274
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:07,280
And I think she was just like, this is very campy.

1275
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,800
And I'm like, well, no, it's not.

1276
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,640
It's moody.

1277
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,480
It's moody.

1278
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,840
But I was like, so I was like,

1279
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,320
maybe we need something lighter.

1280
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,520
So that's when we jumped to

1281
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,000
the very Twin Peaks inspired Riverdale.

1282
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,320
That's true.

1283
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,160
That's true.

1284
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,760
I have seen, I think, all but the last one or two seasons.

1285
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,080
That is another show I have never watched.

1286
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,720
That is a good one to put on while you are doing others.

1287
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,560
That's a binger, yeah.

1288
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,400
That's a doing other things binger.

1289
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,360
That can't be like two, right?

1290
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,600
That is really campy. It's too shiny for me.

1291
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,920
Yeah, it's very shiny.

1292
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,840
I wouldn't be into it.

1293
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,720
I will have somehow finished this show

1294
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,880
by the time we get home.

1295
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,720
Oh, very good.

1296
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,480
Yeah, you won't know.

1297
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,320
It's a magic trick.

1298
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,160
I'm still shocked.

1299
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,520
In a way, the train loves Riverdale.

1300
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,000
The, right, like Owen and Alex and Maddie,

1301
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,520
yeah, the other cartoon.

1302
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,320
Well, I've worked on a few shows, yeah.

1303
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,160
Don't talk about your exes.

1304
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,280
My first job, Infinity Train.

1305
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,200
I'm so sorry.

1306
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,040
You're so right.

1307
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:01,880
They mean nothing to me.

1308
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,720
Thank you.

1309
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,560
I'm just kidding, you guys.

1310
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,400
I love you.

1311
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,240
No, no.

1312
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,240
I'm shocked that Jason likes Riverdale

1313
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,960
because to me, it feels so sacrilegious

1314
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,280
to the original Archie comics.

1315
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,960
Archie comics are so wholesome

1316
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,040
and 50s in Americana.

1317
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,040
But there are so many actual horror Archies out there.

1318
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,880
Well, now there is, yes.

1319
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,000
Now they've expanded it out.

1320
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,320
It's so far removed.

1321
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,040
Yeah, you don't even think of it at the same thing.

1322
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:22,880
Wow.

1323
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,720
Yeah.

1324
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,560
So, and I really-

1325
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,680
Who's the person who posts all the weird Christian Archies

1326
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,200
of the like 70s and 80s?

1327
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,720
There's so many, like, weird Christian centers.

1328
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,720
On, post on what?

1329
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,560
On Twitter?

1330
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,800
On Twitter, yeah, somebody posts a bunch

1331
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,520
of Christian Archie panels.

1332
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,360
Weird.

1333
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,880
That's weird, because there's so many other Archies

1334
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,720
to where I was like,

1335
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,280
this is the most heavy-handed double entendre

1336
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,600
that I've ever seen.

1337
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,800
Archie is very horny, too.

1338
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,640
Yeah.

1339
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,480
That's true.

1340
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,400
This is like a pure phase, or a Puritan phase.

1341
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,600
Yes, there's a, yes, there's a, I don't even know.

1342
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,440
I mean, I read that-

1343
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,280
Who's running it?

1344
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,240
That was as comfortable as I was with being an adult,

1345
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,480
was seeing 16 and 17-year-olds in a comic strip, like, date.

1346
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,320
That was the most romance you could handle,

1347
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,200
was like Archie, Veronica, and Betty.

1348
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,120
And then Cheryl Blossom once in a while.

1349
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:12,960
Right.

1350
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,360
Yeah, when she got thrown into the mix.

1351
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,200
Sure.

1352
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,040
She had red hair.

1353
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,880
She had red hair.

1354
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,600
And then Betty and Veronica would like team up against her.

1355
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,440
Wow.

1356
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,640
Because they had been fighting over Archie for 50 years,

1357
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,160
and now a new 17-year-old came into play.

1358
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,400
Were you not threatened by Midge?

1359
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,640
Midge? No, I liked Midge.

1360
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,480
Okay.

1361
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,300
Midge was always around,

1362
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,120
but Midge was never vying for Archie's affection.

1363
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,040
No, she was pretty locked down with Moose.

1364
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,880
Yeah.

1365
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,920
Well, it's not, Mike wasn't saying he was threatened

1366
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,360
by Cheryl Blossom, he was saying Betty and Veronica.

1367
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,200
Oh, okay.

1368
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,520
No, I, that was none of my business.

1369
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,360
They were up to.

1370
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,280
I was there for Jughead's antics, you know.

1371
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,560
You wanted Archie to make a decision

1372
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,640
and not strengthen these women along.

1373
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,480
Settle down.

1374
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,480
Put a ring on one.

1375
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,880
Yes.

1376
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,960
So let's talk.

1377
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,640
I guess we should talk about Friendsgiving.

1378
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,000
Yeah, so Friendsgiving, we've derailed again.

1379
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,400
Scott is screaming somewhere.

1380
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,040
So yeah, so it starts out basically very similar

1381
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,800
to the Warner Brothers studio tour,

1382
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,280
the traditional tour where you go to the entrance

1383
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,100
for the studio.

1384
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:15,940
Okay, sorry, go ahead.

1385
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:16,780
Cheers.

1386
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,820
Let us set the scene.

1387
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,660
All right, go ahead, yes.

1388
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,620
Let us set the scene.

1389
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,980
We receive our tickets from you.

1390
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:29,980
The tickets say on them, departure window 1030 to 11.

1391
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:30,900
Yes.

1392
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,620
Makes sense to me that I can get there at 1030

1393
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,220
and we'll leave by 11.

1394
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,060
Yes.

1395
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:36,880
Until it begins at 11.

1396
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,740
They left at 1030.

1397
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,580
Oh, really?

1398
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,420
So Ashley and I were.

1399
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,060
And I got there at 1050.

1400
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,900
45-ish.

1401
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,740
At 1045.

1402
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:49,740
At the tour entrance by like 1050 or so.

1403
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:53,600
So luckily, it seems the bulk of what we missed

1404
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,900
was the safety message.

1405
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:55,740
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1406
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,260
And the cool movie in the beginning

1407
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,180
where they take you into that little screening room

1408
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,260
and you watch a little movie.

1409
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:01,420
So we didn't get any of that.

1410
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,180
So I couldn't tell you about the usual start of the tour.

1411
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,580
And then the other issue we ran into

1412
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,500
is this was the first day they were doing Friendsgiving.

1413
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,260
So we want to cut our tour guide some slack

1414
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,300
because he was very nice and he shared a lot of trivia.

1415
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,940
What he forgot to do was a Friends trivia game

1416
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,860
at the start of the tour where they gave away buttons

1417
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,460
that said Friends 30th anniversary.

1418
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,580
Oh, okay.

1419
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:30,020
So I never got to show off all the Friends trivia, I know,

1420
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,260
so we didn't get actually the bulk

1421
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:35,740
of the Friends tour section.

1422
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,580
I see.

1423
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,100
So we basically just got a WB tour

1424
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:42,060
with maybe a few more Friends facts thrown in,

1425
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,020
but it felt like things that they would,

1426
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,780
that they typically show anywhere

1427
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,060
because it seemed what we were talking about

1428
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,420
is it's like whichever tour you get,

1429
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,580
it depends on because there's so much trivia to share.

1430
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,940
There's so many things that have filmed on the lot

1431
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:00,460
that you're gonna get a different tour

1432
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,580
depending on the interests of your tour guide.

1433
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,700
So like our tour guide was a dancer,

1434
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:09,700
so he shared that there was an LMFAO video shot

1435
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:10,900
on the street.

1436
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,540
That he was in, yeah.

1437
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,380
What?

1438
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:17,020
Yeah, it was their most famous song.

1439
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,300
He played one of the zombie dancers.

1440
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,860
Yeah, one of the party rockers.

1441
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,700
Party rockers in my house tonight.

1442
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,060
Just real quick, Jason.

1443
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,300
No, come on.

1444
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,020
A couple months ago, Jason said

1445
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,540
that one of the members of LMFAO had died.

1446
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,860
I swore he had died.

1447
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,300
I thought the uncle had died.

1448
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,100
And he insisted that that was right.

1449
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,060
It was very wrong.

1450
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,540
When I said what, were you thinking of LFO?

1451
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,380
No.

1452
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:46,980
Because two members of LFO have died.

1453
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,300
But no, you said no.

1454
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,620
And we still have not gotten to the bottom

1455
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,460
of why you thought that.

1456
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,980
I have no idea.

1457
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,140
People have thrown theories out online.

1458
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:57,180
There were some other musicians had passed.

1459
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,620
He denied it.

1460
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,460
I was letting them off the hook.

1461
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,820
Because the letters were similar.

1462
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,700
So we still have not gotten to the bottom

1463
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,340
of what you were thinking of.

1464
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,180
No.

1465
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:09,340
Yeah, but listeners have very generously

1466
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,100
thrown out different theories that you've all shot.

1467
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:11,940
You've shot them all down.

1468
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:16,940
I swore I read a news story about it.

1469
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,980
And I either went, oh no, the uncle or oh no, the nephew.

1470
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,060
Is that what they're called?

1471
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:24,900
Oh right.

1472
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,740
No, they're uncle and nephew.

1473
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:27,580
Oh, are they actual family members?

1474
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:28,580
Yeah, there's an uncle and a nephew.

1475
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:29,740
See, I know nothing about them.

1476
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,460
Yeah, anyway, so that's funny

1477
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,500
that he was in the actual music video.

1478
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,620
Yeah, he was one of the party rockers.

1479
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:40,780
So we didn't even get the most friends heavy part

1480
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:44,300
of the tour, which was the trivia game at the start.

1481
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,540
But apparently one of the other tour guides,

1482
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,340
she didn't remember till the last minute.

1483
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,700
So people were thrown off their game

1484
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,940
because it was the first day of leading the Friendsgiving.

1485
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,300
Right, yes.

1486
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,660
So sadly, we cannot comment on what the trivia game

1487
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,780
would have been like.

1488
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,460
I really thought you were gonna say

1489
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,820
they forgot the Thanksgiving meal.

1490
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,500
That was a shame.

1491
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,700
We spent the most time probably at the meal part.

1492
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,740
And we were the last ones to get up and out.

1493
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,580
Wow.

1494
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,900
We didn't realize.

1495
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,380
We were just sitting there talking about Wicked

1496
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,660
because you were going to see this greeting at night.

1497
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,460
And then I looked around and I went, oh,

1498
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,620
we're the only ones here.

1499
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:26,460
Okay.

1500
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,660
And of course, I'm such a slow eater

1501
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,420
that it was largely my fault

1502
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,140
because I was still picking away at the food on my plate,

1503
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,020
which was very good.

1504
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:34,860
Which was great.

1505
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,260
The food was fantastic.

1506
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,460
Gotta give it to them.

1507
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,300
Okay.

1508
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,500
Yeah, we had ham.

1509
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,940
We had all of your Thanksgiving hits

1510
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:45,300
and ham, turkey, mac and cheese.

1511
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,540
Yeah.

1512
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,180
We had biscuit thingies

1513
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:51,900
and all of the food had very like Friends specific names

1514
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,740
for them. Oh, really?

1515
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,460
Do you have a picture or anything of what they were?

1516
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,420
All of the food was a reference to a Thanksgiving food

1517
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,500
that they cooked on the show.

1518
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,740
Oh, that's really good.

1519
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,380
A big, big one.

1520
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,900
This was not at the Thanksgiving meal actually,

1521
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,260
but it was in the Central Perk Cafe

1522
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,900
that they have set up,

1523
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:13,020
was Rachel's trifle dessert

1524
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,780
because in one of the Thanksgiving episodes,

1525
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,380
two of the pages of Monica's cookbook stuck together.

1526
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,100
And so she included a meat layer in her trifle

1527
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:25,780
and they're also desperate to make it

1528
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:29,060
to the end of the meal

1529
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:33,940
because they, see, I just watched it

1530
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,180
and now I can't remember the reason

1531
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,220
for them wanting to make it to the end of the meal.

1532
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,460
But so they're just like eating this meat layer

1533
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,980
in this British dessert.

1534
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,460
Right.

1535
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,300
So they did make that.

1536
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,140
Yeah.

1537
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:46,980
I guess so, yeah.

1538
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:47,820
Right, right, right.

1539
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,620
So that they have available to purchase

1540
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,780
in the Central Perk Cafe,

1541
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:56,780
but they had like a soy something thing.

1542
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,940
I should have taken pictures of all these things,

1543
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,620
but I think they listed it somewhere.

1544
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,340
Oh, I actually got a video of something.

1545
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,180
I got lots of video.

1546
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:07,220
I intend to make a fun reel of our experience,

1547
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,220
but we've got Rachel's buttery biscuits.

1548
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,420
And that's from the show.

1549
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,620
That's from the show.

1550
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,500
So everything is an actual reference

1551
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:18,220
to something made for a Thanksgiving episode on the show.

1552
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,380
Okay, we'd love to see it.

1553
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:20,300
Yeah.

1554
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:24,020
We've got Phoebe sauteed, uh-oh.

1555
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,100
It's like green onions with like garlic,

1556
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:30,260
and she sauteed garlic and toasted almond green beans.

1557
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,100
That might not actually be from the show.

1558
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,500
We've got Ross's lumpy mashed potatoes.

1559
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,340
That is from the show.

1560
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:37,820
So that's an episode where he makes lumpy mashed potatoes.

1561
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,460
That's from the first Thanksgiving episode,

1562
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,580
hence me being able to remember it.

1563
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,140
Their first Thanksgiving,

1564
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,420
none of them want to be at a Friendsgiving.

1565
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,980
They all wanna be doing their usual Thanksgiving activities

1566
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,540
with their families,

1567
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:53,660
but none of them can make it for one reason or another.

1568
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,500
Did Friendsgiving start because of the show Friends?

1569
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,340
Now I'm wondering.

1570
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,180
The name of it?

1571
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,380
Maybe.

1572
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,220
Ooh, interesting.

1573
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,580
I mean, certainly people have been having Thanksgiving meals

1574
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:03,420
with their friends.

1575
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,260
No, not with their friends.

1576
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,100
Only family.

1577
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,460
But it's possible that's why it's called Friendsgiving,

1578
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,460
but I don't think it would,

1579
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:11,500
I don't know that it was ever like marketed heavily

1580
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,420
inside a Friendsgiving episode.

1581
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,060
It was just that like, it got to be a tradition.

1582
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:19,140
They didn't really do like a big Christmas episode,

1583
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:21,800
even though they would do episodes around Christmas,

1584
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,640
but it was their Thanksgiving episodes

1585
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,320
that they were, that the show like really hammered home.

1586
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,320
And their Thanksgiving episodes

1587
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,880
are some of the best episodes of Friends.

1588
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,520
So like in the Ross's Lumpy Mashed Potatoes,

1589
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,440
Monica is a professional chef,

1590
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,360
and so obviously she can make a good batch of mashed potatoes,

1591
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,560
but he insists that they include lumps

1592
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,200
because that's how their mom makes them.

1593
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,760
So that's why Ross's Lumpy Mashed Potatoes.

1594
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,160
So to review, were the mashed potatoes lumpy?

1595
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,320
Or were they like,

1596
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,600
like do you think they effectively recreated it?

1597
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,040
Cause they were still trying to make a good dish.

1598
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,240
So they weren't super lumpy.

1599
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,320
They were really good mashed potatoes.

1600
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,320
They were really, really good.

1601
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,480
Okay, I like hearing you enjoyed them,

1602
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,560
but I don't like that they didn't commit fully.

1603
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,200
Yeah, so there was no meat in the trifle.

1604
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,440
And also, and again, the trifle is just at the cafe.

1605
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,080
It wasn't in the, it wasn't at the Friendsgiving buffet.

1606
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:22,120
They had a pretty mediocre pumpkin pie.

1607
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,800
It like wasn't that outstanding.

1608
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,480
I liked the pumpkin pie, but I'm a pumpkin pie person.

1609
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,320
It was fine.

1610
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,160
There was nothing crazy about it.

1611
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,240
It just wasn't like amazing.

1612
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,080
What did they call it?

1613
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,560
You're very specific in your taste.

1614
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,440
Lindsay is very specific in what she,

1615
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,000
sometimes she'll say like, oh, I don't like this.

1616
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,880
And I will be like, I don't know, it seems fine to me.

1617
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,600
I don't, I hate to be such a man,

1618
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,240
and a dumb husband who's like, I don't know.

1619
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,040
I think it's okay.

1620
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,160
It could be my failing sense of smell.

1621
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,600
So like, maybe I just like,

1622
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,400
wasn't tasting it as fully as other people were.

1623
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,040
But it didn't, it wasn't that flavorful to me.

1624
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,480
Whereas like the cheesy, the buttery,

1625
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,960
cheesy buttery biscuits were really good.

1626
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,800
Really, really yummy.

1627
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,640
Is that from an episode?

1628
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,560
The mac and cheese.

1629
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,920
I think Rachel did make like buttery biscuits.

1630
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,560
I think that is a reference.

1631
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,400
Yeah.

1632
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,240
Oh, those were the buttery biscuits.

1633
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,560
But maybe it was a later episode.

1634
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,400
Or a later season.

1635
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,240
How does it sound?

1636
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,680
I mean, it's making me very hungry.

1637
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,840
And then I look to the side

1638
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,520
and there's a beautiful step, like in cheese.

1639
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,640
Could we, should we be miking your stomach

1640
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,400
during this episode to see if any gurgling is happening?

1641
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,120
I feel like I didn't do a very good job

1642
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,200
prepping for this episode

1643
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,960
because I should have taken down

1644
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,800
what all the names were of their.

1645
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:32,640
Oh, I have them.

1646
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,480
Yeah, she's got them.

1647
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,320
Yeah, yeah.

1648
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,160
We do have every single one?

1649
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,160
Oh, great, okay.

1650
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,480
We got Ross's lumpy mashed potatoes.

1651
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,320
I said that.

1652
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,160
Not that lumpy.

1653
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,280
We got Tribbiani, how you doing mac and cheese.

1654
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,120
Okay.

1655
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,280
That is not from.

1656
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,120
So that's invented.

1657
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,600
Well, that's his catchphrase,

1658
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,040
but it's not in a Thanksgiving episode.

1659
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,160
Joey is too much of a fool to commit the time

1660
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,720
and energy of making a dish.

1661
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,720
Yeah, Monica's making most of the dish.

1662
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,680
Yeah. Right, right.

1663
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,080
But you gotta get each character

1664
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,560
having their own meal, yeah.

1665
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:06,440
So we got Grandma Geller's homemade soyrizo stuffing.

1666
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,400
Okay.

1667
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,320
Okay.

1668
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,520
That one's interesting to me

1669
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,360
because you would think it would be Phoebe the vegetarian

1670
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,040
making the soyrizo dish.

1671
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,240
I would think that, yes.

1672
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,080
I would think that.

1673
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:20,480
We got Joey's sweet candy yams.

1674
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,240
So two Joey dishes.

1675
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,400
Interesting, interesting.

1676
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,200
And I don't think he makes yams for a Thanksgiving.

1677
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,040
Okay.

1678
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,280
Okay. Hold on.

1679
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,120
We got.

1680
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,280
Does he say gams in the show,

1681
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,520
like talking about ladies legs?

1682
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,360
Seems like he would do that, right?

1683
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,200
No.

1684
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,080
He is the ladies man, but he never calls them gams.

1685
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,120
That would be, he wouldn't know what that word means.

1686
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:40,960
He's an idiot.

1687
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,760
I didn't play Joey.

1688
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:43,600
Yeah, Jason.

1689
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,840
If I was in, I probably would have.

1690
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,480
Jason was doing his Joey interpretation.

1691
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,480
When Jason's ranking people's looks,

1692
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,640
he often talks about gams.

1693
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,880
Yeah.

1694
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,160
That's a big part of that, the factoring in.

1695
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,000
Yeah.

1696
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,560
This is, is there any,

1697
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,280
what was that?

1698
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,120
Is there any last one?

1699
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:05,080
The ham, the ham is, well, this is,

1700
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,720
we were on a break, cranberry sauce.

1701
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,720
Right.

1702
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,560
Chandler's honey Dijon glazed country ham.

1703
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,920
Okay.

1704
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,600
Not Chandler ham.

1705
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,880
Chandler famously hates Thanksgiving

1706
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,840
because that's when his parents told him

1707
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,120
they were getting a divorce.

1708
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,480
Oh my gosh.

1709
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,320
Got it.

1710
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,360
So interesting.

1711
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,200
So he would not be making any Thanksgiving dishes.

1712
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,440
Were there any side characters?

1713
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,480
Brad Pitt was in a Thanksgiving episode.

1714
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,040
He was a guest star on the episode

1715
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,760
as a guy who went to high school

1716
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,560
with Monica Ross and Rachel and hated Rachel.

1717
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,000
He and Ross were in the I Hate Rachel Green Club.

1718
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,840
Oh, okay.

1719
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,680
Whoa.

1720
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,640
And the story is that he was chubby in high school

1721
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,960
and Rachel ignored him and now he lost all the weight

1722
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:50,800
in his Brad Pitt.

1723
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,640
Oh, I love that.

1724
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,480
He's 90s Brad Pitt.

1725
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,600
Because he and Jennifer Aniston were an item at the time.

1726
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,440
An item.

1727
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,280
Dang.

1728
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,840
90s Brad Pitt is a 10.

1729
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,680
Don't you think, Jason?

1730
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,720
I mean, I suppose so.

1731
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,560
Yeah.

1732
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,880
10 plus?

1733
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,240
Well, 10 plus once you get to Fight Club.

1734
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,440
I mean, he's got those crazy-

1735
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,280
The crazy abs?

1736
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,360
It would have been around that time.

1737
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,200
Prime Pitt.

1738
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,020
No.

1739
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:12,860
Prime Pitt.

1740
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:13,680
Yeah.

1741
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,520
Yeah, probably around.

1742
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,320
It probably was around that time.

1743
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,280
Did you have an opportunity to go to the fountain

1744
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,680
and the chair and the couch?

1745
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,520
Of course.

1746
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,000
Do you have a photo from that?

1747
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,840
We do.

1748
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,800
Because that feels like the thing.

1749
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,320
Because it's difficult.

1750
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,240
With Batman, there's so many different Batmans.

1751
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,520
Friends was shot on a soundstage, one set.

1752
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,360
Yeah.

1753
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,200
But they have the, from the opening-

1754
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,400
And we did go in the Friends soundstage.

1755
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,240
Oh, you did?

1756
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,080
Named Ford.

1757
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,240
And the Central Perk Cafe.

1758
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,080
And gift shop.

1759
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,920
Because they recreated the Central Perk set

1760
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,240
and now it's there permanently.

1761
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,800
And so we got our photos taken there.

1762
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,640
Yeah.

1763
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,460
Okay.

1764
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,880
Do you feel like, one of the Horror Nights mazes

1765
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,560
at Universal was, I forget which, I always forget what,

1766
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,800
it was, they were using one of the soundstages

1767
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,040
that the original Universal Monsters used,

1768
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,640
one of the original movies.

1769
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,360
And I'm like, it feels kind of like, oh cool,

1770
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,680
it's like haunted or whatever.

1771
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,520
Yeah.

1772
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,040
Going on soundstages is so funny because you're like,

1773
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,620
oh my God, this is where Friends was.

1774
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,500
And then you're like, it's an empty building.

1775
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,340
But it's an entirely different set now.

1776
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,780
I know they just shot a different, a new show,

1777
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,300
a show in here.

1778
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,140
It's been announced.

1779
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,580
Yeah, it's some show called Leanne.

1780
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,420
Yeah.

1781
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,240
Who's on Leanne?

1782
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,080
Jason, you're up on this.

1783
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,780
I'll tell you who, a comedian named Leanne.

1784
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:25,100
Really?

1785
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:28,220
It's a Chuck Lorre show, I believe.

1786
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:29,660
Yeah, it's called Leanne for this comedian.

1787
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,020
Oh my God, I didn't know anything about Leanne.

1788
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,500
She's like the Tennessee grandmama or something like that.

1789
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,180
And I turned to Ashley and I was like,

1790
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:40,100
I bet this comedian is like southern and white

1791
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,100
because I can tell by the set.

1792
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:42,940
Yep.

1793
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:45,300
Because this is like a rich and strong thing.

1794
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:46,900
She Googled it right then.

1795
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:47,740
Wow, okay.

1796
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:49,900
Yeah, Leanne, but I can't remember her last name.

1797
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,240
They have only shot the pilot.

1798
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,080
Yeah.

1799
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,580
Are you sure you're not breaking news here?

1800
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,220
Like as far as- It's possible.

1801
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:58,140
Chuck Lorre is gonna sue Podcasts to Ride?

1802
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:01,020
No, she looked it up and it looked right up.

1803
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,860
I wouldn't even know who this woman was

1804
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,380
if I hadn't found it on Google.

1805
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,980
Chuck Lorre will come to Forever Dog himself.

1806
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:10,340
And choke me out if we are spoiling something

1807
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:11,180
about one of his shows.

1808
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:12,380
I will say, I may be giving it away

1809
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,180
that it is called Leanne.

1810
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:17,900
Because online it is just, I think the untitled,

1811
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:18,720
blah, blah, blah.

1812
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:22,700
Or comedian Leanne so-and-so shooting a sitcom

1813
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,620
with Chuck Lorre or something.

1814
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,500
We don't know, it might not be called Leanne.

1815
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,700
It just could be a, you know.

1816
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,500
No, it's definitely called Leanne.

1817
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:34,820
I'm not giving myself any out.

1818
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:38,620
It's on all of the little car stoppers

1819
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:40,940
at parking lots, parking spots and stuff.

1820
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:44,060
Jason, if you could bring in one of those leather saps

1821
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:49,060
that an English hooligan would have in the 1930s.

1822
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,380
The thing to hit a guy in the back of the head.

1823
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,420
Because Chuck Lorre is going to come in here

1824
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,020
and try to kill me for this week.

1825
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:56,860
Oh.

1826
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:59,640
So you want me to hide in the corner

1827
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,260
and sucker punch him, basically?

1828
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,340
I don't think I've given anything away,

1829
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:05,860
but we were told we're not allowed to take pictures.

1830
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:06,680
Okay.

1831
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,520
So I won't describe.

1832
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,780
If they're telling you about it on the studio tour,

1833
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:10,620
I'm assuming it's.

1834
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:11,940
There is a couch.

1835
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:12,780
There is a fridge.

1836
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:13,620
There's a kitchen.

1837
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:14,700
There's a kitchen.

1838
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,140
I was doing this Batman tour

1839
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,700
and there was all these Teslas parked there

1840
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,100
and somebody asked about them and somebody was like,

1841
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,620
ah, I don't know what you're talking about.

1842
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:21,940
And then three weeks later,

1843
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:24,460
the big Tesla unveiling happened at Warner Brothers Live.

1844
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:25,300
Whoa.

1845
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,980
But I saw the guy be like, oh yeah, I can't tell you.

1846
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:28,820
Dang.

1847
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,220
And honestly, I was like, duh,

1848
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:31,340
I don't know what he's talking about.

1849
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:32,220
Of course that makes sense.

1850
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,060
There was some Teslas,

1851
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,860
but I almost thought it was something else.

1852
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,500
I didn't put two and two together at the time.

1853
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,820
Oh, I actually do know who this comedian is.

1854
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:42,100
Right now, I may have given something away.

1855
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:45,460
It says Untitled Leanne Morgan Project on IMDB.

1856
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:46,300
Well.

1857
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,140
You could have given away the working title.

1858
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:48,980
We should just post it.

1859
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:49,820
That's what she was saying.

1860
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:51,500
I think it's the working title.

1861
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,020
Grandmother's life is upended

1862
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,580
when her husband leaves her after 33 years of marriage.

1863
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:58,260
She navigates this new chapter with the help of her family,

1864
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:01,060
grace, dignity, and jello salad.

1865
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,180
Wow.

1866
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:03,980
This is gonna go for 15 years.

1867
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:08,980
I've seen this woman stand up before, I'm realizing.

1868
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:13,500
This character seems like she should take a trip

1869
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:16,300
aboard the luxury cruise ship, The Odyssey.

1870
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,140
Wow.

1871
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,060
Wow.

1872
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,300
So you did get to go, that is cool

1873
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,540
because you got to go on the soundstage.

1874
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:25,620
But yeah, they don't have it fully recreated.

1875
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:27,780
There's a little version of it on the tour,

1876
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:28,620
which is cool.

1877
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:29,460
Yes.

1878
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:30,620
But then that's, yeah, that's the same area

1879
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:31,460
where you can do.

1880
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:34,620
Because I went on the tour, what did we figure out?

1881
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:35,460
2016.

1882
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:38,140
2016 was the last time I did the Warner Brothers tour.

1883
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,860
And it's one of my favorites, but it had been a while.

1884
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:43,580
But I visited that and you were able to walk around

1885
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:45,020
and interact with things

1886
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:46,620
and you're not able to do that anymore.

1887
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,940
So that was kind of a bummer.

1888
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,060
Had a bunch of pictures over at the counter

1889
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:50,900
of Central Perth.

1890
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,340
Yeah, there was a lot of props.

1891
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:56,500
Now you wait in a line, there's a rope, they let you in.

1892
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,140
There's a professional photographer.

1893
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:00,660
You have to buy your photos from them if you want them.

1894
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:03,060
They do take photos of you with your own phone as well.

1895
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:05,620
And a previous podcast, the Riot episode

1896
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:08,820
about Warner Brothers, Lamar Woods, who was on the episode

1897
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:11,900
is the one who set all of that up.

1898
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:12,740
Okay.

1899
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:13,580
He worked for the company.

1900
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,860
Oh, he made it so you can't wander around?

1901
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:16,700
Lamar.

1902
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:18,540
I don't know that he made what you're talking about.

1903
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:19,460
How dare you?

1904
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:20,660
That might've been after the fact

1905
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:23,140
because I think he quickly had to leave the job.

1906
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:27,300
But he's the one, his team set up the whole new version

1907
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,740
of the photo experience there.

1908
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:32,180
He hired people, he got them moving.

1909
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:34,020
They had a really stressful stress test.

1910
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:38,420
It was very professional, very streamlined.

1911
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,980
Yeah, so I compliment him on that,

1912
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,500
but I didn't get as full of an experience

1913
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,740
as Ashley got back in 2016.

1914
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:48,220
That might not, Lamar might have nothing to do with that.

1915
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:49,060
I'm sure he doesn't.

1916
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:50,900
They specifically hired him to make it.

1917
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:51,740
No, no, I'll text him.

1918
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:52,580
Did you text Lamar?

1919
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,980
Send him a very stern text.

1920
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:57,940
Lindsay would like to wander.

1921
01:04:57,980 --> 01:04:59,860
But yeah, if you listeners have not heard that,

1922
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:01,340
go back and it's fascinating.

1923
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:02,180
He had to go to Orlando.

1924
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:04,420
Lindsay wanted to pretend she worked at Central Fire

1925
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:06,780
instead of just sitting on this very farm.

1926
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:09,820
Yeah, yeah, he had to go to Orlando and train.

1927
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:10,660
What?

1928
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:11,500
He got poached?

1929
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,500
He worked at Madame Tussauds,

1930
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:18,500
and then the company behind the photo technology

1931
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:24,140
then approached him to open up the new photo experience

1932
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:25,460
at the Wyrmbrothers lot.

1933
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:26,300
That is so funny.

1934
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,180
He had to go to Orlando or the area, like Florida area.

1935
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:31,660
He's like a professional Q guy now.

1936
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:33,180
Kind of, yeah, but not now.

1937
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:35,300
But then he opened that up and there was a whole,

1938
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,060
he tells a story of course better.

1939
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:39,540
He opened it up and then immediately got staffed.

1940
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:41,620
Yes, he immediately got like a TV job.

1941
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,020
Yeah. Wow.

1942
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:44,820
It seemed like a stressful couple of days

1943
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:46,980
when it opened initially.

1944
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:47,820
So yeah, that's it.

1945
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:48,660
I love that.

1946
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,580
It was running very smoothly when we were there.

1947
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:54,580
So excellent work, Lamar, even though it wasn't as fun.

1948
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,420
Yeah, it's cool,

1949
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:58,220
because they had cameras set up, like multi-cam.

1950
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:00,660
So while you're in line, you feel like,

1951
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:03,140
or you can look at how it looks on the set

1952
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:04,620
when you are taking your pictures.

1953
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:06,700
Yeah, it's kind of fun to see.

1954
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,860
I saw, I don't know if I've talked about this before,

1955
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:12,980
but in college, I went to a couple TV tapings

1956
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,820
on the Wyrmbrothers lot.

1957
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:19,820
Because one of them, they gave the group,

1958
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:23,860
they like got, they booked groups,

1959
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:25,220
like school groups and stuff

1960
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:27,660
to fill out the studio audience sometimes.

1961
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:31,540
And the one time, if we went and watched this taping,

1962
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:34,780
we could get a discount at Disneyland tickets.

1963
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:37,460
So yeah, of course I went to that taping.

1964
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,780
The other time, I think,

1965
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:42,700
maybe we got some discounted tickets,

1966
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:45,220
but we mostly got class credit

1967
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:47,300
for going to a taping of- To a TV taping.

1968
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,580
The New Adventures of Old Christine.

1969
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:51,540
Really, that was sort of popular.

1970
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,980
Yeah, Joel and Lee Dreyfuss, and-

1971
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:57,340
They needed to force people to go to that?

1972
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:00,460
The guy from the Shield, from the Shield TV-

1973
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:03,700
Not force, but you gotta pull from a wide range of,

1974
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,060
cause like you start running out of people and-

1975
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,540
Yeah, it's like tourist groups, yeah.

1976
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:11,740
But the, oh God, what's the guy from the Marvel movie?

1977
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:13,540
Yeah, Clark Gregg.

1978
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:15,020
He was- Agent Coulson?

1979
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:17,020
Agent Coulson, yeah.

1980
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:19,580
And then another, the other day we went,

1981
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:21,740
it was called The Class.

1982
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:22,580
That only lasted one set.

1983
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,780
I remember that show, not very good at all.

1984
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:26,620
Yeah.

1985
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:28,380
Was trying to be like a new friends.

1986
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:29,420
Yes.

1987
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,780
Writing not so great.

1988
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:34,100
So- And did you like that?

1989
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,820
Yeah, I liked seeing how it was done.

1990
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:40,820
I did not like seeing lines done over and over

1991
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:46,820
and then all the alt lines, you know, about alt jokes.

1992
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:52,940
But yeah, I think hour three, I was about ready to leave.

1993
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:57,980
But we had to stay like three or four hours, I think,

1994
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:02,620
to get our discounted ticket prices or get our class credit.

1995
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,460
It was like-

1996
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:05,300
So you had, you needed to be incentivized to do it.

1997
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:07,300
That one was actually also David Crane

1998
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:08,580
who created Friends.

1999
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:09,420
Yes.

2000
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:10,500
The Class was.

2001
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:11,340
Wow.

2002
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:13,820
And there was- Not still having the juice, yeah.

2003
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:14,900
Was there an actor-

2004
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:15,740
Lizzie Kaplan was in that.

2005
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:17,380
Lizzie Kaplan was in that.

2006
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:19,580
And Jon Bernthal?

2007
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:20,660
The Punisher?

2008
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:21,500
Yeah.

2009
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,420
TV's The Punisher?

2010
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:23,260
Yes.

2011
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:24,100
Oh my gosh.

2012
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,700
TV's the, yeah, actually a bunch of people, great casting.

2013
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:28,540
Yeah.

2014
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:29,380
So I don't know why-

2015
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:30,220
It was a very good cast for us, yeah.

2016
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:31,060
Like I said, it was the writing.

2017
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:32,900
It was like the jokes were nothing

2018
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:36,300
and the laughter sounded canned.

2019
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:40,620
But I'm sure that taping stage was used

2020
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:42,620
for like Friends or Frasier or something.

2021
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,100
Well, as I said many times, the Warner Brothers lot,

2022
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,500
you will go there and you'll see on the wall a plaque.

2023
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:47,500
Jason Ritter, wasn't it?

2024
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,340
My God.

2025
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,180
Jason Ritter.

2026
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:50,020
Jason Ritter.

2027
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:50,860
I mean, we're talking about Andrea Anders.

2028
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,180
How many more names will we see today?

2029
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:55,980
Jon Bernthal, Lizzie Kaplan, Jesse Tyler Ferguson.

2030
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:57,060
My family's Jesse Tyler Ferguson?

2031
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:58,380
Heather Golden-Hernes.

2032
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:59,700
Oh my gosh.

2033
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:04,180
Sean Maguire, Jason Ritter, Lucy Punch for God's sake.

2034
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:05,660
Yeah, this should have been a hit.

2035
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:06,500
Sam Harris.

2036
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:07,340
It should have been a hit.

2037
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:09,940
I mean, fantastic casting created by David Crane.

2038
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:10,780
Oh my God.

2039
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:11,620
What went wrong?

2040
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,460
Is that a picture from the experience?

2041
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:14,300
Yeah.

2042
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:16,180
I want to hear more names from this show.

2043
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:18,020
Wow, it's a whole class.

2044
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:20,540
I want to hear more about how Jason graduated college.

2045
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:21,380
A whole class.

2046
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:23,500
I need more of how he got his credits.

2047
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,900
We need more of it.

2048
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:27,900
I did on the tour, after we left the Leanne set,

2049
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:31,860
I asked, did James Burroughs, is he directing Leanne?

2050
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:33,860
And the tour guide didn't have an answer for me.

2051
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:36,580
And I was like, my question is friends related

2052
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:41,580
because I noticed that there was a like a pillar

2053
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:43,460
in the middle of the set,

2054
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,980
breaking up the kitchen from the living room,

2055
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:50,980
which James Burroughs insisted there be like a pillar

2056
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:54,660
in the middle of Monica and Rachel's apartment set

2057
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:55,660
because he thought it made

2058
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:58,780
for a more dynamic looking stage picture.

2059
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:01,180
And they got rid of it after season two.

2060
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:02,700
Look, he got Jimmy Burroughs.

2061
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:03,540
You got Jimmy Burroughs.

2062
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:07,100
He's one of the top moment camp directors of all time.

2063
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,580
Jimmy Burroughs is the master.

2064
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:09,860
I guess he directed the class.

2065
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:13,980
He's still going, Jimmy Burroughs, I heard the anecdote.

2066
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:16,020
He took the friends cast out and he said,

2067
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:18,340
like they went to Vegas and he said,

2068
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:20,220
this is the last time you're gonna be able to walk around

2069
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:21,540
as normal people.

2070
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:22,860
Your lives are gonna change.

2071
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:24,580
This is how this guy's been in the game so long.

2072
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:25,420
He knew.

2073
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,580
He knew friends was going to blow up.

2074
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:28,500
He's still around.

2075
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,460
He's in his eighties.

2076
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:30,300
He's still doing it.

2077
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:31,180
I think he's in his eighties.

2078
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:33,740
Ironically, he's great on the comeback

2079
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,860
as the director of the fake show

2080
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:38,180
that Lisa Kudrow's character is starting on.

2081
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:39,700
We have not talked enough about Jimmy.

2082
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:41,380
They call him Jimmy sometimes.

2083
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:43,180
We don't know him personally.

2084
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:45,300
I love, if we ever do video again,

2085
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,740
I'd love Jimmy Burroughs to direct our podcast video.

2086
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:48,580
That would be great.

2087
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:50,900
If I don't work with Jimmy Burroughs

2088
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:53,980
before he leaves this plane, I will be so upset.

2089
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:54,820
Is that true?

2090
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:55,660
Yeah.

2091
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:56,480
Wow.

2092
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,320
He actually is.

2093
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,780
He's a fucking king.

2094
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:00,300
He's a sitcoms.

2095
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,500
Yeah, I would love to work with James Burroughs.

2096
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:03,820
Let's find his address.

2097
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:04,660
Let's dox him.

2098
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:05,500
Yeah.

2099
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,140
I would love to create a good sitcom

2100
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:09,860
but very hard.

2101
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:12,900
I think a good sitcom is the hardest thing to write.

2102
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:13,740
Sure.

2103
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:16,100
I think it is easy.

2104
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:19,180
I think that it would be easy to do it.

2105
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:20,180
I could do it tomorrow.

2106
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:22,020
If somebody would give me a chance, I could do it.

2107
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,820
I dare you to make a good sitcom.

2108
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:24,660
I will.

2109
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:26,820
Lindsay, do you mean specifically a three camera?

2110
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:28,820
I mean specifically a multi-cam sitcom.

2111
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:29,660
All this time.

2112
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,140
Yes, classic style.

2113
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:34,700
Yeah, classic live studio audience sitcom,

2114
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,220
I think, is the hardest thing to make.

2115
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:37,220
And that's why there isn't a-

2116
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,940
It hasn't been a truly great one.

2117
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:40,780
In a while.

2118
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:44,180
It's like Stephen King, I believe, says that

2119
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:49,180
short stories are the hardest, like book format, right?

2120
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:50,780
Like very difficult.

2121
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:52,260
Well, maybe it was just because of

2122
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,260
how much coke he was on back in the day.

2123
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:55,100
It could have been.

2124
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:57,820
He couldn't stop himself.

2125
01:11:57,820 --> 01:12:00,100
That's how Jimmy Burroughs is so good at directing TV.

2126
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,660
He's a big coke user.

2127
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:04,100
To joke, I'm joking.

2128
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:06,100
I don't know about his cocaine use.

2129
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:06,980
Maybe not.

2130
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:07,820
Parody.

2131
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:08,660
Parody.

2132
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:09,480
Parody.

2133
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,320
Jokes, jokes, jokes.

2134
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,340
Chuck Lorre is gonna be after me

2135
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,460
and fucking Jimmy Burroughs is gonna come in here

2136
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:14,300
forever, dog, kick the door down.

2137
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:17,340
You've angered all of sitcom royalty.

2138
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,220
You're gonna get your ass roasted

2139
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:22,260
in one of those Chuck Lorre credit cards

2140
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:23,100
at the end of the episode.

2141
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,260
Chuck, I love the Ninja Turtles theme.

2142
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,860
What if I watched the class now and I loved it?

2143
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:29,820
Our daughter, Lindsay and I's daughter,

2144
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:31,660
sings the Ninja Turtles theme.

2145
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:35,460
Look at little baby Jesse Tyler Ferguson in this show.

2146
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:36,460
No more Jesse Tyler Ferguson.

2147
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:38,740
I'm sorry, I'm obsessed with looking at the class.

2148
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:39,580
He does improv.

2149
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:40,420
God has entered my body now.

2150
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:41,260
I have to be on topic.

2151
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:42,580
Look at little baby Joe Bernthal.

2152
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:43,860
Wow.

2153
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,020
What are they, 20?

2154
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:45,860
Babies.

2155
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:47,420
Yeah, they're like 20 something.

2156
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:49,220
If the show was about young people

2157
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:50,540
and I don't wanna hear about it.

2158
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:53,780
It just proves you gotta have longevity in this business.

2159
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:57,700
I do remember some adult cousins at a party

2160
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:01,500
and they had just married and moved into a house

2161
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:04,420
and they specifically had a lot of friend stuff

2162
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:07,260
and I'm like 10 or 11.

2163
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:10,660
I was like, this is a grownup show.

2164
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,780
I can't wait to move to a city

2165
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:16,580
where a lot of oversized open button-ups

2166
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:18,980
like Joey and Chandler wear.

2167
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:20,220
Bowling shirts.

2168
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:22,580
It was a ball,

2169
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:24,460
but didn't Chandler do a lot of bowling shirts?

2170
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:25,580
He did a few bowling shirts this time, I believe.

2171
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:26,780
I know Drew Carey's,

2172
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:28,900
all the clothing on Drew Carey's show

2173
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:29,860
was like bowling shirts,

2174
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:33,180
but I feel like Chandler had sort of button-up.

2175
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:35,380
That was generally his style though.

2176
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:36,220
That was a very 90s.

2177
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:39,300
That was a Smash Mouth type dressing.

2178
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,180
That was very 95, 96.

2179
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:43,100
Yes, 96, walking on the sun.

2180
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,940
96, 97, I think it's 97.

2181
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:48,020
We went through the whole Friends gift shop area

2182
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:50,900
and I just couldn't have wanted to own anything less.

2183
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,220
Yeah, we were like, what?

2184
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:54,420
Which is like, it's not that it's bad stuff.

2185
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:57,740
It's just that I'm not the kind of Friends fan

2186
01:13:57,740 --> 01:14:00,260
where I'm like, I want merch in my house.

2187
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,340
I want a cookie, an oven mitt.

2188
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:04,060
Yeah, that's Friends.

2189
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:06,660
I want a shirt that says, we were on a break.

2190
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:09,700
There's nothing I'd rather own less than I can think of

2191
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,140
than a shirt that says, we were on a break

2192
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:14,380
in the year of our Lord, 2024.

2193
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:16,980
I like the logo.

2194
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:19,860
I feel like it's a very iconic logo.

2195
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:20,820
I was telling Ashley,

2196
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:23,580
I think I had a Friends shirt back in the day.

2197
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:28,340
Or it was one of those parody shirts

2198
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:31,740
that were popular in the mid to late 90s

2199
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,500
where it looked like the Friends logo,

2200
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:34,580
but said something else.

2201
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:36,420
But it said something else, yeah.

2202
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:40,740
Like I had a shirt that was in a FedEx logo,

2203
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:43,940
but it said Fed Up and I was like, 15.

2204
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:46,780
I feel like I've seen a picture

2205
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:49,140
of Anne Hathaway wearing that shirt.

2206
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:51,100
Maybe, that does sound familiar to me.

2207
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,740
I think I've seen a picture of Anne Hathaway.

2208
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:58,740
I had like at least three logo parody shirts at this age.

2209
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:00,540
I had no fashion sense.

2210
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:02,540
I was desperately trying to figure out

2211
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,020
what my fashion identity was.

2212
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:04,940
So I was wearing that.

2213
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:07,780
I was wearing my grandmother's shirts from the 70s.

2214
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:08,780
Oh my goodness.

2215
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:11,660
Or I was wearing a cardigan and khakis.

2216
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:15,660
I was just wearing all my older sister's clothes,

2217
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:19,300
like everything, The Gap, like Abercrombie.

2218
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,140
Cause you had how many older sisters?

2219
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:21,980
Two.

2220
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:22,820
Or older siblings?

2221
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:26,100
I had two older sisters, but one that lived,

2222
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,740
the oldest one's like way older,

2223
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:30,820
but I would always steal my sister's older,

2224
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:33,300
my closest-in-age sister.

2225
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:34,540
But yeah.

2226
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:36,100
I would just, I just dress the same.

2227
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:38,380
I dress like the same, like a little boy.

2228
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:39,220
You know?

2229
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:40,620
Your character.

2230
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,540
I mean, I guess I'm wearing a Rolling Stones shirt,

2231
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:46,340
but that's not a cartoon character, but I don't know.

2232
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:47,340
It's about the same.

2233
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:52,300
So you got the photo op with The Fountain.

2234
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,780
Did they explain to you that The Fountain has been moved?

2235
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:55,620
Yes, yes.

2236
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,140
That was explained on the tour.

2237
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:57,980
It was explained.

2238
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:00,260
It wasn't, it was also explained

2239
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:01,900
that it's not a real fountain in New York.

2240
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:03,220
It's not based on a real fountain.

2241
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:05,940
And it was just a fountain that was on the lot

2242
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:06,780
that they shot in front of.

2243
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:09,180
Some people think it's the fountain with the big angel

2244
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:10,900
that's like, that's in Central Park.

2245
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,180
It is not that fountain.

2246
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:13,740
It's a tiny little fountain.

2247
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:14,620
Yeah.

2248
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:16,380
We were not allowed to sit on the fountain.

2249
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:18,140
We took some photos of me sitting

2250
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,140
and we got a stern top.

2251
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,100
Yeah.

2252
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:22,460
And others followed her.

2253
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:23,300
You're gonna get me in trouble

2254
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:24,660
from the Warner Brothers now?

2255
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,380
There was no signs.

2256
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:28,980
There was no indication that this would not be acceptable.

2257
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:30,660
If we could sit on the couch and take photos,

2258
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:32,300
I thought we could sit on The Fountain and take photos.

2259
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:33,660
Right, sure.

2260
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:34,940
But a guy came up and he was like,

2261
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:35,900
you can't sit on The Fountain.

2262
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:38,700
And I was like, show me the thing anywhere

2263
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:41,060
that indicates this wouldn't have been okay.

2264
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:43,140
No, no, no, I was thinking that.

2265
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,140
And I said it to Ashley after.

2266
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:47,500
To him I said, oh my God, I'm so sorry.

2267
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,500
I'm so sorry.

2268
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,740
Oh gosh, I had no idea.

2269
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:51,500
I never would have sat if I had any idea.

2270
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:52,580
Yeah, she did say that.

2271
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:54,380
Was The Fountain on?

2272
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:56,220
Yeah, I think so.

2273
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:57,060
The fountain was on.

2274
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,900
The fountain was on too.

2275
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:01,660
Did you consider hopping in?

2276
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:03,700
I definitely knew not to do that.

2277
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:05,500
But I did think I could sit on the edge of it.

2278
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,660
It was just before she got reprimanded.

2279
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:09,500
Oh my gosh, right before the crime was committed.

2280
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,580
Look how happy I look.

2281
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:12,380
Just before I got yelled at.

2282
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:14,420
At least we have the photo though, the legal photo.

2283
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:15,980
And then she had to stand.

2284
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:18,620
Oh shit, now she looks upset in that photo.

2285
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:20,420
Well, I had just been reprimanded.

2286
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:23,100
Well, yeah, you got a sap to the back of the head.

2287
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:24,660
I was legitimately taken aback

2288
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:27,300
by how much he scolded me.

2289
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:28,140
Wow.

2290
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:28,980
He like rushed over.

2291
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:32,020
I felt very defensive because I don't,

2292
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,100
I'm not a rule breaker.

2293
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,460
I don't like breaking rules.

2294
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:36,460
I don't like having broken rules.

2295
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:39,940
And then yeah, the couch itself

2296
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:43,700
is made of like a very hard plastic of some kind.

2297
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:46,780
The couch is almost like the Snick couch or something.

2298
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:50,940
It's like a cartoon version of the couch itself.

2299
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:53,180
It's an exaggerated mock-up.

2300
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:55,780
Because so many tourists sit on it.

2301
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:58,300
They're like, you can't possibly have a real couch.

2302
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,460
Well, then is the real one in that set,

2303
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:02,940
that little other set, that's the real one, right?

2304
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:03,780
Okay.

2305
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:06,540
Or a real one because they tore the set down

2306
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:09,380
like the day they were done shooting.

2307
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:10,220
Right.

2308
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:11,260
Because they had to get out of there.

2309
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:12,100
Yes.

2310
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:12,940
So they had to shoot the clips.

2311
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:13,780
They recreated it later.

2312
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:15,620
They had to shoot new adventures.

2313
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:17,100
They had to get Jimmy in to shoot the clips.

2314
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,580
They had to get, help Jason finish college.

2315
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:20,420
Yeah.

2316
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:21,260
They had to get Jason to finish college.

2317
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:22,900
They had to boss him in.

2318
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:25,740
Yeah, just a basic communications class.

2319
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:27,580
Oh yeah, they had umbrellas for us.

2320
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:28,420
Isn't that fun?

2321
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:29,260
I don't know if they always have umbrellas.

2322
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:31,380
I'm showing a picture of the umbrellas,

2323
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:32,900
which I did have a question about.

2324
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,540
We didn't really get an answer,

2325
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:38,500
but I thought what was the significance of umbrellas?

2326
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,820
Don't they have them in the opening?

2327
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:40,660
Yeah, they have them in the opening.

2328
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:41,500
Well yeah, but why?

2329
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,780
I think it was just to create a fun pop of color

2330
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:44,620
in the opening.

2331
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,060
I think it was just to have movement

2332
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:51,060
and something different in some shots.

2333
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:52,140
You don't buy it, yeah.

2334
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:52,980
I know that.

2335
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:53,820
You're a little superfluous.

2336
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:54,660
I think they were,

2337
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:57,340
because the trivia I did know is that

2338
01:18:57,340 --> 01:19:01,220
they told them they weren't gonna have opening titles.

2339
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:04,780
The creators, like without asking permission first,

2340
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:06,900
went ahead and shot those opening titles

2341
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,500
in front of the fountain with the couch

2342
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,340
and the umbrellas,

2343
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:11,420
and then showed it to them

2344
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:15,860
with REM's Shining Happy People playing over it,

2345
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:16,700
and they were like,

2346
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:19,260
see, isn't this better with an opening title sequence?

2347
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:21,220
And they were like, yeah, it's better with an opening.

2348
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:23,260
And then he wrote the song.

2349
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:24,300
The Rembrandt song.

2350
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:25,140
Wow.

2351
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:27,260
I do like the Friends theme.

2352
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:28,100
Yes.

2353
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,380
I will say, I always like the Friends theme

2354
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:31,220
even though it's a day.

2355
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:32,060
It's a solid theme.

2356
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:32,900
It's iconic.

2357
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:33,900
Yeah, it is iconic.

2358
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:35,380
And the guy said, who wrote it,

2359
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:37,780
he was like, well, if I'd known it was gonna be as big a hit,

2360
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:40,420
I might've spent a little more time on the lyrics, though.

2361
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:41,260
Oh, yeah.

2362
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:44,220
The lyrics are, yeah, they're fine.

2363
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:45,060
They're fine.

2364
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:48,020
They're very serviceable for the show.

2365
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:49,860
Gonna feel this way.

2366
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:50,700
I'll be there for you.

2367
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:54,300
No one told you life was always gonna be this way.

2368
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:55,140
Cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck.

2369
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:56,420
I always think of it in the same realm.

2370
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:57,740
Your job's a joke, you're broke.

2371
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:58,580
There's like, it's like a wife's day.

2372
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:00,380
Is that what it says?

2373
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,580
Your job's a joke, you're broke.

2374
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:05,580
Your wife is dead on a rival.

2375
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:06,420
Relatable.

2376
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:07,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2377
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:09,700
Because it's all about the struggle of your 20s

2378
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,300
and how your friends and your family

2379
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,100
when you're just out of college.

2380
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:14,660
Yeah, I couldn't relate to the lyrics.

2381
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:15,500
Yeah.

2382
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:19,700
I wanted to be a Pinocchio.

2383
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:20,940
I wanted this to be a Pinocchio song.

2384
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:22,660
You wanted to be a superhero.

2385
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:26,060
So were there any things you thought of in the moment,

2386
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:28,060
like, oh man, if they did something next year,

2387
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:29,860
like an extra element, oh man,

2388
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:34,860
I wish I could put on Phoebe, like play Phoebe's guitar.

2389
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:37,500
I know she plays the guitar with the Smelly Cat song.

2390
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,340
You know that.

2391
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,340
That would have been great.

2392
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:41,620
They should have had a woman dressed as Phoebe

2393
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:42,460
playing her song.

2394
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:43,300
That would have been so fun.

2395
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,140
Look at that, I've never even,

2396
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:44,980
I just know that as a reference.

2397
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:46,980
That's how I've observed things.

2398
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:48,820
They were playing music from the show.

2399
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:49,660
This is how good a theme entertainment is.

2400
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:50,500
It's all like 90s jams.

2401
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,500
Like, weirdly, when we first arrived at the buffet,

2402
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:56,140
they just kept playing all by myself on a loop.

2403
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:56,980
Yeah, that was weird.

2404
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:57,980
Is that on the show ever?

2405
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:00,060
Yeah, it's in one episode.

2406
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:02,580
What is going on?

2407
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:05,420
And then finally other songs started to play.

2408
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:06,260
This is a good playlist.

2409
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:08,860
These songs that were used in the show.

2410
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:09,700
Yeah.

2411
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:11,540
Would you have liked it?

2412
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:12,380
But yeah, they should have had a woman there

2413
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:13,540
playing Phoebe's songs.

2414
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:16,100
Singing while we're eating, maybe,

2415
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:16,940
that would have been fun.

2416
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:17,780
And they just like throwing some other stuff in there, too.

2417
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:19,300
Yeah, Smelly Cat.

2418
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:20,140
As if she was playing at a cafe.

2419
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:22,260
I didn't see any Smelly Cat stuff.

2420
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:23,100
Or merch.

2421
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:24,220
Would you have liked?

2422
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:25,060
That's weird.

2423
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:25,900
Yeah, it is.

2424
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:28,860
Because of the celic, Courtney Cox relationship,

2425
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:30,100
would you have liked to see an older man

2426
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,180
kissing a young woman?

2427
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:34,420
I would have loved to have seen a mustachioed

2428
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:39,220
50-something year old kissing a woman

2429
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:40,460
just about to hit 30.

2430
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:41,700
I would have loved it.

2431
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:44,580
And that could just be happening the entire meal.

2432
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:45,500
Okay.

2433
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,420
Here's what I would have loved.

2434
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:48,580
Awnings.

2435
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:51,260
Tents of some kind protecting us from the sun.

2436
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:52,100
Oh, a lot of sun, okay.

2437
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:53,940
Full blisteringly hot in that sun.

2438
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:54,780
It was like 80 degrees.

2439
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:55,620
Ooh, yeah.

2440
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:57,940
So we're sitting eating hot Thanksgiving dinner.

2441
01:21:57,940 --> 01:21:58,780
Yeah, sure.

2442
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:00,180
In the blazing sun.

2443
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,020
Okay.

2444
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:02,380
I also would have loved some coffee.

2445
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:03,200
Yeah.

2446
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,040
Okay.

2447
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:08,360
Well, did they do coffee on the show, Michael?

2448
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,200
I've never seen it.

2449
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,040
I've never seen it.

2450
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,440
Central Perk?

2451
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:15,440
Central Perk is the coffee shop they always hang out in.

2452
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,760
But do they drink coffee there?

2453
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:17,600
Constantly drink coffee.

2454
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,440
You can get a tea.

2455
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:19,280
You can get a tea.

2456
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,120
It's giant bowls.

2457
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:20,960
No, they're constant.

2458
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:21,800
Even I know that, Mike.

2459
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,840
Giant mugs of coffee in every episode.

2460
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,840
So I married an axe murderer or a cappuccino.

2461
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,120
The reason they didn't have that

2462
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,840
is because they have the Central Perk Cafe

2463
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,840
for you to purchase all of these coffee.

2464
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:33,680
Correct.

2465
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,120
So that's why there was no coffee at the buffet,

2466
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,960
but I desperately needed caffeine.

2467
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,720
And they only had soda.

2468
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,160
Gravy didn't do it for me.

2469
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,280
Gravy didn't do it for me.

2470
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,120
Jason drinks caffeine with gravy.

2471
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:46,240
Oh, the turkey was delicious.

2472
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,200
The turkey was moist and delicious.

2473
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,480
The ham was fine.

2474
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:52,680
Would you like to hear the specialty drinks?

2475
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,520
Oh, yes, please.

2476
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,760
Special tea coffee drinks.

2477
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:59,760
So we've got the Joey, that's mango cold brew tea.

2478
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,040
Okay.

2479
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:02,080
We've got the Monica.

2480
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,520
What do you think that was?

2481
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:05,400
Oh my God.

2482
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,360
I'll tell you, it's the one I ordered.

2483
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,800
It's the one Lindsay ordered.

2484
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,000
Sprite, Sprite.

2485
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,480
Coffee drinks, Michael, coffee.

2486
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,320
Oh, coffee drinks.

2487
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,320
Right, right.

2488
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,720
Sprite mixed with coffee, Sprite infused coffee.

2489
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,160
Actually, that sounds good.

2490
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,120
It probably is good.

2491
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,760
Midnight mocha cold brew.

2492
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,200
Okay. Okay.

2493
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,120
What do you think the Rachel is?

2494
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,520
I'll tell you what the Rachel is.

2495
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:29,720
Hair. Should have been the Phoebe.

2496
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:30,960
Yeah.

2497
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,880
Oh, it's noodles in the coffee,

2498
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:36,680
like to look like Jennifer Aniston's hair.

2499
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:37,840
Noodles.

2500
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,200
Yeah, because it would just be noodles

2501
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,280
in the shape of her hair.

2502
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,680
That's fun.

2503
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,280
I'm an expert at themed entertainment.

2504
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:44,120
I love that.

2505
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,360
It was a cup of noodles.

2506
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:46,200
You know the cup of noodles?

2507
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,200
A cup of noodles in the coffee.

2508
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:51,120
The Rachel, you drink it on the Warner Brothers line.

2509
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,640
It was a matcha latte.

2510
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:54,480
Okay, okay.

2511
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:55,320
Oh, okay.

2512
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:56,160
I've heard of that.

2513
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,000
It's very strong.

2514
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,320
This one is the Ross.

2515
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:00,640
Okay.

2516
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:01,960
Classic flat white.

2517
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:06,360
Nailed it, nailed it.

2518
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:08,080
And then we got the Chandler.

2519
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:11,600
That's a caramel hazelnut latte.

2520
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,080
And then the Phoebe,

2521
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:18,200
which was a cookies and cream ice blended.

2522
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,600
That seems way more Rachel to me.

2523
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,360
And then the matcha seems way more Phoebe.

2524
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,800
Yeah.

2525
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,480
It's a bit of a, yeah,

2526
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:28,080
departure from everything else.

2527
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,120
Character assignment.

2528
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,560
But yeah, so those were available

2529
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,320
and the cream ice blended.

2530
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,160
Yeah.

2531
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:34,000
So yeah.

2532
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,080
And you know what I got?

2533
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:36,040
Oh yeah, please.

2534
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:37,080
A hot chocolate.

2535
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:40,440
Not themed to any character.

2536
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:44,400
Nothing like baking in the sun with hot chocolate.

2537
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:45,240
Hot chocolate.

2538
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,280
We were inside by this time

2539
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,080
because this was at Central Park.

2540
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:51,040
Baking in the sun I feel like is a complaint I see

2541
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:54,520
about a lot of new theme park lands

2542
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,760
or attraction lines.

2543
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,480
Yeah, all you have to do is set up some of those

2544
01:24:58,520 --> 01:24:59,320
I know.

2545
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:00,160
Yeah.

2546
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,000
That was a mistake.

2547
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,440
I hope they figure that out.

2548
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,400
And you look at the early photos

2549
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,320
of Tomorrowland at Disneyland.

2550
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:10,320
There's these giant shade coverings everywhere.

2551
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,160
Yeah.

2552
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:12,000
Yeah.

2553
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,160
So to sum up, is there any overall thoughts?

2554
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,160
The experience was nice.

2555
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,120
You had a nice day together.

2556
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:19,960
Very nice day together.

2557
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,000
It was a nice day with friends.

2558
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,760
It's always fun to be in the lots.

2559
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,600
Yeah, it was a nice day with my love.

2560
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:25,640
Yeah, my love.

2561
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,120
Yeah, any other.

2562
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,960
It was a bummer that we didn't get the friends trivia.

2563
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,200
Honest mistake, I'm sure.

2564
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,040
Yeah.

2565
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:37,080
And he threw in, I think we got a fair amount

2566
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:40,000
of friends trivia during the actual tour.

2567
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:40,840
Yep, yep, yep.

2568
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,520
This is where they filmed this scene.

2569
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:45,240
This is where they filmed that scene.

2570
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,720
Yeah, here's the movie theater from this episode,

2571
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:48,560
all of that.

2572
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,040
And then the meal was really good.

2573
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:51,880
Yeah.

2574
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:52,720
Yeah.

2575
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:55,360
I'd say worth it for the meal alone, honestly.

2576
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,920
Looking for a nice Thanksgiving dinner.

2577
01:25:58,720 --> 01:25:59,560
Check it out.

2578
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:00,400
Yeah.

2579
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,240
Yeah.

2580
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,840
All right, well, Jason, I mean, you don't care about friends,

2581
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:05,800
but maybe we send you over a couple more days

2582
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:06,640
of this event.

2583
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:07,480
Yeah.

2584
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:10,680
You get one of your to-go bags, you load up.

2585
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:12,640
Are you allowed to bring a doggie bag,

2586
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:14,360
by which I mean a black trash bag?

2587
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:15,840
We were wondering, I was like, we should have brought wine.

2588
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,600
This would have been so nice with a nice wine.

2589
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,840
They could have charged like a little, you know,

2590
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:24,000
extra price and sold alcohol, I think.

2591
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,880
I wonder, yeah, I wonder if that's probably a whole like,

2592
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,640
to do, getting a liquor license.

2593
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:28,640
Probably.

2594
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:29,480
Yeah.

2595
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:31,080
I'm sure it's to do with liquor license.

2596
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:32,960
They should let, on any studio tour,

2597
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,040
they should let you drink.

2598
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,760
Yeah, I agree.

2599
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,240
Also the catering staff was super nice as well.

2600
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,080
Yes.

2601
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:39,920
And they were not in character.

2602
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,240
Everyone was very nice, not in character.

2603
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:42,400
Okay.

2604
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,600
So maybe more characters next year.

2605
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,480
I would say your idea for somebody playing the Phoebe.

2606
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:47,320
The Rachel drink?

2607
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,160
Mm-hmm.

2608
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:51,480
Not so the Rachel drink, more so the Phoebe,

2609
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,960
somebody playing Phoebe's music

2610
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,520
would have been a really good touch.

2611
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:55,360
All right, well.

2612
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:58,040
I feel like, you're not too far off.

2613
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:01,640
I feel like espresso tonics were a thing I saw

2614
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,600
for a while at Cafe Menus.

2615
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:08,280
I think I've never seen anyone suggest a cup of noodles.

2616
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:10,880
He's saying my Sprite idea, right?

2617
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,040
I know, Sprite idea, yeah.

2618
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:17,520
I think the big ramen manufacturer,

2619
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,240
I think there is top ramen with caffeinated top ramen.

2620
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:22,080
Really?

2621
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,880
Like Gamer Fuel top ramen.

2622
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,720
What about caffeinated gravy?

2623
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:26,560
Whoa.

2624
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,520
No, a man can dream.

2625
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:32,320
Do you have your morning cup of gravy to start your day?

2626
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,160
Yeah, yeah.

2627
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:35,000
Well, that's possible.

2628
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,320
You could make, I mean, we really,

2629
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,080
we've talked about so many different business ventures

2630
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:39,680
on the show that have never come true,

2631
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,760
but Jason Sheridan's caffeinated gravy

2632
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,120
is something we should put to the front of the line.

2633
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:48,120
After the fact, it was funny because it didn't seem,

2634
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:50,880
like I seemed the most excited about coming in

2635
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,040
with like Friends Trivia on the tour

2636
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,600
because the guy was like, and then on this scene

2637
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,080
is where you see, down that alleyway,

2638
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,600
you see Monica and Rachel talking.

2639
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,080
I was like, I know, they were talking about

2640
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:02,440
Jean-Claude Van Damme in the episode

2641
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:03,280
where they're seeing the movie.

2642
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,880
Yeah, yeah.

2643
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:08,720
And I seem to be the only one really like being like,

2644
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:11,840
yeah, this is the list, and like pushing the nerd glasses up.

2645
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:12,680
And one other gal.

2646
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:13,520
Yeah.

2647
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:14,360
The Laren.

2648
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:17,200
And I think that's because we were there on press day.

2649
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,080
And so a number of other people were all there

2650
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,800
to cover it for something that weren't so much there

2651
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,280
because they were Friends fans.

2652
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,160
And I didn't realize that until the meal.

2653
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:26,000
Yeah.

2654
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:26,840
That was maybe what I was dealing with

2655
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:29,440
with Batman Day as the press.

2656
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,280
Yeah, possibly.

2657
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:32,880
But yeah, there was all the, the guide was like,

2658
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,840
cause yeah, they give them all these very specific things

2659
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:37,440
to say cause it's not their normal guide speech.

2660
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:40,040
And the guide for Batman Day was like,

2661
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:42,880
he said something about Aquaman's villain, Black Mantra.

2662
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,560
And the villain's name is Black Manta,

2663
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,680
like the aquatic life.

2664
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:49,080
And I just was like gripping my,

2665
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,480
I was like, I'm not gonna correct him.

2666
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:52,960
He's doing his best.

2667
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:53,800
He called Mr. Zomp.

2668
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:54,640
He sent a very long email after.

2669
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:57,560
Yeah, you sent a Zazz live email.

2670
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:01,000
Did you go to the Turner Classic Movies tour?

2671
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,320
They invited us to an event.

2672
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,160
Yes, I did go to that.

2673
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:05,000
I would have loved to have gone to that one.

2674
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,440
Well, there was a whole,

2675
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:07,800
we talked about this on the show, did we not?

2676
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,120
With Ben Mankiewicz and the marching band.

2677
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,320
Yeah, Ben Mankiewicz was there and a marching band came.

2678
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:14,200
All of a sudden like playing 76 trombones.

2679
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,040
Oh my gosh.

2680
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,880
And Ben Mankiewicz on a tram car

2681
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:20,360
turning around the corner and we were like, holy shit.

2682
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:24,080
And then there was like an old cowboy.

2683
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,480
I forget the actor's name,

2684
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,680
but he was just like there to be like,

2685
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,520
the movies are great or whatever.

2686
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,040
I would have loved that.

2687
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:31,600
It was really funny on the tour

2688
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,760
because we're sitting next to this other couple

2689
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,760
and he would tell us the fact,

2690
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,240
he'd be like, and here's where Growing Pains was shot.

2691
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,800
And Ashley and I would be like, oh.

2692
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:44,120
And then he'd say, and here's where

2693
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:46,680
like Pretty Little Liars did this.

2694
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:49,840
And we were both like totally silent with Bill.

2695
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,360
Or he would start to say something,

2696
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,760
he would go, ah.

2697
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:54,080
Yeah, yeah.

2698
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,760
Because it would seem really interesting

2699
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:58,000
and then become like abruptly less interesting.

2700
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,320
So it would be an, ah.

2701
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,960
Just me freaking out.

2702
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,040
Freaking out on a tour when they go like,

2703
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,400
and this was Philip Marlowe's office building

2704
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,440
in The Big Sleep, Humphrey Bogart walked through this door.

2705
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,800
And I'm like, oh my God.

2706
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:13,880
Exactly, it's like, yeah,

2707
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,240
Ashley and I both going, ah.

2708
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:18,680
Giving away our age as soon as he was like,

2709
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,040
and this is the Seaverse house.

2710
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:20,880
And we're like, what?

2711
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:21,720
Yeah.

2712
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:27,520
Yeah, I did that when they said Adam West.

2713
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:28,360
Yeah.

2714
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:29,520
I just got very, I get giddy.

2715
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,560
I do feel like Ashley and I were the most vocal tour.

2716
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,400
For sure.

2717
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:34,960
Okay, so you won the tour.

2718
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:35,800
We won the tour.

2719
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:36,640
Let's say so, yeah.

2720
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,280
We're definitely the star pupils of the tour.

2721
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:39,120
We were, yep.

2722
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:39,960
That's good.

2723
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:41,600
And then I really appreciated the fact

2724
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,000
that they showed a trailer for the second season

2725
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,560
of the Gremlins cartoon.

2726
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:47,400
Oh, right, right.

2727
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,240
On Max.

2728
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:50,760
They showed that on the tram in the little video.

2729
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:51,600
They showed that on the tram video.

2730
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,440
Oh, that's good.

2731
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:55,600
When we were like leaving the buffet.

2732
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:56,440
Yep.

2733
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:57,680
Synergy, that's nice synergy.

2734
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:00,200
It was just nice to see an animated show get some love.

2735
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,640
I know.

2736
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:04,520
That's right, P.S. guest Joan Ford worked on that.

2737
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:05,360
Yes.

2738
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:06,200
Oh.

2739
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,120
Well, let's say, and I'll do it really casually

2740
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:09,680
and quietly, but Lindsay and Ashley,

2741
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,320
you survived Pomcast, pod.

2742
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,320
That usually does it.

2743
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,400
I'll do it quietly.

2744
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:16,560
Did I call it Pomcast?

2745
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:17,400
Pomcast.

2746
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,680
Yes, Pomcast.

2747
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:19,520
Oh my God.

2748
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,360
Oh.

2749
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:22,680
You survived podcast the ride.

2750
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,080
Let's exit through the gift shop

2751
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,640
now that we're talking cartoons.

2752
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:26,480
Whoa.

2753
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:27,920
And you do the, let's do the sell.

2754
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:28,760
Let's do the art sell.

2755
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:29,600
Oh, that was perfect.

2756
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,160
Ashley, quickly before we do that is,

2757
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:34,120
Ashley was on the hunt for something

2758
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:36,480
to do with Tiny Toons.

2759
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,040
Yes, you were Babs Bunny.

2760
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:38,880
Oh yeah, I am.

2761
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,700
Because she is Babs Bunny.

2762
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:40,540
That is awesome.

2763
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:41,380
Sometimes I forget.

2764
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:42,200
Yes, I forget.

2765
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,040
We're talking to Babs Bunny.

2766
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:43,880
I know, crazy.

2767
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:45,440
So Ashley bought like a really cool

2768
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:48,720
original animation sell from the original Tiny Toons.

2769
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:51,000
Yeah, because it's, I'm always like everywhere.

2770
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,800
I'm like, any Tiny Toons stuff anywhere?

2771
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,280
This was a big hit show also.

2772
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:58,200
And it's always Looney Tunes, you know,

2773
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:01,000
and then Space Jam stuff, you know, all that.

2774
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,720
So, but we went outside and they had like a whole,

2775
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,600
not marketplace, but like a whole.

2776
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,280
As we were exiting through the gift shop.

2777
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:09,480
As we were, yeah.

2778
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:12,080
All of these original like vintage sells

2779
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:13,640
from different shows.

2780
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:16,160
So I asked if they had Tiny Toons stuff and they did.

2781
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:17,760
They had like four bins worth.

2782
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,920
And Tom Rugger, who created Tiny Toons,

2783
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:26,280
he comes and like signs them and like.

2784
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,120
Oh, that's cool.

2785
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,400
Yeah, but he wasn't there that day.

2786
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,840
So, yeah.

2787
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,200
Ashley got a really good one.

2788
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:33,480
Yeah, I'm gonna get it signed.

2789
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:34,320
I bought one.

2790
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:35,160
Yeah.

2791
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,560
Did you try to like.

2792
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,240
The Princess Leia, yeah.

2793
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:39,720
Get it on the house.

2794
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:40,560
Like hey, this is.

2795
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,400
I did, well, he was like, I told him.

2796
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,480
And I was like, yeah, I'm the voice of Babs Bunny.

2797
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,720
And he was like, oh my God, what?

2798
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,920
And I was like, yeah.

2799
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,560
And he was like, oh, well, you can get an employee discount.

2800
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,800
And I was like, what?

2801
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:52,640
I don't work here.

2802
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,760
You know, I don't know how he.

2803
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:56,600
I was like, how are you gonna prove that?

2804
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,200
Technically employed by WB though.

2805
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,600
I guess so, yeah.

2806
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:00,440
Sure.

2807
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:03,880
Yeah, so I got a pretty hefty discount.

2808
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:05,000
Which was really nice.

2809
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,160
You are subletting the water tower from the Animaniacs.

2810
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:09,360
Exactly, yes.

2811
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:14,960
I am Warner Brothers royalty at this point.

2812
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:15,800
You are.

2813
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:16,640
Seriously, yeah.

2814
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:17,480
Just kidding.

2815
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:18,880
I kept threatening to out Ashley

2816
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,720
as the voice of Babs Bunny on the tour.

2817
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:21,560
I was like, please don't do it.

2818
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:23,840
If he so much as mentioned Looney Tunes,

2819
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,680
I was gonna be like.

2820
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:25,520
Um.

2821
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:27,400
But it didn't happen.

2822
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,680
You got reprimanded for that impulse.

2823
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,280
After that fountain sitting incident.

2824
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:35,400
And it was by the ghost of Jack Warner.

2825
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:36,880
That's why you were so startled.

2826
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:37,920
I was like, oh my God,

2827
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,680
the four Warner Brothers are reprimanding me

2828
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:41,840
from beyond the grave.

2829
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:44,680
But yeah, so now that we've discussed

2830
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:47,200
the actual exiting through the gift shop,

2831
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:52,200
please watch my and Ashley's show,

2832
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:54,200
Fairly Odd Parents, A New Wish.

2833
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:56,920
It is out on Netflix in multiple countries,

2834
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:58,760
including the US now.

2835
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:02,560
Premiered November 14th, I think.

2836
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:05,160
Thursday, November 14th.

2837
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,080
We don't know what time it's gonna drop,

2838
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:07,920
but that's okay.

2839
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,400
But yeah, that's when it will be coming out.

2840
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,880
And I think this episode comes out after.

2841
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:13,520
Probably after that day.

2842
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,800
I think this is our Thanksgiving episode, probably.

2843
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,320
It should already be available to watch.

2844
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:18,400
Please. Yep.

2845
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,240
Please watch it. Set a timer, set a reminder.

2846
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:22,960
First half of our first season that already aired.

2847
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:23,840
Yeah. On cable.

2848
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:28,840
But the views of this will supposedly be considered

2849
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,400
in giving us the second season.

2850
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,680
It's important to see this.

2851
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:34,480
So if you could leave your TVs on

2852
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,960
with it playing all night.

2853
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:38,080
And it is important that you finish it

2854
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:40,320
and finish it all in one,

2855
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:45,320
like binge it as much as you can and finish it.

2856
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:46,800
And read it.

2857
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,760
Within the first 30 days of its release.

2858
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,800
Give it five stars as it starts.

2859
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:51,640
Two thumbs up.

2860
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:52,760
Two thumbs up. Loved it.

2861
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:53,880
Loved it. Give it a loved it.

2862
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:56,400
If you're gonna let your TV play,

2863
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:00,280
remember to set a timer to wake back up

2864
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:02,680
to click the yes, I'm still watching.

2865
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:04,160
Yeah. Right.

2866
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:05,960
Are your pets home alone?

2867
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,960
Put on Fairly Odd Parents a new wish.

2868
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,000
Keep them company.

2869
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,480
Watch it multiple times.

2870
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:13,600
They are probably sick of Roku City at this point.

2871
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:14,560
So a little change.

2872
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,480
You're going to Thanksgiving.

2873
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,160
Family members have kids.

2874
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:20,320
Let them know this show exists.

2875
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,160
Yeah.

2876
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:23,760
Suggest it to your friends with kids.

2877
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,960
Suggest it to any parents you know.

2878
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:28,080
We would really appreciate all the views we can get.

2879
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:28,920
We really would.

2880
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:30,920
We're really proud of the show.

2881
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:31,760
Here, let me hold.

2882
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,080
Everybody did such a great job.

2883
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:35,200
Let me talk turkey to the listeners.

2884
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:36,520
Turn the fucking show on.

2885
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:37,360
Okay.

2886
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:41,520
Do you want to feed our fucking kid or not?

2887
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:42,360
We have a kid here.

2888
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:43,200
We need season two, okay?

2889
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:44,040
Yeah, we do.

2890
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:46,120
If you have a two year old at home,

2891
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:49,280
she needs food and clothing and shelter.

2892
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,440
This dumb podcast that we've been doing for seven years.

2893
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,280
You owe me.

2894
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,920
Do nothing else.

2895
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:57,040
Okay. I'm talking turkey.

2896
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:57,880
Cause it's Thanksgiving.

2897
01:35:57,880 --> 01:35:58,720
Help get our show reviewed.

2898
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,560
That's why.

2899
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:00,400
Yeah.

2900
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:01,240
That's why you're talking turkey.

2901
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:02,360
So thank you for doing this.

2902
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:06,520
Cosmo and Wanda, the fairies will be put down.

2903
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:07,360
Yeah.

2904
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,520
They will die.

2905
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,560
Their lives are on the line.

2906
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:14,960
We're letting Hazel go, but Cosmo and Wanda will die.

2907
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:15,800
Yeah.

2908
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:19,600
So that'll be on the listeners of podcast if it happens.

2909
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,200
We've gotten great fan reaction online.

2910
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:24,720
Huge support.

2911
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,920
A really big round of support.

2912
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,000
They have really just taken the reins on this.

2913
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,200
It's been really heartening to see.

2914
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,600
We really appreciate everybody who has said something

2915
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:34,440
about it on social media.

2916
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:39,240
Promoted and posted and did fan art and shared.

2917
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:40,080
Just like, yeah.

2918
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:43,160
So much love for the show and we really appreciate it.

2919
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:46,160
Let's keep the train rolling, the love train.

2920
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:47,040
So yeah, as for us,

2921
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:50,200
you can find us on all the socials, podcasts, the ride.

2922
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:51,040
You can go second gate.

2923
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,920
You can hear a bunch of different weird stuff

2924
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:55,760
we've been doing all month.

2925
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:59,480
Jason talking about Generation X, the weird Fox movie.

2926
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:01,560
We did 20,000 leagues under the sea,

2927
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:04,080
the Tokyo version with Matt Mazzani.

2928
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:05,440
And yeah, I'm trying to think.

2929
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,120
I guess we just put out an episode

2930
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:09,960
about a really weird Thanksgiving parade

2931
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:12,440
that we literally found hours ago.

2932
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:13,800
Hours ago, we're like,

2933
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:16,160
there's an original song about Goofy being a dinosaur

2934
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:17,240
called Goofasaurus.

2935
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:18,480
Goofasaurus.

2936
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,040
Never heard of this before.

2937
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:20,880
Wow.

2938
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,520
A couple hours ago, we're going back and forth

2939
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:25,080
and I was finding something and there's this weird

2940
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:28,840
half Macy's Day parade, half Disneyland parade

2941
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:31,880
where it's like very dinosaur Flintstones themed.

2942
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:33,680
No idea what it is.

2943
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:36,840
Finding Eisner treasures every week still,

2944
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:38,840
Eisner era treasures.

2945
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,360
The man was a treasure trove.

2946
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:41,200
God bless him.

2947
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:42,200
And then to go out,

2948
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:44,680
I bought myself a gift weeks ago at Disneyland

2949
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:46,120
and I want to open it right now.

2950
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:48,080
This is gonna be my first munchling

2951
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:49,880
now that we're talking about food.

2952
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:53,720
These are Disney, this is a new thing I'm about to collect.

2953
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:58,720
So Lindsay, a shutter should run down her spine

2954
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:00,160
as far as stuff I'm collecting,

2955
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:05,160
but these are characters that are meant to also be food.

2956
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:10,000
So I could get Scrooge McDuck who's pancakes.

2957
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,040
He's half Scrooge McDuck, half pancakes.

2958
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:15,640
Huey, Dewey, and Louie who are in a cereal bowl

2959
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:17,320
filled with fruit.

2960
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:21,840
Kit Cloudkicker from Tailspin who is a brown sugar muffin.

2961
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:25,120
Darkwing Duck who is a fruit cup parfait.

2962
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:28,640
Gosselin Mallard who's freshly squeezed orange juice

2963
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:33,560
or Gosselin from Darkwing Duck.

2964
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:36,040
She's the plucky little girl.

2965
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:38,800
Goliath from Gargoyles Berry Breakfast Pastry.

2966
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:39,640
Wow, Gargoyles.

2967
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:41,560
Or a mystery character.

2968
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:43,240
So I'm very excited to do this.

2969
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:45,120
I've been meaning to open this up on the show for weeks

2970
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,520
and I think Thanksgiving is a perfect time.

2971
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,480
Mike is just tearing into the box.

2972
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:51,840
Your chaotic boxing thing is so stressful to me.

2973
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,800
And we've got, oh, Scrooge McDuck is a pancake.

2974
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,440
Yay.

2975
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:59,120
I gotta say, it's gotta be the best one, right?

2976
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:00,600
The Darkwing Duck Parfait was the one

2977
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:03,640
I maybe wanted the most, but this is pretty good.

2978
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:04,800
They all honestly are really good.

2979
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,760
And we're going to Disneyland soon with the family

2980
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:09,320
and we'll get a few more of these boxes when we're there.

2981
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:10,560
Nice.

2982
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:13,200
As long as Fairly Odd Parents gets picked up for season two.

2983
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:15,760
Yeah, only on that condition.

2984
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,760
Just to share a brief theme park story.

2985
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:22,360
Regarding our child, she's been talking to the nightlight

2986
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:23,640
in the bedroom at night.

2987
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:26,680
She says, hello, Lelo nightlight.

2988
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:29,920
And then I talked back as the nightlight

2989
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,640
and I said, hello, Ramona.

2990
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:34,440
And so then I did this a few times

2991
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:37,760
and now she just like continually tells the yellow nightlight

2992
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,880
about her last trip to Disneyland.

2993
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:40,840
Whoa.

2994
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:42,360
She's like, I was at the castle.

2995
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:45,880
I saw Mick and Minnie and Goofy and Daisy and Donald.

2996
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:46,760
It's so cute.

2997
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:50,480
Daddy went on a 15 minute rant

2998
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:53,480
about something called Lightning Lane premium.

2999
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,040
Yeah.

3000
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:56,880
Yeah.

3001
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,480
Well, she knows and she knows what the problems are

3002
01:39:58,480 --> 01:39:59,320
with the system.

3003
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:00,640
And she can list them.

3004
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:02,680
She can list them and she does, yeah.

3005
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:04,480
But in the cutest voice possible.

3006
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,960
Anyway, thank you for listening.
