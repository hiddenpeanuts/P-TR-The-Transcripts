00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,360
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate where today we are talking about the best dinosaur

3
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,920
themed coaster in the history of Orlando theme parks. That is of course

4
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:41,480
primeval world. I'm Scott Gardner. Hi Jason Sheridan. Hi. And Mike Carlson. Hello. Yes, the best dino

5
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:49,520
but dino coaster, dino themed coaster. Dino, well in which can you even dino related, dino

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,760
adjacent? Yeah, that's adjacent's good, I think. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that makes sense. There are

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:04,240
depictions of dinosaurs, technically. But this is the same issue then you run into with DC Six Flags

8
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:11,120
coasters. Can you really say that the new whatever Wonder Woman coaster is a Wonder Woman themed

9
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,160
coaster? Is it a more Wonder Woman adjacent? Look, it's, I watched a video of it last night,

10
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,360
it is a flight of courage and that's all I need to know. All right. It takes courage to do it and it

11
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,200
tributes the courage of Wonder Woman and it took courage to build it. So I'm just all about the

12
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,680
courage. I apologize to Wonder Woman and her coaster and the courage that it took. But there's

13
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,240
other DC coasters. I looked at it and I was like, man, imagine all the people and their courage.

14
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:49,680
Do they play imagine on their coaster? That would be the toonless celebrity imagine all the people.

15
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,440
They couldn't get the rights to John Lennon's version so they got the early pandemic imagine.

16
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,760
That's right, because it's Wonder Woman because Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman. Oh, that's right. And

17
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,080
that took courage to do. Everyone made fun of her but imagine the courage to email all of those

18
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:16,560
people only for them to be publicly mocked. And now you can go on the ride and experience that courage

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,080
yourself at which Six Flags? Is it here? It's here. Okay. You'd feel getting on that coaster

20
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,400
feels like answering an email without really knowing what's ahead pandemic wide. The courage

21
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,440
of not we don't know that this is going for three years and counting. Yeah. We don't know that

22
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,600
celebrity videos are going to be roundly mocked. Right. Yeah. Unlike celebrity reunions, which are

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,280
celebrated and we love them, keep them coming since we're never leaving Zoom world. Exactly.

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,520
Many reunions but seeing along as we mock those we don't like. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Does Wonder Woman

25
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,840
open soon? Open the other day. I mean, I don't know when the hell this is coming out. Can we not get

26
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,680
an invite to a press event? I think we did get an invite but I don't think there were clear

27
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:09,680
directions of what to do in it. There was info and there was a link to media elements where you

28
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,840
were prompted for a password I did not have. Oh, so you tried to register for a press event

29
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,440
and we were confused and you gave up? I yeah. Well, I thought someone else was in the email. I thought

30
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,440
I was like, oh, well, we'll get on this and then, you know, life got in the way. We forgot. We didn't

31
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,680
have a chance to go to Six Flags for free. We didn't take it. We had a chance to go to Santa Clarita during a heat wave.

32
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,880
Oh man. Yes, where it's like 10 degrees hotter. Yes. Man. Yeah. Now I'm upset. And to a theme park with

33
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,600
no shade. I don't know if there's a tree. That's right. I guess I know there's trees in Magic Mountain,

34
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,640
but there's not a lot of trees featuring cracked asphalt that is not carefully constructed and

35
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,360
painted cement to create an illusion featuring authentic cracked asphalt. I like it more for that

36
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,480
reason. It's the real deal. Yeah. Now, and Scott, at the top, you were saying this is the best dinosaur

37
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,560
themed roller coaster because Velocicoaster is about Blue, who you just consider a friend.

38
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,200
Yeah, I think Blue transcends its species and their relationship transcends

39
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,320
a time and its own franchise. Do you ever think, because I was the other day at a nice

40
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,520
sit up on Jurassic patio with Aaron as we like to do and we had a great seat where we had full view

41
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:36,240
from way up above of not just the boats landing, but also the little Raptor show with Blue. Yes.

42
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,800
And you ever think about, maybe we don't appreciate enough that back when we did get invited to stuff,

43
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,920
if we can remember those days, that we got invited to the Jurassic World ride opening and we got to

44
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:52,960
watch Pratt himself control Blue, not control, that's not the way they view it. What? Like what

45
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,440
is he, when he's working with his hands, it's just like. Team, work with, communicate. Yeah,

46
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,960
I don't think he would be so severe with the language because it's his friend. It's, yeah,

47
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:09,840
it's communicated. Summon, no, halt, summon. Connect, work with, work with, work with,

48
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,240
work with, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Make a breakthrough with, I think he would put it in like

49
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,440
psychology terms. Good, good, good go to, if you do have to respond to an email that you don't know

50
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,040
anything about, like great to connect with you. Exciting to loop back on this. That's what you

51
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,400
should have sent right back to Six Flags. And that you hear that is played through speakers as you

52
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,960
do the first drop on Wonder Woman. I bet we could, we'll still get a, we'll see, we'll do, oh yeah,

53
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,080
you're invited. We missed it. Yeah, I completely missed that. July 4th we were invited on. I saw

54
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,400
this, I thought it was just. Media day was yesterday. Oh man. I thought there was an update

55
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,280
coming. I thought there was like an update with instructions. Guys, imagine the sunburn we could

56
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,120
have gotten. I have a feeling we could email and still go for free. Yeah, possibly. Yeah.

57
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,840
I don't think we save it. Would you do with Wonder Woman Coaster? It would look kind of fun. I have

58
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,960
to eyeball it. I have to see it with my eyes and see if I have the courage. If you had done like,

59
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,040
if you would have like a beer at the, it's, I know they don't have the full throttle lounge right now,

60
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,600
but if, if, you know, a couple of beers. This was the issue when I, when I went,

61
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,680
cause I wanted to try a coaster. I wanted to maybe do Batman the ride when I went with a friend of

62
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,760
the show, Buzz Buzz and they, the beer line was so bonkers that like, all right, that's out. That's

63
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,520
not happening today. It was like clearly going to be, it was so much worse than any of the ride lines.

64
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,960
Like clearly it was going to be an hour to get a not good beer. Like what's that? Get a pen beer,

65
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:50,160
you drink it a pen. Oh yeah. That is, yeah. You can't walk around. Oh, we discovered that too. Oh,

66
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,760
bomber. All right. Yeah. Yeah. It is a pen. Yeah. You have, there's a beer drinking pen at six flags.

67
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,000
Like you're a sheep or something. You cannot, yeah. It's really to prevent the rowdiness, I guess.

68
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,480
Yeah. The chaos from happening. So yeah, you, you can eat at the Johnny Rockets pen. I think you

69
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:15,440
can have a drink there, but there are multiple drinking pens for the local, uh, souses.

70
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,560
They pour beer from the end of the troughs. They pour them out of the feeds. You and like the

71
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,560
Santa Clarita town drunk, there's drinking up at six flags. I'm thrilled to meet such a, I mean,

72
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,800
that's a prestigious company to, for him to have been, or her have been elected that imagine it's

73
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,400
stiff competition. Yeah. Yeah. So I walk here. I work in that office building that just says

74
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,400
scorpion off the highway. You don't know how much of your data I have. There's an,

75
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,760
there is an Andy Griffith style town drunk in Santa Clarita. We know that. Uh, uh, so yeah,

76
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,840
we'll see, we'll investigate. Maybe we'll just end up there at fright Fest. Who knows? That might be

77
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,960
it. Yeah. Yeah. We'll always try to do that obviously, but today is about a dearly departed,

78
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:15,120
a departed animal kingdom attraction called primeval world. Um, this was okay. So just,

79
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,760
just basics here. This is a wild mouse coaster. We know how do you basically describe a wild

80
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:28,800
mouse coaster? It's one of those it's, it's, it's a goofy sky school at Disneyland. It's, it was

81
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,280
considered an off the shelf kind of ride. I remember when I rode one when I was kid,

82
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,080
I was kind of delighted by the concept because it's a lot of, you feel like you're going to go

83
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,680
off the edge of the track. Yeah. Yeah. It's those really tight turns and kind of severe

84
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,280
quick sudden that you might whip around the corner and there's a drop there. You didn't even see,

85
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,600
it seems like some of these wild mouse rides are successful if done in the dark, if you can put

86
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,960
them in an indoor, like we ran into a Batman one, like a joker thing that was done that way.

87
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:06,320
It seems like that'd be a good format, but out in the open, out in the sunlight, it's a weird genre,

88
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,480
especially for Disney where you expect theming because it just is an industrial looking

89
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,120
format. If you know, goofy sky school, or if you got to do primeval world, it's just, it's like all

90
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,520
pipes and supports and beams. It looks like something inside a factory. Like if you were

91
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,840
watching a Mr. Rogers video on like some instructional thing, how you would learn how

92
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,200
bolts are made and transported from one side of the factory to the other side with the truck,

93
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,480
like where the truck would take them to the stores. Yeah. And some other confusing, there's

94
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,640
two of them facing opposite directions. Yes. So while it could eat up a fair amount of people,

95
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:52,640
something like 1400 people an hour, if operating a full capacity, it does look odd to see two

96
00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:00,640
identical coasters facing different ways. Some other things about it. The cars spin, the cars

97
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:09,600
do rotate. You cannot control that. So some videos I watched, people spun once and then not at all.

98
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,160
And so the one big element of this that's kind of unique is the, the cars spin,

99
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,880
you cannot control the spin. It just happens. So sometimes you might spend a lot. Sometimes you

100
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,760
might not spend very much at all. And it's not, this is what, because I was starting to go,

101
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:36,560
okay, okay, let's get this out of the way too. I don't, I don't think it's not my belief that

102
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,800
this was the worst ride on Disney world property, but some people positive that that was definitely

103
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,200
said. But then I also saw a lot of, I don't know, it was charming and people were, were hard on it.

104
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,840
So just to put that out there, that it's a candidate and I didn't get to go on it. So I

105
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,720
didn't know what the deal was, but when I heard spinning wild mouse, because I find wild mouse

106
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,520
coasters to be a little insane or stomach churning or something. A little unnerving. Sure. Yeah. So

107
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:10,080
I'm like spinning the whole time. That sounds not good. Then I realized not spinning the whole time

108
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,520
you do your drops and then towards the end, when it's just about kind of getting back to the

109
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,560
station, then it's like, all right, well, we got nothing else going on. How about we spin them?

110
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,760
It's like a late into the ride. Am I incorrect? That's, I watched a couple of videos and that

111
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,200
seemed to be as it was coming towards the last third of the ride. People started to spin more,

112
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,680
but sometimes just once. Sometimes you didn't get a lot of spinning.

113
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,720
I have not ridden this either. When I was there last fall, I peeked through some chain link fence

114
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:51,920
and I saw the ruins of it. I saw piles of scrap metal and like a bulldozer. It will admit this very

115
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:01,840
inglorious end, right? It just became a seasonal attraction in 2019. Maybe the intent to start

116
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:10,000
running it more in 2020. Of course, and then 2021 park reopens and they, oh wait,

117
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,480
or Disney world was sooner, right? I don't know. Disney world reopened after the NBA bubble,

118
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,040
uh, I believe so summer of 2020. Okay. But whenever they just, but this did not,

119
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,480
they did not. And then they just started quietly demolishing it. Yeah. I mean, the carnival games

120
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,360
were there, uh, still that's where I won Jane. The, uh, I thought I won her a stuffed animal

121
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,600
based on the ride vehicle for primeval world, but it's the, it's the triceratops ride vehicle

122
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:49,600
of triceratops spin, which does seem to still be active. Yeah. Okay. So well, let's,

123
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:58,640
let's talk about this area in general because okay, animal kingdom opens big grand park,

124
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:05,200
huge scale to the thing we've reproduced just so much nature and there's so much acreage to it.

125
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,920
But you got that problem of like, there's the big grand elements and then there's not just a bunch

126
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,360
of little things for little kids to do problem. They kept having around this time. We got to just

127
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:22,960
up the numbers up capacity, give, uh, families places to go. And there had been this little

128
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:32,560
gift shop called Chester and Hester's, uh, treasurers. Okay. And they are Chester and

129
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:40,400
Hester are a married, an old married couple who are presumably dead today as we find,

130
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,440
I think they're gone, right? I think it's their, their relatives who are keeping the name alive.

131
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,200
I think so. Although that said Chester does do the safety warning of this

132
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,440
roller coaster. Oh, it's chest. He says, Hey, it's Chester.

133
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:01,120
I did not see that in a video. Wow. Wow. So Chester is characterized. What do you think? What, uh,

134
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,480
would you, could you ascribe a quality to Chester? Well, here's the, the reading the backstory of

135
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:16,640
this whole land that was at the dinosaur Dino land USA takes place in a place called Deeks County.

136
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,080
Dinosaur bones were discovered. All the paleontologist and grad students came.

137
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,520
They established the dinosaur Institute as they're digging stuff up.

138
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:31,920
And the dinosaur Institute is where you go on dinosaurs, which was initially countdown to

139
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,320
extinction. That's that's correct. So when you're on this attraction, we're talking about today,

140
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:44,560
you are at the same time in animal kingdom, Dino land USA, Diggs County,

141
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,640
yes. And Chester and Hester's Dino Rama. Yeah. You're in four places when you're on this ride.

142
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,360
Yes. Because the backstory, which I do appreciate this backstory, but there are some trouble

143
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:02,400
difficulties with it. So Chester and Hester owned a gas station near where this was all happening.

144
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:08,800
They converted to a general store and then they turn an empty lot into like carnival attractions,

145
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,040
fun, fun attraction. Because there's a bunch of activity around the facility where they have a

146
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,640
time machine now and they're sending people back to rescue baby allodars. So that is gathering so

147
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,840
much tourist attention. Yeah, right. They basically assembled like the Flintstones

148
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:32,400
shitty campsite thing outside of some legitimate interesting discoveries. Yes. It's so much like

149
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:38,000
that. And that Flintstones episode we did that there in Arizona, there's the bad little camp

150
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,960
grounds with really plastic looking dinosaurs. And they so they did that. So we now have Disney

151
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:51,040
contributing, not just like Disney has done the pier and old and Coney Island, but now they're

152
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,840
doing like rides just two people built. Disney is nodding to kitschy roadside attractions

153
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:03,120
of like the mid 20th century that theme Disney theme parks and such essentially put out of

154
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,280
business as did interstates. But Chester and Hester are basically doing what Walter and Cordelia not

155
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:16,720
did. But it's for dinosaur bones, not fried chicken and pie, you know? Yes. Yeah. So they,

156
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,600
yeah, if you're going to come to see dinosaur bones and the and meet, uh, what are those doctors names?

157
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:31,520
Oh yeah. I don't remember who any of them are. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Dr. Seeker. If you're going to

158
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:37,280
go to hang out with Dr. Seeker at the Dino Institute while you're here, you might as well

159
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,560
play our scam carnival games and go on our, uh, flimsy rides. We may as well take advantage of you.

160
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,600
These are like, these are Huckster. Chester and Hester are Hucksters. Yeah. That's the name of

161
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:56,800
Hucksters too. They, they slick slick people. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Trying to fool. Yeah. It's like, uh,

162
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,720
entrepreneurs, Michael. Okay. Sorry. Small business heroes. Sorry. Sorry. You won't allow us to

163
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,960
like Chester and Hester. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, so I'm surprised they don't have more like kind of

164
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:16,000
Wisconsin Dell style, like tour, like the fake sifting for gemstones and stuff. Like there should

165
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,560
be even more kind of like, there should be an old West photo opportunity or a dinosaur photo

166
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:26,320
opportunity. There should be more of those like standard. Wasn't there a thing like that? Wasn't

167
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,200
there a, and I don't remember where it was that I want to say is in the, it could be, it's either in

168
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,960
the Sabrina, the teenage witch episode that there's like a digging for bones. Oh, maybe.

169
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:44,400
Attraction. Or is it in like one of those kind of less good, like a Caroline Ray host to either

170
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,080
way it's Sabrina, the teenage witch relate someone from Sabrina Doug for fake bones.

171
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,120
Interesting. We got to find that any, which I think is a little bit of a trick where it's like,

172
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,520
yeah, that makes sense in this area. Also, if you go to any, uh, zoo or aquarium gift shop,

173
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,120
there's a little table with some bones and some sand and a little brush and you can brush the

174
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:15,680
sand off the plastic bones. Which look, it is, it is stuff. It eats up time. It's stuff to distract

175
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:23,920
kids for half an hour to get the line down for dinosaur or the safari. So these things. Yes.

176
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,880
And it's funny. It's just, it's also funny in this, it happens a lot with, I guess, any sort of

177
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,680
creative endeavor is trying to figure out ways that intellectually makes sense for you not to spend

178
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,800
much money in the park. So you have to figure out, okay, how do we just throw a bunch of rides that

179
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:45,040
are already made? Okay. It's a, an old time pier or it's a shitty roadside attraction. Like this is

180
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,880
the imagineers have to solve this problem often where it's like, how do you dress up a very little

181
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,560
budget compared to other things at Disney? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Excuses for attractions to be cheap

182
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:03,040
because then, then they have to gussy it up. Like, well, storyline wise, it's like a kitschy roadside

183
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:10,720
attraction, but the line between kitsch and sheep is so thin. And I watched the one video from like

184
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:18,960
2012, uh, ride through this, uh, already crazy, uh, what HD from 2012 looks like compared to HD from

185
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:26,240
2019. Uh, but the 2019 one, uh, the, the more detail you could see, you could notice how

186
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,880
so many of the signs of this attraction are very dirty. And I don't think that's kitsch. I think

187
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:39,760
that is the elements. Just let it happen. That's the, we have a narrative excuse. I think something

188
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:46,720
that bugs me is that it's just like, okay, a thing or two like this where like it's hokey and it's

189
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,760
supposed to be, and we invented a fun little narrative to sure, but they were doing a lot of

190
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:59,440
that around this time. Oh yeah. This opened in 2002. So we're within the year of early California

191
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,560
adventure where that was all like, yeah, it's look, it's a cheap dinosaur with sunglasses. Yeah. It's

192
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:10,560
all tacky and like, okay, hang on, but you can't pull this on every, like you can't do this over

193
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:17,440
and over again. Yeah. I saw a thing in September of 2000. Uh, they, they announced that new

194
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,160
attractions will be coming to magic kingdom and animal kingdom. Uh, animal kingdom would be

195
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,440
getting Chester and Hester's Dinarama. The magic kingdom would be getting the magic carpets of

196
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,680
Aladdin. So that's a grim press conference day. That's like a, like, oh fuck that. If you don't

197
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:39,280
know that ride, that's just, that's a spinner and you're on carpets instead of elephants.

198
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:48,720
It is so tacky and does not fit into adventure land and Disney world. Uh, that is just awful

199
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,600
looking. And then the other attraction in this area is Triteratops, Triceratops spin,

200
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,040
right? Which is the same, which is another one of those too. So they're just adding these

201
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,360
left and right. Okay. I was, I was doing some, cause when I, once I finally watched a video

202
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,640
of this and saw it aesthetically and then was thinking about the opening, I was just like,

203
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:16,080
this is a, this is a 2002 ass ride. This is so where they're just leaning into the tacky

204
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,000
and the kooky. And I associate this with being kind of a weird cheapo time for Disney.

205
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,800
And then I was like, I had to figure out everything that happened in the, the surrounding

206
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:35,520
year. This is Disney's ride output in 2002. They do this in just a little over two months

207
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,440
journey into imagination with figment. Now, if you don't call primeval world, the worst

208
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,440
attraction at Disney world, you would almost definitely, I think that is the thing edging it

209
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,280
out as worst ride. If we're always talking rides, right? So maybe we take stitches, great escape

210
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,200
out of it, which is technically not a ride. You have to be sitting on something and it has to move.

211
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,600
Yes. Yeah. So the things that move that take you to the worst places and sites, it is probably

212
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,440
this, that figment ride open the same year. So same, same year. And then let's go globally.

213
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:14,080
What did Disney put up ride wise in 2002 journey into imagination with figment,

214
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:21,040
Armageddon, all everything. This is, this was open the same month as Disney studios, Paris,

215
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,320
wow. Gone over worst park they've ever built, which means Armageddon. It means the Paris

216
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:33,680
back lot tour where you see the sets of rain of fire and eaten ash. Bug's land is this year,

217
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,480
which is more charming than the other stuff. However, I'm looks choo choo train would never

218
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,480
be on the list of best Disney attractions. And then you got this primeval world. That's the 2002.

219
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,440
Yep. That's insane. That is so, that is a rough, is this there? It might be their worst year. This

220
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,040
could be Disney's. That's an interesting question. It's in general for us to explore once. What is

221
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,360
the best year and what's the worst year? Well, a couple of thoughts. One, if I, I'm going,

222
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:10,720
if I give them the barest minimum, the, uh, uh, very bare benefit of the doubt, okay. Uh, outside

223
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,080
of Armageddon and a lot of Disney, sewage, Paris park, the commonality and a lot of these attractions

224
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,600
is little kids. A friend of mine recently just took their four year old down there.

225
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:29,600
Kid loved the current journey into imagination. What? They, cause it's figment. They like a four

226
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,880
year old. It's a four. He's got his little jacket on. Yeah. And figment, they bought it, stopped

227
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,840
figments. They didn't find it unpleasant with the like lights out and the skunk in the toilet.

228
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:50,480
I don't think so. I think I, I, and James family too, liked it like both versions, like growing up

229
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,280
and stuff. And so I was with you on, I was like, okay, that makes sense. Cause I feel the same way

230
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,160
I go, I take my boy to universal studios and we go on the little minion spinner. So I like that kind

231
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,080
of stuff more now, but I did not think the end of that sentence was going to be the new figment.

232
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,280
Right. I did not, it had never occurred to me that kids might like that.

233
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:16,320
I think there is some like slapsticky stuff. It's cool when the room is dark and then it's suddenly

234
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:23,600
like a big imagination thing. I think, I think it could just be every room could be a toilet room

235
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,240
as long as there's still a figment there. Yeah. Cute dragon. I think there'll be a decent amount

236
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,920
of kids that like it. Yes. And you don't want to have what we have, which is that we like the

237
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:37,040
previous figment better. If this is the only figment, you know, and he does look the same.

238
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:44,640
They didn't redo him. Other than the bad CGI, the 2002 CGI depiction of him. They should,

239
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,960
every room could be figment just testing out a different like Toto toilet.

240
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,480
Yeah. Well, there's a Toto room. There's a Cola room. There's an American standard room,

241
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,360
you know, and it could just be like, I'm flushing this one. And then it's like another one. And I'm

242
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,840
flushing this one. And then kids would be like, that was pretty good. Oh man. If he flushes one

243
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,000
and then he comes out of it too. Too expensive. Oh, okay. You can put just a head, you can hide

244
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,080
just a head and you don't even have to build the full body. What about it's just pay, it's like a

245
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,560
cardboard. It's cut out. It's not a three-dimensional. Just save some money here.

246
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,600
If he's reaching around the corner to flush it. So you only have an arm and then you only have

247
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,560
a head coming out of it. So that's, that's good. Yeah. That's how you spend smart. It's clock. Oh,

248
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:32,480
it's clocked. And then, Nope, just false alarm. And then he flushes it. I'm flushing this one.

249
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,800
Oh, it happens to the best of them folks. How is all the best toilets, figments, toilet rooms.

250
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:45,120
My poops are rainbow colored. Yeah. Eric Eitel still on the ride in that version.

251
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,240
So that's been a bit of a doubt is that little, little kids will like a lot of this stuff.

252
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,360
Animal kingdom was hurting for stuff for kids to do. We saw my cousin and his family when they

253
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,080
were down there, when we were down there and just talked to them for a few minutes and we were at

254
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,320
animal kingdom and they're like, is there anything for a four year old and a five year old to do here?

255
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:12,720
And I was like, there might be something over in dino land still. And they're like, we're going to

256
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,920
see if the older one can fit on flight of passage. And I'm like, he's not going to, he's not going to

257
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:24,080
be able to stand on his tip toes. You can do the slow boat ride. Yeah. Yeah. I understand. I guess

258
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,120
are they just trapped by that? Like Disneyland doesn't have this problem because they started

259
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,040
with the, with little kid rides. And that was a lot of the initial appeal of it. And those have

260
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:41,040
some caked in charm and you forget, you would never say Mr. Toad, it's just flat characters.

261
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,560
Look how cheap. Yes. Like that's just not the lens with which you view that. Right. You're charmed

262
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,480
by those. There's just in hand, this charm and history. So you aren't running them through the

263
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:59,280
same microscope as like if a new kid's thing is built and kids like big cartoony stuff. So you

264
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,160
might make it look that way, but then it could end up not charming at all. Here's what I would

265
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,400
say to that though. And maybe somebody would tell me that the budget on these things are more than

266
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:16,320
I think. But Toy Story Land to me feels like a good version of this. It's not the most expensive

267
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:23,040
rides in the world. Slinky dog is a coaster. It's got an animatronic on it and the cars are slinky,

268
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:29,520
but they're like slightly better versions. There are another letter grade up from these. Well,

269
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:37,280
and all of those, because Toy Story Land also has one of those, it's like a little engine and then

270
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,400
you're in the supporting car and it whips you around. Here it's the Mater ride. I forget,

271
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:47,120
it's like an alien, it's a flying saucer. It's Little Green Men and it's so fun. Those rides are

272
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,600
so fun. Deceptively fun. Yeah. You completely can take a group of adults on those and they'll be

273
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,400
laughing and smiling when you start whippin' around. So these are all the good versions of,

274
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,920
I assume these are much cheaper than a crazy e-ticket ride, but the theming on these and the

275
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:09,280
ride system itself is much better than just sort of a generic wild coaster with some flat cardboard

276
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:15,840
dinosaurs on the entrance sign. Well, the environment is really fun. There's a lot of big toys everywhere,

277
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:22,480
a lot of big stuff. You're little. And then the lighting and sound and stuff at night is really

278
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,000
fun. Yeah, but it is the budget version. Yeah. It's not Star Wars land budget at all. There's a way

279
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,240
it's expensive, but. Right. And it certainly helps if you're dealing with characters who people have

280
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:39,440
affinity for and not like Hucksters we made up and generic cutout scientists. Can I also say just

281
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,720
before we move on from my theory that 2002 is Disney's worst year, I also, okay, also

282
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,040
things are not getting better because the next year is mission space. Oh yeah. Well, and it's

283
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,440
funny you say that because I was going to say in the Disney war book, it's like,

284
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:04,320
there is, everyone is ecstatic when mission space opens and it's not like we did it. We knocked out

285
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:10,320
of the park. It's like a prize fighter on his last legs who gets a good shot in right as he's just

286
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:17,520
been getting his ass kicked for so long and he does not win the fight, but because it's just like,

287
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,720
the movies are kind of duds. They're still recovering from Euro Disney. They're recovering

288
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,680
from California adventure. So it's like, and we're probably our post nine 11, which when you talk

289
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,960
Disney's worst year, it's possible that it's not 2002 with all these bad rides. It's a,

290
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,800
it's one of the many years where they didn't do anything. Yeah. Well, yeah, you're considering

291
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,840
mission space though, a victory when it was, I'm saying in the book, it was like, I see that

292
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,360
context sucked it up, like even, which is pretty crazy because the ride killed people. Like that's

293
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:56,800
the big success. We are talking these, the boy in a dark time, uh, within the same two years,

294
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:04,080
2002, primeval world, 2003 mission space, both rides killed two people. And I think, I think

295
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,760
believe these are tied for a highest death count on an attraction insane. And they were both built

296
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:16,640
at the same time. And it's weird. It's, isn't it bizarre how often the rides that are dangerous,

297
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,680
that kill people are also the rides that separately from that are not good rides.

298
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,800
Don't like them also. There's a couple of exceptions, but yeah, that does often.

299
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:33,120
Yes. Let's be clear. Good attractions kill people too. Any attraction can kill people, but.

300
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,120
Well, a thing about, I knew about this. I did know about this going in. Uh, I knew about Chester and

301
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,440
Hester's Dinerama. Uh, I was curious if everyone else knew about Chester and Hester, but the other

302
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,720
thing I knew about this is that the ride manufacturer declared bankruptcy in 2008. And

303
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,560
I always heard part of the reason for seasonal operation was it was so hard to get parts. It

304
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:02,400
was so hard to get replacement parts and do upkeep when the manufacturer no longer exists.

305
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:10,560
God. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. Rocking a hard place. Yeah. So just kind of a mercy killing. It

306
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:18,160
seemed like for this thing ultimately, um, yeah, weird, just a grant. And then, okay, well, should

307
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:24,560
we maybe talk about the story? Sure. Yes. Well, okay. So we've established Chester and Hester and

308
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:31,440
you're in this, um, this purposefully janky environment. Yeah. But then the, okay. So what's

309
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:40,240
this within the story? Well, the queue tells a very slim story about being sent back in time,

310
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,960
right before the asteroid hits to the time of the dinosaurs. And if you think, Hey, isn't that the

311
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,760
storyline for, uh, the dinosaur attraction, you are correct. That is the same storyline. But this one

312
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:00,320
is told in the art style of kids, educational toys from the nineties and two thousands,

313
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,880
like the book cover you get for free at school that kind of has like,

314
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,720
it's yes, it's, it's in the style of, uh, Sunday funnies that you ignore.

315
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,600
Well, hold on a second. Jason and I, there's, we don't ignore any of the Sunday funnies.

316
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,880
You know, those weird Sunday funnies that aren't on the comics page, they're kind of like in another

317
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,960
section for some reason. And they're underneath a word puzzle next to classifieds. Yeah. They're

318
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,880
not as good as crankshaft or that, or that like, it's a new board game and it combines four board

319
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,480
games and you build, you use clay, like all these kinds of things. Use clay for a board game. There

320
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,800
was like a board game, like a knowledge board game that had like different tasks and stuff. And it's

321
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:53,680
like, and there's clay and there's puzzle boxes and there's trivia, you know? Yeah. I don't, I think

322
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,080
I know what you're talking about. Or like flash card, those flash cards, those long flash cards

323
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,120
that people would have. I know the long flash card. Yeah. Like that, that is the aesthetic of the queue.

324
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,760
Yeah. It's not, I don't love the art style here. You know, it's funny. I was trying to remember

325
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:16,400
anytime that primeval world had come up and we tweeted a joke about it when it closed and somebody

326
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:23,280
commented, when are you going to do a second gate about the original characters in the queue? Which

327
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:30,240
I, they're not wrong. Like there are characters to talk about. At the end of the ride, you run into a,

328
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:37,760
like a, he's like got big coke rim, coke bottle glasses. He's a scientist who's bald and with a

329
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:45,040
white mustache and he's holding up a sign that says, yeah. And this is this guy, there's yeah sign

330
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:52,960
guy. And there's kind of like Nickelodeon 90s style horn rim glasses. There's all kinds of glasses.

331
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,320
With these characters that are our friends, the kooky scientists. We don't have a lot of other

332
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:05,280
info to ascribe to them, but I guess this is technically that episode where we discuss our

333
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:14,000
friends. Yeah. Do you, do you, do we like any individuals within this unpleasant art? No,

334
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:22,320
is the answer no. I find all pretty unpleasant. I'd like to, I'd like to be a contrarian and be

335
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,200
like, no, you know what? Actually these pictures suggest an interesting person and an interesting

336
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,160
character. Here's what I'm going to say. I don't think I care for the scientists. I don't wish them

337
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:40,720
ill. They say they all seem like nice people, but you know, I kind of like are some of the dinosaurs.

338
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,160
Yeah, sure. Throughout the attraction, because remember we're going back to right before the

339
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:53,600
asteroid hit. And so it's not in this ride, a scene of horror and screaming that's for dinosaur.

340
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:59,680
You go on the dinosaur ride. If you want to hear screams front to back, along with loud

341
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:09,680
thunder claps and a, a like distorted audio on your Jeep. Here it's kind of like,

342
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,920
it's all dinosaurs going like, I'm getting out of this joint. There are like, there's thought

343
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:23,520
bubbles and signs that indicate like, Ooh, yikes. Guess the, uh, Hey, one ticket to, uh, next

344
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:30,400
available planet. Right. It's a very cute extinction event. The event is very cute.

345
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,960
You know what? Yes. The cutest that an extinction event could be like the picture on the top,

346
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,720
like the sign on the top of the ride is, is kind of cute. Yeah. Oh, and the Whirly gig,

347
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,400
there's like little gear, dinosaurs, dinosaurs moving a little above the entrance. Oh,

348
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:53,760
are there legs kicking like it's probably a gear, but it looks like it could be the wind doing it.

349
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,400
Just kind of like a simple machine, a little bit kind of cute. I think, uh, one thing I think they

350
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,680
maybe considered when they're like, we don't have a lot of money. What can we get away with here?

351
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,240
Someone might've chimed in, Hey, you know, um, kids just love dinosaurs. A lot of them,

352
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,760
they're either terrified of them or they love them. So if we play to the ones that love them,

353
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:24,720
we probably don't need to do a lot, you know? Yeah, that's true. Just show dinosaurs at all.

354
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:31,440
Um, include it. So this is the one I'm just fully on board with. I fully support this dinosaur who

355
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,960
is ducking a, like a pretty hokey comet is going by above his head and he has a quote bubble. It

356
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:47,760
says, yikes. I like yikes dinosaur, which is so being that I like any element of this, I think

357
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,280
notches, I think there's no way it's worst Disney world attraction just by shared virtue of yikes

358
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,840
dinosaur for me. That's my, yeah, that's the, that's the kitsch at least. That's at least,

359
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:04,000
I think fairly successful kitsch that you could point to in the whole dino land where it is like

360
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,520
the thing I was holding up is a dinosaur. That's like, he's getting hit with like a, like a,

361
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,160
an asteroid, like it's a beach ball or something. Like he's getting hit from behind on the beach

362
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,880
or something. He's like, Oh, like, well, that's going to be a problem versus like, Oh, my whole

363
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,880
species is going to be wiped out now. Maybe that's a yes. They don't know the extent of it,

364
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,240
much like humans in many ways. Well, that's, you can say, figured it out, figured it out to make

365
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,400
that point as well about certain things that are happening. Um, but yes, it is a very ridiculous

366
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,520
way to present this thing that happened to that wiped out all the dinosaurs. Yeah, look, you end

367
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:48,080
up with, I think it'd be, boy, we would be cold hearted, the three of us to not enjoy the depiction

368
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:53,520
of any cartoon character holding a bindle. We got a bindle. Yeah. Yeah. No, you're right. You're

369
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,640
running away and looking, but I really like any of them given side eye to the com comets. Well,

370
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:04,160
you're saying Mike, like we take all the drama as opposed to this screeching ride next door

371
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,400
that it's all these dinosaurs go, Oh, and they got suitcases. And one of them said, there's a quote

372
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,480
bubble of one. It's really, it's small. It's easy to miss. And it says this really extinct.

373
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:21,120
Yeah, that's horrible, but I kind of like how clunky it is. I'm dry. I hadn't even thought

374
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:27,680
about this pre the episode. I'm discovering the joy of these slightly worried dinosaurs who were

375
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,120
about to die in the moment. I think this is, uh, I actually like them. You know what? I don't mind

376
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,120
this at all. You've, you've convinced me. Yeah, you're right. You're right. It is kind of a fun

377
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:43,280
commentary on the dinosaur ride where it's like deadly serious. And then here it's more like,

378
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,120
it's a living. Well, here's what, uh, because this, I was, I feel like I had run into defense

379
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:56,480
of this attraction from Mr. Animal Kingdom himself, Joe roadie, who, you know, will go on massive,

380
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:02,240
many paragraph tears, uh, in defense of like a piece of sheet metal or whatever. Yeah. Which

381
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,480
am I, I've said this before, around the show. My dream is to get him to assess like the inside of

382
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,160
an Applebee's in that way, right? Like 12 paragraphs about the design of an Applebee's, uh,

383
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,880
you know, and Apple, Applebee's is great. I, I, I would only, uh, I, I recently became fond of,

384
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,520
of red Robin. We just talked to that and I would love to hear his thoughts about what I, the,

385
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,800
one of the things I found the American flag made of baseballs. I think there's a thesis to be,

386
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,400
I think he would like, enjoy the symbolism of that and find something profound about it. Um,

387
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,000
I found the board game I was talking about, if you were to call cranium,

388
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,120
Hmm.

389
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,120


390
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:44,240
It's kind of a different, that I think had like,

391
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,520
confusing to me the clay.

392
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:53,120
I think that was like, um, kind of a version of charades or, um, what's the one where you draw

393
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:59,120
it and you guess, try to guess like what you're like, Pictionary. I think that was like,

394
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,440
you get a word and you have to shape it in the clay and they have to guess what the shape,

395
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,760
what the item is that you've constructed.

396
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,680
Good enough at clay make maybe only a roadie would be good at this.

397
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,160
Yeah.

398
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,440
It wasn't like a pottery. You didn't get a pottery wheel with the game.

399
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,040
No, you got a pristine thing of clay that eventually probably became disgusting after like,

400
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,080
Quickly, right?

401
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,720
Quickly.

402
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,120
Yeah.

403
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:26,960
Yeah. So cranium, I mean, they, uh, I forget this artist name. There's a certain artist or

404
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:33,760
illustrator style it has, but just in the juxtaposition of styles. This is very much of

405
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,120
the cranium era of kids education.

406
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,040
We did have poopy loaf. We had cranium, I think.

407
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,400
What I was heading for with roadie, he Instagrammed about this in 2018. It is perhaps

408
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,800
lost on many guests that the primeval world ride is supposed to be a down home parody of dinosaur.

409
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:59,360
So he justifies this. It is a parody of another ride. Again, I think it's, it's,

410
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,280
it's a little bit of a stretch. I see that now and I appreciate it. I don't think it's a well

411
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,960
done enough. I think we're doing a lot of like excuse making.

412
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,440
Yeah. The ride itself is not a parody.

413
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,280
No, the ride is not that good rides. Just like it's a roller coaster with three drops and the

414
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,400
drops seem kind of unpleasant and then the spinning. See it's, I don't recommend watching

415
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,200
ride throughs of this. They're kind of nauseating.

416
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,480
Yeah, right. No, I completely agree. Uh, if it was like a Mr. Toad style dark ride with like flats

417
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,600
and like, Oh, here it comes. Guess we're all going to die. Like if that was the idea, then

418
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,440
that's a full parody, but just a wild mouse coaster and then some fun signs.

419
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:44,960
Yeah. Yeah. Not quite, but yeah, yeah. I hate to disagree with Joe, but I, I at least appreciate

420
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,760
they, this is all imagineers trying to have some fun in a not great situation, much like the

421
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,840
dinosaurs running away with their bindles and suitcases. They are trying to make light of a

422
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:04,320
dark era in time. And in this case in the Walt Disney company. And I appreciate the backstory.

423
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:11,680
And I guess that combined with, well, this coaster, uh, it's probably very fun for little kids and

424
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:18,320
families and it's not super intimidating looking. No, but it's scarier than it is scary. It's scary.

425
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:23,280
But after the first one or two times, I'm almost going off the edge. You laugh a little. Yeah,

426
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,000
but I don't, I don't want to do it. Well, let's talk a little about that. And some of this can be

427
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,840
say, you know, we'll talk about some of these other ones, goofy sky school someday, but I,

428
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:37,360
I don't ever do these. And when I'm on them, I, if I do it, I am regretting it. And when that,

429
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:44,560
when I see that first drop and I see how severe it is, what is it? It's like I've done bigger drops,

430
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:51,360
but on everything too slow. Everything with coasters for with me is that the stuff that's

431
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:57,280
slow, that's the stuff that's designed to chill. I don't like the stuff that's designed to thrill.

432
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:03,520
I'm on board for it. So I am anti chill when it comes to coasters. What about spill?

433
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,560
Well, spill seems like it's an accident. So no, I'm anti spill. And what about kill? Well,

434
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:17,680
it's a ride designed to kill. I don't think any of this. Well, if it's, if it's used in the,

435
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,680
in the way that you're just going to guess, they'll have a perfect experience than yes.

436
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:29,360
But like, like hang time at knots, the chill part that's straight up 90 degrees and the dangles,

437
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,680
you know, I don't need that. I don't think that's very chill. I think that's meh too.

438
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,760
I mean chill like chill. Oh, I thought you meant thrill and chill. Thrills and chills. I think in

439
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,960
the context of thrills and chills means chills like this. You were saying all these words and

440
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,600
it's honestly making me feel like I'm at a marking meeting for Dairy Queen. Like, all right. And this

441
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:54,880
entree thrills and then this chills. Jason, that's grill and chill. Well, that is grill and chill.

442
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:01,280
So that's there. The DKs that are branded, so they have food and additional ice cream are

443
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,960
DK, a Brazil grill and chills. That's the actual name of it. It's a DQ express. Then there's no

444
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,160
grill. I believe so. And I don't know if the grill and chill, at least in Rockford, Illinois,

445
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,000
that was the branding on the DQ that had like a much bigger expanded menu. Yes. It was grill and

446
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,040
chill. So no, I'm not talking about grills. I'm talking about thrills and chills. Chills meaning

447
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,760
like you're a little scared. You're chattering. You're chattering. Not chill like you're cool.

448
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:36,320
Everything's groovy. So yeah. So like on, yeah, the wild mouse coasters are all chills to me.

449
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:42,080
There's no thrills. I'm not having any thrills. Yeah. I'm glad you mapped this out further.

450
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,200
Cause yeah, all chills. It's all chills. And I, yeah, with, with being up that high, I'll,

451
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,680
I'll even say this. All the spinner rides at California Adventure are chills to me. I don't

452
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:57,440
get much thrill on them. I feel scared. And then like swings on the silly symphony swings or that

453
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:06,320
other Zephyr thing. Does this help explain some of the, the haunt desires and changes in attitude?

454
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:11,280
Like maybe none of us and some of the changes in latitude, which happened in this, this attraction,

455
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,400
have you, maybe you don't, maybe in haunts, you want thrills, not chills.

456
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,960
Well, thrills, I, I'm, I love thrills. The rules are really great. Sometimes they're a little too

457
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,240
extreme, like on twisted Colossus at six flags, cause they're so fast and so out of control.

458
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,120
But I think if I do that again, I'll get a little more used to the speed and the velocity.

459
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:41,280
But yes, I've, I've never been a big fan of chills. So I'm still trying to get into chills

460
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,520
in general. Mike likes thrill. Mike loves thrills. Mike hates chills. Yeah. And would you say we're

461
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:54,880
all anti chill and in some, some way, I guess so. I have not thought about, I've never thought of

462
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,040
anything an attraction does to you is giving you chills. But like, so I have to really, I got to

463
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,160
wrap my head around it one ride at a time. That's true. You're, you're describing unease.

464
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,840
Yeah, it's like in credit coaster is a great coaster because you never really get,

465
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:16,480
there's never a chill on it because it's, it's mostly all fast. No chill. There's the big drop

466
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,480
that happens that you can, I guess you could get a little chill cause it's pretty steep if you have

467
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,600
don't go on a lot of coasters, but not really. It's, it doesn't give you the time for your brain

468
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:30,800
to interpret things as a chill. Isn't it a chill at the beginning before the thrill?

469
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,920
Yeah, but it's so quick. Just a little, it's a tiny chill. It's a tiny five, four, three, two,

470
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,080
one. What's, what is a kid's name? Dash. Dash. Yeah. Dash and Neil Patrick Harris.

471
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,120
Yeah. So it's like quick. It's so quick. That's my, that's my dream. And that's when I started

472
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,440
going on coasters, like rock and roller coaster as a kid. And I was like, Oh good. You don't have to

473
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:55,360
do the whole, like you're ascending slowly. Cause that would stress me out as a kid. So,

474
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:03,440
so nervous anticipation equals chills. Yes. And while it can chills happen within the body of a

475
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:09,040
ride or is it only absolutely they can. Cause like for instance, twisted colossus does have

476
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,800
an ascending part. It's not that steep, which isn't a problem, but it does send a chill up my

477
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,520
spine again. Cause it's the thrills have stopped. So the twisted colossus basically there's two

478
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:25,040
tracks. You go up, up, up, up slowly, then you go nuts. And as Geo says, it releases the chemical

479
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,760
in your brain that just like is supposed to numb you. And then you drop, you go through the whole

480
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,360
thing and then you go up again, you do the ascent again. So there's a chill in there where, I mean,

481
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:39,360
I guess you could also call it a catch your breath moment as well. Cause you're just so relieved.

482
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:44,160
The first part's over. Is it okay. Let's go elsewhere in animal kingdom expedition Everest.

483
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:50,640
I, is it, is it considered a chill when you get to the top of the mountain? Yes. Okay. That's a

484
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:58,880
chill. Maybe kind of a chill in the Yeti beat because things sort of stop again. So any moment

485
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:05,760
of anticipation and right, I would say those are minor chills for me. Can a drop be a chill

486
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:13,760
or is a drop always a thrill? I think a drop is 90% a thrill. Cause like the drop again, it's,

487
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:20,480
and there's some people that don't like thrills. So they could have the total opposite feeling is

488
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:26,160
that they don't like that part. Would it an all chill experience might be walking a tight rope

489
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,240
and the only thrill would happen if you fell and it would be your last thrill.

490
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:36,000
A hundred percent. A tight rope is all chill unless you're like your brain is wired differently

491
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,360
and you think it's confusing because chill does sound like chill. I think you have to pluralize

492
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:48,240
it. I think the only way it works for me chills is different than chills. Okay. Cause usually,

493
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:53,040
yeah, you're right. The expression is usually like thrills and chills. Yeah. It has to be

494
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:59,280
pluralized. It has to be singular is chilling. Right. Okay. Right. That is calming. Okay. So

495
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:06,320
when we're talking about chills, we're talking about plural chills, but I think, I think most

496
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:13,920
people are more anti-chills than thrills. Okay. Yeah. I think so. This is fascinating to me. This

497
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,440
is a new, your brain has been working with this rubric the whole time. Yeah. We've never heard

498
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:26,320
it broken down this way. Yeah. How does this work for like Halloween Horror Nights houses?

499
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:34,320
Like it's all chills. It's all, it's not thrills. It's not, no, it's, it's all chills. And you're

500
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:40,080
trying to, what has been the recalibration for me going through the haunted houses is recalibrating

501
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:47,680
my brain to get the same excitement from a chill that it gets from a thrill. Because like you've

502
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,240
talked about like different, it's a different feeling. Yeah. But isn't when something jumps out,

503
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:59,200
doesn't that feels more like a thrill to me than a chill from how you've characterized it chills

504
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:04,880
are something's going to happen and I'm nervous about the thing. There's a lot of anticipation.

505
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:11,280
It's almost all anticipation. Like the Us house, you talked about how unnerving it was to just

506
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,320
walk into an empty living room. Like dark, empty living room from the movie Us and just kind of

507
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:24,080
standing there. So much of it is chill. So much of it's chills that you're right, that you're right.

508
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:30,960
The jumping out does give you a little jolt and I guess you could, it's like in a sub genre of

509
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:38,560
thrills, but by and large you're going in there and you're tense and it's all, it's, I feel like

510
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:47,120
it's 80% chills. It's 80% anticipation of what is going to happen. And the change is getting to the

511
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:53,440
point where you enjoy that. And that is where I'm, I'm still struggling a little bit with it in that

512
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,480
different aspects, like a Minotaur based escape rooms. Well, what was the percentage there?

513
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,520
How did chills and thrills factor into that experience? It was all chills.

514
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,400
It was nothing but chills. It was a COVID mask wearing chills.

515
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:14,560
Real world chills. In addition to my sort of whatever you would call it, claustrophobia fear

516
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:21,680
or I don't know, some sort of anxiety that just popped up. But when Lindsay went with me

517
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,640
two years ago, whatever, however long this goddamn pandemic has been going, three years ago,

518
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:33,600
the first house she was experiencing total chills and hated it. She was just pure. It was pure

519
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:39,760
chills, no thrills. And then the second house, her, she did admit her brain recalibrated a little bit

520
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:46,240
to start enjoying some of the chills more. I think you've helped elucidate if anyone can

521
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,800
track any of this, if you can successfully recalibrate your brain to understand the

522
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,400
difference between thrills and chills. I now see that your haunt journey has been shifting.

523
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:02,560
Your body has to become a machine that converts chills into thrills. You have to do alchemy,

524
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:09,440
chill based alchemy to convert the chills. So after the first house, you might be saying,

525
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,320
nope. You might be saying Jordan Peele's, nope. But then at the second house, you'll be saying,

526
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:22,000
yes. You might be wishing to get out. Then you say, nope. So much. You want to get out until you

527
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:31,680
say, it feels like they're out to get us. Yes, exactly. Yes. Perfect. Yes. Well, yeah, I think,

528
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:36,320
I feel like I have, I feel like we've mapped your brain by breaking down this chills and thrills.

529
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,600
I think your brain's worked the same way. I think you've just never thought about it like this.

530
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,520
Yeah, I haven't done. I mean, we've both talked about, I think we've both been doing a little

531
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,920
exposure therapy of like watching the horror movies we didn't watch as children. Yes. Or in

532
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:56,480
my case, like there's images just glued in my brain from like VHS boxes or Fangoria magazine covers.

533
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:04,240
Big ups to Rob Zombie for apparently recreating a Fangoria magazine photo spread in movie form in

534
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:11,440
that monster's trailer. I'm giving in the vet of the doubt. But yeah, like I'm fascinated. I am

535
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:17,280
fascinated by the world of horror because it's like a whole world with its own movies and TV

536
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:23,760
and fandom and magazines. And yeah, it's comic book adjacent. And I wish I was into it. But it's very

537
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,560
alien to me. You got to watch Bram Stoker's Dracula though. Oh, I've seen Bram Stoker. Oh, you have.

538
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,240
Yeah, that's great. So great. Have you seen Scott? Have we talked about this in the show before? Yes.

539
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,840
Yeah, okay. Five timers. I think this is a second. I was going to say it's a two. But a two is always

540
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,680
a candidate for a five. Yeah, for sure. I think I'll remember this though and not bring it up

541
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:47,760
until you see it and you go, oh my God, it's the greatest. Yeah. Okay. What else about this?

542
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:55,440
Let's talk about that asphalt, Jason. This is one of these defenses, every article about this ride.

543
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,320
Do you want to break down this asphalt thing? Well, I just saw it a little and like I looked

544
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:05,440
at the pictures and I was kind of like, I get like even even they're losing me with this, which is

545
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:12,320
that they painted this quote unquote lot, which it's not really a facsimile of a lot. It is a lot.

546
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:19,920
Yes. It's the rides in this area are just on a parking lot. It feels like a carnival built in a

547
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:26,240
church parking lot. And it looks a little fucked up. There's big cracks in the concrete. But if also

548
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:32,400
if you've got people walking on it for 20 years on the Florida elements, it gets more fucked up too.

549
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:39,760
So they have an excuse. But what the defense of it is that no, no, no, the cracked concrete was a

550
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:45,840
choice. It was a carefully because there wasn't a lot there. So we made a choice in the style of

551
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:52,000
concrete lot that we built. We wanted it to feel like just a janky place and not a manufactured

552
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,560
Disneyland type environment. So the concrete cracks were on purpose. Does that shut everyone

553
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:07,120
up? Well, I not Mike, I appreciate this. I appreciate the thought exercise, but what's

554
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:14,080
the perception? What do regular people, even people like us who do the extra mile of looking

555
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:19,120
into it or paying attention to details, like what is the perception? You know, because I don't think

556
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:24,160
most people that go into this dino land or went into this were like, oh, I understand exactly what

557
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:31,200
this is. All they know is they just went by like much more highly themed buildings and experiences.

558
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,720
And now they're in a place and they're not articulating this because dad doesn't give a

559
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:40,000
shit. Dad's just tired. He wants to get into American dishing. But it's not like, it's not

560
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,280
like you hear that and you go, oh, what a great thing. Like, oh, what a, because there's plenty of

561
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,760
stupid nerd stuff that we go, oh, wow, that's a really cool little detail. But I don't know.

562
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:56,640
This is just, I don't know. In animal kingdom. Yeah. Any little details were like, oh, that's great.

563
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:02,960
Yeah. And like wear and tear that is on purpose, like, like a collapsing roof or structure that

564
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,680
was designed that way. This doesn't count as that. And this is not, it would be, you know what, it'd

565
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,960
be really funny if it was like they did build like the front of a church and that's where you go into

566
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,360
like use of the bathroom because it was like, we set this up in a parking lot, like a carnival.

567
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:22,640
Like you could do something like that and really like flesh out that idea that this is like a

568
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:28,480
temporary little thing. People love church gags. Yeah. People love church guys. Why are there more

569
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:34,560
fake churches in the Disney parks? I have the faithful, a lot of them famously love to laugh.

570
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:40,080
That's true. I love that. I guess really why would you build a fake church inside a real church?

571
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:46,160
If you know what I'm saying, the Disney parks are a church. They're our church.

572
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:55,680
If you're comparing wild mouse coasters, I mean, I think that I don't like to go on it that much,

573
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:00,640
but I think that sky school is more charming. I think there's, I watched a video of that and like,

574
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,880
okay, every little goofy billboard is fun and there's a little bit of animation to it.

575
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:10,800
Uh, I'm, and so I was like, is this the worst one of these they did? And, and, and to make sure I

576
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:16,880
watched a video of the California adventure, original wild mouse coaster Mulholland madness.

577
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:23,840
Yes. Well, Holland madness is worse because this lift hill that you're doing on primeval world,

578
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:31,200
it's silly. It's all like misshapen clocks and doodads and swirls. And I showed up the errand.

579
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,120
She said the same thing I thought, which is this just looks like Seuss landing. It's extremely

580
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:40,400
Dr. Susie. Yeah. Several years after that was built. So that's the, how the colors look. So I

581
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,920
don't like that. You're like, why are we in Dr. Seuss aesthetic? However, and the colors are tacky

582
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:52,000
again, very 2002 S ride. Um, but then I watched them all Holland madness, which is worse than I

583
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:01,760
remember. That's just all like, uh, pipes and, uh, and then structures and then yellow road signs.

584
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:08,800
It's like going to the storage facility for Caltrans. It's, it's so nothing. It is like,

585
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:14,320
it's absolutely worse than I remember. There's one little doodle of a dip shit going like,

586
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:20,960
can I get a cappuccino? Just like the shittiest looking guy. I think I went on Mulholland,

587
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:26,960
Mulholland madness once and goofy sky school once. And yeah, my memory is yeah, Mulholland

588
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,200
madness. They did it, but there's more like it's, it's aesthetically more pleasant now. I,

589
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:38,000
I couldn't believe how much worse Mulholland madness was just true indefensible garbage.

590
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,840
Yeah. I was trying to figure out if no, and I feel stupid for even bringing this up. Now I was

591
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:49,120
looking it up. The raging spirits coaster in Disney sea is not a wild mouse. It's not, it's

592
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:54,960
it feels like a super version version. Like a cool, cool. It's really cool. And it's a short

593
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,880
ride, but it's really cool. But yeah, I don't think it's, it feels similar in that it's like,

594
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,040
it's all packed into a very little space. That's kind of a fun thing about this attraction that

595
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:07,600
you're like, that it is just like, it's, it's all right on top of each other and cars are zipping

596
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,760
by you and then you go under this one and through this one. Yeah. Um, but that's like the ultimate

597
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,720
version of it. There are thrills, legit thrills on that. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And that's the one where

598
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,520
that's one where they scared me that I was too tall to ride it, that I was barely

599
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,160
under how much you needed to be. What happens to me? I don't want, and they look scared.

600
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:34,960
It brought me to this point. I, and maybe this, we could start winding it down, but the, I had

601
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:44,240
the thought of, could we invent a 2002 S Disney ride? Like, can we invent a Disney cheap on purpose

602
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:51,520
wild mouse coaster from this where it has a built in? No, no, no. It's supposed to be not.

603
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:57,040
And I have just a starting point for one, which is again, and think about what else is going on with

604
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:03,840
Disney 2002. Cause I looked up what movies they put out that year. Let's go. Let's fucking go.

605
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,440
Snow dogs, treasure planet, the hot chick.

606
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:17,120
Wow. That's a pretty funny shitty, really?

607
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:23,920
Early Rachel McAdams, uh, doing as best she can in a shitty. I like her. Um, what, who is that?

608
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:32,800
A dimension release or a touchstone? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, rain of fire, eight Nash, um, country bears.

609
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,960
So things are looking up. Okay. It wasn't so good of a list, but now country bears, which we all agree

610
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:43,280
that we like very much. And then, um, and, and, uh, hunchback two was that year.

611
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,760
Delighted talking about when Shane was here. So I'm like, Oh, this is peak. Oh, this is straight

612
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:55,600
to DVD times. That's another thing of the darkness of this era for Disney. But so they're big into

613
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:02,080
the DVD market and pumping out that shit. Maybe that's an attraction is the Disney DVD factory.

614
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:10,320
It's the plan where they're putting out lady in the tramp six, right? And aristocats for like,

615
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:18,880
so there DVDs are fly. So you are, are you a crate of DVDs? Are you, are you a DVD?

616
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:24,640
And then there's like something above you that's going to stamp a label on you.

617
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:30,240
How will we start with this? We just, since it's gotta be as cheap as possible, it's just a

618
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:36,800
repurposed version of the Aerosmith French, uh, sign that has CDs on it. Yeah. Oh yeah. They've

619
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:42,480
already made that big CD also made in this same year. That's also a 2002. Yeah. So we know they,

620
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:47,280
they can print that for, they can print us a big CD. Okay. Yeah. So, so you're, uh,

621
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:55,840
you're going through, yeah. Are you, are you the actual like laser that's printing? I think you're

622
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:02,800
the, I think you're a, a DVD. You're, you're, you're, you're fresh out of the, the DVD oven

623
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:09,440
and now a movie has to get encoded on it. So you're avoiding lasers and avoid, no, you can't avoid

624
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:16,320
them. Cause yeah, you'd be pro. You want it. You'd want like to be, or you, maybe you're in a DVD

625
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:20,560
factory. So this conveyor belts next to you are just dumping. And this actually is where they're,

626
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:27,520
cause they got so many of these. Yeah. They have, they're making sequels to everything. Uh, so it's

627
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:32,320
like, like here's, here's a, like, here's an adventure. That's just the penguin. It's where

628
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:38,960
the penguins and Mary Poppins go to outer space. It has, it has three frames a second. So they

629
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:44,560
got to get all these DVDs out for penguin space adventure. Um, so, but, so they are making them

630
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:49,520
practically in the facility and maybe you're like an employee going to check on the machine,

631
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:55,520
but then you get caught in the crazy gears of it. So you're, so you're now avoiding a laser that's

632
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:01,600
going to encode aristocat seven onto your forehead. So it's a quality control. You're a quality control

633
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:07,840
sort of officer. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. There's a problem in the DVD factory. You have to go fix it.

634
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:12,400
Okay. It's all going haywire. Maybe at some point you go through, you know, you always accidentally

635
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:19,200
go like an address or a Cove or like you go down the closed path and it's like, oh no,

636
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,720
they're going down the path that slides the DVDs into little paper envelopes that are sold for

637
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:31,520
$2 at seven 11. And this I never see those like at a gas station or stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

638
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:36,080
There's surplus DVDs that have somehow been removed from their boxes and put in like weird

639
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:41,760
little shitty cardboard boxes or paper envelopes. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's how you can get the

640
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:48,560
transporter three for like $3. And that's paper Cove down there. We got to avoid paper code. And

641
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:55,360
this all has to be indicated with like six flat signs. Yeah. Yeah. We are nothing that, you know,

642
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:01,680
these have to be made in a day. Yeah. And not, and not even by like an artist, but by like more of

643
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:08,160
a stencil or like somebody who would like make a stencil on a crate to say there's ball bearings

644
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:14,160
in it. The pre show is a guy coming in like, oh good, you're all here. Sorry. We were just coming

645
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:20,160
up with different slogans for the front of the boxes, like bigger, louder and uncouth, you know,

646
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:26,400
like all that, like, uh, well there's little like, like cutout guys and like this ride, but they

647
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:34,000
aren't scientists. They are people on the computer looking for like a podunk movie reviewers at local

648
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:40,640
outlets willing to give these movies good reviews. Like is somebody in Omaha willing to say that

649
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:48,560
Pocahontas four isn't dog shit? Right. Well, I have to say that the hot chick boy edition was

650
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:57,280
actually a lot. It was better than just the regular theatrical version. Can we find a room

651
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:05,840
for a character named Dick Van Diske DVD? Oh, he does a little soft. He does a little. It's not Dick Van Dyke.

652
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:10,720
It's too expensive to get him, but it's like a, it doesn't even have to be a sound to like.

653
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:16,560
It could just be. Maybe he stamps the labels on with, he puts labels on his feet and then does a

654
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:20,240
soft shoe. It's drawn. That's a picture of somebody indicates and it's confusing, but you're right.

655
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:26,080
Yeah. That's what he does. He dances the title on a disc. Which with a, with a cardboard flat,

656
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:31,840
he's just like holding up a straw boater and he's like, one foot is in the air in a weird way. So

657
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,560
it's like, Oh, I guess he's dancing. He looks like he's tripping.

658
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,360
And at the very end, maybe there's let's, let's really go for broke and get a big,

659
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:48,720
wooden Michael Eisner in there. And he's got a big rubber stamp that says approved,

660
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:54,880
which he will of course put on anything as long as the production cost is less than 50 grand.

661
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,080
And just cause I've said it now, this is a second timer, as I'm about to say, but there's a,

662
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:04,640
I'm part of the, like the charter or whatever he's signing or the proposal, it just says,

663
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:11,360
sell a grilled cheese in a Disney store. And he said, yes, Michael, you already did this 10 years

664
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:19,360
ago. The gift shop speaks for itself. It looks like a fucking Sam goody. It's just walls of these.

665
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:25,680
Hey, I hate to blow up this concept, but here, hear me out. There's another version of this

666
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:30,080
where DVDs, I know it's a little too early for 2002, but maybe it's a couple of years later.

667
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:35,760
DVDs are becoming extinct because streaming is coming. So streaming is streaming out of the sky.

668
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:41,120
Oh, it's like big scary lights in every Marvel movie where a big light is shooting.

669
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:44,160
And DVDs are saying, Oh, time to go.

670
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:51,200
They're just like trying to run the money printer. Like it's like, Oh,

671
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:56,240
we got a couple more dollars out of this thing. Yeah. Nowhere I can find a good clearance sale.

672
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:02,480
Yes. Point me to the nearest fries electronics. We're going to all be in the landfill soon. And

673
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:09,520
like ones like kind of got the Cathy expression. Like making these with little eyes. Yeah. DVD.

674
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:16,400
Yeah. So it's a mass extinction events with DVDs. And yeah, streaming is represented by,

675
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,600
I guess, like the light of God coming out of the clouds or something.

676
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:26,320
Wow. Wow. This, this extents. Yeah. So you could have DVDs of dinosaur.

677
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:31,520
Yes, exactly. And they are going extinct. Is there a dinosaur too? Is there a

678
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:37,520
directed DVD dinosaur? Or was it just too expensive? Yeah. Yeah. They were, I don't know.

679
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:42,640
They were going to have to do it with puppets maybe, or like with unsold Aladar toys. Yeah.

680
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:46,880
No matter round up all these guys like are still in the garage. Thanks Griffin. Yeah.

681
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:53,120
Just pop it. Yeah. The, the, the Buzz Lightyear. Yeah. The animated show that I,

682
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:59,040
I will watch on UPN, which we later on found out after we did the Buzz Lightyear episode,

683
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:04,400
it's like they weren't Pixar did not enjoy that. They weren't happy with that. That was happening.

684
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,760
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that was in the era of Disney. That was another dark thing is like,

685
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,920
maybe they're going to lose Pixar. Like, yeah, you're in our machine now. We're going to do

686
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:17,120
whatever bullshit with Buzz Lightyear. Yes. Is there's like make Toy Story 2 and make it bad.

687
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:25,040
We want it bad. We want to punish them. We need your approval stamp on Toy Story 2. Um, is it bad?

688
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:32,160
If it's bad, I'm going to do it. And imagine Pixar Pixar is newest co-release with Paramat.

689
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:38,320
Like, like whose fortunes would have been buoyed by Pixar had they left? Yeah. Yeah. Very good.

690
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:43,120
Yeah. Good point. Weird. Well, this, I think that's a, that's, that doesn't blow it up. That's a punch

691
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:49,840
up. Yeah. Do we have a name for it though? Countdown to DVD extinction. Um, what, what does it call

692
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:55,920
when there's like a big, when there's a change of format media chain? Uh, yeah. Meteor. Meteor.

693
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:03,920
Meteor. Oh, that's good. Yeah. The meteor, the, the media, the meteor, meteorites.

694
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:12,480
Meteoric shift. It's a meat. It's so it's like, um, it, it is a, the change that's coming is

695
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:20,560
meteoric for the industry, but for the physical media. Yeah. Sure. DVDs. Meteoric shift colon.

696
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:27,840
Huh. Guess I gotta buy this thing now. Which the dads are like, oh, are you right? Right. How many

697
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:33,760
more, how many different versions are we going to have of Aladdin? What Cinderella so many times.

698
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:41,680
VHS DVD, blue ray, Disney plus. And then there's a little, at the end, there's a little like,

699
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:45,520
I don't know how it would be best represented, but it's like somebody being like, hold on to

700
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:51,280
your physical media. Hold on. You know, you're going to get priced out of everything. Eventually.

701
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:58,080
Hold on. One little, one little cracked DVD in the corner, whispering to you. We're not gone yet.

702
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:03,600
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Rebecca. He's owning physical copies. Um, every movie will cost

703
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,400
a hundred dollars and I'm going to be Googling your whole life. What movie is where on what

704
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:15,200
streamer and I've got the episodes. Peacock won't put up. She's naughty. Disney plus isn't going to

705
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:20,800
put up those Simpson commentary tricks. Hold onto your DVDs. All the streamers are going to be called

706
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:28,240
like goopy or two blip or you're not going to know which is which. Something is vandalizing.

707
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:42,400
I've got the asses. No asses on Disney plus. I have the only I have Darrell Hannah's double's

708
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:49,760
butt from splats. Right. I think it's a great ride. That's a great ride. Oh my God. Well,

709
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:56,560
you survived the discussion of a lesser ride than this admittedly primeval world, but boy,

710
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,760
you know, I didn't know if we were going to enter into a miserable episode. We're talking about,

711
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:05,440
oh, it's just a bummer and a boy, a bunch of crap. I think we had a lot of fun. I think we found some

712
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:10,560
stuff to like about this thing. I would say you guys tell me, I would say definitively not the worst

713
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:16,960
ride ever at Disney. Hey, it's colorful. It's got a lot of colors. Just that is something. Yes. Do

714
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:21,440
we? Did we? Are we going to officially name what the best ride is? Are we going to save that for a

715
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:26,400
different episode? You say the best. I meant the worst. Okay. I'm very tired. That doesn't sound

716
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,720
like us. Just talk about the best ride. It just, you know, that's true. Well, we would have to

717
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:36,960
shit. Um, is it those magic carpets are a little pretty rough.

718
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:43,120
Solid can't. Well, let's not over to, we won't, we won't discuss it. We'll, we'll like, what's,

719
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,400
what's your knee jerk? Mine's journey into imagination with Figman. Well, that's the

720
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,960
problem is that if I'm, if I'm a four year old, there's still a little dragon. So I can't say

721
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:56,640
that even though you're right. That's the biggest travesty there. Absolutely. But it's not the

722
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:02,160
worst time. It could be a right. It's gone like this. I really don't like mission space.

723
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:06,640
Could be mission space. I think mission space sucks. And I know some people like it and I,

724
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:12,240
yeah, it's just, I find it unpleasant. I mean, physically, obviously the one thing is unpleasant,

725
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:17,360
but also just like, I know this is how it's like spaces travel is done, but like, I don't,

726
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:21,600
I don't care. Like I don't, you're in a little claustrophobic thing and it's like,

727
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:27,600
I appreciate what they were trying to do, but I, but he's not playing the blues. So what good,

728
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:32,080
well, that's my biggest problem with it is that for me, uh, that's my biggest problem with it.

729
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:39,760
Oh yeah. I just bought a speaking of the blues friend of mine texted me a photo of a little

730
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:46,160
matchbox blues brothers car. And I said, buy that for me. It sounds okay. Yeah. Yeah. So I have that

731
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:50,800
Jason, you want to lock in and just knee jerk. I think I, yeah, I think I gotta go with that

732
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:59,520
magic carpets. I think, you know, some of these, I know it would be the antithetical to Disney's

733
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:06,240
vibe, but if it was just built and unveiled and they're like, Hey, new, uh, spin a ride, new ride

734
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:12,320
with like, without the fanfare of like announcing, we're building a carnival ride that looks a little

735
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:17,920
nicer for like one month before the sun and the rain just sat the color out of it.

736
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:26,080
That's solid and solid trick. Um, let us know what you think because if it's in, if it's in contention

737
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:30,800
for worst ride ever at Disney world or any park, there's an episode about it for sure. There's

738
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:35,360
rides that are perfectly pleasant that we might never do an episode about. But if it's worst,

739
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:42,080
for sure. Where if it's in bottom 20, yeah, that's true. If there's meat on the bone, we need to pick

740
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:47,680
at the meat. We need to just devour and tear the meat apart. Like volt, like the vultures we are.

741
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:53,760
Yeah, yeah. Well, we'll get there. I don't know that my mission space is definitively my worst ride

742
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:58,160
at Disney world, but it's the knee jerk though. We haven't done any of these. That's true. Yeah.

743
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:02,400
It'd be a tip that that's what that feels to me, like a depressing episode of flying carpets.

744
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:08,640
No way. Let's do it right now. Let's do it right into it. Yeah. The ones where we're always like,

745
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:14,800
it's too dry or there's not that. Then there is a huge birth, like a huge amount of room for madness.

746
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:21,120
We get them. We come in edgy. We come in just like, you know, like we drink 12 coffees. I wanted to

747
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:28,080
feed this thing. I'm going to kill this motherfucker. I have found the record in the morning. I fucked

748
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:33,760
up once or twice recently where I had just been drinking coffee and I came in on an empty stomach,

749
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:41,280
but filled with caffeine. I just felt so insane leaving them or like at the end of them.

750
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:46,320
And so now I have to force myself to eat at least a light breakfast before recording. And

751
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:50,320
wouldn't you know, I feel miles better feeding myself. Makes sense.

752
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,280
I didn't eat anything this morning. Oh, you guys. I feel weird. You got a big coffee.

753
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,760
Yeah. I got it last night. I actually drove through McDonald's last night, got the big coffee

754
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:04,400
and put it in the fridge. I don't understand these overnight McDonald's for both of you.

755
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:10,800
What do you mean? I don't think the food quality at McDonald's can survive the night. I didn't get

756
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,840
any food. Yeah, but no, the coffee Jason and his overnight milkshake. The milkshake is tougher.

757
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,840
The coffee is fine. The coffee tastes exactly the same. Yeah. It's an ice coffee. Especially if you,

758
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:24,800
I mean, I guess you can get a little milk in it if you're just going to drink it the next morning,

759
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:29,520
but like sometimes I'll get a black and add my own like soy milk or oat milk or something.

760
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:34,800
Yeah. Okay. That holds up. I'm not talking about like putting two cheeseburgers in the fridge.

761
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:40,080
That would be madness. Did you, I milkshake sat odd with me. They didn't sit out with you oddly

762
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:47,040
in your body. Well, okay. Not those because I drank them the next day, but I drank a freezer

763
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:53,120
one a few days later and I felt like shit. Oh, freezer milkshake. A freezer milkshake. What was

764
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:59,440
the over? What were the stats there? How long did it sit? Kinds? That was a Shake Shack churro

765
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:05,520
milkshake that sat for a few days. You look so bashful. A few days. I wasn't going to bring it

766
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:09,040
up, but I was like, I gotta bring this up. Cause like. Yeah, I know. We're wine at night, I swear.

767
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:13,120
But yeah, it keeps, wait, wait. So you give me the stats. Give me the, how long did it sit? What was

768
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:19,040
the like, like from when to when? Four days, like a Saturday to a Thursday. That's wild. I would never

769
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:22,960
do that. And then how do you, do you just leave it out to melt? A thought for a little while.

770
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,880
Like in the fridge or just out at room temperature. Just out at room temperature because it's a rock.

771
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:32,000
It's hard as a rock. I wouldn't do that. But it worked with the McDonald's one because I did

772
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:39,040
it the next day. Cause milkshakes are. Yeah, the next four days. You free. I rolled the dice.

773
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:44,320
You can afford it. A milkshake. You're a theme park professional. I am a foghead. Get a new.

774
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:50,640
Cause like if ice cream, like milkshake, I know there's the, the chemical makeup is different,

775
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:55,520
but like milkshake is almost like it's in the perfect state of not being fully ice cream

776
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:02,080
and not being fully melted. And you really like, there's a perfect sweet spot there to drink it.

777
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:06,400
So freeze it. Like it would be as if ice cream, like you let it melt and then you went and put it

778
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:11,840
in the freezer again to freeze. It wouldn't maintain the magic. The magic would be gone.

779
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:16,400
And that's the way I feel about freezing a milkshake is like, well, yeah, that what's easier is

780
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:20,560
there's this place around here called the baked bear and they do like kooky, big ice cream.

781
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:28,000
And if you just eat half of one of these massive ice cream sandwiches, which you, yeah, that's

782
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,840
probably what you should eat. You can freeze that and then just take it right out of the freezer

783
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:36,880
and eat it. It's like a chip, which basically change in that time, but it's the change in temp.

784
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:42,000
So if there's any real milk component, which is obviously a big question with any of these,

785
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,840
but you do not want to fuck around with temperature and milk. You do not want to

786
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:51,760
have that milk go all the way down to chilling cold and then all the way. This is more thrills

787
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:59,440
and chills than I could give you. My theory is that what did me in was the churro piece. So you've

788
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:05,920
got a fried chewable thing. It's not just a milkshake. It was hot and then got cold and then it got

789
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:14,080
really cold and then got room temp. I think that's why I want to do it again. I'll finish

790
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:20,000
my milkshakes like a good boy. Like a good boy. Do them all in one sitting. But I will freeze my

791
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,360
ice cream sandwiches and I will freeze my pints of ice. I don't eat, I'm not in college anymore. I

792
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:34,000
don't need a pint of ice cream in one sitting. Do it in two. All right, let's get out of here.

Glad you survived. Glad you made it here. I thought you were going to say spills from his mouth,

798
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:06,560
from his stomach. I guess it could be anywhere. Four days, it's like wine. It only gets better

799
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,760
with age.
