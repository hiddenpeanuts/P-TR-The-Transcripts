1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,160
Warning, the following haunt cast contains Lego friends, partying with NSYNC members,

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,680
the Phantom of the Opera's daughter, and a hot take on a controversial topic, the song

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,920
What I Like About You.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:28,400
Jane Clare joins us to talk Beetlejuice's Graveyard Review and much more on today's haunt cast,

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:46,360
The Fright.

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:52,960
Welcome to another installment of Haunt Cast The Fright, the show where we, as we get into

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,920
the meat of the episode, step into the blasts of giant fog machines for 90 seconds in order

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,960
to change into our official podcasting regalia.

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,540
I am normally Jason Sheridan, but this month I'm Jack O'Lantern, slime it in, here as always

12
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:18,180
with the creature once known as Michael R. Carlson, but this month known as...

13
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,300
This month I'm known as I kill Gerson, but I want to change this because last week it

14
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,020
sounded like I was admitting to killing girls.

15
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:33,620
That is not what I am about, so I am changing my name to Pike, innocent of all allegations,

16
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,300
son.

17
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:42,220
But what does this do for your reputation as a lady killer?

18
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,780
For the month of October, we're going to forget that phrase even existed alongside my name

19
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,880
as a descriptor.

20
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,580
Maybe we'll resume it after this whole thing blows over.

21
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,580
You can't erase that reputation.

22
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,580
The world knows.

23
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,260
I don't want to, but for this month, I don't know what you're talking about.

24
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,260
Joining us also...

25
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,380
Yeah, I amended mine, but in a more minor way.

26
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,420
I'm going to be Scott Gravedigner.

27
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:13,740
I'm going to add an N in there to tie it into my real name, which I'm not going to repeat

28
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,060
because you don't need to know it for October.

29
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,460
Yeah, good point.

30
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,460
Yeah, just a little adjust.

31
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,460
Nips and tucks.

32
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,460
It's ever flowing.

33
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,460
We're always adjusting.

34
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:27,580
Yeah, as my scandal grows, I think perhaps I will also have to amend.

35
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:36,580
Hopefully it's going to be done here, but this October surprise really took me by surprise.

36
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,060
Scandal that could bring the whole thing down, absolutely.

37
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,060
Exactly.

38
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,860
Yeah, we were talking about Beetlejuice's Graveyard Review today, and we have a special

39
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:54,060
guest coming all the way from the other room of the apartment that I am sitting in.

40
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,380
She's a singer.

41
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,340
She's a theme park professional, and she is my girlfriend.

42
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,340
Please welcome Jane Clare.

43
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,540
Hi, sweetie.

44
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,060
Hello.

45
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,860
Can I be Jane Scare for now?

46
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,860
Yay.

47
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,860
Wow.

48
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,360
That's good.

49
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,460
It's so easy.

50
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,360
That one sets right in there.

51
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:11,760
Hello.

52
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,260
Hi.

53
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,860
Hey, thanks for doing this.

54
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,260
I just want to paint a quick picture for the listener.

55
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,060
Jane is sitting on a couch, and Jason is sitting next to the oven.

56
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,860
Because of audio concerns, we had to go through a whole thing just now to figure out what

57
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,860
the best way to get audio that was clean was going to be.

58
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,460
Didn't want an echo and such.

59
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,460
Yeah.

60
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,460
Exactly.

61
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,660
Exactly.

62
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:40,460
Yeah, because lest we started to think that two people could have in the room chemistry

63
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,460
on a podcast in 2020, no, no, no.

64
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,460
It needs to be as clunky as possible.

65
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,460
Yes.

66
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,260
So, yeah, we fumbled around a little bit, but now we've got it.

67
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,460
And honestly, this is actually where Jason usually records the podcast when he's doing

68
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:00,260
it remotely next to that oven, I assume because perhaps you put cookies in at the start of

69
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,260
a record.

70
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,460
Okay, here it goes.

71
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,460
All right.

72
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:08,460
Well, now, so, yeah, I made a little spider hole.

73
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,060
This is where I usually record.

74
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,360
I pull two kitchen chairs.

75
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,900
If I record at Jane's, sometimes I record at my house.

76
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,760
But when I'm at Jane's, I pull two kitchen chairs into the kitchen.

77
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:29,420
And the reason for this is because there is a wall unit air conditioner that I was concerned

78
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,460
about picking up.

79
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:37,700
And in the spring, when it was more mild and chilly, we would just turn it off because

80
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,320
there is a ceiling fan.

81
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,940
And then I recorded the Griffin Newman episode here, and that went for three hours, and it

82
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,020
was like an oven in here by the time it was done.

83
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,520
You need to change your climate in general.

84
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,280
You have to really think about it before a Griffin episode because you know you're going

85
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,820
to be there for half a day.

86
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,220
Exactly.

87
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,820
Yes, that is true.

88
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,300
And Jane is very patient, but even she has her limits.

89
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,900
I'm just excited that I get to be a part of one and don't have to be quiet in the next

90
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,900
room for a couple hours.

91
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,900
It's so fun.

92
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,900
Your usual role.

93
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,900
Yes, indeed.

94
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,700
Do you ever hear Jason say stuff?

95
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,340
Because like Lindsay, oftentimes when we would be recording at our apartment, she would yell

96
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,340
stuff if she was in the kitchen and she heard something and she disagreed with a thing or

97
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,980
she agreed with it, she would yell.

98
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,900
Do you ever find yourself hearing something Jason's saying and going like, I'd like to

99
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,180
scream that's wrong or that's right?

100
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,180
Definitely I think it.

101
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,660
And then after I'll be like, did you say this?

102
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,700
And then I'll be like, either like, oh yeah, or like, oh crap, or like, that's fine, or

103
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,700
like what?

104
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,700
I don't know.

105
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,700
Yeah, I don't know.

106
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,700
I feel weird interrupting it.

107
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,700
Sure.

108
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,940
Well, maybe this has to open it up.

109
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,780
Maybe now we have to allow the interruption, the in the next room interruption.

110
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,420
Now we've introduced you to the audience officially.

111
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,420
Uh huh.

112
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:06,620
I, yes, I think from now on, if Jason says something that's really wrong, just feel free

113
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,580
to yell in the background.

114
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,820
I have permission now.

115
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,620
So okay, sounds good.

116
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,700
I have another issue with the way that that introduction happened, which is Jason, when

117
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,420
you're introducing your girlfriend on this podcast, what you're supposed to do is say

118
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,500
my love in a way that makes everyone very uncomfortable.

119
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,820
That's the that's the standard introduction of a significant other.

120
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,100
Very suspicious that you're hiding something.

121
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,980
You're like going overboard to make a vent.

122
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:46,580
I try to give her professional bonafides to not try and like make being my girlfriend

123
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,580
the most important thing is surely surely not.

124
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,740
I mean, it's the most important thing to me.

125
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,740
But.

126
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,740
Well, thank you.

127
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,740
That was very nice.

128
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,820
Yeah, I think you hit the right balance.

129
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,820
And if the listener doesn't know what Scott is talking about, he's talking about my introduction

130
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:09,380
of Lindsay's first appearance on the podcast, which some people considered a bit strange.

131
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,380
Not to me.

132
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,380
I thought it was normal.

133
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,420
Yeah, I don't know what it was like this like you like shifted into a register.

134
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,420
I'd never heard.

135
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,820
I just like it's like you were playing in a new scale that I was unfamiliar with.

136
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,820
Well, that's my love voice.

137
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,540
And I don't really show it to the audience.

138
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,540
Love.

139
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,540
The voice is love.

140
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,140
It means I'm in love.

141
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,700
I am very, very, very.

142
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,100
I suppress everything.

143
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,100
We all know that.

144
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,460
So love had to eke out somehow.

145
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,540
It eked out in a strange way that time.

146
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,540
What can I say?

147
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,660
Crawled out of your your vocal cords.

148
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,100
There's something wrong with me.

149
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,300
OK, fine.

150
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,740
We got to the bottom of it.

151
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,620
And then the other day, I immediately put you in in the doghouse because we were on

152
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,620
a zoom.

153
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,620
Oh, my God.

154
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,620
We're going to talk about this.

155
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,620
Yeah.

156
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,700
Well, we'll get to that when Lindsay does the show.

157
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:10,260
But yeah, I think like two years ago, she had like light like flagged Tower of Terror.

158
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,780
And I forgot.

159
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,500
I just forgot there was another episode that I think we're going to do with her that was

160
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,900
more forefront in my mind of like, oh, that's the next Lindsay episode.

161
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,100
But I just look, I forgot.

162
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,780
And yes, I got called out in the middle of a zoom birthday party.

163
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,780
Let's just put it that way.

164
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,580
That all of us were on organized by Jane, where everyone was wearing Spider-Man masks

165
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,980
and in the midst of the spider revelry, some very awkward moments occurred.

166
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,980
Yes.

167
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,980
Yeah.

168
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:48,300
Well, yeah, we'll we'll continue to break me down in that future episode.

169
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,620
And then also, my my my old friends that we've talked about this before, I think in the next

170
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,260
couple of months, maybe a Wisconsin Dulles episode so we can break me down even further.

171
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,220
Oh, new angles of that episode.

172
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,500
Fantastic.

173
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:08,660
And that puts my mind at ease because I just know my ass is going to get roasted today.

174
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,700
I guess we should just get into it then.

175
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,140
Yeah, let's stop talking about our nonsense.

176
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,140
No, yeah.

177
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,740
But well, that's you know, there was the question.

178
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,780
Yeah, you forgot to give Lindsay the topic that she flagged.

179
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:25,940
But there but this this this topic obviously had to be flagged for Jane because Jane is

180
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,860
a performer in Beetlejuice.

181
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,860
Well that's the thing.

182
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,180
I want to say Beetlejuice is a Graveyard Review.

183
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,740
You were in a Beetlejuice something or other because the name changed a bunch of times.

184
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,620
What were you in?

185
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:47,380
So I was in Beetlejuice's Graveyard Mashup, which was the final version before the entire

186
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:53,460
theater was demolished for Fast and Furious Supercharged.

187
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,460
Oh boy.

188
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,180
Oh, the tragedy of tragedies.

189
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:01,180
And so that puts it in Florida because you well this show hasn't been in Hollywood for

190
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,180
a while.

191
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,580
You did work in Florida and now you and you've been out here and you've worked at Universal

192
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,220
out here as well.

193
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,620
Yeah.

194
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,900
So I actually did my last show at Beetlejuice like a week or two before I left for L.A.

195
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,860
The show was closing about the same time that I was leaving, which ended up working out

196
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,940
really nice.

197
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,700
And yeah, so I did my last show, which I found on YouTube.

198
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,060
And I'm so happy that somebody got my very last show because as I was watching it, I

199
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,260
was like, oh, I remember doing that thing and that thing.

200
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,460
Oh my God, this is my last ever show.

201
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,460
Somebody captured it.

202
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,540
I was really happy to have that.

203
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,540
So that's amazing.

204
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,180
Wait, this was passed to us and I watched it and I didn't.

205
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,740
Yeah, I didn't realize it was literally the last one.

206
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,740
That's pretty special.

207
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,740
My last.

208
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,740
Oh, your last.

209
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,740
Not the last one.

210
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,740
It wasn't.

211
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,740
Yeah.

212
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,740
So I that was my last show.

213
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,380
And yeah, because I was watching it and I noticed there's some times where like Beetlejuice

214
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,220
will give me like a little kiss or one of the dancers would like hold my hand.

215
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,220
And I was like, oh my God, this is my last one.

216
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,620
And I had to try to not cry that whole show.

217
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,420
Do you know how many shows you did in total or about?

218
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,620
That's a good question.

219
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,620
Probably.

220
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,340
I don't know.

221
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,540
Yeah, we would do like it depends on the schedule, but we would do maybe four shows a day.

222
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:27,300
And I was a sub, so I would be there maybe once or twice a week at most.

223
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,060
Because I kind of in Florida, I kind of hopped around different venues.

224
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:36,260
So I wasn't full time at that venue, but I would do like the Diagon Alley show.

225
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,020
I would do one of the shows in Hogsmeade and then I would do Beetlejuice.

226
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,660
So I would be working at the park like four days a week, but between like three different

227
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,500
venues. So I don't know, a couple dozen, maybe more than that of Beetlejuice.

228
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,100
It definitely became in my body enough that when I was watching it back the other day,

229
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,940
I started doing it.

230
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,420
I was like, I don't know how I know this still.

231
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,340
Like, this is weird.

232
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,980
Like possessed you.

233
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,820
Yeah, right.

234
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,420
I'm being taken over.

235
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:14,580
We should I should say one of my favorite stories about your your theme park resume came up

236
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:23,300
because so we were doing the downtown Disney ordeal and on the episode about the Lego

237
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:29,740
store in downtown Disney, Mike revealed to us about the Lego friends, the back story

238
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,020
about, you know, the friends, you know, the Lego friends.

239
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,500
They're just a bunch of fun loving gals.

240
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,380
And we had fun.

241
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,700
We were talking about the back story.

242
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,860
We showed the picture.

243
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,820
And after we recorded that episode, Jane, you and I were like hanging out and we were

244
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,020
I was talking about the recording.

245
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,620
I was like, by the way, do you know about the Lego friends?

246
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,740
And I held up a picture and you were like, yeah, I know the Lego friends.

247
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,340
That's me, idiot.

248
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,180
Like that. I was like, what?

249
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:03,100
And I look in the picture that Mike had found from the official website of Lego land.

250
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,500
Jane was in.

251
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,020
This is true. Can confirm.

252
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,660
Yeah. So wait, I found a photo and yeah, remind me what I found.

253
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,620
It was just a picture of people playing the Lego friends in Lego land.

254
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:23,260
Was that what it was? I think it I think it was the promo shot of us on what was called

255
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,540
me as riding adventure, which was one of the rides in Hartlick City, which is what the

256
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,180
town was called. So the franchise had already existed.

257
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:37,060
The toys came out as kind of a kind of like this is our Barbie type thing, but it's our

258
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:43,340
own IP for Lego, I guess, maybe to kind of appeal to like young girls in the cliche,

259
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,900
you know, world that Lego likes living, I guess.

260
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,700
But yeah, we were on the ride on the horses because we did a whole day.

261
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,460
I was one of the media girls, which was like a big deal because I never got to be one

262
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,620
of the media girls.

263
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,660
So I got to be the media girl.

264
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,180
So I was in all the pictures and promo and opening day and stuff.

265
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,500
So, yeah, whenever those PR pictures come around, I'm always like, oh, there it is.

266
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,860
Wow. So so, yeah, media girl was like that meant that you would be out front.

267
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,780
I assumed they would put like the best performers of some kind, like is that kind of

268
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,420
what the thinking was when like they would choose people?

269
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,500
There's a lot of things that go into it, but I would say, I mean, that sounds like I'm

270
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,340
tooting my own horn and I definitely don't mean that, but I had to work hard to become a

271
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,380
media girl. No, it was kind of like whoever they thought, like, yeah, who was the most

272
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,540
prepared at that point?

273
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,740
Because some stuff gets kind of thrown in last minute or who they know is reliable when

274
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,580
things get a little chaotic because some people fall apart more quickly.

275
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:46,340
And like, for example, the show we did, that's actually online, like that all the like

276
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,260
attractions magazine and everything covered my track for my song skipped and they had to

277
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,180
go back. And there's like this look of panic on my face because I was like, you've got to

278
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,580
be kidding me. And it was fine.

279
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,580
But I was like, you never know what's going to happen on the show day because everything's

280
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,020
kind of thrown together. So it's a couple of things.

281
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,180
Yeah, I mean, that was really fun.

282
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:12,220
It was really fun to open a show and actually play a character that's like a real

283
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,540
character that's already around because a lot of the other stuff I do, it's like or I did is like

284
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,940
versions of. So like for the Hogwarts school choir, I wasn't like a specific Hogwarts

285
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,460
character. I was like a prefect who's a Gryffindor.

286
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:31,060
So like this was Lego was the only time I got to play like an actual character, which felt

287
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,380
really cool because like there was also a fountain outside and I got to be a voice in the

288
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,860
fountain. So for years, I think they changed it now.

289
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,540
But for a couple of years there was like you could step on something and you'd hear my voice.

290
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,340
And that was really cool.

291
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,980
Oh, part of an attraction, part of a thing in a physical place.

292
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,020
That's that's the dream. What did you say?

293
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,260
Do you remember any lines from this character?

294
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,060
It was yes, it was just one.

295
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,300
And I have a video of it.

296
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,620
And it was just you're the star.

297
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,620
That's it. That's it.

298
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,700
Pretty good. Pretty fun.

299
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,820
Well, and you it was this it wasn't like the fountain.

300
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,660
There's that fountain at Universal or they used to have it where you would be there.

301
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,700
A performer was somewhere else and they would be talking.

302
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,460
It was different than it was that.

303
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,820
No, it was different from that.

304
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:18,300
So the theme of Heart Lake City was like girl power, friendship, but also like music and

305
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,220
like being a rock star pop star kind of vibe.

306
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:27,140
So it was a literal heart shaped pool that was there because it used to be Cypress

307
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:32,380
Gardens and Cypress Gardens had a heart shaped pool already as a whole other thing.

308
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,940
But you would step on different shapes and each Lego friend would say different things

309
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,700
as you stepped on it.

310
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,540
And what did I miss?

311
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,260
What who which one were you of the Lego friends?

312
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,420
Oh, I opened as.

313
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:53,100
Olivia, I think, and then I also cross trained into Emma and Stephanie briefly,

314
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,540
but I Olivia was my main character.

315
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,180
Yeah, of course, of course.

316
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,020
We all know them very well.

317
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:04,180
Olivia is the sort of a is Olivia a bookworm or just Olivia has glasses.

318
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:10,980
Olivia, honestly, I OK, Emma liked karate, so she had like karate.

319
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,380
It's so ridiculous, y'all.

320
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,820
OK, so Andrea was the lead and she was like the pop star singer.

321
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,300
So the whole concept, I feel like we're talking about Lego friends now, but

322
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,260
I love this. OK, so the whole concept of the show that I did was called Lego

323
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,300
Friends to the rescue.

324
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,260
So Andrea was like, I have this big show in Heart Lake City, but I'm nervous because

325
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,460
it's not going well and I need my friends to help me get through it.

326
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,780
So we came to the rescue and then like did the show with her.

327
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,420
And it was like Power of Friendship, which was literally one of the songs.

328
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,740
So, yeah, one girl was like really like Stephanie was like, I'm the tech girl

329
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,620
and I'll handle your sound and lighting.

330
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,260
And like one girl is like, I'm good with decorations.

331
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,660
And one girl, Mia, Mia's like into animals.

332
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,820
It really had nothing to do with it.

333
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,460
It was just like put a paw print on her costume and

334
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,420
well, she'll wear pants and not skirts like everybody else,

335
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,100
because she's a tomboy like.

336
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,500
This is a dense pathology.

337
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,500
He is throwing blood at the audience.

338
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,820
What a time.

339
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,100
I'm on a as I got obsessed with.

340
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,940
I was talking a lot of Disney dot fandom dot com last week,

341
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,980
and now I'm on Brick Brickimedia dot org for Olivia.

342
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,300
Wait, I'm sorry. This is Brickipedia, but the web address is Brickimedia.

343
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,620
So if you want Brickipedia, go to Brickimedia dot org.

344
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,780
And when you look up Olivia,

345
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,780
somebody has taken the time to list every outfit Olivia has ever worn.

346
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,420
This is one of the densest things I've ever seen.

347
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,300
Amber vest, light pink skirt and white shoes, magenta top, light blue skirt

348
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,060
and white shoes.

349
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,020
I'm scared to see very normal, very cool.

350
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Normal stuff.

351
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,460
It's been your time doing for no pay.

352
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,260
I swear, I think I've seen people like I've seen the Wikipedia's

353
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:03,260
for people who are like running for president that are like way less thorough

354
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,460
than the Olivia page.

355
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,940
This is this goes and goes.

356
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,820
And I'm disturbed.

357
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,620
I'm going to try. Oh, there's a lot of like a wait.

358
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,540
Is it like her address?

359
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,220
They have addresses. What are you talking about?

360
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,220
They have their address.

361
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,180
Wait, no, maybe this is like the character.

362
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,820
I don't even know this.

363
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,740
They are dock saying Olivia has been doxxed by Brickimedia.

364
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,700
Olivia and Emma have been doxxed.

365
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,940
Is Brickimedia like like an Alex Jones or like a Matt Drudge type website?

366
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,940
Scott, are you sure you're not on like an alt right?

367
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,860
Lego website.

368
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,820
It's like it's a QAnon world that believes that every heart

369
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,940
like city is a real place and that these little creatures are like throwing

370
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,340
the power balance.

371
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,620
I don't I think the numbers I'm seeing are the codes of the like

372
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,140
of the Lego sets.

373
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,380
So four one oh three three Jungle Falls Rescue is the name of the set,

374
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,380
not an address of a place.

375
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,220
Olivia, Olivia was part of the George Soros gang.

376
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,340
Oh, no.

377
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,500
We got to get some people over to Jungle Falls Rescue.

378
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,220
Part of the Illuminati.

379
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,860
Olivia's part Illuminati.

380
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,660
Well, this is almost too perfect of a transition because Jane, when you were

381
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,780
Legoland used to be this botanical garden like Cypress Garden, Cypress Garden.

382
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:27,020
Yeah. And you told me once about like the one the building they would use

383
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:32,180
for like, you know, private parties and like rehearsal space sometimes

384
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,260
was kind of like a like you would describe it as like a big old house.

385
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,940
Right. Yeah. A certain style of like like a big old with like big columns.

386
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,220
What is that? A plantation, a plantation house.

387
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,260
OK. Yes. Unfortunately, this was the deep south.

388
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,100
And, you know, the history came along with it.

389
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,420
And they tried their best to make it kid friendly.

390
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,340
And, you know, you adapt and do what you can.

391
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,700
But yes, we did rehearse in like this giant mansion

392
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:11,180
plantation house where it was like weirdly empty with like a grand staircase.

393
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:15,460
But upstairs, there was like one suite that was themed to Lego friends

394
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,660
that you could win to stay in.

395
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,740
But the rest of the house was like so creepy and empty.

396
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,700
It was so weird. And like, yeah, it was a weird.

397
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,220
This is a haunted mansion, essentially

398
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,460
partially themed to Lego friends instead of ghosts.

399
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,140
Precisely. Wow.

400
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,260
And the other place you told me you rehearsed at was.

401
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,180
Yeah. Oh, so the yeah.

402
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,180
Legoland did what they could.

403
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,700
And the other place we rehearsed was the 4D theater.

404
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,140
But like after hours and we would be in the front

405
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,300
where there was like all that space between the audience and the screens,

406
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,340
but not all the special effects turned off at night.

407
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,980
So we'd be like running the show and then like like puffs of air

408
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,500
would come out and scare us so bad because like they were timed.

409
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,100
And I don't know why they didn't shut off.

410
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,500
So we'd be like running the show and be like, OK, guys, let's do this.

411
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,580
And just like all this like the stuff would come out and like it scared me.

412
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,220
I was because I was a kid.

413
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,340
I was scared of everything in the parks.

414
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,620
And I always was like, you can't go past that line

415
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,140
because someone will come out and get you.

416
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,260
So like I was a little bit scared. Sure.

417
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,980
You're in it after hours. Yeah.

418
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,060
And gas is shooting at you. Oh, my God. Yeah. Fog.

419
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,540
That evil fog that teens love.

420
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,180
When you were a kid, you said you were scared of everything.

421
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,940
Were you like scared, obviously, and intrigued

422
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,420
because you ended up being a performer in these shows?

423
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,580
Or was it truly fear?

424
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,980
Yeah. So I mean, so I grew up in Orlando for a lot of my childhood.

425
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,220
We moved around a lot, but then I went back as an adult.

426
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,540
So I guess about half of my life spent in Orlando.

427
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,980
So we went to Disney World

428
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,780
pretty much every weekend when I was five till I was 10.

429
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,340
We had like passes and we lived. Oh, yeah.

430
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,980
So I definitely really liked the entertainment.

431
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,940
And if there was like an empty little spot or a stage, I remember

432
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,620
because I'm also the youngest and like just love attention,

433
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,780
which Jason knows nothing about.

434
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,940
And I would like hop on the little stages.

435
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,420
But I was like, cute. I was like five.

436
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,380
And I'd hop on the little like stages that they'd have

437
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,660
and like start singing and people would like clap and shit.

438
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,300
So I think like I was destined to do what I did.

439
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,180
But no, I was scared more of like like attractions,

440
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,140
I think because my imagination is so wild, which is why things still scare me

441
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,820
as an adult, because I would like start to think like this could happen.

442
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,780
And they go, well, this will happen. This will happen.

443
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,860
So my imagination would go before my like reality would.

444
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,620
Sure. So were you more did you did you like the shows at theme parks

445
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,660
more than the rides or was it was it both?

446
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,620
I would say probably yes.

447
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,060
All of my family did, though, too.

448
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:57,140
So like my favorite show was The Hunchback of Notre Dame

449
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,180
that they had at MGM when it was back when it was MGM.

450
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,140
I remember that show like so vividly.

451
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,340
I thought it was so amazing.

452
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,900
And I do think that's part of the reason I wanted to like

453
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,460
be a performer, maybe specifically theme park.

454
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,980
I really liked that.

455
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,860
And yeah, I mean, I liked the rides fine, too.

456
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,780
But I was always more interested in like what was going on entertainment wise, I think.

457
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,180
Sure. Which we kind of like neglect shows a lot.

458
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,660
This is this is a different perspective.

459
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,620
I yeah, I don't know.

460
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,220
We yeah, we've missed a lot.

461
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,100
We haven't talked about that Hunchback thing.

462
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,420
And here it's one of your big influences. Oh, it's so good.

463
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,780
It's on YouTube and it's so good.

464
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,860
So good. Yeah.

465
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:45,100
I mean, there's we briefly mentioned, I mean, we've done a couple of little shows here and there

466
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,620
like like stuff like as a kid.

467
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,140
I always like that Little Mermaid show.

468
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,020
They still do it at Hollywood Studios.

469
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,900
RIP to most theme park shows as well.

470
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,860
Yes, this is our heart goes out to all these people that are laid off

471
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,100
from these shows that are like major productions.

472
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,580
Well, yeah, and are closed permanently as of like 12 hours ago.

473
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,180
Can I say this, Chase?

474
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,780
Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's on the block.

475
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,140
Yeah. OK. Why?

476
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,540
So my friends that worked at Disneyland, they just were told that

477
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:19,420
Frozen is officially like closed and magical map is officially closed.

478
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,100
So they didn't get to have their final show.

479
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,100
Like for me with Frog choir out here.

480
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,380
I mean, I guess I'll say it because I don't think I'm doing it again.

481
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,900
I didn't know that I had my last day

482
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,220
like in retrospect, I know, but like I didn't know like the last show

483
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,460
that I did before Covid, which was like March 12th.

484
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,300
Maybe I had no idea that was my last ever show doing that show.

485
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,500
So, I mean, it's kind of nice because then you don't have like the sadness

486
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,940
attached to it while you're doing it.

487
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,700
But now it's a little bit like I didn't really get a formal last show.

488
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,820
And it's a little sad.

489
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,300
But like, yeah, it's kind of wild right now.

490
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,460
I'm super sad. Yeah. Well, those mean.

491
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,340
Yeah, it's there's tons of people that it's very sad.

492
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:04,020
It's very. Yeah, it's like these show like Frozen,

493
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,140
especially is like this major, major production.

494
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,620
Like it's like like they put so much time, obviously,

495
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,260
and they've done the show now for a couple of years.

496
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,860
And it's like it's just gone.

497
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,700
It's so much.

498
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,940
I mean, in with magical map, too, there's so many costumes.

499
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,300
Oh, yeah. So like they're all such great.

500
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,100
And it's sad because I feel like too, over the years, as with Beetlejuice,

501
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,420
you know, that got taken out not during Covid,

502
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:33,060
but just to replace with a ride of a franchise they thought would be a better,

503
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,540
you know, attraction for that area.

504
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,100
And I think over the last few years,

505
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,980
like live performance has taken a bit of a hit.

506
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,540
And then now with Covid and everything, it's just demolished.

507
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,860
So, you know, I hope that in the coming years,

508
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,820
when things start to pick back up, it will recover.

509
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,100
But it's definitely a really weird time right now for a lot of people in theme

510
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,140
parks, not just entertainment.

511
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,380
But yeah, yeah.

512
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:59,180
Fast and furious supercharged is the Covid of theme park attraction.

513
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,700
Hell yeah, brother.

514
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,860
I'm now that's a guess I didn't do.

515
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:12,700
I only know the tram one, but I if I had to guess and Jay Jason is not said kind things.

516
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,660
No, no, I'm waiting.

517
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,980
I'm keeping all of my little thoughts for because I when we went to Florida

518
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,620
for like to do the live show, I was the only one who went on.

519
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:29,860
That was like the last thing before I got on the like lift to the airport.

520
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:33,740
I picked up my bag and I was like, God, I can't believe my last ride was

521
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,420
fast and furious supercharged.

522
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,420
This is so.

523
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,660
But the vision by now you can get on the plane and imagine like

524
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,020
what if Vin Diesel was hanging off at the bottom of this sucker?

525
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,500
Oh, man, what if Dom?

526
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,020
What if Dom was sitting next to you?

527
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,580
I wish Delta played turned down for what?

528
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,540
As I got on to got onto the flight.

529
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,980
Yeah, that would have been 2019.

530
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:04,300
So let's let's talk about this show, which here so just the primer

531
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,180
for anybody who doesn't know it, let me say because I didn't know the version

532
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:13,740
that you did, Jane, but I grew up with it in Universal Hollywood.

533
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,860
So my synopsis would have been it was a show that is hosted by

534
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:24,220
Beetlejuice of the film Beetlejuice and where Universal classic monsters

535
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,980
get involved in a big old rock and roll review.

536
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,140
And that's about it.

537
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,580
That pretty much said like, oh, they're all like variations of that.

538
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:38,020
But as time went on, there was some like adding of original IP

539
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,340
of which you were part.

540
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:45,100
But this this began like around was it an opening day at Universal Florida?

541
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,300
Or they added in 92?

542
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,140
I think it was.

543
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,820
Correct me if I'm wrong, someone.

544
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,100
But I'm pretty sure it was it was it was a one or two years.

545
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,740
You told me what the opening day was.

546
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,100
There was a short lived, an American tale five.

547
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,140
Duh. That was first at the at the stage in Florida.

548
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,900
So the venue was there, I think, at opening.

549
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,140
But it wasn't that show. Yeah, you're right.

550
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,340
There was Fievel Goes West. Is that right?

551
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,460
Yeah, it would have been.

552
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,540
There was a Fievel Goes West thing, I think.

553
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,060
I think was the first Fievel.

554
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,100
And then Fievel Goes West is what the play area is more.

555
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,540
Oh, OK, OK, OK.

556
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,900
So so that was a pretty quickly like it seemed like a pretty quickly

557
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,460
thrown together like Fievel stage show.

558
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,220
And it kind of doesn't make sense because it was just an amphitheater

559
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,500
by in between New York streets and San Francisco streets.

560
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,060
So like, oh, I don't quite.

561
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,660
I mean, oh, I guess the mice land in New York.

562
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,540
I guess that makes sense.

563
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,020
Kind of kind, kind of kind of.

564
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,140
Many Ellis Island area.

565
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,980
But what what could make more sense for Universal Studios

566
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:54,460
than deploying the classic monsters and the show that I recall

567
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,540
from 90s Universal Hollywood?

568
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,580
You know, it's the classic lineup.

569
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,620
It's Frankenstein. It's Dracula. It's Bride of Frankenstein.

570
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,700
And then the phantom of the opera, which was kind of the biggest

571
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,100
swing in the original one, because he has sort of like a

572
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:18,940
kind of a new wave vibe with his with his not jet black, his jet white hair.

573
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,660
How do you how do you describe white hair?

574
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,620
Not yet. That wouldn't be part of it.

575
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,340
But I just love his look a lot.

576
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,260
He is he's the most like kooky way.

577
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,780
He's like he looks like he's out of the Jetsons movie or something.

578
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,820
I saw the Phantom.

579
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,860
I watched a video from 1992 and I think it was the one in Florida.

580
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,980
And he looks very much like Jordan Klepper to me.

581
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,820
Oh, he's got the big he is like a he's got the big hair and he's got

582
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,780
like a pink outfit.

583
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:49,340
So the phantom would probably know a ton about politics.

584
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,340
If you got him going, he could explain to us everything

585
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,580
that's going on in this crazy country.

586
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:59,980
92 Phantom. Yes, 92 Phantom would be an expert in 2020 politics.

587
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,020
Exactly.

588
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,900
I I'm trying to remember my feelings about this.

589
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,060
I remember liking the show.

590
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,900
And it's the it's the degree of scary

591
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,260
and rock music that is pushing the.

592
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,460
What I'm saying is when you're seven or eight,

593
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,620
it does feel scary because they are monsters.

594
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:29,220
And it does feel like rock music because you're unwilling

595
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,780
to push the boundaries of hard rock music when you're eight.

596
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,660
So I viewed this as an extremely adult attraction when I was eight.

597
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,380
Can I back you up with that?

598
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,300
Because as an adult learning the show, when we put on our costumes

599
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,500
for the first time for like tech runs at night,

600
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,980
I was scared of all the Frankenstein.

601
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,060
Hey, all right.

602
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,460
Because because they have these shoes that are like,

603
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,060
like just so big.

604
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,060
And oh, my God, I was scared.

605
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,820
Like I was a little scared of them because they were so tall.

606
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,380
Yeah, very tall.

607
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,460
I get it, Scott.

608
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,060
Hey, all right. As a kid, I will say like when if Beatlejuice

609
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,220
when it comes to the audience, he does a lot of crowd work,

610
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,380
especially early on in the show.

611
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,420
That always would freak me out, even if it was just like

612
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,020
we were seeing some sort of like dinner theater show

613
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,700
and like the host would come out in the audience.

614
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,860
I would get scared of the host even if he had no monster.

615
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,540
It is so unnerving.

616
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,460
Yeah, I just don't mention me.

617
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,700
Don't talk to me.

618
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,300
I think that's where my anxiety started as a person was

619
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,940
audience participation in theme park when I was a child,

620
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,140
because I remember that happening a couple of times

621
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,500
because I was so little, like they'd come over

622
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,700
and I just would be like, I hate this, like get away from me.

623
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,620
And to this day, I don't like interactive theater.

624
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,540
I'd rather either be in the audience or on the stage.

625
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,100
Like in between makes me like sweat buckets like.

626
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,420
That's a good point.

627
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,420
Neither here nor there.

628
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,660
I need to like, I need to know going in.

629
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,060
It's like you have you're part of this

630
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,300
and you're like you're performing essentially.

631
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,740
Or I just I usually like nine times out of 10.

632
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,140
I just want to sit there and observe.

633
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,340
Yeah, I'd agree.

634
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,900
Also, the logic of this is a little confusing

635
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,460
because Beetlejuice comes out, does a like eight minutes of crowdwork

636
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,260
and then goes backstage.

637
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,740
He's like, you got to say my name.

638
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,620
You got to say my name so I can come out.

639
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,980
And it's like, wait a minute.

640
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,220
You're just out here like yucking it up.

641
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,020
Now you need to be summoned. Right. Yeah.

642
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,500
Yeah. Why is that?

643
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,900
Is it your disbelief, you know?

644
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,140
Or is it to turn on his his rocking abilities?

645
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,260
Like you're just getting like warm up Beetlejuice and then.

646
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,820
But he can't rock to say his name thrice.

647
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,940
OK, yeah, it's probably about right.

648
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,540
It has a lot to do with rocking, probably.

649
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,860
It's probably in the book.

650
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,660
It's probably in the book from the movie.

651
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,300
There's probably a chapter on the rules of rock

652
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,220
for the recently deceased.

653
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:52,620
What a rockin show the the I I watched.

654
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,820
This is in, I think, the defunct land about the show, but it's also in the.

655
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,940
I love any time we can discuss the

656
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:05,820
John Forsythe hosted Universal Souvenir video that is on YouTube and is a delight.

657
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,580
John Forsythe of Charlie's Angels fame, who has this

658
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:14,580
just does all this very stiff narration of each universal attraction.

659
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,300
And his quotes about this one are tremendous.

660
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:22,500
He calls it a rock and roll review of Monster Mashers.

661
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,780
They're dead. We're grateful.

662
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:32,500
He says so wistfully, he says, like more lovingly

663
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,940
than I've said, like it's like sweeter than anything I've said to this baby yet.

664
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,460
It's so like just they're dead and great.

665
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,980
Thank you. We salute you.

666
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,860
I know I'm making a joke about a band name, but also Beetlejuice.

667
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,580
I salute you, sir.

668
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,420
That's like also like it sounds like he's on a like on a porch in a rocking chair,

669
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,260
like we're just like kind of staring off into the distance with like a little twinkle in his eye.

670
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,460
Just having memories about things he's seen is like, yeah, he's dying.

671
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,380
And the thing he remembers the most about being on this earth was watching

672
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,220
watching Frankenstein rock.

673
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,420
Yeah, really lovely.

674
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:22,100
Look, he looks old as hell in these videos, which I remember I would add

675
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,340
like a gift shop.

676
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:28,460
My I would always want them, but they're like, no, this is forty dollars.

677
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,780
Strangely overprice.

678
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,140
Yeah. Little do they know, just be strewn on YouTube for anybody to watch and make fun of.

679
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:39,820
And it is funny that like I think I have the same thing, just like I'm not even willing to ask my mom.

680
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,340
This isn't worth the favor.

681
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:46,340
And then like what you and I were coveting so much, Jason, was a video where an old man

682
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,260
thanks monsters.

683
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:55,660
And the other thing is, if you go to a travel agency at the time and ask for information,

684
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:00,700
they would either hand you that or just tell you to write away to this address

685
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,940
and Disney will send you of the almost identical video every year.

686
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:10,140
But not with Charlie, not with relevant to us as children.

687
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,020
The voice of Charlie.

688
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,620
Yeah, you wanted that specific old man.

689
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,060
He's a really dynamic old man.

690
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:22,780
You wanted an old man who looked like the portrait of Dorian Gray,

691
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,180
who is not represented in this show.

692
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,180
The painting that ages well, the man stays the same.

693
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:32,900
I'm sure we could jump all around and talk about various monsters who appeared in the thing.

694
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,540
And as it started, it was kind of these initial like it's it's the classics.

695
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,780
But Jane, that is not what you played in the show.

696
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,860
You were a later addition, an original IP to this world.

697
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,980
Can you tell us what you were?

698
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,100
Yes, I have some props here, which I know the audience can't see.

699
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,220
Oh, great.

700
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,100
I was able to like sneak off with some stuff.

701
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,900
So I have my mask.

702
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,460
Oh, a mask. There's a clue.

703
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,700
There's my mask.

704
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,860
Whoa, it's studded and sparkles.

705
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:08,260
Just stuck on the inside, too, from the Florida sweat heat makeup melt.

706
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,580
Yeah, no, I love having this. And then I.

707
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,500
I also have the collar that I had to wear.

708
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,580
Oh, neck broach thing.

709
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,940
I needed this thing because you were like belting and they were like

710
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,540
putting this thing around your neck.

711
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:27,380
So you were like, but no, it's good.

712
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,860
It's fun. I got to keep.

713
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,780
Well, it's the smallest thing I could walk away with because like the top.

714
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,460
Can I talk about my costume since we're kind of on that?

715
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,460
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

716
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,540
Wait, wait, wait and say the name of the character.

717
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,700
I didn't say what I was. Oh, I'm so sorry.

718
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,820
I'm so sorry.

719
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:46,460
Yeah, so my character's name was Fantasia, the Phantom of the Opera's daughter.

720
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,420
Yeah.

721
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,940
Yeah, so it was cool.

722
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,500
Yeah, she was cool.

723
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,540
It was fun because she's kind of more like like she wore pants,

724
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,180
but the rest of the girls like were skirts.

725
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,340
I felt like she was more of this like tomboy rocker chick vibe.

726
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,900
And that was like way fun because that's more my vibe anyway.

727
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,900
So like it was just cool.

728
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,740
And she has like her own DJ booth and like.

729
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,820
It was so well, I don't know, I don't want to get ahead of myself

730
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,340
because I don't know what to talk about.

731
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,380
Well, she's like the in it becoming a little less rock oriented.

732
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:24,580
I think you lose the the the non played live instruments on stage.

733
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:30,620
You use you lose the fake guitar and it becomes more of a dance oriented show.

734
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:36,660
And you really Fantasia is the leader of this doing the mashups from the title.

735
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:42,860
Like you have to have to pull hits from the 80s and combine them with the hits of today.

736
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,140
Mm hmm. You know, that's true.

737
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:49,700
Yeah, she there's there's a line where I say to Cleo who comes out

738
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,340
who's the other character in the show that was a new IP.

739
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,460
And it was I got you, girl, I'll spin this.

740
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:00,460
So, yeah, she was up there spinning away those mashup tunes.

741
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,900
Delightful. And you get it.

742
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,980
You get a narration, you get introduced, you get like a cue

743
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:12,220
and a a giant contraption rotates you onto stage, which that was pretty cool.

744
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:16,140
Yeah, it was like for the first version of the show, it rotated.

745
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,460
And the Phantoms like Wurgen was there.

746
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,700
And then for a while, it was just a chair and the characters,

747
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:28,340
the characters, hip and hop would be leading on it to two perplexing characters.

748
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,980
Oh, yeah. This was in everything we're describing as a version four.

749
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:37,260
But version three started the drift to hip hop with the characters, hip and hop,

750
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:42,100
who seemed to be they were front and center in Beetlejuice's performance of Hey,

751
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,180
Yaw. Jane, I'll set you up for this.

752
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:50,580
Will you talk about your connection to another version of this show?

753
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,500
Yes. Hip and hop.

754
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:58,220
So I always kick myself for making the choice I made on this one rainy Orlando day.

755
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:03,340
So they had auditions come through a lot for Universal Japan and whatnot.

756
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,460
And they have them everywhere.

757
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,220
But Orlando, they would always come through Orlando for stuff like that.

758
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:13,060
And I went to the open call for Universal Japan for Beetlejuice.

759
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,580
And they kept me at the time for hip and hop.

760
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,740
And I was like, this is really cool.

761
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,140
And I wasn't doing the show yet.

762
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,700
I don't think in Orlando. I think this was before.

763
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,860
And I kept making the rounds, I kept making the rounds, I kept making the rounds.

764
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,180
And I was like, oh, my God, I'm the only girl that they're keeping right now

765
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,180
for hip and hop. Like, this is crazy cool.

766
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,820
But before the final dance callback,

767
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,540
I had another callback at Orlando Repertory Theater,

768
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:43,420
which was one of the professional theaters in Orlando for Fiona and Shrek, the musical.

769
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,420
And I was like, if I don't go to this, they're going to be really pissed that I didn't show up

770
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,940
because that's rude.

771
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,820
So I was like, do I leave this one where I'm killing it?

772
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,380
I was like, OK, here's what I'll do. I'll talk to them about it.

773
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,820
So then I was like, hey, man, like, I have another audition.

774
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,140
Can we work this out?

775
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,700
They were like, come back tomorrow for the dancer call.

776
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,420
And you can do that callback.

777
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,420
I ended up just kicking, just really shooting myself in the foot

778
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:12,420
because I was so caught up with the Beatles you saw auditioned at the Shrek one.

779
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,460
I just flopped so hard and was like just I was not mentally there.

780
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:21,180
And then I went back to the dance call callback the next day.

781
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,060
And it was for like dancer dancers.

782
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,780
And I was there for like singer mover.

783
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,780
So I looked like shit and like couldn't keep up because it was for like hardcore dancers.

784
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,420
So I didn't get either job.

785
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,620
And I just was like, man, I was so close to being hip and hop.

786
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,820
Like, but, you know, my life worked out very well and I'm happy.

787
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,420
But like at the same time, I'm like, man, what if I had booked hip and hop?

788
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,740
Man, those cool costumes and wigs.

789
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,460
In hindsight, would you rather been hip and hop or Fiona?

790
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,940
Oh, hip and hop for sure. OK.

791
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,580
Yeah, because I ended up saying, well, I can't say.

792
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,300
OK, all right. Sure. Sure. Sure.

793
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,260
But there was some secrets.

794
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:03,420
There was a possibility of a Japan being like I what is your job?

795
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,060
I am hip and I live in Japan.

796
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:11,820
Yeah. Darling, we could have met so many years earlier when you were hip or hop

797
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,020
and I was Austin Powers in school.

798
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,300
That was Singapore. Oh, it's Singapore.

799
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,500
Well, I guess, you know, I would have I would have been over there.

800
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,700
And like, I've got a long weekend off coming up in Japan still as John.

801
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,180
So what is the quickest way to get Singapore to Japan?

802
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,580
Does my discounts work to where they they?

803
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,940
Mm hmm. I think that would have for sure happened.

804
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:35,220
Had you definitely for sure taken my advice and applied to be Austin Powers in Singapore.

805
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,620
I know still I was so hopefully still possible one day.

806
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,460
Oh, yeah. We'll see.

807
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,500
If we started having to record this, it like the virus is over.

808
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,420
We're doing this. We're still doing it via Zoom because Jason lives in Singapore now.

809
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,180
He's doing it late at night.

810
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,340
We're doing it first thing in the morning.

811
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,300
He's still wearing his crushed velvet suit when he gets home.

812
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,540
Hey, didn't have time to change.

813
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,220
Let's just get right in. I'm ready to go.

814
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:04,540
He puts the Swedish made penis and larger pump on the counter as he gets home,

815
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,740
like smashes it down. It's like, all right, let's record on day.

816
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,660
We're talking about some other we're talking about King Arthur's carousel.

817
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,980
And he's like, you know, I just think this is one of the most shagadelic attractions.

818
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:19,140
Like, it's you know what he's saying anymore.

819
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,540
God damn it.

820
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,100
Hey, it's possible.

821
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:29,940
The some facts that I wrote down about Fantasia from her introduction,

822
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:36,020
Beelgeuse says that she's a real daddy's girl and she's a phantom who needs no opera.

823
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,700
That's all fun.

824
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,420
And now that's all good.

825
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,340
But I can't believe that.

826
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:48,700
Let me just admit this, that I genuinely laughed out loud at Cleo's introduction,

827
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,340
during which Beelgeuse said Sphinx better have my money.

828
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,500
I actually laughed at that.

829
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:02,020
I forget if that was improv or not, because the Beatle, the Beatlejai,

830
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,180
the Beatlejai had improv room.

831
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,580
They had room for that.

832
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,740
I feel like that was actually in the script, though,

833
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,420
because it was timed with the way the pyro and the music would hit.

834
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,620
But yeah, that's pretty dicey for them to put.

835
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:21,980
Well, it's not a bad word, but it's if you if you fill it in

836
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,620
mentally, well, thanks for having my money.

837
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,260
Yeah, it's a he's a little blue in the land in that video.

838
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,540
He got like he got blue, right?

839
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,540
For like as years went on, because in the 92 version, he's pretty

840
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,580
he's a lot less aggressive.

841
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,940
He's more like kind of like I'm this guy.

842
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:41,740
And then by 2006, he's like, yeah, I just took a huge shit like that.

843
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,820
That's like he's there's a joke there, too.

844
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,900
He's like, oh, I don't I forget what he says.

845
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,140
Like I just he's talking about corn and his creature,

846
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:53,460
the creature of the Black Lagoon I just made in the toilet.

847
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,180
I had to drop my creature off at the Black Lagoon.

848
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,620
There you go. That's a better joke.

849
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,780
One. And then he's like, talk about man scaping. Yeah.

850
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,380
He's talking about man scaping.

851
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,980
He's like, I think he's talking to the wolf man at that point.

852
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,580
Wow. So was he a podcaster from three years ago?

853
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:17,140
Hopefully those were ubiquitous.

854
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:22,940
The you bring up the off color nature of the show.

855
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:26,260
There are versions of this that I think were technically PG 13,

856
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,780
because it is a little more adult.

857
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:32,460
And this is the official description from touring plans

858
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,340
from Lynn Testis touring plans.

859
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,380
In response to concerns from parents,

860
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:41,660
Beetlejuice's body banter has been toned down

861
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,780
since the show's original incarnation.

862
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,540
But he still does some off color improv for the audio.

863
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,420
Officially designated B for body.

864
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,100
Well, it's like I like Len.

865
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:55,260
Len was probably just as offended as I would be by going to some sort of body

866
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,820
show, and he wanted to make sure that the people knew that Beetlejuice

867
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,940
was going to be talking about taking a shit.

868
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:07,660
Oh, yeah. I personally got told something that was too body about my show.

869
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,700
If I could share that, I don't know if this is allowed.

870
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,980
I think Jason knows where I'm going with this. I don't.

871
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,660
OK, no. OK, so the cost.

872
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,100
Oh, OK, so I was going to talk about the costume.

873
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,460
I guess I'll get back to that. So the costume for Fantasia was

874
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:28,980
like a bustier that was hella padded.

875
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,540
And then like.

876
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,220
I mean, that's what I want to talk about for a second.

877
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,460
It's like the bustier was hella padded.

878
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,820
So like the first day of rehearsal, we had fittings.

879
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:44,260
And I remember them going, she needs a bigger size and more padding.

880
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,540
And I was like, Brr, Brr, Brr, Brr, Brr and felt bad about myself.

881
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,900
But it's OK. So basically.

882
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,740
We also learned how to like contour our.

883
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,140
I don't know. I want to be appropriate to the good boys here.

884
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:01,300
So I don't know what I would have to say.

885
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,700
However you like to describe.

886
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,980
Wait, no, we're getting crazy.

887
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:07,100
We just had the debut of the word panties on the show.

888
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:10,060
We could do whatever now. Let's get it.

889
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,180
Crack. So my my boobies

890
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,900
looking crazy.

891
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,860
And I guess a couple of audience members were like,

892
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,260
that her boobs are a little like we're uncomfortable.

893
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,340
And the stage manager was like, hey,

894
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,900
we could you maybe not contour them so much because from audience,

895
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,140
it's it's playing like really not appropriate.

896
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,420
And I was like, OK.

897
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:37,140
But like also the padding was like four inches thick.

898
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,780
And like also I was wearing like a Victoria's Secret push up bra.

899
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,660
Like it was meant to be like that.

900
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:46,380
Like so it was just kind of like, yeah, it was a very

901
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,300
parents like somebody.

902
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,700
Comparents like went and found a worker.

903
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,700
Like apparently they put effort.

904
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,300
They put they put effort into that.

905
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,580
Yeah. And I wasn't the only girl who had that problem.

906
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:01,500
The full time girl.

907
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:07,100
Was well endowed and the costume made it look more crazy.

908
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,820
And so like I remember I felt so bad for her because people online

909
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,500
were like, oh, look at that boob lady.

910
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,620
And it's like, come on, guys, like that's that's I felt so bad.

911
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,580
Because like, what is she supposed to do about it?

912
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:25,380
And this is the same, you know, property that produce Bill Intents.

913
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:29,220
Like, oh, OK, Bill Intents hate crime adventure.

914
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:36,940
Yeah, I mean, that's that's I mean, I am sure being in these shows,

915
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:41,980
especially being a woman, like you run into like every from every angle.

916
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:46,140
You try being a Hogwarts student wearing a skirt

917
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,940
and having creepy old dads take pictures with you and people

918
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:53,260
like touching you and meet and greets where you're like, get off of me, sir.

919
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:58,460
Like, like it has to like, I can only imagine like you're hearing

920
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,500
like this is too extreme.

921
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,260
This isn't good enough.

922
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,300
You're not good enough.

923
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:08,500
It's good. Then like people, weirdos in the park, like you're just like,

924
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,980
you do like 10 battles, you're probably fighting at once often, I'm assuming.

925
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:13,820
That's my assumption.

926
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,300
Yeah, definitely.

927
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,260
And also just like in the entertainment community,

928
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:20,580
there's typically more women than men competing.

929
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:24,140
So like also at the same time, they're very quick to be like, you're replaceable.

930
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:24,900
You know what I mean?

931
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,340
Like, I guess everybody is in theme park.

932
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:30,820
But like you definitely do feel like if there's a younger girl

933
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,540
or a girl who just did a show that like got a lot of notoriety,

934
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,500
she could take my job.

935
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,460
Like, so, yeah, it was it was.

936
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,220
I mean, that's a very small part of this.

937
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,420
I don't want you to think I didn't enjoy my experience,

938
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,420
but yeah, it definitely is a part of it.

939
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,700
But it's yeah, I mean, it sounds like to what we've heard, like people have,

940
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,100
sorry, a lot of different jobs as well.

941
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:54,460
So like it feels like your stability ends up like you're like, well,

942
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:59,100
I'm doing three shows at once just because that's sort of the nature of this.

943
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:04,420
And people get shuffled in and out and it feels not permanent from.

944
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,860
Oh, for sure.

945
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,020
Yeah. Theme park work.

946
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,220
I mean, a lot of entertainment work is not permanent.

947
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:12,380
And I think that can be, you know, a lot of people can relate to that.

948
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:17,060
However, with theme park jobs every year, we would have to almost

949
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:19,340
like re audition kind of thing.

950
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:22,260
They were called like our contract auditions, I think.

951
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:28,660
And each like February, you would have to go in, do like a song and a monologue,

952
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:33,540
depending on what your role was, just to kind of like keep in touch

953
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,940
and freshen up and stuff.

954
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:38,180
And then at that time, they'd also go like, we want to cross train you here.

955
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,700
Let's have you read for this or like we think maybe and you know, whatever.

956
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,500
And after that, the talks would be who's going to have the four day contract,

957
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,740
who's going to have the three day contract, who are going to be the top three

958
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,260
under that and who's going to go in the pool.

959
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:52,140
So every year you could change.

960
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:56,100
And like also someone could get a contract on it.

961
00:50:56,100 --> 00:51:00,380
So this actually relates back to my Beetlejuice audition.

962
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,100
I was the second cast to learn the new show.

963
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,660
So I wasn't the opening cast of the version that I did,

964
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,380
but I was in rehearsals as they were opening.

965
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:16,020
So they had this replacement audition because the girl who originally got cast

966
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:22,660
as Fantasia for the next round of people learning it, she booked a cruise,

967
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,580
I think cruise ship job.

968
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:27,380
So they had a last minute like, oh, shit, we need to fill this.

969
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:30,740
So I randomly got pulled in because I was internal and I just auditioned

970
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,660
from my contract audition.

971
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,340
And so it was like me and a handful of other girls that already worked

972
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,580
in the park that I knew.

973
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:41,860
And they had us just like head to head doing like choreo and like

974
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:45,740
singing and harmonies and who looks right with this person

975
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,660
and who sounds right with this person.

976
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,460
And I booked it that way.

977
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,420
So if that girl hadn't gotten the cruise contract,

978
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,460
I may not have never learned it.

979
00:51:55,460 --> 00:52:00,060
And also the funny thing was every time I would audition for that show,

980
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,300
I guess it was twice, I was called for Cleo.

981
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,340
I was never called for fan.

982
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:06,300
So when they they gave me Fantasia, I was like, cool.

983
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,940
But like I only ever sang for Cleo, like I think because I'm short.

984
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:14,180
So it was pretty wild when they but it's because the girl

985
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,860
like a vacancy kind of opened up for Fantasia.

986
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,740
So. Yeah, it's pretty wild.

987
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:23,020
It seems like there's just the other.

988
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:26,860
Yeah, like there's just like 50 different things that they throw, like any

989
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,620
you get jobs thrown to you at last second.

990
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,820
I mean, this happens in the entertainment industry, but it seems like there's

991
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:37,060
so many more considerations for specifically theme park entertainment work.

992
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,100
Like there's just so many variables, so many options.

993
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,740
Yes. You've got to be prepared for anything.

994
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,060
There's nepotism.

995
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:50,220
Sure. There's, you know, seniority, for example, the the

996
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:55,580
Beetlejuice in the link that I think Jason sent you that I was in.

997
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,580
He had been a Beetlejuice for decades, so some of them,

998
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:02,140
they kept around for each version, but some were not.

999
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:05,580
Some people would get cut between versions and they were really hurt

1000
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:08,940
because it's like, you know, that it could feel really personal.

1001
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:12,180
But it's like maybe it's just like they changed the song that Dracula sings.

1002
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,820
And now it's not your register.

1003
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,940
It doesn't sound right in your voice.

1004
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,700
Or we're changing the look of bride.

1005
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,220
And, you know, unfortunately, like you don't fit it anymore.

1006
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:21,540
You never know. Like you literally never know.

1007
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,860
So it was always kind of scary.

1008
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:27,380
And that's why I kind of put my, you know, like I want to be at this stage,

1009
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:30,380
this stage, this stage, this stage, because you never know which one's going to go

1010
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:35,980
under or you never know how long you'll fit that type or like, you know, it's crazy.

1011
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:42,100
It's interesting to like, well, you had told weren't you at one point like,

1012
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:46,700
yeah, I worked at Universal these days and then I'd be at SeaWorld these days.

1013
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,220
Or was it SeaWorld and Lego?

1014
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:51,500
Like when you lived in Orlando, you did the full grounds.

1015
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,380
Yes. So even I would do two venues in a day at the same park.

1016
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,420
I remember one day I did a couple of shows with Frog Choir and then hopped over

1017
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,500
to Beetlejuice because they needed coverage.

1018
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:03,500
So that was always fun to kind of just like hop around.

1019
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,140
But yeah, I did some seasonal work with SeaWorld.

1020
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,340
Please don't cancel me.

1021
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:14,260
It was it was third party entertainment.

1022
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,540
So I didn't actually work for SeaWorld.

1023
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,420
I worked for a third party company.

1024
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:21,460
But they they did like Christmas and Halloween time stuff for kids and families.

1025
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:24,220
So that was a really fun, easy job.

1026
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:30,140
I got to be like a pretty princess and like just stand there basically and get paid

1027
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,180
for a lot of it or like for Christmas.

1028
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,780
I was a Polar Express elf, which sounds like funny and lame,

1029
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,500
but honestly, it was so magical.

1030
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,500
It was so magical.

1031
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,820
And then I did Legoland.

1032
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,180
I never worked at Disney.

1033
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:47,100
I auditioned at Disney a lot and I got fit for some stuff.

1034
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,460
And it was close to getting some stuff.

1035
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,380
Oh, and Nick Hotel.

1036
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,940
I auditioned for Nick Hotel, booked a show, and then the show fell under.

1037
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,220
And then the hotel went under.

1038
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,420
So I almost worked at Nick Hotel.

1039
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,260
Wow. What was the role?

1040
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,780
It was going to be like a pop style show.

1041
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:08,660
And the audition song was It's Always a Good Time.

1042
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,060
Wow. Yeah, that's right.

1043
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,180
I know y'all love that one. Owl City.

1044
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,540
Right. Yeah, baby. Yeah.

1045
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:19,660
That's going to be like a Disney Channel rock style show, but for Nick Hotel.

1046
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,940
And then I booked it.

1047
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,500
And then they said, J.K., it's not happening.

1048
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,900
We don't have money. And then it was like, hmm.

1049
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:28,020
Wow. Now, but you but it all worked out because you did.

1050
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:32,500
While you didn't get to do good time, you did get to both whip and Nae Nae.

1051
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,060
Oh, I have it in my notes, too, Scott.

1052
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:39,780
I feel I I asked you because you you said,

1053
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:44,180
like, I knew the show got as the different versions go on,

1054
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:47,980
they add more and more like topical stuff like the one around ninety nine, two

1055
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:51,220
thousand. They had live in La Vida Loca in that one.

1056
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:55,700
And if you went to Orlando in nineteen ninety nine, two thousand,

1057
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,580
you could not escape Ricky Martin's live in La Vida Loca.

1058
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:00,780
It was playing in all the parks.

1059
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,060
It was playing everywhere.

1060
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:05,300
And when you said when we said we were going to do this, I was like,

1061
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,020
well, what was the topical thing in your show?

1062
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:12,140
Did you guys do the Harlem Shake? And you know, we did the whip and the Nae Nae.

1063
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,020
We also did the Harlem Shake.

1064
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:16,540
It changed every few months. Oh, OK.

1065
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:23,580
So we did we did Harlem Shake, I think we did all about that base,

1066
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,900
which was like, OK, we did whip and Nae Nae.

1067
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:29,140
We did. Oh, there was one more.

1068
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:32,580
I almost want to say Gondam style, but I don't remember if that was it.

1069
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:36,100
Holy grail. But they would change, like, right.

1070
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,380
Some days I'd go in.

1071
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,500
And if I happen to be there on the day where they're changing,

1072
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,220
it was always kind of exciting because they'd be like, hey, guys,

1073
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:44,180
we're going to update the the possession song.

1074
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:46,540
Like when he takes over and we all like, what is it?

1075
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,300
And they'd be like, we're doing whip and Nae Nae.

1076
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,420
We'd be like, yeah.

1077
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,420
And then we'd go out and rehearse it because it would be like a new time thing.

1078
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:55,900
So there was one day I got to be there for a change and I felt like really cool.

1079
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,300
Wow. I was really late.

1080
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:02,020
I will be the first cast to whip and Nae Nae.

1081
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,180
It's so dumb, but that's how they make you feel it.

1082
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:08,700
Like, it's so competitive there because it's like that's the gig is like you work in the park.

1083
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,500
So when you get little things like that, even though it means nothing,

1084
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:14,140
you feel like, well, did you do that yet?

1085
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,620
Oh, well, I was there the first. It's so catty.

1086
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,580
It's so dumb.

1087
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:21,580
Huge pop from the crowd when Frankenstein starts to whip and Nae Nae.

1088
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,060
Oh, yeah. Very funny.

1089
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:25,540
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

1090
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,860
Well, was it was the video?

1091
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:28,980
It was your video, right?

1092
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,300
Where it's a psych.

1093
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:33,420
They say psych because they're playing for the start of Thriller.

1094
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:37,540
And then they go psych and then whip and Nae Nae starts.

1095
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:41,020
And it's a great misdirect.

1096
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:41,820
And then, oh, yeah.

1097
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:45,140
Could you imagine them having the rights to that song with all the pyro money

1098
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,420
they put into that show plus rights to that song?

1099
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,580
They would go bankrupt.

1100
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,140
I'm I'm confused.

1101
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:54,140
We should really look into this, like what the what the theme park music

1102
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:57,420
rights situation is, because we've seen

1103
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:04,900
like Charlie Brown and not scary farm do a parody of Thriller called Spooky Night.

1104
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,500
But is that do they have to pay or is it a parody?

1105
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,580
So they don't have to pay.

1106
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,180
It's covered. No parodies covered.

1107
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,060
Is that why they were allowed to do it?

1108
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:16,620
Because they make it the very cutting parody Spooky Night

1109
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:20,260
because it's a spooky, spooky night.

1110
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:25,500
Also, like, is anyone actually tracking notses like approval of things?

1111
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,220
It's a pretty big park.

1112
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:30,020
I mean, you think they would like have a lawyer.

1113
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,860
Oh, yeah, you got we got to go.

1114
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,460
Well, the world shut down.

1115
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,540
Twenty twenty three will go. Great.

1116
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,220
Do you do you think

1117
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:41,900
Carlos Santana or Rob Thomas was in the audience

1118
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,300
and then Frankenstein starts playing smooth?

1119
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,740
It's just like, what the fuck?

1120
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:47,900
I didn't clear this. What the hell?

1121
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,100
Yes, I think that's very likely.

1122
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,820
Yeah, you just started that famous solo up.

1123
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:57,500
So, yeah, I am.

1124
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,980
I guess they probably have to get the rights.

1125
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:02,300
But is it because that thriller piece is so like short

1126
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,540
because they're playing the intro, they didn't have to pay for it?

1127
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,180
And there might be like one thing off in there,

1128
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,060
like it might have a slightly different like instrument added.

1129
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:11,860
So technically you could say it's not the same.

1130
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:14,900
I don't know. I actually don't know.

1131
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:19,460
Yeah, because those those Star Wars, the hyperspace hoopla

1132
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:22,980
would have tons of new pop songs.

1133
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,940
And like, oh, sorry.

1134
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,780
No, no, I was just going to say, I like in that, like,

1135
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,860
that's a very visible show.

1136
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:33,220
Yeah, I feel like because Disney has its own like,

1137
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:35,820
I mean, Universal has its own like record label, too.

1138
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:40,300
But Disney music, I think, encompasses a lot of different things

1139
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,860
because of how big it is as a corporation.

1140
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:47,500
So I wonder if some of the stuff got in that way for Disney.

1141
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:51,060
I'm not sure. I have friends that did the hoopla, though.

1142
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,300
I just. Oh, wow. Really?

1143
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,220
Did you ever think about trying to do the hoopla?

1144
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,140
I think I was too young.

1145
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,300
OK, that was going on.

1146
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,340
I am but a child.

1147
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,260
I'm just kidding.

1148
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,740
Um, I was born in the 90s, though.

1149
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:07,860
I will say that.

1150
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:10,340
That reflects.

1151
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,260
You were getting out. You were getting out easy.

1152
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,140
You were getting out easy.

1153
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:16,140
So far, I have gotten out pretty easy.

1154
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,060
Yeah, we still got some time.

1155
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,620
I mean, we still got time.

1156
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:22,340
I guess we didn't really talk about how we met.

1157
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:25,940
I don't know how much you want to share at middle school.

1158
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:27,700
You met at her middle school.

1159
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:31,220
Well, OK, I was walking by a candy shop and there was this man.

1160
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:39,180
No. Well, we we met on a dating app, but we had mutual friends.

1161
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:45,380
And we were we were walking the same way to our first date,

1162
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,540
like crossing a street at the same way.

1163
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:50,500
And like, I kind of thought it was him, but it was like awkward.

1164
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,900
And I was just like, Jason.

1165
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,540
And he like turned and he was like, hi.

1166
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:58,140
And I just was like, hi.

1167
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,540
But, you know, obviously, it sounds like a me.

1168
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:02,660
Cute to me.

1169
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:03,860
It was cute.

1170
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,300
Yeah, it was.

1171
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:09,580
And you had kind of alluded to working in the theme park sphere.

1172
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:12,860
And I had kind of alluded to

1173
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:18,660
doing something being obsessed with the theme park sphere.

1174
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:22,980
Yeah. So I think too much time thinking about the theme park here.

1175
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:28,020
Did you bring did you bring up on the first day, like Jim Hill and Lantesta

1176
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,060
or season pass?

1177
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:30,220
That's an effort.

1178
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,300
We just brought up childhood traumas.

1179
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,060
We just yeah, that's fine.

1180
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:37,260
That's a little more relatable.

1181
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,140
I would say, yeah, save Jim and Len for date two.

1182
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:41,420
Yeah, exactly.

1183
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:43,140
Seal the deal. Right.

1184
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:47,300
Yeah. Is would you say because you obviously like you were living

1185
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:50,820
the theme park life, but Jason was no Jason.

1186
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,620
Look, the three of us are outsiders.

1187
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:53,620
We didn't.

1188
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:56,100
I mean, Scott obviously worked at Universal, but we're not like

1189
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,980
we weren't like completely immersed in this for years.

1190
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,300
Like not anymore.

1191
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,580
Jay's trying to get back in.

1192
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:02,980
I'm working every day.

1193
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:07,180
Well, you need to be more flexible.

1194
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:08,500
You needed to be more flexible.

1195
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:12,180
You needed to be able to sub into a Beetlejuice show or a Spider-Man Rocks.

1196
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,260
That's true. I never offer.

1197
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:17,060
I never like made it put it on the table that I could host Fear Factor Live.

1198
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:20,700
Right. Or the animal actor show or something like

1199
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,660
you get a call tomorrow this morning like this morning.

1200
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:24,980
Scott, we need you at the animal actor show.

1201
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,660
All right, I'll be there.

1202
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:28,140
And then like everyone say hello to Henry.

1203
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:32,020
And then a Falcon flies at my face and I go, oh,

1204
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:35,260
one time I got to go meet all those animals, by the way,

1205
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,580
and like go backstage and see them all.

1206
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:40,380
And it was like the best day of my life because they have some

1207
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:41,500
that they don't use in the show.

1208
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,940
And they were so cute.

1209
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:46,660
I mean, that sounds very fun to see the animals.

1210
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:51,380
It was. Do you think the host of like the animal actors ever,

1211
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:54,900
maybe he was playing Beetlejuice, maybe like the day before in the morning

1212
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,780
he came out and he was like, I just took a shit.

1213
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:00,660
Oh, I'm sorry. I mean, the animals here are all trained

1214
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:01,940
and they've been in the movies.

1215
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:04,020
And this is a hawk that can catch

1216
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:07,700
this can catch a piece of food in its talons.

1217
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:08,780
That's so funny.

1218
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:13,820
Well, I will say, like for like Frog Choir, you have to have like the accent.

1219
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:17,140
Sorry to ruin everybody's illusion that I'm not actually English.

1220
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:21,940
But and I if I was doing that enough, sometimes it would like slip in

1221
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:25,140
a little because you just get used to like for meet and greets,

1222
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,660
you have to stay in character and you talk a lot.

1223
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:29,580
It's OK, sweetie.

1224
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:33,020
J.K. Rowling ruined everyone's illusion that she's not a fucking scumbag.

1225
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,900
Yeah, that's right.

1226
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:37,780
At least my job with that ended before that shit show.

1227
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,220
Hey, that's true.

1228
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:42,580
You're not being photographed in the wardrobe of this

1229
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,140
tainted franchise.

1230
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:46,580
That's good news.

1231
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,460
This is the biggest moneymaker for Universal ever.

1232
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:53,220
My God, it's now like its creator won't shut up.

1233
01:03:54,100 --> 01:04:00,060
Yeah, Disney had like a entire like land themed to the Cosby show.

1234
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,660
Huck's Huck's double.

1235
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:06,420
No, cause be raised.

1236
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:10,900
Oh, God, if if people do five minutes of the psychos

1237
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:14,100
who create comic books, they do five minutes of research.

1238
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,220
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1239
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:16,460
Don't put that in anyone's head.

1240
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,340
Those like maniacs and oh, yeah.

1241
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:25,220
So what was like her word was in my train of thought and all around.

1242
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:26,060
I'm completely lost.

1243
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:29,380
You were asking about if somebody went from one show to the other.

1244
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:30,820
We were talking about. Oh, yeah.

1245
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:32,860
Hi, we were talking about hoopla.

1246
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:35,300
Oh, that's what I was going with it.

1247
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:38,180
I was going to say like Jason's level of fandom,

1248
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:43,020
which is probably similar to our level of fandom, like when you heard

1249
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:46,300
like the information where he would say like, oh, I looked at this blog

1250
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,020
and the blog tells me about a new churro flavor.

1251
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,300
Was that your type of fandom as well?

1252
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,020
Or were you more like just like, hey, this is just my job, buddy.

1253
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:58,300
So I have to say, I also grew up being a theme park nerd.

1254
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:02,180
So when we moved away from Florida when I was 10, every year

1255
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:05,740
I would order the vacation DVD and watch it like religiously.

1256
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,620
So I was a little freak, too.

1257
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:08,860
OK, definitely.

1258
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:13,900
Um, just another just another nasty little freak.

1259
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:16,460
The rest was just another free.

1260
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:18,460
It doesn't know this.

1261
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,660
This fandom surprisingly easy to break into.

1262
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:31,260
But but also at the time, like it did also feel like, oh, it's just my job.

1263
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,460
Like when I got when I first my first show, I learned Universal was Frog

1264
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:37,060
Choir as the like conductor in Florida.

1265
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:42,580
And I remember like when I booked it, everyone was like, oh, my God,

1266
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,100
are you so happy to read all the books?

1267
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,780
And I still to this day, I haven't read all the books.

1268
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,780
Like I was like, no, like it's a job.

1269
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:49,740
Like I was I was excited. It was really fucking cool.

1270
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:54,860
But like I wasn't really my thing is a cool job.

1271
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:59,500
So so you weren't like, I guess, yeah, you were just like, oh, yeah, I'm I'm

1272
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:05,100
I also have an affection for these old VHS free VHS tapes and like, let's watch.

1273
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,300
I clicked pretty fast about stuff like that.

1274
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:09,740
Yeah, which was nice, because I had never.

1275
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:12,340
So I remember one of our like first times hanging out, too.

1276
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:16,500
I was like, do you want to watch like this theme park video

1277
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,700
of like history of this thing?

1278
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:21,580
And I was like, I've never watched these with anyone but myself.

1279
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:23,620
And I think Jason was like, yeah, I don't think I have either.

1280
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:24,900
And I was like, this is nice.

1281
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:28,020
Like it was cute. Like, like, oh, we're both kind of nerds.

1282
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:29,660
And like my friends were I told my friends about that.

1283
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:31,140
They're like, you guys are fucking nerds.

1284
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:33,700
I was like, I know. I love it.

1285
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,380
Hey, that's great. It's to get Lindsey, I think.

1286
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:38,020
And I think she would say that, like,

1287
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:41,660
she was kind of like a lobster in a pot of water with the theme park stuff.

1288
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,940
Because when we started dating,

1289
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:46,300
when we started dating, we both really loved Disneyland.

1290
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:47,180
It would go a lot.

1291
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:51,860
And then I really started turning up the heat on like blogs and WDW

1292
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:54,900
magic forums and podcasts.

1293
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:59,380
And hey, listen to this thing that that that they said on the Diz.

1294
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:03,900
Like that would be so all of a sudden years in, she was like, OK, I

1295
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:07,420
I don't need every rumor that you've read on the message.

1296
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:10,140
Dial it to 60 percent or so.

1297
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:12,020
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1298
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:14,220
We definitely have taken turns.

1299
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:16,820
Like if we were hanging out, like one of us would be like,

1300
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:18,100
oh, did you see this thing?

1301
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,940
And then the other I feel like we're 50 50.

1302
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:23,100
I'm like, no, not now.

1303
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,580
No theme park right now, please.

1304
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:27,700
That's for sure. Yeah.

1305
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,900
If I if I was having like any kind of issue or drama with like

1306
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,260
the more work side of my work, I would be like,

1307
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:37,700
I just can't think about theme parks and we do anything else like. Yeah.

1308
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,100
OK, let's go.

1309
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,620
Let's go back to Beetlejuice.

1310
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:42,980
Yeah, because I have a question.

1311
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:44,140
It is so off track.

1312
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:44,620
No, no, no.

1313
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:45,460
Is what happens.

1314
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:49,740
But I but we can't let this pass without me asking a question about

1315
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,820
from the video that

1316
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:55,260
your last performance.

1317
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,500
And maybe you don't have the answer.

1318
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:00,220
Beeljuice makes you know, there's there's topical jokes throughout.

1319
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:03,020
He does one of our favorite thing like the Aladdin Genie.

1320
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:05,980
But there's one that's baffling to me, which is at some point

1321
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:10,660
he looks at someone in the audience and he says, Hey, Lamar Odom, time to get up.

1322
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:13,020
I caught that too.

1323
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:17,500
Yeah. I mean, I I think I know what that joke is.

1324
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,780
What is it? I think so as well.

1325
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:24,100
Well, he was in like a drug induced coma after spending time at a brothel.

1326
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,420
Am I wrong? Oh, I think that is the reference.

1327
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:31,300
Yeah, like that seems to be what that joke is.

1328
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,300
And a hospital.

1329
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,180
Oh, oh, geez.

1330
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,420
That's pretty dark.

1331
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:38,020
But I sounds right. Unfortunately.

1332
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:39,340
Yeah, look, I know what that was.

1333
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:42,220
He was with Chloe Kardashian at the time.

1334
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:43,740
Mm hmm. OK.

1335
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:44,940
And it was a whole thing.

1336
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:45,820
It was a whole no, no.

1337
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:47,100
I think he had to see he was splitting.

1338
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,820
They were on and off again.

1339
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:52,260
And then he he was in the hospital with a coma, which that is a

1340
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:54,700
that's a pretty crazy joke to make at a theme park.

1341
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:58,460
I feel like because it is associated with Kardashians, it's like, guys,

1342
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:01,820
Kardashians is safe space, like everybody fucking hates them.

1343
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:03,700
Just dish on them all day.

1344
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:06,500
Like, I feel like anything Kardashian related is always like, ha ha.

1345
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:07,980
They're going to fucking love that.

1346
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:09,300
It's like, all right.

1347
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,700
I yeah.

1348
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:16,420
In the in the previous version that ran in the early till 2000s to 2014,

1349
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:19,740
there is like rapid fire Paris Hilton jokes.

1350
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:23,100
But then in a version I watched, he makes a very quick reference

1351
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:27,180
to the mayor of Toronto, which I believe is the reference to the

1352
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:33,620
now deceased Rob Ford, the former maniac mayor of Toronto.

1353
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:34,540
Wow. Yes.

1354
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:38,740
I mean, that I will say, though, the Lamar, that joke seems crazier to me.

1355
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:39,740
I don't know what the time frame.

1356
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,540
Maybe he was out of the coma at this point.

1357
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:45,300
But that is I can't imagine the genie making a joke about that

1358
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:48,900
during the Aladdin show like, oh, you're taking a nap.

1359
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:51,180
Are you Lamar Odom? Like a grittier.

1360
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:56,900
That that made that made me think of something to bring to the table,

1361
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,980
which is, yeah, there's Paris Hilton stuff.

1362
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:02,540
I saw a really old one that is, you know, we're going to have some monsters here.

1363
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:06,780
You know, you call them the Jerry Springer show rejects.

1364
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:09,700
So that kind of thing.

1365
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:14,300
And that's a good slot, right, is calling somebody a monster.

1366
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:18,180
I think there's one with Kim and Kanye at some point in time.

1367
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:20,980
And I was like, if this thing was still going in 2020,

1368
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:24,620
is there a safe

1369
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:28,740
celebrity to put in that slot that where everyone would laugh

1370
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,980
and where it's not problematic in some way?

1371
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:35,940
Yes. Any of the 20 executive branch members

1372
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:38,620
who got covid from their own hubris?

1373
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:41,220
Well, that's what we think. But well, that's yeah.

1374
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,540
But that doesn't play. Yeah.

1375
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:45,420
They're going to play in Florida. They're not going to do that. All right.

1376
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:48,380
I mean, I agree. They're open to be mocked.

1377
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:51,500
But yeah, I don't think they're even doing like a Trump hair joke.

1378
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:54,540
I think I think in I think theme park world is so skittish

1379
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:57,500
that they would not even make fun of his orange complexion.

1380
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:00,700
Well, I mean, in the version

1381
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:05,740
that I was in, he does make a Mary Kate and Ashley joke.

1382
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:09,060
Oh, because he has the little shrunken head thingies

1383
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:10,860
and there's like very bony and skinny.

1384
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:11,900
And I think that's the joke.

1385
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,900
And I think it's still kind of mean, but

1386
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:19,020
also kind of like I think they've been out of the spotlight enough.

1387
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:20,260
But it's not really 2020.

1388
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:22,100
I'm trying to think. I don't know if there is.

1389
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:26,580
Well, like, I mean, if you're a question, I don't think relevant celebrity probably.

1390
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:28,740
But like up until, you know, whenever the Aladdin show went away,

1391
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:31,420
which is a couple of years already, Jeannie, up until the very end

1392
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:34,540
was making a Dr. Phil joke and snow.

1393
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:39,620
And I feel like I feel like, yeah, I feel like that type of thing.

1394
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:42,500
Yeah. That's a couple of years past its prime.

1395
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:45,980
There has been consistent Dr. Phil's just on the air.

1396
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:47,260
You know who he is.

1397
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:49,980
He doesn't have any controversy, but you know, he sounds like this.

1398
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:53,140
So you can say like it has to be that safe.

1399
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:57,980
Yeah, I feel like Carrot Top is like a good, but that's not really distinct.

1400
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,900
But I feel like it's not good.

1401
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,900
Not a bad. Yeah, I know what you mean.

1402
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:05,220
It's got to be kind of culturally like everyone needs to know.

1403
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:07,140
We all agree we hate the Paul's.

1404
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:09,540
Everyone hates Logan and Jake Paul.

1405
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:14,180
But I don't think a theme park audience would necessarily know who they were.

1406
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:18,420
Right. It would be it would be like, I think also the reference probably,

1407
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,660
especially right now, would probably have to be like,

1408
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:25,020
Hey, Taylor Swift, I knew you were trouble when you walked in. Yes.

1409
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:26,700
That's funny.

1410
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:29,380
Like that would have to be the type of thing, I think, where it's just like,

1411
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:30,660
that's just a reference.

1412
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:32,940
Sure. It's not insulting Taylor Swift.

1413
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:36,860
Maybe slightly the idea that she is overexposed.

1414
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:39,260
Maybe like people are tired of Taylor Swift.

1415
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:41,740
Maybe that is a fair theme park joke to make.

1416
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:44,220
Maybe I'm still not super confident. Right.

1417
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,580
I think. Yeah, I'm not sure.

1418
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:48,300
It's a good question.

1419
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:49,140
It goes to show you.

1420
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:52,380
Just go way back and like do 80s references.

1421
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:53,900
Like, I pity the fool.

1422
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,740
Like just just stupid shit.

1423
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:57,860
That's like, I got to watch it.

1424
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:00,540
I'm going to get fired like Rosie and bar.

1425
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:03,980
I could see that flying, to be honest with you.

1426
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:07,060
I could see that being a thing that actually sounds about right.

1427
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:08,540
It's a few years old.

1428
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:10,380
Everyone knew she got fired.

1429
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,340
And nobody cares anymore because our world's on fire.

1430
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:14,100
Yeah. Yeah. Right.

1431
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,980
You got to have a little distance.

1432
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:17,940
Yeah. You got to have a little distance right now.

1433
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:22,700
I think it does sound like we're like railing against this.

1434
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,860
Do theme park cancel culture.

1435
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:26,540
We want the jokes back.

1436
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:29,340
Everybody we want to be able to say whatever we.

1437
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:32,180
Beetlejuice should have freedom of speech.

1438
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:36,220
He should be allowed to eviscerate the pop culture celebrities.

1439
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:38,180
Like sometimes try jokes out.

1440
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:44,580
And if we had one of our like managers, I guess, but like directors watching,

1441
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:47,340
they'd be like, maybe not that one.

1442
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:51,260
Like, yeah, another cute thing to get us back into the show.

1443
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,820
I get a little bit more.

1444
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:56,620
The two people that were like the head of our training

1445
01:13:56,620 --> 01:14:00,100
were two of the original brides in the first show in Orlando

1446
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:05,100
and the original bride in Orlando and Frankenstein are still married to this day.

1447
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,780
Well, wow. True love.

1448
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,620
Oh, they met through that.

1449
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:11,540
And then well, that here, that sets me up.

1450
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:16,260
The the the collision of this show and pop culture.

1451
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:19,820
I got to show you guys these photos

1452
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:23,540
because there's there's a big celebrity presence in the history of this show.

1453
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:28,940
Why? Right there in the middle, we got Wayne Brady as Dracula,

1454
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,780
who I imagine came up.

1455
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:35,180
We're doing this out of order, but I'm sure came up in the Ghostbusters episode.

1456
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:41,700
And and then the probably most famously one, Joey Fatone,

1457
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:44,660
who was a very regular performer.

1458
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:49,020
I think I think spent some time as Wolfie the Wolfman,

1459
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:52,180
but I at large some time as Dracula as well.

1460
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:55,460
I do have a story about Joey Fatone. Oh, great. Yes.

1461
01:14:56,700 --> 01:15:01,580
So the closing party that we had was like after the final performance,

1462
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:05,020
which was like after hours, kind of just for the cast and crew and some other people.

1463
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,340
And this, again, was like a week before I was about to leave.

1464
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:09,580
So it was just kind of like this final goodbye party.

1465
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:13,420
And a lot of the original cast or people

1466
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:16,660
who had done the roles previously were there.

1467
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:20,700
And Joey Fatone and what's the other one that lives in Orlando?

1468
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:25,100
What are the not not Lance or J.C., but Chris Kirkpatrick.

1469
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:27,620
I think it was Chris Kirkpatrick.

1470
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,300
They were there.

1471
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,340
Well, he said the after party, but Joey Fatone was there.

1472
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:34,580
And I remember, yeah, he's just like he lives in Orlando.

1473
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:36,780
Like he he just lives in Orlando. Like it's very chill.

1474
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:39,500
I don't know if I can. But

1475
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:45,540
no, I'm just saying like they're very normal, chill, like Orlando vibes.

1476
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:46,580
So he was just like chill.

1477
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:48,940
And I remember talking to him being like, hey, man, what's going on?

1478
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:51,180
And to me like, oh, I'm moving to L.A. next week.

1479
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:52,740
And he's like, I just left L.A.

1480
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:53,740
And I was like, that's cool.

1481
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:56,340
And then we went to the after after party at like a bar.

1482
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:59,660
Yeah. And Chris Kirkpatrick shows up and we're all like doing shots and shit.

1483
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:02,380
I'm like, I'm drinking with two people from in sync.

1484
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:04,740
Like, what the fuck is going on right now?

1485
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:06,420
Like, so, yeah, they were cool.

1486
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:09,660
And then Wayne Brady,

1487
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:13,180
he's kind of still like around in that way.

1488
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:15,580
Like he still talks a lot of theme park people that he knows

1489
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:18,820
are like mutual with the people I know. And

1490
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:23,060
I remember in the training group that I did,

1491
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:26,660
we didn't really have a lot of people of color in the show.

1492
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:28,980
So it was always very exciting when we did.

1493
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:31,660
And I remember in my training group,

1494
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:35,340
we did have a person of color playing Dracula and he posted about it.

1495
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,900
And Wayne Brady was like, hell, yeah, keep it going, man.

1496
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:40,660
Like he was very supportive and like, am I going to get canceled

1497
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:43,300
for saying that I was trying to make it nice? Oh, no, no.

1498
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:45,180
That's nice. OK.

1499
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:47,460
It seems like Wayne Brady was trying to be supportive.

1500
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:48,580
And yeah, yeah, yeah.

1501
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:51,940
Seemed like he was still invested in the invested in the community.

1502
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:54,420
You know, I am the Dracula.

1503
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:58,500
You know, you might you might get in trouble because Chris Kirkpatrick

1504
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:02,380
has been lying low for a couple of decades now because he's still terrified.

1505
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:05,220
Eminem will kick his ass.

1506
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:09,660
That's now that's that's a good run, Jason.

1507
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:11,100
That's a good safe reference now.

1508
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,620
That is 20 years old. It's 20 years old.

1509
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:19,900
Yeah. Unfortunately, much of culture is now post Stan

1510
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:26,220
in the generic term and Stan the maniacal fan who may kill you.

1511
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:28,540
Why have we embraced this term?

1512
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:31,020
Why do people want to be like Stan?

1513
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:33,540
I don't understand this.

1514
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:36,380
I term endearment now, I think, because like someone will be like,

1515
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:38,140
oh, my God, you're like so cool.

1516
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:42,060
I totally stand. And it's like, are you are you 17? Probably.

1517
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:46,500
The my thing, my thing with Stan is that like it feel like it came way late

1518
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:48,620
compared to the song.

1519
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:51,780
Oh, that's the whole thing is like it's a throwback kind of thing.

1520
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:55,460
Like like kids are not kids, but like teenagers discovering what that is.

1521
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:59,140
Maybe I think like maybe adults who actually knew the song started it.

1522
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:00,620
But then kids were like, what does that mean?

1523
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:03,100
Oh, it's like a throwback. I'm cool now.

1524
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:05,260
Like, I didn't know that song.

1525
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:10,100
Jane, do you think like, do you know more youthful slang than Jason?

1526
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:13,580
Or is he is he impressed you? OK. Yeah. OK.

1527
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:17,580
So honestly, now that I'm thinking about it, are you actually giving him

1528
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:20,700
the youthful slang he often uses and he's sort of passing it off

1529
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:23,260
as if he's young and hip? Yeah, there it is.

1530
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:27,060
I'm going to go ahead and say I have been the mastermind of this puppetry.

1531
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:30,140
Now, OK, the Palpatine to his Snoke

1532
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,140
in the know it sincerely.

1533
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:35,020
But honey, I made you a promise.

1534
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:40,420
I will, like I said many times, I'm never going to learn who Dua Lipa is.

1535
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:45,380
I just it's just never going to be like, oh, my God, did you see that?

1536
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:46,180
Like blah, blah, blah.

1537
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,380
Like I'll go off on stuff.

1538
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:50,260
And he's like, yes, something I definitely know.

1539
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:54,220
Dua Lipa and the baby's new remix.

1540
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:58,900
Yeah. Meanwhile, he writes down the baby

1541
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:01,740
and he knows he's going to put it in his pocket for the next episode

1542
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:05,740
to make our listeners think that he's just on the cutting edge of culture.

1543
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:09,460
Why, just this morning, we were talking about Blackpink's new album

1544
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:13,820
called The Album and how he wanted to buy one of the sweatshirts

1545
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:18,540
that's oversized and just says ice cream, which I support.

1546
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:22,740
Hell, yeah. There's a big hit single with Selena Gomez, a black pig

1547
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:26,140
that says ice cream and they sing about ice cream.

1548
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:28,460
The kids still like ice cream.

1549
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:30,660
I guess we are cool.

1550
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:33,780
Oh, yeah. Hey, let me tell you about ice cream, kids.

1551
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:37,460
Definitely not a metaphor for something much dirtier, but yeah.

1552
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:40,100
Oh, it's just about the sweet treat.

1553
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:44,700
Um, they don't do that stuff in Korea.

1554
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:49,220
I got so they got so many minders on the K-pop stuff.

1555
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:51,700
Like they they filter all that good with the cream.

1556
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:55,340
If you know what I mean, ice cream, ice cream, ice cream is one of.

1557
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:59,980
Ah, it just sounds like, you know, an audience list to me.

1558
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,580
Yeah, sounds like Ben and Jerry's run.

1559
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:05,260
Take it. Yeah, take it at face value.

1560
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:10,740
This will really prove how at the opposite end of this spectrum I am.

1561
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:15,460
And in fact, I in that I pine for pop culture that is from before I was alive,

1562
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:18,700
because I really lit up here.

1563
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:21,020
Let me just share the screen and throw this on.

1564
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:24,220
I was the most excited that this song

1565
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:28,460
appeared in an iteration of the shows from 1999.

1566
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:32,060
All right. Let's party.

1567
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:34,940
Rocking with Beetlejuice.

1568
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:37,660
Rocking with Beetlejuice tonight.

1569
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:40,740
Rocking with Beetlejuice.

1570
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:43,580
Rocking with Beetlejuice tonight.

1571
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:49,260
That's like, can you can even any everyone on this zoom say what that song is?

1572
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:51,380
I can't say the name.

1573
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:53,580
I know it, but I don't know the name of it.

1574
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:59,380
Not even this is this is a crossover of sticks into theme park world

1575
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:04,780
that is rock in the paradise made into rocking with Beetlejuice.

1576
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:11,420
And what could be more rocking than that with just that rocking with Beetlejuice?

1577
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:14,900
It reminded me so much of the Simpsons halftime show where they do

1578
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:19,060
the Lou Reed Walk on the Wild Side.

1579
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:21,660
Do be do be do.

1580
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:24,580
I mean, good news for me.

1581
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:27,700
I mean, Sticks, if you know, I don't know if there's a lot of crossover

1582
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:31,180
of our fans and Sticks fans, but Sticks is about as like

1583
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:35,940
Sticks rocks about as hard as a band comprised of Frankenstein and Dracula.

1584
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:39,620
They sort of are Beetlejuice's Graveyard Review.

1585
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:42,060
So this makes a lot of sense to me.

1586
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:46,220
I did in high school, our halftime show at the football games was all Sticks songs.

1587
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:51,180
It was so like, wait, I played it in that

1588
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:54,380
we did Mr. Roboto, we did.

1589
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:56,980
Oh, shoot, we did the big hits.

1590
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:02,020
Help me out. I haven't thought of a babe and too much time on my hands.

1591
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:04,500
Too much time on my hands.

1592
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,540
We did.

1593
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:08,460
You wouldn't have done heavy metal poisoning or any any other deep.

1594
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:09,780
No, no, no.

1595
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:10,700
We did too much.

1596
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,220
We'd said come sail away.

1597
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,500
Too much time on my hands.

1598
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,660
Mr. Roboto.

1599
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:17,420
What kind of band is this?

1600
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:19,660
A marching band marching band.

1601
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:21,460
You did it. It was an entire marching band.

1602
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:26,340
Sticks said, yes, we had a new band leader come in my senior year

1603
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:29,980
and he threw everything up in the air as far as like before that,

1604
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:32,020
it was all John Philip Sousa.

1605
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:33,820
And then he was like this

1606
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:36,860
like slightly younger in his early 50s man

1607
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:40,060
who just decided to switch the whole thing up.

1608
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:42,340
And it was like we're playing Sticks at halftime.

1609
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:44,660
And then when we went to Disney World that year,

1610
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:48,020
we played Paul Simon's late in the evening as we walked down Main Street,

1611
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:50,460
not John Philip Sousa or some sort of march.

1612
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:54,260
Switching out of John Philip Sousa is like the, you know,

1613
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:57,220
updating it to a baby reference today.

1614
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:58,580
Yes.

1615
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:00,340
Exactly equivalent.

1616
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:04,780
Well, and we were all I'd I have never really gotten into Sticks.

1617
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:07,780
I'm sure now maybe if I started to do a deep dive, I'll appreciate it more.

1618
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:10,260
But at the time, we were all just so confused.

1619
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:14,180
It's just the thing is, it's the there's no question

1620
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:16,300
it's the best behind the music to me.

1621
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:22,500
Learning about the tour where they acted and made a short film and played robots.

1622
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:24,580
I mean, the best, the best.

1623
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:27,100
I would like I will just find that behind the music.

1624
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:29,460
I will do that. Glorious.

1625
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:34,660
Classic rock strewn throughout it, too, because then Dracula performs

1626
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:39,580
a medley of just a regular cover of Hot Blooded,

1627
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:42,060
but dovetailed with a

1628
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:46,180
I guess a parody addicted to blood.

1629
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:50,140
As well face them addicted to blood.

1630
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:54,660
Yeah. And sometimes there's parodies and sometimes there's not.

1631
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:59,140
Yeah, even within that, that's like a parody followed by not a parody back to bed.

1632
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:02,380
So so it's interesting because Beale just comes out at the start of the show

1633
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:04,660
and he's being very, very, very bawdy.

1634
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:09,540
But then they go into a very clean parody of Prince's Let's Go Crazy.

1635
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:12,420
Mm hmm. But it is a parody.

1636
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:13,980
I wrote down I wrote down a line.

1637
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:17,500
They don't make it. Let's go shitting. Right.

1638
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:19,980
Let's go shitting.

1639
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:21,580
Let's go get some corn.

1640
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,020
Let's drop corn. I see.

1641
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:26,100
I see. Oh, I was going to I was going to make a body joke.

1642
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:29,540
Looking for the purple banana and I'll put it in my butt.

1643
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:33,060
And that's the full body parody.

1644
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,340
Let's go. Yeah.

1645
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:39,300
The original one has the most like hooray for everything,

1646
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,140
kind of like variety show vibes.

1647
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:45,340
But I was surprised how much like current ish music for the time

1648
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:49,220
was in it for the early 90s.

1649
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:50,860
Let's go crazy.

1650
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:54,060
I was thinking Let's Go Crazy, though, was going to be a holdover from there

1651
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:57,020
because it felt like such a clean with the line is like night is young.

1652
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:58,140
Got to take a bite.

1653
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:01,020
So hot. I feel a jolt. Got a party tonight,

1654
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:05,340
which feels very like hooray for everything. Clean version.

1655
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:08,460
She's so hot. I feel a jolt.

1656
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:13,260
Do you know all the words from the parody, Jane?

1657
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:17,180
I believe so. I can also do Cleo's rap, but I won't because.

1658
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:20,900
We well, I can.

1659
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:22,780
You could request it.

1660
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:26,020
Well, you your big song was Sweet Dreams.

1661
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:29,620
Yes. Sweet dreams are made of this, which later in the show,

1662
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:35,660
you know, mashups very popular in the 2010s was mashed up with Smooth Criminal,

1663
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:36,980
which I think it's really cool.

1664
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:40,620
They got an alien and farm song in there, you know,

1665
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:43,340
and then there was also Ballroom Blitz.

1666
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:45,900
That's the one you choose from.

1667
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:50,620
You think they would have gone with the movies,

1668
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:52,940
the alien and farm song about movies,

1669
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:55,900
but they went with Smooth Criminal.

1670
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:57,980
Not as big of a hit movies.

1671
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:59,620
No, not as big of a hit.

1672
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:01,500
I kind of like movies, though. I'll be honest.

1673
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,740
I do, too. I know movies.

1674
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:06,740
But you don't know the alien and farm movies.

1675
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:08,900
They get dressed up like Ghostbusters.

1676
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,340
Yeah, there's a video where they're dressed up.

1677
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:13,780
I don't know it.

1678
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:16,340
I'm not going to go too hard because I haven't heard in a couple of years.

1679
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:20,140
And it's probably not as good as my memory says it is.

1680
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:22,740
You know, hold up. Maybe might not hold up.

1681
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:25,980
Can I go back to 2006 if we're going to talk about rap?

1682
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:30,740
I think from what I found, my favorite rap performance in any of it,

1683
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:35,700
they really they rung in 2006 the right way with this little number.

1684
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:36,700
The new solution.

1685
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:58,580
What is the is it a parody?

1686
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:00,540
Is it a parody or is it just the song?

1687
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:02,220
I think it's just the what?

1688
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:03,740
The original lyrics, of course.

1689
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:07,740
Yeah, well, really, the one we know is a parody in a way.

1690
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:09,500
It's a clean parody.

1691
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:12,500
I couldn't it was a little too. Let's get it started.

1692
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:13,660
Oh, yeah.

1693
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:17,660
I that yeah, because I didn't hear we watched this version together.

1694
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:20,500
And I was like, oh, no, the audio messed up.

1695
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,900
They're playing the album cut. Oh, no.

1696
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:24,300
They put the rock CD.

1697
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:27,020
They're live singing, Jason, and they're live singing.

1698
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:29,700
They seem excited. Oh, no.

1699
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:32,820
I think of the Black Eyed Peas are like the sticks of rap.

1700
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:38,580
I think that that's about like they are as legitimate to rap as sticks was to rock.

1701
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:42,980
Well, I am looks like he drives Beetlejuice's car.

1702
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:45,180
How about that?

1703
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:47,660
He's got that big purple car.

1704
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:49,060
That is like.

1705
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:53,460
Oh, that car.

1706
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:55,660
Look up the car if you don't know the car.

1707
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:57,860
Oh, that reminds me of another question I have.

1708
01:27:58,220 --> 01:28:00,180
Do we think that in 2013,

1709
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:03,980
that Beetlejuice made a topical joke that was like,

1710
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:09,180
hey, anybody see the VMAs Robin Thicke's been stealing my wardrobe?

1711
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:13,140
For sure. For sure.

1712
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:14,580
He has that joke.

1713
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:15,540
Has to.

1714
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:18,180
I feel like they almost made that joke when I freaking did it.

1715
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:19,740
That might have still been relevant.

1716
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:20,940
That brought Beetlejuice back.

1717
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,340
Oh, yeah.

1718
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:26,020
Just because it's so specific, like people remember it.

1719
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:27,140
Oh, for sure. They made.

1720
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:28,420
Wow. That's nice to hear.

1721
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:29,780
I could have written for it.

1722
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:33,700
It's nice to know I could cut it as a writer for the mashup.

1723
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:38,660
We've been begging to be writers on one of these things,

1724
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:40,180
and no one has taken us up on it.

1725
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:44,380
No theme park has contacted us and said, write a show like this for us.

1726
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,140
We're ready to do it.

1727
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:48,180
I'm surprised. Yeah.

1728
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:49,260
I'm shell shocked.

1729
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:52,860
I know for a fact, there was some powerhouse talent involved

1730
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:55,060
in Jane's version in the mashup version,

1731
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:57,500
because one of the companies involved in making it,

1732
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:59,660
why they knew something about rock and roll.

1733
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:01,900
All right. They're called Renaissance Entertainment.

1734
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:05,900
And their co-owner and CEO is a man named John Binkowski,

1735
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,620
the head of Hard Rock Park.

1736
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:13,460
Whoa. The rock and his company and all of theme park entertainment.

1737
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:18,140
All all roads, all rock and roads lead to one man.

1738
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:20,460
Lead to one man, the man himself.

1739
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:23,100
Binkowski, come on, hook us up, Binkowski.

1740
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:25,260
Talk to this guy. We really got to talk to this guy.

1741
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:26,900
We got to talk to this guy.

1742
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:31,940
It's funny with turning it into Fast and Furious that like,

1743
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:34,580
I mean, that's like a little

1744
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:39,300
I think that is Universal's attempt at being current pop culture

1745
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:41,380
relevant, whether or not it's successful.

1746
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:43,740
But it's like they took this spot.

1747
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:48,700
It's like this area in the park is meant to be the spot for the kids.

1748
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:52,340
And by that, I mean the spot where they, you know, show what kids

1749
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:54,340
were talking about seven years prior.

1750
01:29:54,580 --> 01:30:00,220
So but at least that is maintained kind of by turning it into Fast and Furious.

1751
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:03,660
Right. That's true.

1752
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:08,540
But, you know, it sounds like it's again, I haven't been on the Orlando one either.

1753
01:30:08,540 --> 01:30:10,340
It sounds like it's not quite the same.

1754
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:14,140
Five minutes into watching these Beetlejuice things, I'm like,

1755
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:16,340
oh, this is more fun than supercharged.

1756
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:18,340
I mean, it is.

1757
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:19,340
It is.

1758
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:20,340
It's missing.

1759
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:25,940
It's missing. I feel like that park is missing a certain energy of this kind of like universal.

1760
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:29,380
Like, it's it's yeah, it's very loud.

1761
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:30,900
It's very pop culture.

1762
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:36,340
It's just a little body like they've kind of stripped a lot of of that out.

1763
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:38,380
Not even before covid times.

1764
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:45,700
I mean, yeah, I if the one in the early 90s, I felt like it had such an 80s aesthetic to it.

1765
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:51,780
Yeah, that I guess I guess I'm now I'm viewing it through the lens of like, oh, that's that's cool.

1766
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,260
The way they were making it look back then.

1767
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:56,580
But it's just because that's what like that was actually current.

1768
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:58,260
I'm thinking it was nostalgic back then.

1769
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:05,020
But it's like it feels like something like fun and very themed.

1770
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:09,500
It just feels more specific, I guess, is what I'm saying than like a screen ride.

1771
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:14,300
Like it feels more unique in original, even though it's it's, you know, a framework of a theme park show.

1772
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:18,060
But it feels like, oh, this would be a fun little thing that's different than everything else.

1773
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:24,300
Yeah. And as I as I say that, of course, they they were playing Great Balls of Fire in 1992.

1774
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:28,180
A 30 year old plus year old Jerry Lee Lewis.

1775
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:32,380
Rock and roll all night and party every day. Yeah. Yeah.

1776
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:35,420
Like, I don't know. I'll say this for comedy.

1777
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:40,820
There is that one of the jokes that I really appreciate it was there.

1778
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:47,460
There was a moment in one of the versions where Frankenstein, they shoot off a bunch of pyro and Frankenstein freaks out at the fire.

1779
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:50,740
That's a solid joke. That's a good joke. Yeah. Yeah.

1780
01:31:50,740 --> 01:32:00,980
They kind of played Frankenstein as the little like dumb, but lovable was kind of his thing, at least in our version was like in our version, too.

1781
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:06,980
It was supposed to be like in the previous versions, it was like he and the bride kind of had this like on again off again or like whatever.

1782
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:09,060
But in our version, it's like they're settled down.

1783
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:10,420
They're a couple.

1784
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:14,740
It's very cute. Like that was supposed to be their like arc, I guess, if there is one.

1785
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:17,820
But like so that was kind of cute.

1786
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:22,220
They made him just like dumb, lovable and like established that they were together.

1787
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:32,140
And the reason that worked is because they made Dracula like Fantasia's like love interest or vice versa, you know, because in the previous shows, Dracula would kind of be like, I wish it.

1788
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:34,300
I had Frankie's girl, you know, like all that stuff.

1789
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:38,340
So then I can't believe that's a solid joke, too.

1790
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:40,180
Yeah, pretty good.

1791
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:49,420
So like in our version, right before Fantasia's entrance, Beetlejuice is like, oh, you know, still haven't found anybody, Drac.

1792
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:52,300
And he goes, I've tried in vain, but I couldn't find my type.

1793
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:57,460
And he like gets the bride and then the bride's like, it's time for some new blood.

1794
01:32:57,460 --> 01:33:01,180
And so then I come out and then supposed to be like, Dracula's like, oh, who's she?

1795
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:02,420
And then he gets distracted by her.

1796
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:04,500
And then Cleo and Wolfman are kind of a couple.

1797
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:05,900
So it was kind of like couples.

1798
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:09,300
This whole thing is about trying to get monsters to hook up.

1799
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:14,340
Hell, yeah. This is a big rock and roll monster key party.

1800
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:15,740
Keys in the bowl, gang.

1801
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:24,780
Keys, your giant, your giant castle footlong castle keys, the keys in the drag keys to the Dracula.

1802
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:31,820
Do you know, do you know any other any info about Fantasia's backstory or like what?

1803
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:34,420
I guess I guess the question I have is what happened to her dad?

1804
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:38,220
Yeah, I don't know.

1805
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:41,140
I mean, I don't really know.

1806
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:42,620
I think it was kind of up for interpretation.

1807
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:47,180
But like there there are some cute moments where like if you're paying attention enough,

1808
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:49,460
there's little nods to him.

1809
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:54,380
Like when they do the girls just want to have fun bit for like the girl characters,

1810
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:58,460
Fantasia specifically sings the oh, daddy, dear, you know, you're still number one.

1811
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:03,780
And the choreography was like you as much as many times as you can draw attention to your mask,

1812
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:06,260
because that's your kind of go to thing for your character.

1813
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:11,980
So like Cleo's was like, your go to thing is mummy hands and like Egyptian hands.

1814
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:17,620
And then Fantasia's go to is like the rock hand and like the put your hand over your mask thing.

1815
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:22,940
So it was oh, daddy, dear, you know, you're and then you would do the little messing still number one.

1816
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:25,500
So like there's little nods if you're paying attention.

1817
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,940
But, you know, most people kind of miss is the number one.

1818
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:31,460
I don't know. I read it is pointing to the sky like maybe he died.

1819
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:34,700
I kind of take it that way, too.

1820
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:37,500
But I have a different reading of it.

1821
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:41,220
I think he's up in the rafters enjoying his daughter performing.

1822
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:43,980
Maybe that's much more wholesome.

1823
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:45,260
Right. He's that's what he loves.

1824
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:47,700
He loves being in the rafters, for God's sake.

1825
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:51,780
That's his whole thing in the rafters in the basement.

1826
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:53,820
Right. He loves to lurk about.

1827
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:56,300
So like he's not going to be in the audience with the tourists.

1828
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:58,100
He's going to be up, you know, watching.

1829
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:59,620
He gives her notes after every show.

1830
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:03,220
You were flat here and you were showing that contouring is kind of a tire.

1831
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:06,820
Oh, no, it's a gypsy.

1832
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:09,180
It's a gypsy gypsy rose.

1833
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:11,100
She's like Dracula saved me.

1834
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:12,180
It takes me away.

1835
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:15,140
I have to lie and say daddy's number one. It's not true.

1836
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:20,460
Daddy, do you know you're still number one?

1837
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:25,060
Jane, do you have any like do you remember any just like like times

1838
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:29,220
like the show went a little awry, funny stories with like other cast

1839
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:31,740
or like anything stick out like that?

1840
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:33,660
Yeah, for sure.

1841
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:37,620
I mean, even in watching the same video I keep referring to,

1842
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:40,900
there's some stuff where I was like, that was definitely something

1843
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:43,580
we all tried to like make happen that wasn't really allowed.

1844
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:45,980
But we were closing like if you notice in Balleroo Blitz,

1845
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:49,740
I crawl under Frankenstein's legs, which was just us fucking around being like,

1846
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:52,980
dude, I'm going to crawl under your legs when you cross from here to here.

1847
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:55,500
Be like, OK, man, like stuff like that.

1848
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:59,580
Or in that show, too, we're like, guys, let's add all the riffs that we can.

1849
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:03,700
And so you'll notice that some stuff there's like added riffs that we know

1850
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:05,340
because we've heard the show a million times.

1851
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:08,140
And we like I tried to add a riff here and you'll see people kind of laugh

1852
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:09,420
and be like, nice.

1853
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:13,220
And then also in that show, for some reason, one of the dancers,

1854
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:17,980
one of the male dancers in that show, we me and him had this like inside

1855
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:20,900
joke about like who could get the last like two claps in before

1856
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,300
we had to move to the next thing.

1857
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:26,260
So whenever we were like dancing together in like what I like about you,

1858
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:29,340
you can see us like both doing this because it was something

1859
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:30,820
that no one would really catch.

1860
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:32,540
But I think we were all just trying to have a good time.

1861
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:33,420
We were all really sad.

1862
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:35,180
There was closing and people were moving.

1863
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:36,820
And so it's like stupid shit like that.

1864
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:40,140
We had really fun backstage.

1865
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:45,180
Like happenings like just, you know, just funny shit

1866
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:47,580
because there are a lot of like costumes from the old shows.

1867
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:50,220
There'd be random wigs and shit everywhere, too.

1868
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:54,140
So people would get have fun with that and we'd all trade wigs like I would

1869
01:36:54,580 --> 01:36:56,340
because we had like wig caps and on and stuff.

1870
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:58,340
We would take a lot of stuff off because it's so hot.

1871
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:01,020
So one time I'd be like, oh, my God, can I try on your wig?

1872
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:02,900
I want to see what I'd look like at this or like, oh, my God,

1873
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:03,780
what if we did it like this?

1874
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:04,900
Like we would just have fun.

1875
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:09,100
Like we was just such a silly, silly, fun time.

1876
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:12,900
And like it really is like a family like we all still talk and we're all in like

1877
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:18,660
like a Facebook group of like Monster Family and like if someone's out here.

1878
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:21,140
That's which sounds funny, I guess.

1879
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:21,780
No, it is nice.

1880
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:24,300
And so like if someone's out here, I'll be like, oh, my God, I live here now.

1881
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:25,300
Like, do you want to hang out?

1882
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:30,660
Like there's a guy who did sound for us, who also does our date, I guess, tour stuff.

1883
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:33,380
So he did the Green Day Tour and he was doing something else.

1884
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:36,340
And any time he was out here rehearsing in Burbank, I'd be like, hey, man, let's hang out.

1885
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:37,740
And like we would hang out.

1886
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:39,140
And so it's just like not even a question.

1887
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:43,660
So it is like this really like runs in the blood, especially with like the original brides

1888
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:45,860
really being a big part of each iteration.

1889
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:51,980
It was kind of like a nice family to get, you know, kind of invited into.

1890
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:56,740
And another funny thing backstage, too, which I have a picture of and I'm sure Jason can send you guys.

1891
01:37:57,060 --> 01:38:02,660
We had like a full size Beetlejuice man, like figure statue.

1892
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:05,700
But like it was not it had like real clothes on.

1893
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:06,620
It wasn't like hard.

1894
01:38:06,620 --> 01:38:09,740
It was like an actual like figure, but it was man sized.

1895
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:12,020
And it would scare the crap out of me all the time.

1896
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:17,180
But we had one and we would always dress him up funny and like for Mardi Gras, put beads on him.

1897
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:19,660
And at Christmas, we made it look like he was decorating the tree.

1898
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:21,580
So like, that's pretty funny.

1899
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:29,260
And like the chair that was on the turntable before the red chair, our stage manager had that as her chair in her office.

1900
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:32,340
So if you'd go into the office, she was like sitting in the chair.

1901
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:34,900
Like it's just everyone loved it.

1902
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:36,580
And like it was just a fun time.

1903
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:40,900
And I think that's really why it's so sad it's gone, because my first thought was like they're going to destroy

1904
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:42,780
that break room where we had all that fun.

1905
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:45,380
Like that was really what my first thought was like, wow, that sucks.

1906
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:51,940
Like, you know, we had so much fun occupying time between shows and just like, you know, being stupid.

1907
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:54,340
And we all we did like a lot of us did our own makeup.

1908
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:57,820
I mean, Frankenstein, Beetlejuice and Wolfman had like airbrushing and stuff.

1909
01:38:57,820 --> 01:39:00,380
But the girls did a lot of their own makeup.

1910
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:05,060
So we would just be like at the makeup mirrors, just like having fun and like some day sucked.

1911
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:07,860
But so does every job. But like, that's what I take away from it for sure.

1912
01:39:07,940 --> 01:39:10,660
It's just like it was so fun.

1913
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:12,820
Like sometimes it didn't sound good.

1914
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:13,940
Sometimes it didn't look good.

1915
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:19,060
And I'll be the first to tell you that it's hard as hell to do all that cardio and belt and not be flat,

1916
01:39:19,060 --> 01:39:20,940
flat as hell all the time in that show.

1917
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:22,900
But did I have fun? Yes.

1918
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:25,020
Like, was it like living my best life?

1919
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:27,180
Yes. Like, I don't know.

1920
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:35,180
The graveyard review was the peak of not the peak, but like a just glory days in your life.

1921
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:37,820
Having monster slumber parties.

1922
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:39,780
I felt like a rock star.

1923
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:41,420
I mean, I had like the Britney Spears mic.

1924
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:46,940
We always called them the Britney Spears mic, these old ass, like big black, like mics.

1925
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:48,220
And it was just a good time.

1926
01:39:48,220 --> 01:39:50,180
We fucked around all the time on stage.

1927
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:53,060
Like we just yeah, it was fun.

1928
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:58,100
It sounds good. I look I in hindsight, wish I went right to Orlando at 18,

1929
01:39:58,100 --> 01:40:02,660
did a bunch of shows, partied at Pleasure Island every night.

1930
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:05,500
And that like I've that would have seems like very fun.

1931
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:09,540
And it's it's nice hearing that it seems like it was fun for the most part.

1932
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:12,900
Yeah, it really was fun.

1933
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:15,940
Sorry. Do you hear the dinging noise?

1934
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:18,460
No, no, no. Jason, do you hear that dinging noise?

1935
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:19,740
It just stopped. OK.

1936
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:21,580
Oh, no, I think it's fine.

1937
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:25,340
The cookies sounded like an alarm and I was like, oh, my God, what is that?

1938
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:28,580
The cookies are done.

1939
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:32,740
No, I will say 90 minutes cookie recipe.

1940
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:34,540
No, I didn't mean for that to come off like that.

1941
01:40:34,540 --> 01:40:36,940
I was very distracted. No, it really was.

1942
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:39,980
We, you know, after shows, we'd be like, you guys want to go to food and wine

1943
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:41,860
tonight and be like, hell, yeah, we'll meet you there.

1944
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:43,940
Like, oh, I was working over at this job today.

1945
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:45,340
I just did my shows there.

1946
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:50,740
But you're going to like, you know, it really was this cool like experience to

1947
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:55,140
very lucky to have had like just living in Orlando as an adult working in that

1948
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:59,940
industry. Like, I'm very glad that I'm where I am now and I'm no longer there.

1949
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:03,980
But at the same time, there's very fond memories and very learned a lot.

1950
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:06,820
And like, who gets to just be like, you guys want to go to food and wine

1951
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:08,140
tonight for fun? It's like, yeah, OK.

1952
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:10,540
Like that was like date night. That was like going out night.

1953
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:13,100
Like, I don't know. That's like one of my favorite.

1954
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,660
I mean, like I would go after Beetlejuice and I'd still have some of the crazy

1955
01:41:15,660 --> 01:41:19,220
makeup on and we would just go drink around the world like, oh, so should Mike.

1956
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:20,220
Did Mike mess up?

1957
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:23,140
Should Mike have done the alternate?

1958
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:26,020
Yes, I did. I absolutely messed up.

1959
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:27,780
I I'm not saying I would have moved out here.

1960
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:31,220
I'm just saying, though, instead of going to community college and stayed in my

1961
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:33,580
hometown, I should have gone to Orlando and had fun.

1962
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:35,780
I totally messed up.

1963
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:39,220
Mike, whenever whenever you talk like that, I always say the same thing.

1964
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:41,260
You got to get back in improv classes.

1965
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:43,060
You got to get to get some refreshers.

1966
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:45,020
Jason, shut the fuck up.

1967
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:49,540
So upset when you make those jokes.

1968
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:52,620
We wasted our whole lives doing improv.

1969
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:54,140
I don't need to go back.

1970
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:55,980
What'd you spend years doing classes on?

1971
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:58,420
You should have come into my graveyard review instead.

1972
01:41:58,860 --> 01:42:00,340
You know, you should have been in a real show.

1973
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:03,700
Playing should have been playing Beetlejuice.

1974
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:05,940
That's what I should have been doing.

1975
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:10,260
Your height would work to your advantage for a lot of stuff like you would book

1976
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:12,460
stuff, especially horror nights.

1977
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:15,300
I don't know if that would interest you at all, but your height, you would get

1978
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:20,180
booked immediately for shit like you would be Frankenstein everywhere.

1979
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:26,180
As long as I can play the goblin Beetlejuice character in any of these,

1980
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:29,860
like just do that voice for any of these characters I'm absolutely in.

1981
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:31,100
I'm very game.

1982
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:34,820
You are going to have to do jokes that are related to fecal matter.

1983
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:44,300
Look, if I will, I will go to church, I will go to the Holy Land experience.

1984
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:45,820
Light a candle.

1985
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:48,100
I used to live right by the Holy experience.

1986
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:48,860
Oh boy.

1987
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:50,620
Did you hear the baptisms?

1988
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:52,460
I would have to turn down that street.

1989
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:56,780
No, but I would have to turn down that street and pass all of the big like

1990
01:42:56,780 --> 01:42:58,940
animals just to get to my apartment.

1991
01:42:58,980 --> 01:42:59,460
Wow.

1992
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:05,900
I love like, I mean, Universal Orlando is like you go a couple of blocks and you

1993
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:10,940
hit a public supermarket, but Mike, I feel like you told me it's like, yeah, you

1994
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:13,220
know what's next to Holy Land experience at Target.

1995
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:14,060
Yeah.

1996
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:15,100
Like this.

1997
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:16,740
It's right by a mall at millennia.

1998
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:23,220
You cross over I-4 and like it's Holy Land and then Target, Krispy Kreme, Panda

1999
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:26,260
Express, like the whole mall.

2000
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:29,140
So just so like, you know,

2001
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:34,820
like go get some diapers in the morning, then get blessed into a bathing pool by

2002
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:40,340
Jesus himself, then go pick up some orange chicken, just get it all done in the same

2003
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:40,900
little space.

2004
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:46,060
Catch a crucifixion on the hour every hour, like just hit it up.

2005
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:47,300
Quick crucifixion.

2006
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:49,220
Quick, quick crucifixion.

2007
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:51,980
Um, closing thoughts about this show.

2008
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:55,980
Uh, I mean, I'm, I'm now like, I wish it was still there.

2009
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:57,420
I wish it was still there in Florida.

2010
01:43:57,420 --> 01:43:59,100
I, or in Hollywood rather.

2011
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:03,340
It's, you know, one thing that's strange about it is that it went away and then they

2012
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:08,980
moved the special effects stage show, which we talked about with Carl Tartt up to, uh,

2013
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:11,180
like that happens in this castle theater.

2014
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:15,100
And clearly the castle theater is a place where Beetlejuice should be performing, not

2015
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:17,500
where you should be learning, wow, what chroma key works.

2016
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:18,900
Uh, it's right there.

2017
01:44:18,900 --> 01:44:20,020
It's waiting for him.

2018
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:21,660
Uh, I think it's a bummer.

2019
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:24,500
There aren't monsters dancing around and rocking in there.

2020
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:30,260
Well, even more insulting in Hollywood, what replaced it was Spider-Man rocks.

2021
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:30,620
Lord.

2022
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:32,660
Yeah.

2023
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:35,980
I could be, I could be in that show though.

2024
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:37,300
You could.

2025
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:38,340
Would you have saved it?

2026
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:39,900
Would it still be going with your?

2027
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:41,740
I think yes.

2028
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:44,060
That's basically what I was trying to say is that I would have saved it.

2029
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:47,300
I would have really.

2030
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:48,060
I can fix him.

2031
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:48,900
I can fix him.

2032
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:50,180
Yeah.

2033
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:53,140
I would have played multiple characters in the show once.

2034
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:55,220
I think I would have done a lot of costume changes.

2035
01:44:55,980 --> 01:44:57,380
Um, okay.

2036
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:59,220
Let me make one more, one more, one point.

2037
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:05,100
Uh, uh, this is sort of, this is related, but the song, what I like about you by the

2038
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:11,340
romantics, I don't know why I have, like, I don't ever want to hear it again.

2039
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:16,820
Cause it's in, it's in too many commercials and it's just too, right?

2040
01:45:16,820 --> 01:45:19,140
Like doesn't exist as a song anymore.

2041
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:20,180
It's been ruined.

2042
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:20,940
Right.

2043
01:45:21,820 --> 01:45:24,900
But like, I feel like there's some songs where I think it was overusing commercials

2044
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:27,700
then a couple of years later, I'm listening to it and I go, man, this is a really good

2045
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:28,180
song.

2046
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:33,060
I just, just maybe got too tired of hearing it, but the romantics, what I like about you,

2047
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:35,100
I get rid of it.

2048
01:45:35,140 --> 01:45:35,420
You don't.

2049
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:36,980
I kind of agree with you.

2050
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:41,580
It also kind of brings some PTSD cause that was the most like cardio song that I had to

2051
01:45:41,580 --> 01:45:45,620
do right before the mashup of smooth criminal and a sweet dream.

2052
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:47,700
So I'm like, Oh God, here comes that song.

2053
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:48,380
So I just.

2054
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:48,900
Yeah.

2055
01:45:50,060 --> 01:45:52,100
There's so much dancing in your version.

2056
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:56,100
There was like, I know people on stage when we watched the previous version, we're like,

2057
01:45:56,420 --> 01:45:58,580
there's six people on this massive stage.

2058
01:45:58,580 --> 01:45:59,660
It feels empty.

2059
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:01,180
So like they fix that.

2060
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:06,820
What I like about you also used in a lot of like promotion for like sitcom commercials.

2061
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:09,660
It's like the two guys, a girl and pizza places back.

2062
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:11,100
What I like about you.

2063
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:15,500
Well, and is it in this Amanda Bynes, Jenny Garth show, what I like about you, right?

2064
01:46:15,860 --> 01:46:16,940
Oh yeah.

2065
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:17,620
The theme of it.

2066
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:19,140
They named the show after it as well.

2067
01:46:19,900 --> 01:46:21,060
Yeah, I agree.

2068
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:23,860
I think that song can be done for now.

2069
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:25,260
It died with the show.

2070
01:46:25,260 --> 01:46:25,780
We've heard it.

2071
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:27,020
It died with the show.

2072
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:27,580
Yeah.

2073
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:27,780
Yeah.

2074
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:29,940
Beetlejuice was the ultimate iteration of it.

2075
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:31,340
And what else are you going to do?

2076
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:33,420
Yeah, it's fun.

2077
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:35,580
Cause then it went into, didn't it go into something?

2078
01:46:35,580 --> 01:46:37,940
It went from, Oh no, I guess not.

2079
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:39,860
That one was maybe the only one that wasn't a mashup.

2080
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:41,540
Yeah.

2081
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:42,980
That one got a lot of time.

2082
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:44,780
That one got a lot of time.

2083
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:47,380
I was like, this is the most they've played a song.

2084
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:49,140
They've done a song with what I like about you.

2085
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:52,660
I think it's cause they really wanted to highlight that there's three couples, but

2086
01:46:52,660 --> 01:46:53,380
there's so much going on.

2087
01:46:53,380 --> 01:46:56,180
It's still kind of hard to figure that out, but it is like, that's when they're

2088
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:58,820
like, Oh look, that person's with that person.

2089
01:46:58,820 --> 01:47:01,860
And it rolls into you really got me going.

2090
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:03,460
Oh yeah.

2091
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:04,300
You really got me.

2092
01:47:05,180 --> 01:47:06,740
That one's less played out.

2093
01:47:06,980 --> 01:47:13,020
So we're saying less what I like about you, but how about far more?

2094
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:14,420
What does the fox say?

2095
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:18,100
I, it was perfect.

2096
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:20,620
You know, watch, I wanted more of that.

2097
01:47:20,620 --> 01:47:21,660
I wanted more gang.

2098
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:22,060
I'm sorry.

2099
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:27,140
I started thinking about like some 2010 stuff of like, Oh, I never, I

2100
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:28,820
realized they never finished watching.

2101
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:34,220
Like I never watched the last season of girls, but this beetle juice reminded

2102
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:34,820
you of that.

2103
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:35,900
Yeah.

2104
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:36,260
What?

2105
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:40,980
Well, I was thinking about like, just like Lena Denham, I know how much, um,

2106
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:42,620
2010 stuff.

2107
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:47,260
Like I, I'm like, I never need to revisit this, but watching this, I was like, I

2108
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:49,780
like seeing watch me whip and Nae Nae.

2109
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:50,740
It's fun to hear.

2110
01:47:50,740 --> 01:47:52,340
What does the fox say?

2111
01:47:52,780 --> 01:47:53,820
Well, yeah, spoiler.

2112
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:56,220
I guess I'm holding onto a novelty song.

2113
01:47:56,260 --> 01:48:00,980
The last episode of girls is they all dance to watch me whip, watch me Nae Nae.

2114
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:02,660
It's like almost exactly like that.

2115
01:48:02,660 --> 01:48:03,420
That'd be great.

2116
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:04,460
Beelgeuse's graveyard.

2117
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:05,020
Yeah.

2118
01:48:05,900 --> 01:48:09,060
Do you, do you think of the show was happening today?

2119
01:48:09,580 --> 01:48:16,380
Like Wolfman would be riding on the back of a vehicle as dreams by Fleetwood Mac

2120
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:18,300
played and he was drinking ocean spray.

2121
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:21,700
Cause I think that's a slam dunk.

2122
01:48:21,860 --> 01:48:23,180
I think that's, yeah.

2123
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:27,780
It is there some configuration of seven to do like a BTS song?

2124
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:30,060
They would never get the rights for that.

2125
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:31,500
I feel like you don't think so.

2126
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:33,580
No, in dream world, I guess you could.

2127
01:48:33,620 --> 01:48:33,780
Yeah.

2128
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:34,300
I don't know.

2129
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:34,780
Yeah.

2130
01:48:35,780 --> 01:48:36,460
Yeah, I don't know.

2131
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:40,100
I mean, Jeannie, Jeannie would definitely, if the show was happening in California

2132
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:43,660
Adventure, Jeannie would definitely bring a bottle of juice on stage.

2133
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:49,900
Well, so is the only, the answer maybe is that if, if, if theme parks are not going

2134
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:53,580
to be able to have these shows, like all of these characters maybe need to keep

2135
01:48:53,580 --> 01:49:00,860
living on on TikTok, like all these, all these Beetlejai as you said, multiple

2136
01:49:00,860 --> 01:49:03,660
Beetlejuices strewn about the world.

2137
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:09,780
Need to get a TikTok account going and start, uh, you know, firing those

2138
01:49:09,780 --> 01:49:14,900
parodies out, a step put, put, put the word out on that Facebook group, I think.

2139
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:15,780
Okay.

2140
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:16,460
Yeah.

2141
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:16,740
Okay.

2142
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:17,460
I'll, I'll get them.

2143
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:19,500
I'll round them up and we'll make something happen.

2144
01:49:20,540 --> 01:49:21,060
Okay.

2145
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:24,940
We're getting reports that a Beetlejuice has stopped skateboarding and started

2146
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:27,060
complaining about ballot harvesting.

2147
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:28,340
Shut it down folks.

2148
01:49:29,180 --> 01:49:30,180
Nothing could be fun.

2149
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:30,980
It's 2020.

2150
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:31,620
Nothing's fun.

2151
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:33,100
I'll make every TikTok.

2152
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:34,380
This was fun though.

2153
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:38,060
This is a blast to talk about this and Jane Clare, you survived Haunt

2154
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:39,340
Cast the Fright.

2155
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:40,580
Thanks for joining us.

2156
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:42,060
So fun to talk to you about this stuff.

2157
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:43,140
It was so nice to be here.

2158
01:49:43,140 --> 01:49:43,380
Yeah.

2159
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:43,700
Yeah.

2160
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:44,100
What?

2161
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:44,540
Yeah.

2162
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:45,420
Thank you so much.

2163
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:46,060
So much fun.

2164
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:47,460
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2165
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:49,420
Is there anything you would like to plug?

2166
01:49:50,980 --> 01:49:51,620
Oh, sure.

2167
01:49:51,660 --> 01:49:55,460
Um, I just released a single a few weeks ago and a music video.

2168
01:49:55,500 --> 01:50:01,420
Um, so you can stream that anywhere, any platform, Spotify, Apple music, iTunes,

2169
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:02,780
blah, blah, it's on YouTube.

2170
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:08,180
Um, on socials I'm on Instagram and Twitter, underscore Jane Clare underscore

2171
01:50:08,180 --> 01:50:11,500
because the person who has at Jane Clare has been inactive for years and I can't

2172
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:12,340
do anything about it.

2173
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:14,460
So, uh, I gotta add that underscore.

2174
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:20,620
Um, can they find with the Y Jane with, oh yes, J A Y N E.

2175
01:50:21,180 --> 01:50:25,420
And they can find the song under your net real name on like Spotify.

2176
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:25,860
Yeah.

2177
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:26,660
So just search.

2178
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:30,500
Um, the song is called so glad you're mine, but you have no idea who I wrote

2179
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:30,900
that about.

2180
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:34,340
Um, no, but actually something cute.

2181
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:36,260
Uh, Jason helped me film that.

2182
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:39,380
So I filmed a lot of the B roll, but the stuff that I couldn't film Jason filmed

2183
01:50:39,380 --> 01:50:39,860
for me.

2184
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:41,780
So that's the cute little thing.

2185
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:43,020
That is cute.

2186
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:43,780
A cute little thing.

2187
01:50:44,020 --> 01:50:45,420
Duet collab.

2188
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:46,300
That's wonderful.

2189
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:48,060
Yeah.

2190
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:49,140
It was so fun.

2191
01:50:49,220 --> 01:50:49,700
Yeah.

2192
01:50:50,260 --> 01:50:51,820
Um, so yeah, everyone check that out.

2193
01:50:51,820 --> 01:50:57,220
Well, and our, as always the three of our, uh, romantic collaboration that we call

2194
01:50:57,300 --> 01:51:00,900
podcast, the ride is, uh, available every Friday.

2195
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:03,700
Uh, you can find out more on social media.

2196
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:06,940
We get our T public and there's three bonus episodes every month.

2197
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:12,580
This month, uh, behind the cemetery gates at, uh, patreon.com slash podcast, the

2198
01:51:12,580 --> 01:51:12,860
ride.

2199
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:16,260
Um, um, yeah.

2200
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:19,580
So just to sum up, uh, Hmm.

2201
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:22,500
Well, I already said the thing about what I like about you.

2202
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:27,180
Then I think we have to like, uh, I think we end with like, we have to do the, the

2203
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:27,620
clap.

2204
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:29,660
So like, uh, uh, all right.

2205
01:51:29,660 --> 01:51:35,020
Well, and we hope you liked that episode of podcast, the ride, are there three?

2206
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:35,740
Did I do it right?

2207
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:37,220
No, wait, there's four.

2208
01:51:37,340 --> 01:51:42,020
Uh, um, and that's, that's what we like about beetle juices, graveyard review.

2209
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:42,940
Cut, cut, cut, cut.

2210
01:51:44,380 --> 01:51:48,380
They're very, very, I say beetles use three times to close it out.

2211
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:51,660
Oh, you know, that's how you got to end the show.

2212
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:53,260
Cause that's how we ended the show.

2213
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:59,540
Beetle juice, beetles, beetles, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on real quick.

2214
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:02,020
I don't want to go in overtime here, but if all three of us say his name at the

2215
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:05,020
same time, since we're in separate places, would he all appear?

2216
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:06,420
He would get confused, right?

2217
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:07,140
What would happen?

2218
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:07,500
Yeah.

2219
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:11,300
How did, how do they deal with shows up in a new zoom window because he also is

2220
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:13,100
worried about catching the Corona virus.

2221
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:17,060
So he's, he would pop in broadcasting from the underworld.

2222
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:18,700
I'm on room.

2223
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:20,460
I'm remotely zoning in.

2224
01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:21,260
Oh, works.

2225
01:52:21,260 --> 01:52:21,900
There he is.

2226
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:23,020
I'm afraid already.

2227
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:25,060
I'm back.

2228
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:27,020
I just took a huge.

2229
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:29,620
Beetle juice.

2230
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:31,660
Let's get out of here.

2231
01:52:31,660 --> 01:52:32,500
All right.

2232
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:34,900
So, so long.
