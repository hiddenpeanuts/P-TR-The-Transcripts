00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Teral Audio.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,840
Warning, today's podcast may include Steven Spielberg acting, an orb wielding teacher named

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,080
Botanicus, and a pulse pounding analysis of Universal Studios ET Adventure.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:41,680
Let's wrap in for the premiere episode of Podcast the Ride.

5
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,600
Hello everybody, welcome to Podcast the Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three childless

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,200
men in their 30s.

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,840
We're part of Teral Audio, home of Doughboys, and many, many more great podcasts.

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,840
My name is Michael Carlson.

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,120
I am joined by my co-hosts, as always, Scott Gairdner.

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,700
Hi, that's me.

11
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,720
That's Scott, and Jason Sheridan.

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
Hello.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:09,600
Yeah, so today's topic is going to be the Universal Studios Ride ET the Adventure, and

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:38,880
we're going to break it down and talk about what we would do with it if we were in charge.

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:02:08,840
So for those of you listening for the first time, we are the kids who got too into the Disney parks.

16
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:21,200
Yeah, I think so.

17
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,440
And look, there are people who have the disease worse than us.

18
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
That's certainly true.

19
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
Yes.

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,800
Yeah, we're like at least a little bit self-aware about it.

21
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,160
There are a lot of folks, if you go on these message boards, that do not have any sense

22
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,880
of humor about any of this stuff.

23
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,040
That being said, people on the message boards, we are your friends, and we...

24
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,040
Yes, oh, we like you guys.

25
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
We are also of you.

27
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
Yeah, no, no, no.

28
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,040
Please listen.

29
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,960
But this is a thing that a lot of people listening might not realize the depth of theme park fandom,

30
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,360
that there are these message boards, and there are many, many fan sites, many, many other

31
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,460
podcasts out there.

32
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,040
We're going to try to be the one with the vaguely comedic bent, which I can only assume

33
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
doesn't exist.

34
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,600
We're going to do our best with that comedic thing, but we will get very serious about

35
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
this.

36
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,400
It's going to be like, we're laughing, and then we're like, but they should not have

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,320
made that change to my ride.

38
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,040
That was my ride when I was a child.

39
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,600
You will be shocked how non-comedic it is for the vast stretches of time.

40
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,440
It really is the area of all of our lives that we are the most or the least ironic about.

41
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
That's true.

42
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,440
We're going to share it with you.

43
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,400
Yeah, and then we're just going to get into stuff like Imagineers Who Created Rides, which

44
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,720
is the thing as a kid I didn't even realize, because the rides just feel like they've always

45
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
been there.

46
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,880
They're like these people, men and women, who have slaved over this design and went

47
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,040
through a whole political process of trying to get their idea approved.

48
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,800
They probably in-fought with other people and management and bled for this stuff.

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,880
Then Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was born.

50
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,200
Something that you just accept, the Runaway Mine Car Ride.

51
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,520
It seems very innocent and like it's always been there, but yeah, it took a lot of effort

52
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
and hard work to do.

53
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,280
There's so many rides that don't get completed.

54
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,560
In that Imagineering building, the headquarters of the Disney theme parks, there's so many

55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,480
rides that are invented, fully cooked up, probably even built and then are never installed

56
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
in the parks.

57
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,400
A movie will come out and then completely tank and they can't justify spending the money

58
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,960
to further promote that movie.

59
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,920
Yeah, we never will see the creation of Dick Tracy's Crime Stoppers in real life.

60
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,320
It exists only on paper and the internet fan sites.

61
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,480
It would have been a great ride though.

62
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
Sure.

63
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
It's very disappointing that it never made it.

64
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:45,800
Join an animatronic, Warren Beatty, on a journey through the city as you fire guns.

65
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,240
Wow, mommy, I saw Dick Van Dyke's character, Raisin Man, whatever he is.

66
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,560
Is that his character, Raisin Man?

67
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,000
Should be, as far as anyone knows.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,840
Correct us if you're listening, but also you probably don't know.

69
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
No one knows.

70
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,840
No one likes Dick Tracy.

71
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,680
That's a real problem with rides, especially today.

72
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,920
It really has to be intellectual property that people are familiar with.

73
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,440
I think actually, the intellectual property issue is something that kind of hurts the

74
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,120
ride that we're going to talk about today because I think this character is not really

75
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,480
in the forefront of popular culture anymore, but maybe he should be.

76
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,400
We're talking about E.T.

77
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:32,200
The E.T. Adventure, one of the great Universal Studios rides, a fixture at Universal Florida

78
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,400
still today.

79
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
An opening day attraction.

80
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,800
One of maybe the only opening day attraction that still remains in Universal Florida.

81
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,160
This and the movie monster makeup show.

82
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,520
This is the only remaining ride.

83
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,320
The show in the fake Pantages Theater, as I know it.

84
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,280
No longer at Universal Hollywood, dearly departed, no longer at Universal Japan.

85
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,160
We could tell you a little bit about this ride and what it is, or we could let Steven

86
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Spielberg tell the tale.

87
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,720
Steven.

88
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,560
Steven, where are you?

89
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,080
Get out of here.

90
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,080
He's coming.

91
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,080
Here he is.

92
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
We don't have much time.

93
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
Steven Spielberg, and it's my pleasure to welcome you to the E.T. Adventure, but I'm

94
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
afraid we don't have much time.

95
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
See?

96
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
So I'm going to cut right to the chase.

97
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,080
The E.T. needs your help.

98
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Now, we've just received the message that you're going to be on the ride.

99
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
We're going to have to wait for the ride.

100
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
We're going to have to wait for the ride.

101
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
We're going to have to wait for the ride.

102
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
We're going to have to wait for the ride.

103
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
We've just received the urgent message from E.T.'s teacher, Botanicus, calling for E.T.

104
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
to come home right away.

105
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
You see, a big problem has developed three million light years away on E.T.'s home world,

106
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
the Green Planet.

107
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
E.T.'s friends are in danger because their planet is dying.

108
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Remember what E.T.'s friends look like because it's going to be up to you to help E.T. find

109
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
them once we get them home, and there's not a moment to lose.

110
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Very important.

111
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,080
Because only E.T.'s magic healing touch can save his friends and bring his planet back

112
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
to health.

113
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
E.T. must go home, and only you can help him.

114
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
We have to go.

115
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,080
We have to go.

116
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
We have to go.

117
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
We have to go.

118
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
We have to go.

119
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
We have to go.

120
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:58,080
We have to go.

121
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:10,080
We have to go.

122
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:19,080
We have to go.

123
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:31,080
We have to go.

124
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:38,080
We have to go.

125
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,080
We have to go.

126
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:51,080
We have to go.

127
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,080
We have to go.

128
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,080
We have to go.

129
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:08,080
We have to go.

130
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,960
I mean, as a child, I think that's probably, I mean, it's for children, but like, yeah,

131
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,560
the whole thing is like, you really were like, I may die on this ride.

132
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,320
This might be a suicide mission on like, whether it's, you know, this or Space Mountain.

133
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,620
I'm like, I may hurdle into a star.

134
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,960
Like it may be over.

135
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,560
And there weren't ride through videos.

136
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,360
You couldn't look up what things were on YouTube when we were children.

137
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,800
So yeah, I assumed that any single ride that you got onto was going to literally murder

138
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
me.

139
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Yeah.

140
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,480
The internet really opened up like theme park fandom because I think there was like fan

141
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,520
scenes like any other thing.

142
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:52,560
But like now there's just, you can watch footage of any ride and we will put footage of this

143
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,760
ride in the show notes for you to watch at home.

144
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,320
Well, what we just heard was like the pre show video that you see in line of Steven

145
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,120
Spielberg preparing you to ride this children's ride.

146
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,720
Which by the way, so we should talk about then what transpires, what the ride is.

147
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,720
So as Steven Spielberg himself told us, you climb aboard a bike.

148
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
ET needs your help.

149
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,960
His planet is dying.

150
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,280
The green planet.

151
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,760
His teacher Botanicus is part of it somehow too.

152
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
He factors in.

153
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,620
Anyway, you got to get to the green planet.

154
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:32,460
So you end up in the scene basically from ET where you're avoiding police officers

155
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:37,280
who in this case are portrayed by very stiff, barely animated dummies.

156
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,540
And there's cars coming at you like police cars and like FBI, like FBI I think cars,

157
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,800
some sort of secret covert agencies that are trying to capture you and ET before you can

158
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,240
make it home to the green planet.

159
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,760
Every agency's cars have all arrived in the hills of Tahunca, California where the ride

160
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
is set.

161
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,840
An obscene amount of walkie talkies like the redo.

162
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
No guns.

163
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
No one has a gun.

164
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Did they do the gun change or did they never have guns?

165
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Never had guns.

166
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Yeah.

167
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,360
Steven Spielberg famously edited out all the guns in ET in like a DVD release a few years

168
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,720
ago and changed them all to walkie talkies digitally, which I think has gone back, but

169
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,680
that was in the digital changing craze of the late 90s, early 2000s of his friend George.

170
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,160
Now this ride, this ride hits like a very common theme park thing where you, you hit

171
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,880
like a big beat of, of the movie and then you get a whole lot of new stuff.

172
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,800
Like you get a whole new adventure.

173
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,320
In this case it is, yeah, you're, you're taking the place of Elliot.

174
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,800
You're riding the bikes, ET's in the basket and there is a little ET animatronic in the

175
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,880
basket that pops up and you're evading the federal authorities.

176
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,600
Does it, does it have a face?

177
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,240
I always wondered because you can't really see you're in the bike behind the ET.

178
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,800
Yeah, you're talking ET in the basket.

179
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,280
If you could see yourself in the ride, is there an ET face on the other side?

180
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
I think there is.

181
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,640
I think I sat in the front row and like leaned over and was like, yeah, there's, there's

182
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,640
his face.

183
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,200
There's a chance that like if you lean over and it's just like a blank robot face.

184
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,440
It's faceless mannequin.

185
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,200
Or just like circuits shooting out raw electricity at you.

186
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,000
I think in this day and age, in this day and age if like somebody were to put their phone

187
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,080
out and take like the selfie, it would have to be there because it would be terrifying

188
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,840
if there was, yeah, that creepy face.

189
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:38,200
If you felt like ET had his face ripped off, then the green planet dying is the least of

190
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
your troubles.

191
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,920
So once you have successfully evaded all of the federal agencies, spoiler alert, you do

192
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,600
by flying in your bike as in the film, then you end up seeing all the new stuff.

193
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,160
As Jason said, you go to the green planet.

194
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
You fly over a city.

195
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
You fly over a nondescript city.

196
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
I think it's Los Angeles.

197
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,760
I think you can see a Dodger Stadium in there.

198
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,040
It's a Los Angeles-esque city at least.

199
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,040
Yeah.

200
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,160
It is the same sequence from the Peter Pan ride.

201
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,560
If you've ever written Peter Pan, there's a very similar sequence because you're flying

202
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,720
in a similar type of ride.

203
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,160
These are called dark rides, by the way, both of these rides, and they're both called suspended

204
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,280
dark rides because you're actually hanging from the ceiling and moving forward as opposed

205
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,960
to it being on a car on the ground.

206
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,440
But yeah, it's like it's a similar thing where you're like looking over all the rooftops

207
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,440
and it's really just like a tiny model that's lit up that makes it look like you're...

208
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,040
And it is the same track layout as the Peter Pan ride, which is maybe something you have

209
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,240
to knock a few points down.

210
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,440
It's part of originality.

211
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,240
The fact that it literally bends the same way and then you go into a little sub-sky

212
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,520
room in the back right corner, whatever.

213
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
It works for Peter Pan.

214
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
It works for this.

215
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,680
I don't know why I'm trying to gotcha this ride right from the top.

216
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,720
You're really sticking it to him.

217
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
I love the ride.

218
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,320
I don't mean to criticize, but it is weird.

219
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,840
It's a copy and paste of the scene.

220
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,960
I mean, there's a ton of that in the theme park industry.

221
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:09,200
There's only so many companies that make massive ride track systems and all.

222
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,320
So they all use the same manufacturers.

223
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,760
Oh, that's true.

224
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

225
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:21,440
And certain types of rides, your wild mouses and the spinning rides and that kind of thing.

226
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,640
You are seeing a lot of copies of copies of this ride.

227
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,940
Universal, very famous for a lot of simulator rides, especially when the Florida park opened

228
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,400
in 1990.

229
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:38,480
Even more now, I think, you sit in a car, the car rocks around, there is a giant screen

230
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,040
and you're watching footage that syncs up with your ride vehicles movement.

231
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,400
Another common Universal Studios trope is getting splashed.

232
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,360
Yes, there's a lot of splash, errant water going on in a lot of these rides, not in the

233
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,760
E.T. ride.

234
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,240
Once you're on the green planet, you think maybe you get sprayed by a fountain of water,

235
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,240
but you remain dry.

236
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,400
Part of the one of the pieces of suspense that makes the ride so fun.

237
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,240
Let's talk about the green planet.

238
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,000
Well let's, should we break down, let's go through, because I want to save the green

239
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
planet stuff.

240
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Okay.

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Let me, we'll just tease the green planet.

242
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,760
There's a lot to talk about.

243
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,600
You end up on the green planet.

244
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,760
Now the green planet is where E.T. is from and it exists in some other forms of media.

245
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,720
And if you don't know about the green planet, it's a little weird.

246
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,720
It's a little strange that E.T. would come from this place.

247
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,720
Yeah, if you've only seen the film E.T.

248
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
Yeah.

249
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,440
If you've only seen one part of the E.T. expanded universe, you know, the movie E.T., you might

250
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,440
not know that, you know, E.T. lives in a world of plants and fluorescents.

251
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,440
He lives in, it's kind of a pre-pandora, you might say.

252
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Yeah, so he has that.

253
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,080
I have that written down too.

254
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,320
It's a bioluminescent, which is the word I keep seeing in all of these Pandora write-ups

255
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,080
where it's like the bioluminescent forest.

256
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,080
And I was like, well, you know what?

257
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,440
E.T.'s homeland green planet was bioluminescent, you know, 25 years before Pandora ever showed

258
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,440
up.

259
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,920
Yeah, this looks very similar to Disney's new Pandora land of Avatar.

260
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
Well, Disney's striking back.

261
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
They're getting revenge after that Peter Pan.

262
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,480
Disney's getting revenge for that Peter Pan homage.

263
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:26,760
It's a game of cat and mouse revenge that extends over the course of 50 years.

264
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:34,800
Peter Pan, 1955, is ripped off in 1990, and in 2017, the Pandora shaman boat ride.

265
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,280
Like the Count of Monte Cristo, it takes a full lifetime to get revenge.

266
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,040
It's the long game.

267
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
Yeah.

268
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,000
Now the green planet is mentioned like once in the movie.

269
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,440
Doesn't Elliot say like, oh, E.T. came from the green planet?

270
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,280
Is that the full extent of...

271
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
Is it even in the movie?

272
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Is it in the movie?

273
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
Is it in the movie?

274
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
I don't even know that it's in the movie.

275
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,280
Is it in the movie?

276
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
Maybe you imagine that?

277
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,480
Or is there a piece of dialogue where he talks about the green planet?

278
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,440
E.T. also doesn't have a lot of speech capabilities, so he probably couldn't get out a lot of information

279
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,600
about the planet, even if he wanted to.

280
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,240
In the movie or in this ride, as becomes very apparent at the very end.

281
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,160
Yes, his speech troubles and we'll get into that.

282
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,280
But the green planet is mentioned pretty heavily in the book of the green planet.

283
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,500
Yes, and there's a book called E.T. the Green Planet.

284
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,760
Now the first, I was just going to go break down because the first glimpse we get of E.T.'s

285
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,040
other world is in the line.

286
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,680
It's in the queue itself.

287
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,800
When we see a character that is named Botanicus, as Steven Spielberg calls him, Botanicus.

288
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,040
And that is he's introduced as E.T.'s teacher, which is, you know...

289
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
All you need to know.

290
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:49,620
He taught E.T. how to put on a wig and eat a Reese's.

291
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,760
Everything E.T. can do.

292
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
Also a question I have.

293
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,020
How old is E.T. in the movie?

294
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,800
How old would you assume he is?

295
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,240
I was thinking about this.

296
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,520
He sort of, I mean, he's paired with a child.

297
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,720
He's paired with other children.

298
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,260
Does that make him a child?

299
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,960
And when you see Botanicus, who basically, if you haven't been on the ride, is an elderly

300
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,960
E.T.

301
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
Yeah, Botanicus is old as shit.

302
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,120
Like Botanicus looks like shit.

303
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
We all have links.

304
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,120
The years of prop and kind to Botanicus.

305
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,920
Yeah, he's E.T. with like seven more layers of wrinkles.

306
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,800
And he talks like Master Splinter.

307
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:29,240
But he has a much greater vocabulary than E.T. himself.

308
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,560
Is this answered in the book how old E.T. is?

309
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
I don't remember.

310
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,640
Full disclosure, I have the book E.T. the Green Planet.

311
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,120
I haven't read it cover to cover.

312
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,840
I've also lost the book.

313
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,640
And I also don't remember if E.T.'s age is addressed in it.

314
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,800
Well, you're listening to real experts.

315
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,920
Yeah, but I have done some...

316
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,320
I think you made the right call losing the book of the Green Planet.

317
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,320
That was an accident, though.

318
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
I really...

319
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,400
I was cherishing the book despite losing it.

320
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,440
What do we know about the book of the Green Planet?

321
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,560
It came out like a few years after the movie?

322
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,600
It was a few years after the movie, yeah.

323
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,880
And it's about...

324
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,800
It picks up right where E.T. left off, the movie E.T. left off.

325
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,600
And it's, as Jason...

326
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,880
It's bizarre as shit.

327
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,040
It's so weird.

328
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,400
It's immediately... E.T. is immediately sort of on a spaceship and kind of longing for

329
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Elliot.

330
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
He misses Elliot.

331
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,320
And E.T. all of a sudden has a vocabulary and there are all these different characters.

332
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:38,200
And it's basically a story where E.T. goes back and he lives in just the weirdest place.

333
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,840
I mean, it resembles the ride, but it's totally, totally off from the movie.

334
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,720
Now it's sort of a cute romp with these different characters.

335
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,200
There's a character named the Flop Glopple, which is described as a character that looks

336
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,920
like it's made out of socks.

337
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,600
Which, you're like, well, I don't know.

338
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,000
It's like he took E.T., gave him a cuddly little cute cartoon personality, and then

339
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,560
threw him into this weird adventure, which he eventually does go back because he misses

340
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,760
Elliot so much.

341
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,760
And Elliot also...

342
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,880
Here, I'm getting ahead of myself.

343
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,280
Elliot also is discovering girls and E.T. has a telepathic link with him.

344
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,080
And E.T. is coaching Elliot through puberty.

345
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,280
Oh my God.

346
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,560
Like across space though?

347
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
Yes, across space.

348
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,560
Because he's on another planet?

349
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,840
So E.T. will also project his astral form to E.T.

350
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,320
And the whole thing is just bizarre.

351
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,800
Does that imply that E.T. and Elliot had this astral connection before they even met?

352
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:39,740
Was E.T. from the green planet, before he got lost on Earth, commanding Elliot to do

353
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,740
things?

354
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,740
Is E.T. also?

355
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:47,320
To brush his teeth in a certain counterclockwise, as opposed to clockwise?

356
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,520
It's possible, I think.

357
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,000
Are they both going through puberty, or is E.T. just experiencing it through a residual

358
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,400
telepathic connection?

359
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,000
I think it's residual telepathic connection.

360
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
E.T.'s...

361
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,720
All of his species are asexual.

362
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
They do address that.

363
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
There's no...

364
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
So I don't think he actually...

365
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,760
E.T. does not have sort of a normal human puberty.

366
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,800
So when you're going... but you would certainly call him a boy.

367
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,400
You would call Botanicus a him.

368
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,600
When you're in the ride, and when you're on the E.T. ride, there's a bunch of other E.T.s

369
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,240
swinging around on vines and playing plants as instruments and stuff.

370
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,600
Are some of those girls, or there just is no sex?

371
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,000
Some of them are children, for sure, because they're smaller than E.T.

372
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,640
Unless it's some messed up culture where the smaller ones are the old ones.

373
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,840
And Botanicus is the youngest.

374
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,360
When you're in E.T., you lose wrinkles in size as the years go on.

375
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
And you lose knowledge?

376
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
Do you get stupor?

377
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,360
I guess so, yeah.

378
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,360
Like, bench and button rules?

379
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,520
And young people teach old people.

380
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,920
I better get all this knowledge out now before I lose it.

381
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,400
There is also, like...

382
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,820
Wise babies.

383
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,380
In this ride on the Green Planet, there's a lot of creatures that look like E.T.

384
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,920
And then he's got a couple other fucking friends who don't look like E.T. at all.

385
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,920
Yes.

386
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,760
And they're kind of upsetting.

387
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,200
They are upsetting looking.

388
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,400
If you were listening to the Steven Spielberg intro earlier, and are still listening now,

389
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,620
one of the things that Steven Spielberg tells you to do is look for E.T.'s friends, because

390
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,840
you will have to help E.T. find his friends.

391
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,520
E.T. doesn't remember what his friends look like, apparently.

392
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:28,340
So in that pre-show video, you see three quick shots of these characters, E.T.'s weirdo friends.

393
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,560
One of them's a weird mushroom guy.

394
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,920
One of them is a shrill doll with tentacle hair.

395
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
With spaghetti hair?

396
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
Yeah.

397
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
Who am I forgetting?

398
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
Mushroom, shrill doll.

399
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Help me out.

400
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,720
There's another one that looks kind of like the little doll, I feel like.

401
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,720
But those are the main ones.

402
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,640
I mean, Botanicus and those two that you mentioned are the big ones that they care.

403
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,160
The other one looks kind of like the Little Shop of Horrors.

404
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
Right.

405
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
Yeah, the plant.

406
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
Yes.

407
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

408
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
So, I don't know.

409
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
What do you think they say?

410
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,160
Are they plants?

411
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
One of them's clearly a mushroom.

412
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
One of them's kind of a plant.

413
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:10,280
The mushroom guy, like I as a kid, I don't like this, but the mushroom man says a very,

414
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,880
very specific line.

415
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,240
He sings speaks the line, welcome home.

416
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,960
You've arrived.

417
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,800
And I don't like it, but I've written it so many times since I was a small child, it's

418
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,520
ingrained in my memory, and I cannot forget welcome home.

419
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:34,960
Like this ride having not been open at my local Universal Studios, which is Hollywood,

420
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,000
for many years and I haven't been on it in a long time.

421
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,360
There are things like that, welcome home, and E.T. saying ready and trouble that just

422
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:50,160
are permanently ingrained that I say, my wife and I say in our day to day lives.

423
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:56,880
If we have finished tying our shoes and are ready to go out for the day, we will say ready.

424
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,320
What a cool house, right?

425
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,600
I think that's endearing.

426
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Hey, thanks.

427
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,640
Well, there's one vote for endearing.

428
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
Thank God.

429
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,920
What was I saying?

430
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,160
Oh yeah, the, no, the sing songy language that is so distinct.

431
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,920
That I find very charming.

432
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,640
It makes me like the mushroom guy.

433
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,200
I don't like the shrill doll, as implied by that I'm calling it the shrill doll.

434
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,120
The shrill doll says, kind of talks in sort of a manic.

435
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,160
Kind of screams that.

436
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
It's like join the celebration.

437
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,880
It's kind of horrendous.

438
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
Oh, dang.

439
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,880
Screwed up.

440
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,680
Blooper number one.

441
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:38,440
I looked up the names of these three creatures and I'm really proud that I didn't know this

442
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,440
already.

443
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,440
Some deep theme park knowledge I'm glad to have, like I.D. and O.D., Captain E.O.'s friends,

444
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,280
but I'm really glad I didn't previously know the names Teakley, Orbadan, and Magdol.

445
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,840
Is Orbadan the mushroom man?

446
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,680
I think, I can only assume Magdol is the scary doll.

447
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:02,440
I think Orbadan is the, I don't know what about the name Orbadan implies mushroom, but

448
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,440
yeah.

449
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
Orb?

450
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,880
Like he's an orb, it's sort of an orbish head I guess.

451
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,040
I suppose so.

452
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,760
And these guys don't show up again.

453
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,800
I mean the financial reality is probably that they're like, all right, we can afford like

454
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:20,640
three kind of big animatronics that move a little and the rest are just little fucking

455
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,440
E.T.'s that are just like.

456
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,560
Well they kind of wave or like they're on a conveyor belt so it looks like they're playing

457
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,560
ball but they're still.

458
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,800
The E.T. adventure in general is a pretty limited animation ride.

459
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:41,240
You will not be blown away as you would by the pirate auctioneer or the Johnny Depp figure.

460
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,600
In fact the FBI agents and the police I think do not move whatsoever.

461
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,920
They are essentially still mannequin dolls.

462
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,240
Probably a thing that could be improved about this ride although I find it sort of charmingly

463
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,240
cheap as well.

464
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,800
They do a lot of cool stuff though like in the in the forest when the ride first starts

465
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,400
with like lighting where it seems like headlights are coming through you.

466
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,440
There's a lot of neat practical effects.

467
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
Yeah.

468
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,520
I think it's a ride that where the environments and the production design is stronger than

469
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,560
the character animation.

470
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:20,120
But maybe in 1990 when this ride was built Disney completely had that market cornered.

471
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,000
And in fact I guess in general Universal Studios does not have like incredible audio animatronics.

472
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,040
I think you might say that their production design is better than their their characters.

473
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
Yeah.

474
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
Right.

475
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
Which is nothing to dock it for.

476
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,520
There's so many great universal rides and this one included.

477
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,680
Something we didn't talk about the line of this ride I think is fantastic.

478
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:46,040
And maybe the first really good universal line a lot of I feel like universal lines up until

479
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,040
that point were just like just turnstiles and you're outside and you aren't really in

480
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,180
an environment.

481
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,480
But in this thing you're in this this amazing lush forest kind of forest.

482
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,480
Yeah.

483
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,800
With which which smells this very particular way.

484
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,240
I'm sure you guys remember the E.T. ride smell.

485
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,480
That's a thing that like that's a specific thing that theme park people do I think have

486
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,280
an affinity for an obsession with is that smell.

487
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,600
To the point where I found a Facebook page where people were talking about like I found

488
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,080
for breeze spray that smells like the E.T. line.

489
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,080
Wow.

490
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,400
Which is kind of like mist and right fog like mist and condensation in fact.

491
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,520
But it is it is a very well there's many specific thing.

492
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,960
There's many rides like where you know the smell of Pirates of the Caribbean or the Haunted

493
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,880
Mansion like those like I think people would probably pay like a top dollar for like a

494
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,200
spray in their house or a candle that would smell like just some 60 year old building.

495
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
Oh yeah.

496
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,240
Like some old water some little packet of 10 where you could label them real fast.

497
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,800
Here's the midway mania.

498
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,440
Here's what are other smells.

499
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
I don't know.

500
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
I'm sorry.

501
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
And smells.

502
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,440
Oh yeah.

503
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,440
No.

504
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
Or the famous.

505
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
Aren't there.

506
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,720
There's there's some rides out there with some like fart smells.

507
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,080
For it doesn't start fart in the city.

508
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,080
Yeah.

509
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,040
The minions Shrek farts Shrek farts.

510
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,680
Shrek has a lot of farting.

511
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,720
Universal locking down those farts.

512
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Yeah Shrek.

513
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,640
The Universal also is has the most fart smells on any of the rides because there's a minions

514
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,880
fart and then there's a Shrek fart.

515
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,520
And I think only Stitch might fart in Disney.

516
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
So yeah.

517
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,720
Universal's got Disney beat by that.

518
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,680
If ET or Botanic is fart they are silent farts.

519
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,680
Yeah.

520
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,360
We'll never know what they smell like.

521
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,760
Anyway amazing line.

522
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,960
It's a really great line.

523
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
And I think maybe.

524
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,640
Yeah like I was saying maybe the first Universal Studios line that kind of builds gets you

525
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,440
into the world of it helps tell the story.

526
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:43,140
It predates really excellent lines like the Indiana Jones ride or I can I assume the Avatar

527
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,320
line is great.

528
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,880
That's what I've heard.

529
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,320
The one the one nitpick I have with the line is that it starts in sort of a movie studio

530
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,120
area like it starts in a spot that looks like it's like there's just pictures of ET on the

531
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,440
wall which like for me personally I like it to be like immersive right from the get go.

532
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,160
So I would prefer that it's a sort of trees immediately versus like you go into this room

533
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,880
with pictures of ET and Drew Barrymore and then you go on the ride.

534
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:15,880
But the reason this is the case is is that they have changed the actual the pre show

535
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,000
that Steven Spielberg and the speech Steven Spielberg gives you.

536
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Yes.

537
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Yeah.

538
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,480
I'm really looking forward researching this because I can only remember the one Spielberg

539
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:32,040
video introducing that I believe the sum total in the history of the adventures that there

540
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:38,440
were three different Steven Spielberg intro videos all sort of with the same components.

541
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,840
Him reminding you that we don't have much time.

542
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,840
Only et ceiling touch can save his planet.

543
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:51,240
But the the the first one which when the ride first opened in 1990 in Florida there's a

544
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,280
video that I'm very fond of where Steven Spielberg is in a movie theater.

545
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,800
He's eating popcorn watching I guess ET.

546
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:04,520
He's just rewatching it remembering how hoping it holds up and and he's eating popcorn and

547
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:10,040
then you cut close to the popcorn and ET's fingers reach in there and they go to stalking

548
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,000
him throughout the video.

549
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So that video kind of like yeah he's not aware of ET until deep into it.

550
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,360
But that yeah that fingers always poking around.

551
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,480
And once he finally taps him on the shoulder and gets his attention that fingers creepily

552
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,680
hang in there for five to ten seconds before he says anything.

553
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,920
We'll post a link of this in the meditator.

554
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:37,080
So but yeah the context the context of this is that the ride itself in the for the first

555
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,040
you know ten years that it was around was that this was a sequel to ET and we were all

556
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,960
actors and we were going to play our parts while we were on the ride.

557
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,040
So the reason that the ride starts in a spot that looks like a movie production place is

558
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,320
because initially they were thinking that we were all going to be pretending to be actors

559
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,400
while we went on the ride which they eventually thought was like this is stupid.

560
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,360
So then they put in that much more exciting intro that you heard at the top of this whole

561
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,360
segment.

562
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,880
Well even that one is the third one because there was a second mid step the one that you

563
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,720
played was from the was from like 2002 when there was a big 20th anniversary re-release

564
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,760
of ET.

565
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,840
There was one in the 90s which was almost the same thing.

566
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,320
And it's unclear to me why they changed it.

567
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,920
It's almost the same stuff.

568
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,640
Steven Spielberg in the forest you're going to be riding bikes.

569
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,000
He's wearing a vest in that one though.

570
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yes.

571
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
He's different clothes.

572
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,440
And in the new one he's wearing a hat which I really like.

573
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,640
I like when a director talks to you in a cap.

574
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,640
It lets you know that they are a director because they're wearing their iconic director's

575
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
cap.

576
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Probably for a battleship.

577
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,640
Yes.

578
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,640
Probably.

579
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,080
A battleship they did not serve on.

580
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,360
They were gifted.

581
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,360
Oh yeah.

582
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,360
The very James Cameron-y.

583
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,360
Ron Howard.

584
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,560
The stolen valor.

585
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,040
Well making a movie is like going to war.

586
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:02,480
They survived the SS abyss or whatever.

587
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,000
So anyway yeah there's two intros where Steven Spielberg is in the forest.

588
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
The original one is Steven in the theater telling you you're going to be in a scene

589
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,120
and ET at the end telling you be good actors which is a very clunky phrase to come out

590
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,120
of ET's mouth.

591
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,280
I don't know that ET could mentally handle the concept of filmmaking.

592
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
And the logic.

593
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,280
Do you know what movies are?

594
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,840
The logic of it is all wrong too because ET is treated as if he's a real person.

595
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,400
So ET in this world is an actor that's playing ET.

596
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Well this is confused logic that's in a lot of things and especially rides where you know

597
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:47,560
like in some cases Mickey Mouse or the Looney Tunes are real people in the world.

598
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:53,520
And somebody calls action on their cartoons and then they walk away from the set.

599
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,960
You actually see this in another Universal ride the Hanna-Barbera.

600
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,360
The fantastic world of Hanna-Barbera.

601
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,360
Long gone Hanna-Barbera.

602
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,400
Yeah yeah yeah one of the original rides.

603
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:08,420
But I just watched the video of that where you know Hanna and Barbera are telling Fred

604
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:13,240
Flintstone okay they need you on the set and then he walks away and doesn't speak or do

605
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
anything.

606
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,320
So there's a lot of media that has this confusing construct where the character is real and

607
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,400
they acted as themselves.

608
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:28,440
I guess you're being asked to believe that ET is like an eight mile situation where the

609
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,000
guy is doing his life story as a film.

610
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,120
And Universal used to really skirt the line like when it first opened in Florida there

611
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:46,920
was so much like fake like you know lighting rigs and like prop boxes and like a lot.

612
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,680
They really made everything look like a set and that's kind of how they got away with

613
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:56,200
like you know the Jaws ride is next to the Back to the Future ride.

614
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,080
It's just like you're on a back lot.

615
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,000
Yeah you're on a back lot that's come to life and you're going through them.

616
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,960
And what is weird with these different Spielberg things is that like Universal's original marketing

617
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,720
slogan that if you find any old kids show where they would give away a trip to Universal

618
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,840
Studios they would always do that tag like Universal Studios ride the movies.

619
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:24,800
And like it really used to split the difference on attractions of here's how a movie is made

620
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,680
versus now you are riding the movie.

621
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:33,120
Yeah there was some very tortured logic in a lot of that stuff in the Ghostbusters attraction

622
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,720
at Universal Florida.

623
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,480
You were on the soundstage where they filmed the final battle with Gozer but then it has

624
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:47,880
been haunted by actual ghosts and almost everything on the Universal tram tour has that construct

625
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,800
where like we're going on to a hot set where they're filming a new scene.

626
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:57,720
Wait a minute they left it all on like it's actually real King Kong is in the fake set.

627
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,440
I think Universal had a lot at a long time where they were this was too confusing and

628
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,200
they had trouble calibrating this and I like that now they're a little more just committed

629
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,280
to the simple if you're going into Harry Potter land you're in Harry Potter land you're not

630
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,240
on the set of the new Harry Potter.

631
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:17,680
There was a lot of awkward stuff where like originally when I was a kid at Universal Studios

632
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:24,640
you would go to the ADR stage where they're doing a new episode of Harry and the Hendersons

633
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,280
and you'd be watching the ADR you'd be watching the Foley sound effects session for Harry

634
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:35,200
and the Hendersons in 1999 and then there'd be this weird part where like oh no the audio

635
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,480
dropped out we have to record it live.

636
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,480
And in what world is there a live episode of Harry and the Hendersons in 1999.

637
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:49,240
I did a similar there was a very short-lived like how do they make Hercules the Legendary

638
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:55,120
Journeys and Xena Warrior Princess making of show where they would put you in front

639
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:00,160
of a green screen and I remember like being a volunteer in this and they made me look

640
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,480
like a centaur in front of a green screen.

641
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,040
Were you humiliated?

642
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,800
No I was psyched I was all about that I so wanted to do that.

643
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,920
Well you gained some height probably.

644
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,320
Yeah I did gain some height.

645
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,320
Congratulations.

646
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,960
The mighty legs of a horse.

647
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,080
My mother did that at Disney's MGM Studios there's the they had the thing where you would

648
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,040
like be in part of the TV shows it would be like superstar television I believe it was

649
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,960
called and it would be like someone was Gilligan's Island and my mom was on some soap opera and

650
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,560
she had to like pull a gun on someone and it confused the hell out of me.

651
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,560
Like I really I knew it was fake but I was like but my mom has a gun in a fur coat now

652
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,000
and like everything is different.

653
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,680
Like I didn't I really I was very confused.

654
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,560
Do you still have nightmares about this situation?

655
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,960
Yeah I say even talking about it I just flashed back to it it was it's weird it was weird

656
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,280
I still it's attached to a weird feeling in my head.

657
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,400
I think probably a lot of our theme park careers have led to some scarring memories and the

658
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,920
things that have given us disturbing dreams and weird complexes and we'll get into all

659
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,920
of them.

660
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,920
Yeah.

661
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,920
Yeah.

662
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,920
Yeah.

663
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,760
And the stuff about Universal there is a great article that I have read a few times now and

664
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,040
I just read again this morning it was in the dissolve if you guys remember the website

665
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:25,680
that dissolve it was when pitchfork tried to make a website for movie writing for film

666
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,120
writing that was it was a lot of like AV Club writers who move.

667
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,120
Yeah.

668
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,040
And they got a lot of AV Club writers and then eventually it got shut down.

669
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,760
But it's I think it's all still online.

670
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,080
It's all good websites with good writing.

671
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
Yeah.

672
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,280
And there really was a lot of great articles and there was an article about Universal Studios

673
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,400
Florida and the writer was speculating that like well one of the things that was different

674
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:55,680
of Universal Studios when it first opened in Florida and now is that there was a lot

675
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,720
more shows about like how movies are made.

676
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,760
Like how did Alfred Hitchcock do all those iconic scenes.

677
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,640
And a few things happened over time.

678
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,400
One DVD special features became ubiquitous.

679
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,380
So it's not much of a mystery of how they make movies anymore.

680
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:21,320
And then two is that you can just shoot movies on your phone and edit them on a laptop.

681
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:26,080
And so like they they really got rid of a lot of those shows and went towards like these

682
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,240
immersive like you're in the movie.

683
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,240
This is a new part.

684
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,200
This is a sequel or a prequel or something and you're living it.

685
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,560
I would add a number three to that which I honestly only really learned in the last couple

686
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
years.

687
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,040
Three would be most people don't give a shit.

688
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,040
Oh yeah.

689
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,080
Most people do not care about how movies are made.

690
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,080
About how things are written.

691
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,500
How things are conceived.

692
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,860
Like I brought a handful of friends out here and have taken them on this Universal Studios

693
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,860
Tram Tour.

694
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,680
They could have given a shit about it.

695
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,680
They do not care.

696
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,120
Because I'm like oh this soundstage.

697
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,680
Like I took them to the Warner Brothers lot.

698
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,200
Casablanca shot here and they're like yeah uh huh uh huh okay.

699
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,520
Where are we going next.

700
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,800
Like and I was I was floored.

701
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,960
I was like but the movies were made here and they're like I don't we don't care.

702
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,480
But if King Kong attacks that tram.

703
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
Well now you got.

704
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,480
Now you're working with us.

705
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,720
Now do you want to find out how that King Kong was made for the ride.

706
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,720
No fuck you.

707
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,720
Fuck you.

708
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,720
Fuck yourself.

709
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,720
That is then you are us.

710
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,120
The difference is that we do.

711
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,120
We would like to know.

712
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,120
Oh absolutely.

713
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:31,600
Like I've got short sleeve old engineers like tirelessly worked on like the the crotch of

714
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,740
King Kong.

715
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,460
Like how to make his legs swing a certain way.

716
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,960
Like give us that red meat.

717
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,880
The other thing that's weird is that I'm always going to websites and learning all this information

718
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,640
and then it's like oh god I wonder who built the King Kong robot.

719
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,560
Oh it was a guy named Bob Gurr.

720
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,360
Oh like what else do you do with that.

721
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,360
That's the end of that story.

722
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,360
Are you going to read what else he did.

723
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,560
Yeah you're like oh wow I like a lot of this man's work.

724
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
Yes sure.

725
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,720
But it's it's often hard to convey to other people which will be the challenge of doing

726
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
this part.

727
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,680
Oh is there any of this interesting.

728
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,560
Are we doing this for ourselves.

729
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,760
Are all podcasts kind of for yourself possibly.

730
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,000
We have a lot of big picture questions we hope to get to the bottom of.

731
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Anyway let's talk.

732
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,120
So that no let's talk interplanetary passports.

733
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,080
A great topic.

734
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,640
Explain what the hell this is.

735
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,200
Yeah so Steven Spielberg mentioned it a while ago.

736
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,880
But when you begin the adventure experience you are set up with an operator in the early

737
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,000
days of the ride probably AT&T who are the sponsors of it and you had to give your name

738
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,280
to the operator who would put your name on to a special passport a little like flimsy

739
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,280
card.

740
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,400
And if you're going on this ride in Florida today almost 30 years deep that is the most

741
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,120
flimsy falling apart unlaminated peeling off card you've ever seen.

742
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,680
Although I've seen them sell on eBay for like three thousand dollars.

743
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,680
It's crazy.

744
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,480
But anyway the payoff of all of this is that at the end of the ride due to the interplanetary

745
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,240
passport ET says your name.

746
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,200
He says your name to you.

747
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,200
Cool stuff right.

748
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Uh huh.

749
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
Very.

750
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Yeah.

751
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:21,480
Like wow ET is going to call me by my first name and then the reality of it is that ET

752
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,520
doesn't enunciate well as we said before and he enunciates even worse on the ride than

753
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,520
he does in the movie.

754
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,600
Can we all just like to try to say our names the way ET would.

755
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,600
Yes.

756
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,600
Ah.

757
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
Ah.

758
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Jason.

759
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,200
And Jason was the luckiest of the best.

760
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,440
I get it pretty close but my dad.

761
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,160
My dad is also named Michael and I feel like Michael does not come out like a very common

762
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,160
American name.

763
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,200
I went on it the last time I've been on this ride was went on this ride was three years

764
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:59,000
ago and he garbled his way through the hole like eight people that were on the ride vehicle

765
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,320
which is like ah ah ah ah ah.

766
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:09,480
Just like one after another of like butchering and like he was drunk or something like.

767
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,640
Boning it in more than like Steven Spielberg.

768
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,520
Like Brian Wilson being shoved in front of the piano at the Beach Boys concert.

769
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,840
He's kind of playing it a little.

770
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,040
Hey look we're just happy he's around.

771
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,320
We're happy to see him.

772
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,520
Happy to see our friend ET our friend Brian Wilson.

773
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,520
I think they're equivalent figures.

774
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,880
Dr. Landy worked with ET and Brian.

775
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,320
ET tried to do a rap song once too.

776
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,160
But so and it's never worked out great and you also you I feel like you were always like

777
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,080
a little behind it.

778
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:45,920
Like you ET is no longer in your frame of vision by the time he's saying your name.

779
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,920
Yeah.

780
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,840
They was never timed out to correctly.

781
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:57,960
But I the idea of this was so neat and I and this was so long before there was any customization

782
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,240
of of rides.

783
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,240
Now you go on star tours and it picks you to be the spy or there's going to be a lot

784
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,080
of interactivity in the upcoming Star Wars land.

785
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:12,440
But I think without ET saying your name you don't have those greater better pulled off

786
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,600
milestones in the future.

787
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,400
That's an early innovation that people have built on.

788
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,960
You would have thought though by now in 2017 they could have just fixed the fucking thing.

789
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,280
They could have done something that would actually make I mean I read today on something

790
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,680
that people were like like talk eat the ET voices working again.

791
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,080
But I don't know that they've completely overhauled it.

792
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:38,600
They really should just get a teenager to do the voice and say it like they really should

793
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,320
just get just print a sheet out.

794
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,320
Do it live.

795
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,680
Have an 18 year old kid.

796
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,680
OK.

797
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,680
Well do it.

798
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,680
If I can't.

799
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,120
I don't think I'm live.

800
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,680
And then ET just reads down the list and the kid because they do that.

801
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,400
They have like the fun like talking fountains and stuff in universal.

802
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,760
They have like charming performers college students.

803
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,160
There's a fountain over by the Harry Potter.

804
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,040
It's in the what's the what's the land by Harry Potter and the Lost Continent.

805
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,040
The Lost Continent.

806
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,040
Thank you.

807
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:16,680
A forgotten universe an original creation of like universal that most people walk right

808
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,680
through.

809
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,680
Sure.

810
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,680
That's what we did.

811
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,680
Except Poseidon show.

812
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,680
Yeah.

813
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,280
One of our my girlfriend and I's favorite memories is the fountain.

814
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,880
Well I had a very like cool like English voice and it was like talking to this little girl

815
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,880
and he was like Olivia.

816
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,880
Hello Olivia.

817
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,800
Olivia come over here Olivia.

818
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,920
And we were like very charmed by this talking fountain.

819
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,800
So I feel like they have the capability to make ET speak.

820
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,680
We're missing out on stuff like this British Olivia voice.

821
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,680
Yeah.

822
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,200
That fountain is a guy that there's a camera on that fountain and there's a guy somewhere

823
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,200
watching that person.

824
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,200
I know.

825
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,200
I know that.

826
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,200
So you're saying they should do that for ET.

827
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,200
I know it's not a real talking fountain.

828
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,000
I'm just saying they can have a clearer voice.

829
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Do you know that?

830
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I do know that.

831
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,560
I think you might just be a fucking idiot.

832
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,960
I am not a fucking idiot.

833
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,960
If you're lying.

834
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,160
Don't tell people that's what I am.

835
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,480
But that fountain every time I see that fountain it's sassy.

836
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,480
Like it's ragging on people.

837
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,120
It's like roasting people and shooting water at them.

838
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,280
Universal has a whole thing where they rag on you a little more than Disney does.

839
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,440
Because I got ragged on by those New York Street performers before.

840
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,000
Where they're like oh look at this guy.

841
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Look at this guy here.

842
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And they can't say anything meaner.

843
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
They can't swear.

844
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,700
So all they can do is be like this lady's wearing a funny hat.

845
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,920
Look at that lady's hat.

846
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,480
Like really like if it was a real issue you'd be like this fucking bitch.

847
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,720
But like they can't say that.

848
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,640
So it's just like look at that guy.

849
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,480
He's got a funny pair of pants on.

850
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,880
Look at that guy's pants.

851
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,200
It's devastating.

852
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,880
If those New York people get on you.

853
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,280
Oh man it's devastating.

854
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,360
You're starting your vacation off being humiliated.

855
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,880
What is this guy from Denver?

856
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,880
Yes.

857
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,880
Oh.

858
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,880
You live on a mountain pal.

859
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,560
Look at this mountain guy.

860
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,320
And like that does work.

861
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,320
The audience.

862
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,400
Yeah people like him.

863
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,760
But if you're getting roasted it's like.

864
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,480
I'd avoid that at all costs.

865
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,880
Still today they're saying all this stuff about the Star Wars attractions that you're

866
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,840
gonna have a reputation that carries you along through all these.

867
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,280
Somebody will criticize you for doing a bad job on the Millennium Falcon ride.

868
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,280
It's a lot of pressure.

869
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,280
Sounds horrible to me.

870
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,720
But maybe ET should roast you a little bit as you get off the ride.

871
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,920
Fuck you buddy.

872
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,200
Don't come back.

873
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,680
You were baggage on that bike.

874
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,680
Look at your hat.

875
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,240
Look at this fucking hat.

876
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,400
What are you from Denver?

877
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,400
You don't even like Magdahl.

878
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,600
You weren't nice to Teakley.

879
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,360
One of my oldest friends and this is how you treat him.

880
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:47,000
Sort of like grouchy Jewish ET that we're developing.

881
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,200
That would be an improvement though.

882
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,960
Come visit me more often.

883
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,960
Come on.

884
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,960
Come on.

885
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,640
So my other question is how do you improve this ride?

886
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,920
What do we do to the ride?

887
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,200
We're in charge of the park.

888
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,200
Do we fix it?

889
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,200
Do we tear it out?

890
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,400
What happens to the ET adventure?

891
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,120
We've come up with an official grading system.

892
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,240
Let's call it an unofficial grading system.

893
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:15,400
So there's three choices that we should each pick of what we would do with this ride.

894
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,800
Would we one, keep it as is.

895
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,800
Don't do anything to it.

896
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,800
It's perfect.

897
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,080
We want to preserve it for future generations.

898
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,320
Two, keep the ride but plus it up.

899
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,320
Make some changes.

900
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,880
Make some improvements to it.

901
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,520
Maybe that grouchy Jewish ET at the end.

902
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:36,680
Or three, we hate the ride and we want to burn it down in an accidental fire for insurance

903
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,680
purposes.

904
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,680
Quote unquote accidental fire.

905
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,360
Universal Studios history is littered with quote unquote accidental fires.

906
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,400
Disney has one or two as well.

907
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,400
I suppose there are.

908
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,600
There's serious insurance fires.

909
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:52,240
You can get some money if something burns down and you didn't have anything to do with

910
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,240
it.

911
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,680
Look there's fireworks going off.

912
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,680
There's all manner of things.

913
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,680
You know.

914
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,680
Anything can happen.

915
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,680
Just grunled employees quote unquote.

916
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,680
A lot of water.

917
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,680
A lot of electronics.

918
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,720
I mean we've all thought about it in our daily lives folks.

919
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,720
Yeah.

920
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,760
About burning down a universal studio.

921
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,560
So alright Jason you go first.

922
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,680
What would your choice be?

923
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,560
Would you keep it as plus up or burn it down?

924
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,080
I think plus up because I do like this ride.

925
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:25,680
I feel like people like ET's not fully in the front of our consciousness but I feel

926
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,040
like people still like ET.

927
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:32,440
I feel like that's a classic family movie and this is this ride.

928
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,600
I think a lot of it is still fun.

929
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,280
I feel like yeah there is stuff that can be improved.

930
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:45,000
That weird room where they're giving you the passport that looks like a movie set.

931
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,600
They just turn the whole line into a forest queue or something.

932
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:57,080
And yeah put some more animatronics in and like make ET talk better at the end.

933
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,960
So I think keep it and plus it up.

934
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,440
And I think this will probably.

935
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,400
I mean I'm saying this ride will probably outlive us all.

936
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,400
Really?

937
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,080
Well it's an interesting note because they've gotten rid of two of them.

938
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,480
There was one in Orlando.

939
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,640
There was one in Japan and there was one here.

940
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,400
And the one here and in Japan went away.

941
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:20,400
And it angered Mr. Spielberg apparently and he put his foot down and he kept the one here.

942
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,240
It angers me.

943
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,400
I say you know I'm all for replacing rides if you have a better ride to go in its place.

944
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,960
And the one in Japan looks kind of cool.

945
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,400
I don't know if you guys have looked this up.

946
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,440
There's a ride called Space Fantasy The Ride.

947
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,680
And it looks kind of neat.

948
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,680
You get to like fly into the sun or something.

949
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,800
It's a spinning roller coaster.

950
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,360
It looks like a blast.

951
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:47,920
But here oddly similarly there's this mummy ride where you go into an eclipse or something.

952
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,160
That's the end of the ride.

953
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,240
You get spun around and they flash a lot of lights at you and somebody yells the eclipse.

954
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,240
What?

955
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,240
Where?

956
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,240
Am I in it?

957
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,680
Is it happening far away from me?

958
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,840
What's the story with this eclipse?

959
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,000
Yeah the mummy ride at Universal Studios Hollywood is trash.

960
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,640
I think it's an awful ride.

961
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,960
Yeah I mean there's a couple things to like a couple tiny things to like about it.

962
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,840
Yeah there's a better version of it in Florida.

963
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,040
And it feels very generic.

964
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,260
It feels like you're just in a warehouse on a roller coaster which is like fun viscerally.

965
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,800
But where's the theming?

966
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,640
Where is the adventure and the fun of going to the green goddamn planet?

967
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,120
Like it's a step down.

968
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,000
It's a bummer that that's the thing that replaced it.

969
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,800
And Spielberg helped make Universal Studios Florida.

970
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,600
Like he was like the big guiding Hollywood consultant.

971
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:41,400
So they want to keep him happy because he still consults on the parks.

972
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,640
Yeah I mean I am worried though if he dies.

973
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,680
If they go well Steven's dead and then like the bulldozers hit the ride in Orlando the

974
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,680
next day.

975
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,680
All the contracts are off.

976
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,680
We're all gonna die one day.

977
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,680
I know we're all gonna die.

978
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,680
I know we're all gonna die.

979
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,960
I know that too.

980
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,920
So Scott what is your, so you want to, what would your choice be?

981
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,920
Oh yeah.

982
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,920
Plus it up.

983
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,920
Plus it up.

984
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,400
Bring it back in Hollywood.

985
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,640
God damn it.

986
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:13,720
And you know what I think hurts the ride is that you don't really know who Botanicus is.

987
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,720
He's his teacher.

988
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,720
Okay.

989
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,400
What did he teach him to do?

990
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,200
What is the connection there?

991
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,340
What's the relationship?

992
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,640
I want to know.

993
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:27,360
Maybe in that pre-ride sequence you watch a little film or something.

994
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:32,100
Maybe we bring E.T. into the language of like the CGI movies.

995
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,840
The Despicable Me kind of animation that all the kids love these days.

996
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,540
Maybe you do some new stuff that explains who Botanicus is.

997
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:46,280
It explains who Mooc Mooc or these other Glip Glop, all these Green Planet characters are.

998
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,000
Maybe provide some context so by the time you see them in the ride you love them.

999
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,720
You want to reach out of the bike and give them a hug.

1000
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,120
That brings up a great point.

1001
00:50:54,120 --> 00:51:00,240
You have to get E.T. back to the Green Planet so his healing touch can fix the Green Planet.

1002
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,680
None of these other assholes have that power.

1003
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,440
What is Botanicus' power?

1004
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,160
Botanicus has an orb where it seems like he gets his power from.

1005
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,000
There's a cool orb that's by him.

1006
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,160
Is the power just to see E.T. and what he's doing?

1007
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,160
Yes.

1008
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,400
That must be it.

1009
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,040
It's like a crystal ball.

1010
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:22,600
My theory about E.T. is that much like Superman when he's exposed to Earth's yellow sun, that's

1011
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,600
how he gets his powers.

1012
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,440
He doesn't have powers on Krypton.

1013
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:31,240
E.T. under our yellow sun on Earth has these magical powers to grow plants and stuff.

1014
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,560
But I would imagine all of his species has that.

1015
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,560
It's not like E.T.

1016
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,800
They really present E.T. as a dumpy little boy in that movie.

1017
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,920
It's not like E.T.'s this extraordinary alien that can bring something back.

1018
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,000
This ride frames him as the chosen one.

1019
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,160
I don't think the movie was not about him being the kid.

1020
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,080
He was just a regular kid hanging out with another kid.

1021
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,480
But in fact when he's gone the planet has gone to shit.

1022
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,440
When you first arrive at that Green Planet.

1023
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,280
It's a bunch of, it's just gas.

1024
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,840
People are, characters are dying.

1025
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:03,120
It does have that thing where the ride is like the movie and that it's like scary and

1026
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,120
depressing.

1027
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,440
E.T. is a very upsetting film.

1028
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:11,880
And when you arrive at the Green Planet it's like you're watching E.T. in the incubation

1029
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,200
unit frothing at the mouth and dying.

1030
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,440
I guess he doesn't see, he doesn't foam.

1031
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,880
But in my, I'll never know because I don't want to watch that E.T. death stuff ever again.

1032
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,880
It's very depressing.

1033
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,600
I did not care for it as a child.

1034
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,520
It was very, yeah, very traumatizing.

1035
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,280
My mom would ask do you want to watch E.T.?

1036
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,920
Like no, please no.

1037
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,400
Did I do something wrong?

1038
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,320
But yeah, maybe you learn more about these people.

1039
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,640
You up the stakes.

1040
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,000
I think better animatronics.

1041
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,520
Although maybe not those cops.

1042
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:44,720
Maybe I like that those cops are apartment store mannequins.

1043
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:51,880
They're brainless automatons the way the worst of the police officers are.

1044
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,840
Really the very, very, we're not all of them.

1045
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,840
You know what I'm saying.

1046
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,720
Folks, the state has a monopoly on violence.

1047
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,000
But we're not going down that road.

1048
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Michael, what's your verdict?

1049
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,160
Oh, on that note.

1050
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,400
I am going to also say plus it up.

1051
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,920
And I have some idea.

1052
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,720
We all are on the same page with this.

1053
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,200
The first thing I have is that I would like Steven Spielberg to record the video again.

1054
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,560
I would like a fourth video.

1055
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,560
Every year.

1056
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,560
Let's keep sending him out.

1057
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,480
Because the last one was in 2002, I think, or something around then.

1058
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,920
I think it needs an update.

1059
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,400
And here's what I propose.

1060
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,160
He isn't Steven Spielberg in the video.

1061
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,280
You don't use his name.

1062
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,280
You can be cute about it.

1063
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,920
He can be like, hello, I'm E.T.'s friend, Steve.

1064
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,880
And we can say Steve and there can be a wink of like.

1065
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,720
Because I don't like the idea that it's this director of the movie.

1066
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,480
He needs to play a character in the universe.

1067
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,280
I want it to sell that we're in another adventure.

1068
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,440
But is it going to confuse people?

1069
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,280
Are they going to think that he's the store owner from the Blues Brothers?

1070
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:54,680
The most iconic Steven Spielberg character?

1071
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,640
If that movie was in the last had come out in the last 30 years.

1072
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,640
Then maybe.

1073
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,640
Then maybe.

1074
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,640
Why didn't he reprise it in 2000?

1075
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:02,640
Oh, that.

1076
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,640
Why?

1077
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,640
That is a good question.

1078
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,640
That would have been a good callback.

1079
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,640
Old store owner.

1080
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,640
So I want Steve.

1081
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,640
I want him to play Steve.

1082
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,200
And I also want a little more explanation, because in this ride, it's like, why is E.T.

1083
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,280
back on Earth already?

1084
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,840
It's not the same thing from the movie.

1085
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,800
So I would like I would propose this.

1086
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,400
That the video is sort of E.T. and his friend Steve doing something.

1087
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,960
And Steve is like, thanks for coming back to Earth, E.T.

1088
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,960
Like, it's so good.

1089
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,960
Like they're doing they could be playing cards.

1090
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:26,960
They could be watching a movie.

1091
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,120
I don't care.

1092
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:34,640
And then Botanic is on the video comes to them and goes with my splitter voice, like,

1093
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,920
you must.

1094
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,320
He's sort of like, it's like a warmer.

1095
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,000
Yeah, warmer.

1096
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I am Botanic.

1097
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
That's offensive.

1098
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I'm sorry.

1099
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,760
E.T., where are you going?

1100
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,400
We got to finish Bridge of Spies.

1101
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,960
And then, yeah, that's good.

1102
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,960
That's fine.

1103
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:54,720
If you want to put a nod to the Steven Spielberg's work, but not reference that he directed it.

1104
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,400
And then Steve explains to the audience that he can't go.

1105
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,360
But E.T. had just got a transmission from Botanicus and they need to go.

1106
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,900
And you guys are the ones to help.

1107
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,980
So then that makes sense.

1108
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,520
Now we know why he's there.

1109
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:10,160
Now we know we're not confused why the director of the movie is there.

1110
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,560
We just know there's a mission.

1111
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,960
We're going to go help E.T. go back.

1112
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,360
Then, yeah, you get rid of that thing where it's like a movie studio.

1113
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,120
You put more trees in there.

1114
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,360
You come up with a cooler way to do the name thing.

1115
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,160
Like maybe E.T. asks you your name or something before.

1116
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,520
Like you have to just say it to him.

1117
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,880
And then there's a teenager behind there and he hears the name of it.

1118
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,480
And then that's when he says it later, which I guess kind of kills the fun of talking to

1119
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,120
E.T. until the end.

1120
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,680
So maybe I can workshop that.

1121
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,080
Put the interplanetary passport on your phone.

1122
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,960
That's a great idea.

1123
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,960
That's a great idea.

1124
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,960
Sure, great.

1125
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,240
The apps are big these days.

1126
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:48,440
They have not converted those interplanetary passport cards to QR codes yet.

1127
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,960
They're still rocking a barcode.

1128
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,960
There we go.

1129
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,600
Let's get it up to 2012 technology.

1130
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,600
Yeah.

1131
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:58,320
Also, a thing that bothers me is that they call him E.T.

1132
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,800
His aliens call him.

1133
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,000
His friends from the planet call him E.T., which is not his name.

1134
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,640
I know his real name.

1135
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,240
His real name is Zrek.

1136
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,280
Z-R-E-K.

1137
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,280
Because that is in the book.

1138
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,280
Oh, that just rolls off the top.

1139
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,280
Zrek.

1140
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:18,320
So if we're going to be accurate, they should be like, hello, Zrek.

1141
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,400
That's how they should be calling him.

1142
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,640
I understand it'll confuse tourists, but let's be accurate.

1143
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:29,200
Maybe you can slash a disclaimer with an asterisk as that is said, or pause the ride entirely,

1144
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,880
unfurl a big sheet of information in the original, in the E.T. mythology.

1145
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:34,880
E.T. is Zrek.

1146
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,640
Obviously, they wouldn't call him E.T.

1147
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,240
That's a name that Elliot made up, so that's why this is what it is.

1148
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,520
And then the paper goes back up.

1149
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,520
You continue with the ride.

1150
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,520
Sure.

1151
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,520
Yeah, that's fine.

1152
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,400
Zrek is, I think, the name the Zodiac Killer signed some of his letters with.

1153
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,240
Nice little reference.

1154
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,040
Nice little Easter egg in that E.T. book to the Zodiac Killer.

1155
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,160
He almost signed it Botanicus.

1156
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,840
He was a flip of a coin.

1157
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,720
I would install a few more Botanicus animatronics as well.

1158
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,880
He has to have a little bit of a stronger presence.

1159
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:12,640
Also, maybe make sort of a Force ghost, Star Wars ghost Botanicus during the ride, or the

1160
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:17,160
first part of the ride, where he says, close call, you're almost there, or watch out, or

1161
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:21,040
something like, have his presence be felt, because he's such a big, they pipe him up

1162
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,240
to be so big, and then he's barely on the ride.

1163
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,240
He barely does anything.

1164
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,560
His big ghost is hovering above Dodger Stadium in the fake Los Angeles, visible in the spotlights.

1165
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,560
This way.

1166
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,560
I'm missing now.

1167
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,560
This way.

1168
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,800
Don't hit Chavez Ravine on your way out.

1169
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,800
Yeah.

1170
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:44,000
And then, also, tone down, because when they get to the Green Planet, it feels like they're

1171
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,060
all the Munchkins in the Wizard of Oz.

1172
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,480
It's a very Munchkin vibe.

1173
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,840
Like, right this way.

1174
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,640
Yes, you're welcome home.

1175
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,040
You've arrived.

1176
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,280
Pick a different thing.

1177
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,800
It doesn't, I don't know why everyone would be so cheery.

1178
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,200
And I think more E.T.'s.

1179
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,200
Don't you want to see a ton of E.T.'s?

1180
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,200
You want a ton of E.T.'s.

1181
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,640
Not these little plant guys you never met.

1182
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,200
The plant guys don't make any sense.

1183
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,000
More E.T.'s and make them, one is a Mohawk or something.

1184
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
One is like a, whatever the E.T. version of a Mohawk is.

1185
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,480
If one had an electric guitar, like, who does the rock and roll E.T.?

1186
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,840
He rips a quick solo.

1187
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:24,480
And then you could do a thing where there's a new song every time you ride the ride.

1188
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,080
You got a DJ one with a big dead mouse helmet.

1189
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,080
Sure.

1190
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,080
Let's make it relevant to the rave kids.

1191
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,080
And you know what?

1192
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,360
How about one girl one?

1193
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:34,360
There.

1194
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,360
One girl E.T.

1195
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,360
Very token.

1196
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,360
Let's be progressive here.

1197
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,520
Token girl E.T.

1198
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,000
Just blonde hair.

1199
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,360
Which looks just like the E.T. from the closet.

1200
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,520
Which is a photo op you can get after the ride.

1201
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,520
Oh yeah.

1202
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,520
Don't forget.

1203
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,520
Don't forget.

1204
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:54,360
And then yeah, my last thing is for all these different characters and for Botanicus, as

1205
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:57,640
Mr. Spielberg calls him, where's the merch?

1206
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,840
Where's the Botanicus doll?

1207
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,720
Like why isn't, like why are we not taking advantage?

1208
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:07,640
Like the big part of theme parks is like marketing and selling some shit, moving merchandise.

1209
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,640
You know what?

1210
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:15,600
My favorite obscure characters, the Captain EO, Idy and Ody and Major Domo.

1211
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,600
Major and Minor Domo.

1212
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,600
Major and Minor Domo.

1213
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,600
And Hooter.

1214
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,600
And Hooter.

1215
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,680
I have a little Hooter.

1216
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,640
They do have dolls of these obscure things.

1217
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:28,800
Why not ruffle through notes, ruffle through notes, Orbadon?

1218
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,320
I want to take an Orbadon home.

1219
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,400
Yeah, they should have more Orbadon merch.

1220
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,360
I had that marketing worked on me as a kid so much.

1221
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:39,520
I was like, look, it's the merch from the ride and you can't get this anywhere else,

1222
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,040
you little fuck.

1223
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,040
You better buy it now.

1224
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,440
It's like, yeah, I better buy it now.

1225
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,720
Where else would I fucking buy this?

1226
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,760
Now the answer is eBay or Etsy.

1227
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,760
Mm-hmm.

1228
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,760
Yeah, so.

1229
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,840
Too many opportunities to share in the magic.

1230
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,760
But I mean, when the ride goes away, it's hard to get that merch.

1231
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:03,520
So like, you'll cherish that Botanicus doll for the next 30 years.

1232
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,880
Who's the mushroom one, Orbadon?

1233
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:05,880
Orbadon.

1234
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,480
You get a big mushroom helmet.

1235
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,480
Yes.

1236
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,000
It doesn't have to just be a doll.

1237
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Becomes an heirloom.

1238
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,080
Parents pass them, this is my Orbadon son and it's your Orbadon now.

1239
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:21,200
I think like in the late 90s when kids were rocking the cat in the hat hat, kids are going

1240
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,520
to be wearing that Orbadon hat at raves.

1241
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,960
It'll be different colored Orbadon hats.

1242
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,760
It's the new Devo energy dome.

1243
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,760
Yeah.

1244
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:36,160
For a new generation of kids who will get beat up as soon as they wear it in public.

1245
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,160
So I mean, that's.

1246
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,760
Orbadon helmets is the solution.

1247
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,760
We all agree.

1248
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:41,760
We all agree.

1249
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:42,760
Keep it.

1250
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:47,160
So implement, keep it and implement all of our solutions now, please.

1251
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,480
You heard us, Universal Studios Big Wigs.

1252
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,960
I got an in there, right?

1253
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,040
Got a minimum wage job there.

1254
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,040
They owe me.

1255
01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:00,040
Hey, start to get cranking on those Orbadon helmets, would you?

1256
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,040
Yeah.

1257
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,080
Send them an MP3 of this and.

1258
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,160
Yeah.

1259
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,640
And assume that they listen to it.

1260
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,640
They might.

1261
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,360
Folks, we'll be right back.

1262
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,200
Folks we're back.

1263
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,080
Here with a segment we're calling Souvenir Smackdown.

1264
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,080
The three of us.

1265
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,080
Souvenir Smackdown.

1266
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,080
There.

1267
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,080
That was a cue.

1268
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,080
Souvenir.

1269
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,080
Souvenir.

1270
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,080
Souvenir.

1271
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,080
Souvenir Smackdown.

1272
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,080
All right.

1273
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,080
We got all the morning radio.

1274
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,080
The Zoo Crew stuff.

1275
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,080
The Zoo Crew stuff.

1276
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:37,840
Folks, there's a large secondary market, I guess you'd call it, for theme park merch and

1277
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:42,440
souvenirs on pretty much any website that sells stuff.

1278
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,680
Amazon, eBay, Etsy.

1279
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:53,720
And you can find vintage souvenirs, maps, tickets, anything you want you could find on these

1280
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,320
websites.

1281
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:59,800
And we, the three of us set out to each find a weird thing.

1282
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,800
Yeah.

1283
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:08,260
So we're going to find out who has found the weirdest piece of souvenir merchandise.

1284
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,080
And then I guess we'll all vote on it.

1285
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,080
I suppose so.

1286
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,120
You might call this stuff Disneyana.

1287
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,120
Yes.

1288
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,120
That's that technical term.

1289
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:18,120
Although some of it might not be from Disneyland.

1290
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,480
So I don't know what kind of Anna it is.

1291
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,600
It's the theme park Anna, I guess.

1292
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,600
What is that?

1293
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,320
Why is that word Disneyana?

1294
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,320
I don't know.

1295
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,320
I have no idea because it's not Anna.

1296
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,360
It should be memorabilia, like Disney-belia.

1297
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,360
Right.

1298
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,360
Universal-belia.

1299
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,240
Does it come from like antiquing?

1300
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,560
Like maybe.

1301
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,560
Like Americana?

1302
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,560
Antiquing.

1303
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,440
Is it Disney and Americana mashed up?

1304
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,440
Could be.

1305
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,440
Better name.

1306
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,480
Burn down the name Disneyana for insurance money.

1307
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,240
Tell us on Twitter if you know what, where did that come from?

1308
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,240
Yeah.

1309
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,240
So.

1310
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,240
All right.

1311
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,240
So who wants to go first?

1312
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,240
I'll go.

1313
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,240
Jason, you go first.

1314
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,240
All right.

1315
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,240
I got it.

1316
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,240
Okay.

1317
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:05,360
So I found, now we all know when you shop for collectibles, like collectible toys, you

1318
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:09,960
want to keep it in the packaging so that it accrues value over time.

1319
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,360
And it's in good shape when you keep it in the packaging.

1320
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,280
With like toys and shit.

1321
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,280
But what I found is a weird thing to keep in the packaging.

1322
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:23,520
This is a, I don't know what year this is copyrighted.

1323
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:31,280
This is a child's swim ring featuring the orange bird still in the packaging.

1324
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,280
All right.

1325
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,120
We'll have pictures of all of this on the, on all the social media stuff.

1326
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:41,080
So this is an inflatable swim ring that you would wear around your waist featuring the

1327
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,080
orange bird.

1328
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:46,200
For those of you out there who don't know the orange bird, a character created by Walt

1329
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:54,440
Disney Productions in the 1970s for the Florida Citrus Commission in exchange for that commission

1330
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:59,680
sponsoring the Enchanted Tiki Room in Florida.

1331
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:06,220
So and a character that went away for a long time and then became a huge hit in Japan.

1332
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:07,700
So they brought him back.

1333
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,680
Where would you see this character?

1334
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,040
What's an example of the orange bird in the world?

1335
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:19,120
You will see him in Florida at this, the place in Adventureland at Disney World where they

1336
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:28,160
sell the citrus swirl, a combination of vanilla soft serve and orange icey.

1337
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,240
And then you'll just see him in souvenir shops.

1338
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:35,720
How would you describe the attitude of this character, this beloved in Japan character,

1339
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:36,720
the orange bird?

1340
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,880
He's sassy.

1341
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,460
He's fun loving.

1342
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:45,000
He has a head that looks like an orange and the rest of his body is either green or orange.

1343
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,340
And he is no longer associated with the Florida Citrus Commission.

1344
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:55,640
He's just back to being a Disney park exclusive character.

1345
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,280
So he's a free agent.

1346
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,880
He could advertise any citrus commission he wants.

1347
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:00,880
That's true.

1348
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,520
If your state is looking for a mascot.

1349
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:10,160
So the eBay listing has ended.

1350
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:15,080
They said it is a vintage 1970s, still in the packaging.

1351
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:19,720
Guess how much money this child's inflatable swimming device sold for.

1352
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,040
So this is like an inner tube, right?

1353
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:25,480
Yeah, this is like a little inner tube you would put around your waist.

1354
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,720
And it's from the 70s.

1355
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,800
It's from the 70s.

1356
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,800
Still in the packaging.

1357
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,800
You wouldn't use it.

1358
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,800
You could try though.

1359
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,040
You could try, yeah.

1360
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:38,840
Let me throw out a $200.

1361
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,880
I think they're asking for $800.

1362
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,880
Scott was closer.

1363
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:47,600
It went for $133.62.

1364
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,600
That's reasonable actually.

1365
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,600
Yeah.

1366
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:55,760
Horrible, although also the furthest character you don't really know and what is it and who

1367
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,060
would be impressed by this?

1368
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:00,440
Would this make you happy at home?

1369
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,480
Would your spouse be impressed if you had this?

1370
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,800
Also, it's not like an action figure or a little statue that you can see it in the box.

1371
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:11,680
It is a folded up inflatable tube.

1372
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,840
It's a Lesley's Pool Supply scrunched up in the box still.

1373
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,920
You can't see the picture.

1374
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,920
You could just kind of make out part of the word Florida.

1375
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:21,920
Orrid.

1376
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:22,920
Orrid.

1377
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:23,920
Orrid.

1378
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,760
I guess you would have to, if you wanted to display, you would have to try to blow it

1379
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,760
up.

1380
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,760
You have to open it.

1381
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:29,760
Blow it up, yeah.

1382
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,120
How long can an inner tube last for 45 years?

1383
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,120
I don't know.

1384
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,040
Did you purchase this product?

1385
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,760
Is the purchaser of this listening?

1386
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,760
If so, let us know.

1387
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,760
Yeah, tweet at us.

1388
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:41,840
What you want to do with it.

1389
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,280
Why you bought it.

1390
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:47,920
If you did and you've used it, just tweet us a photo of you in a lake with the thing

1391
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,240
around you floating.

1392
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,240
Because that would be great.

1393
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,640
That would be very exciting.

1394
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,280
Tweet at us at podcasttheride on Twitter.

1395
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,280
Yes.

1396
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,280
All right, Scott.

1397
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,280
All right.

1398
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:07,160
I will read mine with the same capitalization as the entry does.

1399
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,480
Walt Disney.

1400
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,480
Animal Kingdom.

1401
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,480
Authentic leaves.

1402
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,480
Tree of life.

1403
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,280
Extremely rare prop.

1404
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:21,480
What this is, and let me show you gentlemen without, I'm going to show you a picture of

1405
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,080
two leaves.

1406
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,440
This without showing you the price.

1407
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:31,200
So the centerpiece of Animal Kingdom is a giant fake tree.

1408
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:38,080
These are two leaves on the same little branch from the tree of life.

1409
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,400
Let me read some facts about it.

1410
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,920
This is the ultimate Disney collectible.

1411
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:45,880
An actual branch with two leaves from the tree of life.

1412
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:51,680
This branch with two leaves is from a bigger branch that was removed from the tree after

1413
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:57,560
an incident in May 2012 in which the branch fell onto a public path during bark hours.

1414
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,560
Public?

1415
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,680
This seems like a private transgression.

1416
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,720
Very special item and very rare.

1417
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:08,040
This type of Disney souvenir has never been on the market.

1418
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,400
The tree of life branch is about 25 inches long.

1419
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:14,920
The first leaf is about 12 inches long and seven and a half inches wide.

1420
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:22,120
The second leaf is about 12 inches long and seven and a half inches wide.

1421
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:26,680
Just to clarify the difference between the first and second leaf.

1422
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:30,360
Of course they are scratched after spending many years in the Florida weather.

1423
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,360
Alright?

1424
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,360
So deal with it.

1425
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,360
Florida is rough as hurricanes.

1426
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,360
They're scratched.

1427
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,360
Alright?

1428
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,360
Just buy them anyway.

1429
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,360
Do not miss this opportunity.

1430
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,360
What is the material?

1431
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,960
What does it say it's made of?

1432
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,960
I don't believe it says that.

1433
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,320
I mean what are Disney trees made of?

1434
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,040
I mean it's some rubber and whatever.

1435
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,040
Plaster and rubber.

1436
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,040
Plasticky.

1437
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,680
Does it even say how they obtained this?

1438
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:51,480
Did it fall off while they were at it?

1439
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:55,880
It fell and I think probably whoever is selling this went and grabbed it and hauled it out

1440
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:56,880
of the park.

1441
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,320
Decided to make a nice pretty penny off of it.

1442
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:03,520
Yeah and it implies to me, I think it says that it was part of a bigger branch.

1443
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,880
This guy might have upwards of...

1444
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:05,880
Oh he has the full branch.

1445
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:06,880
Could have like 20 leaves.

1446
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,880
He's selling it for parts.

1447
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:08,880
Yeah.

1448
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,880
Yeah.

1449
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:10,880
Holding out.

1450
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,160
Would you like to...

1451
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,160
This is not sold.

1452
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,120
There are four people watching.

1453
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,120
One of them myself.

1454
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:25,520
Would you like to guess the asking price for this item?

1455
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,520
I'll say 200.

1456
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,520
100 elite.

1457
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,520
I was going to say 200 exactly.

1458
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,520
Yeah.

1459
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,520
The asking price is $29,000.

1460
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,520
What?

1461
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,520
What?

1462
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,520
No.

1463
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:35,520
No.

1464
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,520
Come on.

1465
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,520
Is that the buy it now price?

1466
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,520
Let me see that.

1467
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,520
I have to see that.

1468
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,520
That is the buy it now price.

1469
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,520
Oh okay.

1470
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,520
There are no offers.

1471
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,520
Maybe that's the buy it now.

1472
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,520
People can set.

1473
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,520
They're all handed around if you want to.

1474
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,520
You can set.

1475
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,680
That means they're setting it.

1476
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:52,880
That doesn't mean if someone had put up that money, that means they would have been making

1477
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:53,880
a commitment.

1478
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,300
Can we make an offer right now?

1479
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,300
Just like $10?

1480
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,300
Yeah.

1481
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:59,300
Maybe we should.

1482
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:02,520
First we need to set up podcasttheride at eBay.com.

1483
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:06,520
We're going to sell out of our merch.

1484
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,520
Yeah.

1485
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,520
No.

1486
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,520
Let's do it and see.

1487
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,520
Maybe we can end up with these.

1488
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,520
$29,000.

1489
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,520
We'll update you on a future episode.

1490
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:16,800
Because I would imagine if somebody thinks this is worth $29,000 and they get an offer

1491
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:21,160
for $10, they're going to be furious.

1492
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,180
Did you not read the story?

1493
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:25,160
This fell on a public path.

1494
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,160
Oh my gosh.

1495
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,160
Unprecedented in Disney history.

1496
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,080
And yeah, they're beat up, but God shut up.

1497
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,000
Don't bother me about that anymore.

1498
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,660
Theme park enthusiasts angry about something?

1499
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:36,920
I have never heard of such a thing.

1500
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:41,160
The branch with tulis from Moogerv Branch after an incident in May 2012.

1501
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:47,440
So there's a possibility that a person shimmied up the tree and ripped a branch off as well.

1502
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,440
That's a good point.

1503
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,960
There's a possibility this is illegally obtained.

1504
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:53,660
We're trying to take the leaves back into our hands, democratize the leaves.

1505
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:59,480
Or it fell on someone and someone saw it and they ran up and they're like, oh my God.

1506
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:02,800
And they grabbed the branch before helping the other person.

1507
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:07,760
This could be crucial evidence in the trial that could finally bring Disney down, bring

1508
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,000
it to its knees.

1509
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,920
And yet it was stolen, maybe hidden away by Disney themselves.

1510
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:16,720
Maybe we're accessories to murder if we buy this item.

1511
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:21,680
Disney does sell a lot of stuff to theme park.

1512
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:25,920
To the Van Eten galleries where I've bought some Epcot signs, which I'm sure I'll talk

1513
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:26,920
about on every episode.

1514
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:32,080
There's a giant warehouse in Florida where you can just buy the sign from the hotel or

1515
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,840
like a monorail door.

1516
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,840
Well, the monorail door.

1517
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:36,840
Yeah, I'm all about that.

1518
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:40,200
We all, we would all really like a monorail door in our living room.

1519
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,920
That's my $29,000 item.

1520
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,600
Yeah, I would like the full people mover car.

1521
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,600
Oh, sure.

1522
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,320
Just like in your kitchen.

1523
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:53,280
Which I've seen at this auction that I went to that I believe was set around $29,000 and

1524
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,240
this is being asked for two leaves.

1525
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:59,840
I'm going to the D, well, when this comes out, this may not make sense, D23, but they

1526
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:00,840
always have a car.

1527
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:04,960
You can always buy a car there for like $25,000 a people mover car.

1528
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:05,960
Really?

1529
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:09,400
Yeah, I hope so you'll hopefully ride one up to the next record.

1530
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:13,440
Yeah, that'll become, the people mover car will become my real car.

1531
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,080
I'll sell my current car.

1532
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,600
I mean, I ride everywhere in just a sidecar.

1533
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,800
That's a good point.

1534
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,600
You just coast.

1535
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,800
Okay, so here we go.

1536
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,760
Here's mine.

1537
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,760
This kind of doesn't fall.

1538
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:33,840
I kind of moved out of the rules of the game a little bit, but this is so funny to me.

1539
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,840
I had to do it.

1540
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,080
I'll read the description and then I'll show you the picture because the picture is everything.

1541
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,360
This Winnie the Pooh collectible Disneyland promotional art depicting Winnie the Pooh

1542
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,920
with a park guest in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle.

1543
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,720
This original full color illustration was created during the development of promotional

1544
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:51,360
materials on behalf of the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California.

1545
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,800
Now that all sounds pretty normal, right?

1546
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,800
Sure.

1547
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,800
Sure.

1548
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:59,520
Okay, but like, does this art look weird to anyone else?

1549
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,320
Let me crane around.

1550
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,320
Oh, fuck.

1551
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,520
What the hell?

1552
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:11,920
So what's going on here is that it's a drawing of Winnie the Pooh and a very attractive woman.

1553
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,720
Yeah, real 70s hair.

1554
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:18,800
Or she kind of reminds me of like, you know, she looks like a Jan Hooks.

1555
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,000
She looks like a young Jan Hooks.

1556
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,840
She looks like she just got engaged to a life-size Winnie the Pooh.

1557
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:32,600
That is my point is that these two don't look like a tourist and a person in a costume.

1558
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:33,640
These two look like lovers.

1559
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:36,880
This is a little sexualized what we're looking at.

1560
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:43,240
That was probably not the intention, but it's just, it's so weird because I imagine this

1561
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:48,400
is probably why this never became like a big image they ever used for a lot of things.

1562
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:53,040
But it definitely looks like Pooh and this human woman are having sex with each other

1563
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,680
or about to have sex.

1564
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,320
Her hand we can't see is in his back pocket.

1565
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,320
Like that's what this is.

1566
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,560
He doesn't have a back pocket though.

1567
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,680
We can't see beneath the weight.

1568
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:07,760
We can kind of see, but he could be wearing a half shirt and he has like bell bottoms

1569
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:08,760
on.

1570
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:12,760
He's got his arm around her in such, and again, this will be posted on the various social

1571
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:13,760
medias.

1572
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:18,440
He's got his arm around her in such an intimate way and she's kind of just like has her left

1573
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:24,680
hand like resting on his breast, his like bosom, his peck, Winnie's peck.

1574
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:25,800
It's a couple's photo.

1575
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,440
It's a prom photo for sure.

1576
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,440
Yeah.

1577
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:32,120
It's just so bizarre.

1578
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:33,120
There's not much more to it.

1579
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,280
I will add, how much do you think they're asking for this?

1580
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,640
Sorry, what's the context of it again?

1581
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,640
Is this concept art?

1582
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,840
It says it was concept art for a promotion.

1583
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,520
It's possible this is just some perverts fan art and they're pretending that it was something

1584
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,520
they were developing, the Disney company was developing.

1585
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,160
And that if you buy the full thing, you get to see Winnie the Pooh's erect penis at the

1586
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:54,880
bottom of the cutoff point.

1587
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,600
Oh bother.

1588
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:01,160
And it is the 70s Pooh, like he does look, it's not a much, so this is obviously like

1589
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,160
old or-

1590
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,160
The signature on the shirt.

1591
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,240
The signature on the shirt is the old one.

1592
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,400
This is like an ice storm couple.

1593
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,720
This is the couple that was cut out of the ice storm.

1594
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:13,440
Pooh's head is like resting too, like right on her bosom.

1595
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:17,280
He's yeah, bosom and mouth are perfectly lined up.

1596
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,960
He looks more lascivious than the normal Pooh as well.

1597
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,080
He does a little something to him.

1598
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:22,800
He looks a little bit more adult or human.

1599
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,760
A little more sassy, a little more sexualized.

1600
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,040
Like it's if the guy's, the woman's husband is taking the photo and he's like, check this

1601
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,040
out, old man.

1602
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,040
Look what I'm doing here.

1603
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,760
Again, weird sexuality among Disney fans.

1604
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,760
Who could imagine that?

1605
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:39,320
All right, so what do we think?

1606
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,980
In what quality do you get this item?

1607
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:44,360
It is just, so here's what it looks like.

1608
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:47,040
It's just, oh, did you see the thing?

1609
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,480
No, I did not.

1610
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,440
Okay, so it's kind of a big sketch.

1611
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,480
Let's say $80.

1612
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,480
Card stock?

1613
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,480
$150.

1614
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,480
$400.

1615
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,480
$400.

1616
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:03,480
And on the back it says, in handwritten it says, DL Co-op, feel like a kid, Pooh slash

1617
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,840
guest slash castle.

1618
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,000
$400, make an offer.

1619
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,040
Should we offer, what would the offer be?

1620
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,040
What would you pay for?

1621
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,040
Oh, we can make the offer?

1622
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:16,040
I think we set a podcast amount and it's always what it is.

1623
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,920
$8.99 no matter what item.

1624
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,120
Hey, the price is right.

1625
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,840
We offer $8.99 for, yeah.

1626
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,560
Let's start for sexual Pooh.

1627
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,560
We got a budget.

1628
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:30,280
That Pooh looks like he just, they just said like how was the wedding?

1629
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,280
Like they just got married.

1630
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,280
Yeah, yeah.

1631
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:36,400
Pooh just said the joke like, well the wedding was great but I've been enjoying the honeymoon

1632
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,760
a lot more.

1633
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,840
And is honeymoon a pun?

1634
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,400
Oh, yeah.

1635
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,400
That's what I intended.

1636
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,400
Let's say that.

1637
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,400
All right, good, good.

1638
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,400
Yeah, sure.

1639
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,400
Very clever.

1640
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,400
That's very clever.

1641
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,400
Nice, cleverer than I am.

1642
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,400
Who wins this war?

1643
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,400
How do we decide this?

1644
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,400
Yeah, how do we decide who?

1645
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,360
I'll be honest.

1646
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,120
I think Jason's is the least weird.

1647
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,120
Yeah, I think it is too.

1648
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:01,000
I think it's the least kind of the most pathetic.

1649
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,400
What did you guys search?

1650
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,680
What did you, I typed in like vintage Disney world.

1651
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:08,960
I did all that stuff and then I just typed in Disneyland and then I set it to highest

1652
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,280
price first and then just started scrolling down.

1653
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,280
Yeah.

1654
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:17,960
There's a lot of good, I mean, I'll save some of these for later but there's like for $450

1655
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:22,560
you can get a Marie Osmond Disneyland 50th anniversary rose doll.

1656
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,560
That's creepy.

1657
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,560
I don't know what it is.

1658
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,920
That's creepier than Neeti's friend with the tentacle hair.

1659
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,200
I don't know who Rose is.

1660
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,680
We don't have time to get into that.

1661
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:34,680
We'll have to do a whole episode on Rose one of these days.

1662
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:35,760
Is it between you and I?

1663
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:36,760
I think it's between us.

1664
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:41,760
So let's let Jason decide because I'm going to vote for myself.

1665
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,040
The poo thing is weird.

1666
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:47,920
I mean, there's a lot of erotic fan art.

1667
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,760
There's a lot of erotic pop culture art online.

1668
01:17:50,760 --> 01:18:01,000
I think the Scots, the mysterious incident associated with Scots plus that $29,000 buy

1669
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
it now.

1670
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
It takes it into weird territory.

1671
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,760
It takes it into a very strange territory.

1672
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,960
Well, I agree, obviously.

1673
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,840
I'm taking the whole package into consideration.

1674
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:12,840
Yes, I agree.

1675
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:13,840
Oh yeah, yeah.

1676
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:14,840
Because yeah, okay.

1677
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,240
I will accept defeat is what I'm saying.

1678
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,240
Hooray.

1679
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,240
I will lose.

1680
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,240
Scott wins the first round.

1681
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:22,240
Scott wins the souvenir.

1682
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,240
Smackdown.

1683
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,240
Yes.

1684
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:29,160
And with that, we come to the first ending.

1685
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:33,400
The first conclusion of the first podcast, The Ride.

1686
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,080
We're closing up.

1687
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:38,080
What's the theme park terminology?

1688
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,880
The kiss goodnight.

1689
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:41,880
The kiss goodnight.

1690
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:42,880
That's what they call it.

1691
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:43,880
That is what they call it at the end of the night.

1692
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:48,080
They call it what Disney officially closes and they do a little light show at the castle.

1693
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:52,400
Well, this is a good way to get no return listeners.

1694
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,760
And now the kiss goodnight.

1695
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:54,760
All right.

1696
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,720
All three of us at once.

1697
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,680
All right.

1698
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,680
Never again.

1699
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,920
That segment might not come back.

1700
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,440

1707
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:28,800
So if you have any ideas for shows, except wait, no colons, right?

1708
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,800
Because in the title of the show, there'd be a colon, but we don't have the colons in

1709
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:32,800
those.

1710
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:33,800
Yeah, no colons.

1711
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:34,800
No colons.

1712
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,800
Great.

1713
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:36,800
Okay.

1720
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,640
