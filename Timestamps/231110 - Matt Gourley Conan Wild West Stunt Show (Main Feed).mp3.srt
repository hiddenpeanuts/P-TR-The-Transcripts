1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:56,920
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, which could be considered a stunt show in that it's a show

4
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,720
where the hosts are emotionally stunted.

5
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,600
I'm Scott Gardner, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

6
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,280
I'm here, I don't want to laugh at that also because I'm withholding in my laughter and

7
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,880
my sorrow and my empathy, but that is a good joke.

8
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,480
I want to say that is a good joke.

9
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
Hey, thanks, thanks.

10
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
Very funny.

11
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,720
Some are not made in other stunt show episodes.

12
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,780
And then I also was like, let me Google the definition of emotionally stunted to make

13
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,260
sure that's right and what the results were like.

14
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,740
It's also, it can also be called Peter Pan syndrome.

15
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,740
Oh, we got that.

16
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,740
People not growing up.

17
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,540
Yeah, yeah, yes.

18
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,540
That's definitely there.

19
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,540
I knew we were right on.

20
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,540
I saw that.

21
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,700
Now, I use that phrase joined as always by Mike Carlson.

22
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,180
We take this phrase for granted sometimes because actually today we are not joined by

23
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,680
Jason Sheridan.

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,300
Some last minute stuff came up for him.

25
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,620
He sends his apologies to our guest and presumably to you, the audience.

26
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,620
I think so, yeah.

27
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,140
He didn't specifically do it, but I imagine that he would.

28
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:04,820
But hey, luckily there will be no shortage of great theme park conversation because we

29
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:12,220
are joined by a theme park performing graduate, a Disney and Universal veteran turned prolific

30
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:18,100
podcaster joining us for the second time from Conan O'Brien needs a friend from with Gourley

31
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,300
and Rust and from his new podcast with Amanda Lund, keys to the kingdom, Matt Gourley.

32
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,100
Oh, it's good to be back guys.

33
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,460
Thanks for having me back.

34
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,620
Glad you could really happy you reached out and excited to talk about keys to the kingdom,

35
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,980
your new project, which should be of interest to our audience.

36
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,500
I think already is to some of our audience.

37
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
I think people are listening already.

38
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,260
Yeah, people are finding it.

39
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,380
The buzz of the town.

40
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,140
By that, I mean Main Street USA.

41
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,540
You walked so we could run.

42
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,420
We're merely standing on your shoulders.

43
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:54,700
The sister podcast hardly, hardly just gussied up a little bit more to disguise its same sort

44
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,020
of emotional stuntedness.

45
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,460
OK, well, well, yeah, indeed.

46
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,180
I mean, like I've listened to some of it and you definitely do.

47
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,660
Like, I mean, I've just the one that came out today is we're recording this.

48
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:14,420
I heard some like Disney adult conversation, some Disney adult like defining what that

49
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,900
means. And I feel like maybe you avoiding wanting to be to get that label as many people

50
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,100
do. Disney adult.

51
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,380
I feel like you were like defining yourself as more of a universal person.

52
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,660
True.

53
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,060
A pro of today's topic.

54
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,980
Yeah, I think I always was.

55
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,860
I went to Disney quite a bit as a kid.

56
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,900
And then, of course, I worked there and also universal.

57
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,100
But for my birthdays when it was my choice, it was Universal Studios, stunt shows, movies.

58
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,500
I was so into that.

59
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,420
My wife and I on the podcast, the podcast is just like an eight episode exploration of

60
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,100
what it's like to work at theme parks as a character, as a performer, the good, the bad,

61
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,780
you know, the the dishy, the gossipy, all that stuff.

62
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:01,340
But I I think I'm a little bit more cynical about it than she is.

63
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,020
It's in fact, it's very true.

64
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,380
We talked about this in the podcast.

65
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:10,140
It's no spoiler. And then once we factor our young daughter into it, that really complicates

66
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,700
things because that I see it through her eyes and it changes my perspective a bit.

67
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,340
And so there's a slight personal journey thread through this.

68
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,660
But most of it is interviews with people that have had interesting stories or experiences

69
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,220
at the theme park. Sure, sure.

70
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:32,620
And just like, well, is any cynicism that entered your perspective on it from working

71
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:38,220
there like did it like enhance Amanda's magic working in that world because she was like

72
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,180
part of the magical end of it as a as a princess.

73
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,340
Yeah. And you were doing I don't.

74
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,620
I don't want to say improv, improv shows at California Adventure are less magical than

75
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,420
being a princess.

76
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,180
You're already flattering it more than it's worth.

77
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,700
I think it did, but it wasn't the shows or much the interaction with guests.

78
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,020
It was more the workplace environment there and the kind of like for lack of a better

79
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,460
term, I use this with some hyperbole, but the cultish cultish aspect of working there

80
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,940
and the kind of like not that there was ever a fear of being drawn into that cult, but

81
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,900
the kind of way certain employees and a good number of them would look at you like, well,

82
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,100
why would you ever doubt this?

83
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,980
And why won't you use all this terminology that we have to use and, you know, cult speak

84
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,380
and stuff.

85
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,300
And so I both like loved it and and I don't hate it as a strong word.

86
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,900
It was just funny to navigate through it and kind of look, you know, just look at it from

87
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,700
an outsider's perspective, which a lot of people there don't do.

88
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:40,660
Yeah.

89
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:48,980
Well, and that you did it younger in your life and like not clearly with that not being the

90
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:54,020
end game because there's a lot of people in those worlds who like this is I like this,

91
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,140
I'm staying here.

92
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:00,340
And then you and that's more the type little start committing to the terminology.

93
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,060
Yes.

94
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,540
But that you were like, this is a this is a stop on the way to other things.

95
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,580
We talk about this for a full episode just on the Union performers in Keys of the Kingdom

96
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,620
called the professionals.

97
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,220
I don't know when this is coming out, but this will probably be out by the time this

98
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,380
episode comes out.

99
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,260
This is November 10th.

100
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,820
So yeah, you'll still be in the right like kind of in the middle.

101
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,980
That's the next episode as we record this and we talk to people, especially the Union

102
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:30,420
performers who it's a real kind of like blessing and a curse because I started doing

103
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:36,180
Union performing there in my 20s and was making close to $30 an hour in the early 2010s.

104
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,380
And I had disposable income I could save for a house.

105
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:39,780
Wow.

106
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,460
But then it's great.

107
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,780
And then but if you want to have a family and you want to live, I don't even mean wealthy,

108
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,060
but just comfortably, it really puts you on the borderline of is that going to happen?

109
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,900
And so certain AGVA Union employees, either you got to get out or you got to just knuckle

110
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,420
down and go, this is what life is.

111
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,460
And we speak to both versions of that, basically.

112
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,300
Me being the one that's like, I had to get out into podcast.

113
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,660
The most secure, the most universal.

114
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,220
That's great.

115
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:19,860
So to that universal and well, first of all, the last time you joined us, we talked about,

116
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,460
we did a double header of old school universal stunt show.

117
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:32,660
That was A-Team and Miami Vice, both the precursors to Water Worlds and then to the purge.

118
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,620
The purge show.

119
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,980
Dark Waters show.

120
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,020
I have not seen it.

121
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,420
Oh, no.

122
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,460
Do you know anything about it?

123
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,580
I know a little bit about it.

124
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:38,820
Yeah.

125
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,900
In fact, someone tipped me off that it was happening before it was announced.

126
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,420
I don't know where that gets me.

127
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,860
Other than to say, I would like to be known as the world's foremost

128
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,980
universal studios, theme parks, action, stunt, spectacular, enthusiast.

129
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,300
And an insider, I would say.

130
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:01,300
Oh, I mean, I can tell you that the Waterworld performers sit in a hot tub when they're not.

131
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,660
Really?

132
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,460
Oh, that's great.

133
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:03,700
Yeah.

134
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,940
That's big news on this show.

135
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,660
I've seen that firsthand when I worked there.

136
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,060
Yeah.

137
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,700
That's nuts.

138
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,980
Well, it's nice you can own these titles and say facts like that and get a lot of like,

139
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,140
wow, as opposed to if you said any of this on Conan Needs a Friend,

140
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,620
the mockery you would receive from 15 straight minutes.

141
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,580
I'd be pilloried.

142
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,620
But I'd still do it.

143
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,500
I'd still do it.

144
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,780
If it came up, I'd do it.

145
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,500
It's your role.

146
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:24,820
Yes.

147
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,740
You have to give the cat toys to play with, to bat around.

148
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,740
But yeah, so that's what we're attempting.

149
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,900
Here today is to cover kind of a double.

150
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,780
And I realize that you gave us with the shows that you wanted to talk about,

151
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:47,140
you gave us two of the most mealy-mouthed titles ever to exist.

152
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,620
OK, if we were to do the full titles in our episode title,

153
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,500
that is The Adventures of Conan, A Sword and Sorcery Spectacular,

154
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,780
and The Wild Wild Wild West Stunt Show.

155
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,300
Yeah, except it's The Wild West Stunt Show.

156
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,060
I don't mean to split hairs.

157
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,020
Oh, no.

158
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,140
We're all about splitting hairs.

159
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,740
OK, maybe this might be on me.

160
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,620
Maybe I didn't describe it.

161
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,420
I hope you didn't do a bunch of research on The Wild Wild West Stunt Show,

162
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,500
although we can certainly talk about that too.

163
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,460
Oh, love this.

164
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,900
Look, we are all about microtopic dissection.

165
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,540
And you know what?

166
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,420
Even Jason, knowing that this is what we're going to be talking about,

167
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,060
he seemed a little like, well, I do want to talk about The Wild Wild Wild West

168
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,340
because I saw that in Florida.

169
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:28,980
So you know what?

170
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,660
Actually, maybe you're too.

171
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,380
OK, perfect.

172
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,100
Maybe we'll come back.

173
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,660
Yeah, OK.

174
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,260
So we'll take some wilds out of there.

175
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,060
How many wilds?

176
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,740
Wait, you said two wilds.

177
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,300
Is there a three wilds?

178
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,260
Three is what I knew when I think when the show ended.

179
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,540
And you were saying one wild?

180
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,900
I can bust this out.

181
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,620
So the original stunt show there of all time

182
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,740
was called The Wild West Stunt Show, and it had different permutations.

183
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,860
But it existed for years.

184
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,860
It was the three-man cowboy stunt show, my favorite of all time.

185
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,580
Wow.

186
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,220
Just three.

187
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,260
That's pretty like, that's them doing it.

188
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,700
Because you're not relying on like a power trio.

189
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:10,500
It's a dreamlike, it's the rush of theme park action spectators.

190
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,780
Then they closed it down and opened what would become The Wild Wild Wild West

191
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,540
Stunt Show, but first they called it The Riot Act right in time for the LA riots

192
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,100
to hit, and then they had to change the name to The Wild Wild Wild West Stunt Show.

193
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,420
And then that's a stunt show that involved, I think, what, like five or six people,

194
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,980
many of whom I knew at the time.

195
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,780
And I don't know why I didn't work it to get in this thing,

196
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,220
but I think I thought myself too puny to be a stuntman.

197
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,500
Though there's like a comic relief role that's kind of, would have been up my alley.

198
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,700
Sure, but still requiring probably comfort with falls and crash pads.

199
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,100
Yeah, which I would have been excited to do,

200
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,660
but I just sold myself short and said like, there's no way that,

201
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,620
I think I thought I was too young to, and I probably was.

202
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,380
So you were still, you were working at Universal, you crossed over with,

203
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,740
before this thing closed, which was like 2002?

204
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,460
No, I worked at Universal Studios for one summer in 2011.

205
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:07,940
Oh, okay.

206
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,740
And Disney I worked at for like over a decade.

207
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,140
Oh, sure.

208
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,500
Most of the 2000s.

209
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
Okay, okay, okay.

210
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,980
So the thing was gone, you were just like, why did I not try before?

211
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,740
Yeah, and I still go to where that thing was performed,

212
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,380
specifically the original Wild West Stunt Show, which for a long time was like where they did

213
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,220
the Grinch Whoville thing.

214
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:27,700
Oh yeah.

215
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,340
And now is just like a, like at Horror Nights, it's just like an alcohol pavilion.

216
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,980
Yeah, there's just different booths and stuff.

217
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,540
Yeah, but I still stand there and go, the greatest stuntman of all time, comedian Bob

218
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,900
Rochelle once spit teeth out here day after day after day.

219
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,860
Wow, wow.

220
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,540
Okay, wait, so you've dropped the name because before we started recording,

221
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,340
you were alluding to somebody who had a big influence on you and their role in this show.

222
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,580
A disproportionate influence.

223
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,220
Wow, wow.

224
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,900
Bob Rochelle was, he was of the three people in this stunt show.

225
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,780
He's like the comic relief and like specifically.

226
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,780
So the other two are heels and straight men.

227
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,180
Right.

228
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:12,900
And he's like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck all rolled into one bright red tight curly hair,

229
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,740
kind of long beard often.

230
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,260
I don't know.

231
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,220
There's just something so Warner Brothers about his timing, his perfect timing.

232
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,620
And I don't know what it is because I saw these videos pop up during quarantine

233
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,100
and it just came on YouTube.

234
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,460
My algorithm was like this guy likes stunt show videos,

235
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,180
but I had never seen one from the old version before.

236
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,180
And it came up and I just like shivers went through my body going,

237
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,020
I know this guy.

238
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,500
I saw this guy so many times when I was a kid.

239
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,820
I went home and acted like him.

240
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,700
I put stunt shows on in my backyard for neighbors all based on him.

241
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,500
And then I realized this was the guy that inspired me to kind of want to perform or

242
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,860
do comedy and things like that.

243
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,020
I saw it and realized I didn't know you could make a living

244
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,700
spitting out fake teeth and falling in wells and getting whipped and do comedy.

245
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:06,660
Wow.

246
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,620
So it unlocked it.

247
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,700
You didn't like, he wasn't with you for decades.

248
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,180
No.

249
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,620
All of a sudden you're like, oh, whoa.

250
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,100
Yeah.

251
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,100
It was like, you know, when people have horrible revelations about something they've blocked out,

252
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,540
this was like the opposite of that.

253
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,020
Yeah.

254
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,300
Oh, wonderful.

255
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,820
Why have I been blocking this out?

256
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,900
Then I went into a deep rabbit hole of discovery on this guy thinking, should I look into this?

257
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,940
I mean, what performer in the early eighties in a theme park is like going to come out,

258
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:39,460
you know, smelling like roses, but he, he, he seems to have been, I can only get so far.

259
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,940
And I've talked about this on my, with Gorley and Russ podcast for so many episodes.

260
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,580
It's gross.

261
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:51,380
He turns out he was an extra in like the Presidio with Sean Connery, not even an extra.

262
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,620
He was, he had a small role and he did all these like really schlocky stunt and B movie

263
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,900
films.

264
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:03,140
One about the universal studios stunt team that goes out camping and comes across a drug gang

265
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,300
that they get into a life and death battle with Martin Landau's in that because his daughter's

266
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,540
in it.

267
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,500
And so he just does a couple of scenes as the ruler of the drug lords.

268
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,860
Wow.

269
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,980
And that's like an official branded universal movie or no,

270
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,300
no, they were able to just go shoot like early mornings on the set or something.

271
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,940
That's how I figured, no, it is a gorilla.

272
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,820
Wow.

273
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,900
It's like the escape from tomorrow.

274
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,380
Yeah.

275
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,420
Disney accepted probably like tacit permission as opposed to just pure gorilla.

276
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,700
And way to get production value though is to steal it.

277
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:35,860
Yeah.

278
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,140
That's where they make the real movies.

279
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:37,860
Yeah.

280
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:44,020
But I've been trying to find out what kind of guy he was because then he also died in 2008,

281
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,380
but he ended up moving to Vegas and I don't know if it was to perform.

282
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,340
He worked at a hotel.

283
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,620
Turns out I went to high school with his stepdaughter.

284
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,860
He lived in Whittier when I lived in Whittier and I am no closer to knowing

285
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,500
anything about the guy's personality.

286
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:04,100
This guy that I have now imagined in my brain is the single most responsible person for my

287
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,020
entire happiness in life and wellbeing.

288
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:06,980
Wow.

289
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,580
Which is maybe for the best because there's that don't meet your hero's thing.

290
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,380
If the influence is like what he was to you, the image of him,

291
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,260
and then maybe it's irrelevant if he was cool and nice or grizzled and weird.

292
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,380
I suppose so.

293
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,380
I don't know. I think you should look into it more.

294
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,140
I kind of am compelled.

295
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,100
I really am and I've reached out to people mostly who've posted these videos on YouTube.

296
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,820
You clearly had some access to these shows to have this tape.

297
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,780
What was this guy like?

298
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,140
And all I've ever gotten is he was great.

299
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,500
He was nice.

300
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:40,980
He was great.

301
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,260
That's a good knee jerk.

302
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,100
I'm now discovering what because one of the top Google results for Bob Rochelle's stuntman

303
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,060
is you and the Reddit with Coraline Rust.

304
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,620
And there's this post.

305
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,020
I don't know.

306
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,780
Maybe I'm breaking this to you.

307
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,540
I don't know if you've seen this, but all right.

308
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,420
I'm getting more and more sure that the saga of Bob Rochelle is going to end with Amanda

309
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,340
ripping off a Mission Impossible mask and revealing that she's been a grizzled old

310
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,700
stunt guy this whole time.

311
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,660
Oh, that's hot.

312
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,460
That's ironic.

313
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,820
Custom fan fiction for your marriage.

314
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:18,900
All right.

315
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,980
So this has been seeded then through if this is being discussed on Reddit.

316
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,460
Yeah.

317
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,740
Sometimes we'll ask a question on the show and then sometimes we'll never get it.

318
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,900
We'll ask a question like, does anybody know whatever?

319
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,220
And then we'll get a listener that'll say they know.

320
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,660
And then sometimes it's just crickets.

321
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:37,140
And then sometimes we'll get an email that's like eight paragraphs long explaining.

322
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,340
So let's cross our fingers that someone listening.

323
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:45,860
I had a bit of that happen to me where a guy was a skip tracer, like bounty hunter.

324
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,980
And he sent me civic and personal records.

325
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,900
I did not ask for these things.

326
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,180
And they were like 90, 100 pages of things.

327
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,780
And I still was no closer to understanding the man other than his credit history.

328
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,140
And it's like medical history.

329
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,380
Everything was above board.

330
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,620
Like he didn't have arrests or anything like that.

331
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,780
What was his average blood pressure?

332
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,100
Like, was he a calm guy?

333
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,180
I don't know whether it was during the show or not.

334
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,140
Oh, yeah, that's true.

335
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,180
We know his eye color.

336
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,300
Well, it seems like a nots guy too, which kind of that makes sense.

337
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,420
He was a train robber.

338
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:18,660
Big.

339
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,460
He was the first person ever to be hanged in the hanging.

340
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,660
The first ever hanging.

341
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,780
Oh, wow.

342
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,820
Originally a nots guy.

343
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,660
So people have done great work on my behalf where they've sent me archival footage that's not

344
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,900
for the public on the original nots stunt show, which is another stunt show I adored.

345
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,380
Sure.

346
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:35,700
Yeah.

347
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,500
And he was in that.

348
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,420
And he played multiple parts in that.

349
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:38,740
Wow.

350
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,220
OK.

351
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:39,780
Oh, gotcha.

352
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,580
Oh, interesting.

353
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,980
I mean, because those fit very well together.

354
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,580
And nots still has a western stunt show, correct?

355
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,780
I've not seen it.

356
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,260
I've been there and it has never been playing.

357
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,660
So I don't know if it is a seasonal thing.

358
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,180
Although the last time I saw it, it was rough.

359
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,820
Ah, sure.

360
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,860
That's the one over the road because it's right by what's the roller coaster called.

361
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,700
That's some of the roughness of it.

362
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,740
I forgot the name of the coaster.

363
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,900
Is it Jaguar that goes over there?

364
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,540
It's not Ghost Rider.

365
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,500
Or an inverted one.

366
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,780
It's the one I did.

367
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,660
We did it, yeah.

368
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,260
And I'm embarrassed to say I did it about four days ago and I can't remember the name of it.

369
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,020
It's not Montezuma's Revenge.

370
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,420
No.

371
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,060
No.

372
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,620
It's not.

373
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,660
It's kind of something that any coaster could be called.

374
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,460
I did a front row and my legs are dangling, which I don't like.

375
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,020
Oh, yeah.

376
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,380
And the whole thing freaked me out.

377
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,180
Yeah.

378
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,500
Yes.

379
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:24,980
Yeah.

380
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:31,220
That one, I have to admit, purely was like I think regularly that coaster would have freaked

381
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,580
me out and I wouldn't have done it.

382
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,820
I had had enough drinks at that nots event that like, let's go, we're going.

383
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,740
I remember I was like rounding up everybody.

384
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,860
No time to discuss.

385
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,500
It's happening.

386
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,020
And I kind of don't know if I would do it sober at 11 a.m.

387
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,260
Yeah.

388
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,180
No, I was shocked when you said it.

389
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:46,340
Yeah.

390
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,180
Well, I was so happy to be back also.

391
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,660
Have I ever said on the show how, or have I said many times somehow, that when it was

392
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,900
my first time back post pandemic and it was a thing we got invited to, so I was happy

393
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,020
about that and then some free drinks and I'm really happy about that.

394
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,020
And then I'm on the log ride.

395
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,740
I think solo.

396
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,860
I didn't make you guys listen to this.

397
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:11,460
But so I'm alone in a log rounding the corner and I just started yelling, I love nots.

398
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,100
Ah.

399
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,540
I love nots.

400
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,420
I like nots too.

401
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,620
It's such pure love in that moment.

402
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,180
That makes me happy.

403
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,980
Stand by it.

404
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,220
Yeah.

405
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,100
Being back.

406
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,580
Oh, boy.

407
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,860
That might have been the best.

408
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,940
Maybe that was better than returning to Disney.

409
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,500
I don't know.

410
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,460
Silver bullet.

411
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,020
Silver bullet.

412
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,820
Okay, yeah.

413
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,260
Anything could be called that, right?

414
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,620
And it's not like Western or Eastern.

415
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,180
No, it's not.

416
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,060
It's like yellow and it's like, why wouldn't it be just silver or something?

417
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,540
Yeah.

418
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,100
Good point.

419
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,180
They didn't even have to paint it probably if it was just steel.

420
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,300
Yeah, very true.

421
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,060
But that's funny.

422
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,100
I was thinking about that, about how that is, that, you know, the universal one went

423
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,020
away a while ago at this point, but that tradition is still there.

424
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:51,780
And I forgot the train robbers too, which is the reason I can't take my train crazy

425
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:57,140
son on the nots train because he, I think he would be pretty freaked out by the robbers.

426
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,700
Three and a half.

427
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,340
Yeah.

428
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:58,820
Yeah.

429
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,540
I got that.

430
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,060
Because he doesn't, he's not going to know the reality of that.

431
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,980
I don't think that's, it scared me.

432
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,620
I remember that.

433
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,660
I think, same deal.

434
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,860
My parents thought it was like a gentle little train ride like Disney.

435
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,860
Didn't know fake guns would be in play.

436
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,100
Yeah.

437
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,500
And they would fire the guns when I was a kid.

438
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,460
I don't know if they still do.

439
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,340
They weren't like super loud, but they would shoot blanks in their guns.

440
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,580
And those guys were all over that Calico square and I ate it up.

441
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,220
I loved it.

442
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,100
I'm sure I crossed paths with Bob Rochelle there as well.

443
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:31,620
I just probably, yeah, around you, uh, your whole life, your guardian angel.

444
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,340
I mean, we were spending time in the same city.

445
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,860
We're probably shopping at the same music plus for all of them.

446
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,180
Yes.

447
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:38,580
Yeah.

448
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,500
So he was like, oh, we want Kenobi.

449
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,060
Yes.

450
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,460
Yes.

451
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,780
Oh, Mike, I can't,

452
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,940
he made me so happy.

453
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,740
He was, he was just, yeah.

454
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,020
The revelation is going to be greater than you ever imagined.

455
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,260
Yeah.

456
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,860
Cause he died in 2008.

457
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,900
It could have been struck down by some kind of stunt lord that, you know, was like a rival stunt lord.

458
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,660
That's a common way for them to go.

459
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,820
So yeah, it makes sense.

460
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,700
And there's never been any like hinting that your parents aren't your real parents, right?

461
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,620
Oh my God.

462
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,660
Here it is.

463
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,780
You're putting it all together.

464
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,780
I look just like my dad and I don't have tightly curled red hair.

465
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,100
Okay.

466
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,140
But yes.

467
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,460
And you have all of your teeth.

468
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,700
You haven't spit any out while we've been recording.

469
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,700
Well, that's, that's magical.

470
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:31,780
Bob Rochelle, this, this whole story, this whole, so yeah, that, I mean, well, this is great, Jason.

471
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,260
We will save Wild West and the Florida iteration for Jason.

472
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,740
So save for you, but we can talk a little about, yeah, this was like a fixture.

473
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,700
I think it seems to me like, uh, uh, I get foggy on the, on the tour history.

474
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,900
And I think they were always doing little tours at the studio, even in like silent movie days.

475
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:57,860
But I think the tour, as we know it with trams and the stops and little shows, it seems like 1964

476
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,460
was kind of the advent of it.

477
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,420
And I think from then there was this, the, I guess the, the three person show,

478
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:09,540
I think it might've happened like on the backlot somewhere without seating.

479
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:16,100
And then it ended up where the universal amphitheater ended up and in the same

480
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,580
configuration where it's kind of like a little half dome and terrorist.

481
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,220
And then they, so the amphitheater grew out of that.

482
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,300
So I think, I think that's correct.

483
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,820
So you got that like sweeping view of, uh, of Burbank and such.

484
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:33,220
Pictures of it are amazing because it didn't have as much of a, like, uh,

485
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,020
amphitheater wall thing that it did eventually.

486
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,940
So you would see that Vista behind it.

487
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,140
That was incredible.

488
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,780
Just killer.

489
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,300
It makes that to this day, it makes that kind of like nothing.

490
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,020
Harry Potter coaster.

491
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,580
What's that called?

492
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,380
Flight of the hippogriff?

493
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:47,860
Hippogriff.

494
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,100
Yeah.

495
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:56,100
Um, like that, that is really like enhanced by the first, or that all the drops look like they are

496
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,660
2000 feet drops because you're up on top of the hill.

497
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,060
Oh, right.

498
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,460
Yeah.

499
00:22:59,460 --> 00:22:59,700
Yeah.

500
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:07,060
It's a cool thing about the property, but yeah, um, that was, it was consulted on when it opened,

501
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,020
I guess by, or maybe at some point by Hal Needham.

502
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,380
I didn't know that.

503
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:11,620
Really?

504
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:11,780
Yeah.

505
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,940
I thought, wait, you, yeah, you mentioned his name before we started recording.

506
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,780
I think he did somehow contribute.

507
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,500
Oh my God.

508
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,860
This is making it even more precious for me because I'm a huge, how I'll need him filmography.

509
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,260
Wow.

510
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,740
Wow.

511
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,540
Which is okay.

512
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,860
So smoking the bandit and cannonball runs and all the, it was like, he's, he's, uh,

513
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,900
but Reynolds biggest.

514
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,140
Yeah.

515
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,660
And also mega force and Hooper, which is about,

516
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,180
yes.

517
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:34,740
Yeah.

518
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,100
Adam Weston Hooper.

519
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,420
Correct.

520
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,940
He does have a small part.

521
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,100
Yeah.

522
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,580
He's, he's who Burt Reynolds is doubling for.

523
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,620
Is a stunt man for.

524
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:41,940
Yeah.

525
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,580
Right.

526
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:42,820
Yeah.

527
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,260
Yeah.

528
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:49,780
Wait, and, and the movie, I realized I said his name in the context of the film rad at

529
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,020
one point in time, which I've never seen.

530
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,300
I think, yeah, I think he directed it.

531
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:53,780
Did he?

532
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,340
I believe so.

533
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:54,660
Oh my God.

534
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,660
This like motocross.

535
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:56,900
Yeah.

536
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,380
I remember it.

537
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:03,620
Movie with Talia Shire and sparks in it or the song is in it or something.

538
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,100
Cause when you think motocross, you think Talia Shire.

539
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,460
And she's not a mom in that, right?

540
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,100
She's just the like most competing BMX biker.

541
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,340
Maybe.

542
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:12,900
Yeah, maybe.

543
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,220
No, no way.

544
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,180
I don't know the content of rad.

545
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,380
They should see it.

546
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,100
I love the name.

547
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,540
I was going to say that's your favorite word.

548
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,180
Yeah, yeah, yes.

549
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,680
Yeah.

550
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,460
Named a character rad on the show.

551
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,700
Uh, um, they're also in looking up how need them.

552
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,780
There was like a, there was a toy you could get.

553
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,220
I've seen the Western movie stunt set.

554
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,100
It's incredible.

555
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,580
Wow.

556
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:32,900
Wow.

557
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,900
Have you seen it in person or just like listings for it?

558
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,300
No, I've just seen Instagram postings and I've grabbed the picture of it.

559
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,180
It's a, it's amazing.

560
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,260
It's like a saloon set where they can, you can bust through windows and do high falls

561
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:44,900
and stuff.

562
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,020
This is what I was doing with my GI Joe's.

563
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,980
I would build sets.

564
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,540
Oh yeah.

565
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,260
Yeah.

566
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,740
Miami vice set and built little like fire contraptions that you could press a button.

567
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,340
So they'd like fall in this little shack and then the roof would go like, like that.

568
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:58,820
And wow.

569
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,380
Really?

570
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,340
So into stunt shows.

571
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,180
You would break falls for your carry.

572
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,740
You wouldn't even make them go through like a horrible event.

573
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,620
No, I would have little mattresses in there and stuff like that.

574
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,660
It was like, I was playing stunt show, not now.

575
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,180
Not actual fighting.

576
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,980
Wow.

577
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:19,700
I love this, like, this like major within theme, the, the university of theme park interest.

578
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,620
This is like a, such a specific cool like lane that you have.

579
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,100
Pathetic.

580
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,860
We like, this is the audience for it.

581
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:34,100
But what do you, wait, what, and then what were your like backyard shows like?

582
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,500
Oh, I did two that I remember.

583
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,700
And the first one was because I had no experience putting on a show or understanding how to do

584
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,020
that.

585
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,100
I just had Bob Rochelle in my mind.

586
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,620
I didn't remember what his name was.

587
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:52,660
So I called myself stinky stew and I was him and I got my neighbors, Kelly and Christy

588
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,220
Grenager, Mike Reagan and Jeff Carson.

589
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:03,060
And we just, I, I remember us having rehearsals, but when action was called, everything went

590
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,620
haywire.

591
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,580
And there was like a sandbox.

592
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,900
You could jump in from off a big tall bench.

593
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,340
That was like the high fall.

594
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:15,780
And I made something called the paper punch, which was, I had an old knockoff lightsaber

595
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,580
and a little bar taped like an L frame.

596
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,580
And I just put notebook paper that was about like three by two feet.

597
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,580
So you could bust through it, you know?

598
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,380
Wow.

599
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,340
That didn't work.

600
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,140
It all fell apart.

601
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,100
And I remember being a little depressed that it didn't go over well.

602
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:35,380
So the second one we scripted and worked harder on, had some comedy beats and stuff.

603
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,780
And that would be something I'd be comfortable showing today.

604
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,460
Where the first one, you know, I don't want to talk about it.

605
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:41,700
Sure.

606
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,340
Was there anything very dangerous or mildly dangerous you were doing or no?

607
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:51,620
Well, not for those, but then that led me to doing two fairly dangerous things.

608
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,420
When my mom would leave, I would pull my twin mattress out in the backyard and we had a

609
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,940
detached garage and I would jump off my garage onto the mattress.

610
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,820
As a high fall.

611
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,020
And just a twin.

612
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,580
I know.

613
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,060
Yeah.

614
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,580
That's really precise.

615
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:04,820
Yeah.

616
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,180
Would you do the like the fall?

617
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,780
No, I'd fall on my stomach.

618
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,140
I was too afraid, I think, to do that.

619
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,100
Like a belly flop.

620
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,660
Yeah.

621
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,300
Okay.

622
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:17,620
And then I spent a good amount of time figuring out how to do electronic squibs, blood packs.

623
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,100
Oh, wow.

624
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,900
And I've told the story before, but I figured it out the day of my eighth grade graduation

625
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,740
dance, which I then didn't go to because I was like, I figured it out.

626
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,220
I'm going to stay home and burst squibs all day.

627
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,020
I guess.

628
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,820
I didn't go to prom.

629
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,660
I was going to say skipped, but there was more.

630
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,180
I asked somebody and didn't work out.

631
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:42,500
But I ended up, senior prom night, me and a friend blew up a building for a movie that

632
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,460
never got finished.

633
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:43,860
Oh.

634
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,740
That's how I spent.

635
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,580
It felt like a good like mad, like fuck all that.

636
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,100
Fuck the mainstream.

637
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,020
I'm going to blow up a building instead.

638
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,660
It was fun.

639
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,020
I think I did have more fun probably.

640
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,060
I bet you did.

641
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,980
On that note, how many, because I probably started and stopped so many films that never

642
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,940
got made or animations and things that like, yeah, that was just a career path.

643
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,060
Well, and also it's not a good strategy to like start with.

644
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,740
OK, so we have the explosion.

645
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,540
Now what is the rest of the idea of what it is?

646
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,100
That's me exactly.

647
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,600
Yeah.

648
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:13,460
100%.

649
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,740
It starts with the story.

650
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,260
This is what we know today.

651
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,900
Yeah, of course.

652
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,620
That is honestly how they start most Marvel movies.

653
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,100
That's true.

654
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,340
I think it is.

655
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,380
We know we want to blow up a cool building and then like what else happens?

656
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:28,340
Yeah, and pre-vis is are worked out a year before the actual director signed on.

657
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:28,580
100%.

658
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,980
Bob Rochelle got the name check, but I'd like to name check one that I said before

659
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:40,260
we started recording, which is a longtime guy there at Universal, Lance Rimmer.

660
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,460
Yeah, and he has quite a pivotal history in the stunt show.

661
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,340
Do you know about this?

662
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:44,900
I don't think I do.

663
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,700
I just saw him interviewed and was like, that's the coolest name ever.

664
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,580
And he's a cool dude.

665
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,820
He's got like an Eastwood quality to him.

666
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,300
Oh, sure.

667
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,220
Yeah, he's the guy I'm thinking of.

668
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,020
Is that Lance Rimmer?

669
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,020
I think is he the one that like had kind of piercing blue eyes,

670
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,900
no facial hair.

671
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,900
Is it that guy?

672
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,380
You know what?

673
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,700
I wish I could tell you, but I was just staring at the lower third with his name.

674
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,500
I think that's it.

675
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,860
That's what was piercing to me.

676
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,180
So I may not have like looked the man in his eyes.

677
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,540
I can't expect you people to have gone as pathetically deep as I have.

678
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:21,620
As I understand the story, this three person show existed in like the Universal

679
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,740
amphitheater space and whatever.

680
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:29,220
And then Lance Rimmer was kind of either brought in and he was an actual maybe film stuntman

681
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,100
or something.

682
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:36,260
And he said, let me retool this a little bit and add an actual script and comedy.

683
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,740
And the guy that was kind of the head of it before was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are

684
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,460
you doing here?

685
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,260
This is a stunt.

686
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,340
Oh, it's more of a like actual breaking the fourth wall stunt demonstration prior to that.

687
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,300
Oh, yeah.

688
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:47,860
Yeah.

689
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,540
And he said, let me put in the story.

690
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,940
And the guy got really pissed.

691
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:57,700
And then I think Universal said, let's run them, like give them each three week runs

692
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,980
and see how they did.

693
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:04,420
And then the one with the comedy in the story far exceeded the others in terms of reception.

694
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:04,740
Wow.

695
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,220
Wow.

696
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:05,460
Yeah.

697
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:05,780
Yeah.

698
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:06,580
Yeah.

699
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:11,940
I saw some compressed version of that in a video and I forget the maybe theme park express

700
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,740
was the source of it.

701
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:20,100
But the Jay Stein was the Universal Executive who's considered like the guy who got the

702
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,500
modern tour off the ground in the park that we know.

703
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,820
And he was the one who like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

704
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:30,340
And I say that because that factors into the other show and the same dynamic is at play,

705
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:35,460
which I guess it's there's something about the DNA of Universal where they, I think they

706
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:40,820
had a hard time and still do sometimes have our time moving on from, no, what we are is

707
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,260
you're on the set of something and you are learning about the making of something.

708
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,580
It's the arc of almost everything at Universal.

709
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:46,820
Yeah.

710
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,980
That's where it starts where it's like, we're going to explain it to you.

711
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,940
And then they're like, but actually people want to be in it.

712
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,140
They want to pretend it's real.

713
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,860
They don't want to know.

714
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,380
And just for stuff to happen instead of like, we need three volunteers.

715
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,780
Okay.

716
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,060
Now this is a facade.

717
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,820
And we've talked about that with the last time I was here that both, I think the team

718
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,980
and Miami Vice and even Waterworld have that kind of like cut element to it.

719
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,300
Yes.

720
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:07,700
Yes.

721
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:07,940
Yeah.

722
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,540
Directors spectacular.

723
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,540
Here we throwing the John Wayne punch instead.

724
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,140
I guess Waterworld doesn't quite do that, but they're still breaking the fourth wall.

725
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,260
But there was a stage manager role in the Miami Vice when we come out in a polo and slacks.

726
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:22,500
Yeah.

727
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:22,900
Yeah.

728
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:27,540
There were so many, I feel like when Universal Florida opened up, there must've been like

729
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,180
11 shows with cut, cut, cut.

730
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,140
I'm the director here at that was like every single thing.

731
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,060
Six flat, like the Six Flags Batman show I saw when I was little was the same thing.

732
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,540
That's right.

733
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,220
And there was a fake plant in the audience.

734
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:44,340
He like jumped from the audience onto the like the set itself, which

735
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,100
I thought was real time.

736
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,220
Of course is not real.

737
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:52,580
All I remember about that was that they had clearly purchased the helicopter from Miami Vice.

738
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,220
For that.

739
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:01,140
And then the Indiana Jones show has a kind of like stage director, like first assistant AD.

740
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,260
Oh yeah.

741
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:08,260
That's entirely like filming scenes from the films that have been out since the early 80s.

742
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,260
We're doing the Boulder scene.

743
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,380
Which makes less sense than just like you go and watch a show.

744
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,100
I know.

745
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,380
Seen a play before.

746
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,060
Knott's I think was the first big cowboy stunt show and they don't do that.

747
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,620
They're presentational and they're doing a stunt demonstration, but then a story takes over.

748
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:28,340
They bring in the Beaumont bear from Hollywood is the big Hollywood stunt man to come teach

749
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,860
these berry pickers how to do it.

750
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,380
And they have a plant in the audience too.

751
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,220
It got to the point where every time when I was a kid, I'd look for the guy in the Hawaiian shirt

752
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,020
sitting with a woman and they're on their honeymoon.

753
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,940
Where do you work?

754
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,180
I don't want to say, come on Disney World.

755
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:42,740
Oh no.

756
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:44,900
I'm going to punch you.

757
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,100
Wait, I just had a taco.

758
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,460
All tourists wear Hawaiian shirts.

759
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,180
I guess I do typically wear Hawaiian shirts.

760
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,740
I think the audience thinks I only wear Hawaiian shirts because I post pictures from theme parks

761
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,820
where I exclusively wear Hawaiian shirts.

762
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,540
I guess you have my-

763
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,460
Accidentally gone up because I think you're the plant.

764
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:02,980
You there.

765
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,860
That show was actually really good and I don't think there's any online

766
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:14,500
video of the original three person show at knots because the plant played it straight for quite

767
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,900
a while and you actually really think he's a plant.

768
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,940
And then he's the one that gets shot by a shotgun and does the high fall right at the end.

769
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,660
And that's the only time you really realize, especially as a kid.

770
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,100
It's good.

771
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,420
Yeah.

772
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:24,740
Wow.

773
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,060
Wow.

774
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,260
I can send you links.

775
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,060
Yeah, yeah, please.

776
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,300
Yes.

777
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,100
Well, and it'll be good research for when we do these, the micro topic of the other,

778
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,180
the split off the wild, wild, wild.

779
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,180
Anything else to say about this?

780
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:41,860
Because thematically, I think there's a lot of things that tie into the evolution of the

781
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:47,300
Conan the Barbarian show, but anything else Wild West story?

782
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:47,780
It's weird.

783
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:53,860
There were certain tropes in Wild West stunt shows that I have to believe maybe started with

784
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:58,340
knots because I don't know if there was, I'm sure there were other stunt shows prior or

785
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,020
concurrent to that, but that was the big one.

786
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:06,020
The one thing that I keep seeing repeated was axe handle fights and they have the same

787
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,700
choreography where it's not an axe.

788
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,380
It's just like an axe handle.

789
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,500
They do it in the Wild West.

790
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:10,900
Don't show.

791
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,100
They did it at the not stunt show.

792
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:17,780
There was like a Marine world stunt show up North that had a Wild West stunt show in it.

793
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,860
Oh, Marine world, Africa, USA.

794
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,580
I think that's it.

795
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:20,900
Yeah.

796
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,420
Zarely named park up North.

797
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:29,540
And it had a, a Western stunt show, but honest, like really cheap saloon set.

798
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,540
I want to say maybe there was an orangutan in it.

799
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,580
Oh, I hope.

800
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:37,860
And it has some like actors that went on to do like actual legit.

801
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,660
I think the guy, one of the guys who played Jason Voorhees was in it.

802
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:46,020
Maybe I can't remember, but they would do this bit where they would hit axe handles together

803
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,860
and they would like lock the axe handles and they do it like back and forth pushing.

804
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,540
And then one of them would step away and take a breath, like very bugs bunny, daffy duck.

805
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:58,660
While the other person kept going, and it just killed with the audience.

806
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,380
And then spitting teeth into a spittoon was a big one.

807
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,660
Just a mouthful.

808
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,580
And Bob Rochelle, if you watched any of his videos on YouTube and the stunt show,

809
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,860
he's the best because he just, his timing on how to like when to release a few and when to release,

810
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,940
you know, dozens of them.

811
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,980
Oh yeah.

812
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,540
Yeah.

813
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,020
So he would like vomit teeth that one time you do one and then he would do like a puke.

814
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:20,820
Yeah.

815
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,220
And then, and then somehow continue on.

816
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,060
Was he holding it in his mouth the whole time?

817
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:32,500
No, well see he has this bit where he and his, the tough guy that he's kind of sidekick to

818
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,020
come out of a saloon and the tough guy comes out and slams the slum door back in his face.

819
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:41,140
So he's put them in immediately before that, but then he just kind of hobbles over and just,

820
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:47,060
it's just like perfection how he drizzles them out because you know, even if you don't do that

821
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:52,260
well, it's going to be get a laugh, but he gets like four or five at different times.

822
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,700
Oh, he like, he's able to extend out the bit via timing.

823
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,740
And then I would imagine there's a good, just like there's a ton and then you think it's done

824
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,820
and then beat and the one more.

825
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,140
Yeah.

826
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,220
Or maybe a couple of those.

827
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:05,940
Sure.

828
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,900
I just love how similar some of this stuff is to, cause I love pro wrestling and one of the big

829
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,060
things you do in pro wrestling is you, you just have gum in your mouth the whole time until like

830
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:19,700
you take a big kick, like maybe later in the match and you spit the gum out and if it's white,

831
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,700
it looks like you lost a tooth.

832
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,020
Yeah.

833
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,940
And then so it's like a big, like you really want to sell the impact of something.

834
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,660
That's what you do.

835
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:27,940
Yeah.

836
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:33,780
I love like there's all like all those same like carny tricks and stuff where when you cut yourself,

837
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:38,180
there's wrestlers that spray mist at each other and they have to like go under the ring and you

838
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,300
don't see them do it.

839
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,140
They are kind of carny tricks in a way.

840
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:41,540
Yeah.

841
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,940
Yes. And stunt men and professional wrestlers in my experience, there's a lot of similarities,

842
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,900
mostly because they'll take abuse, but still I love all the tricks.

843
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:57,620
There's a, there's a thing he does where he gets whipped and, and uh, scream.

844
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,060
Can I play it?

845
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,620
I almost have.

846
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,420
Yeah, of course.

847
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,300
Cause it's just, I don't know.

848
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,220
There's something I, no one's ever going to find this as funny as I truly do, but there's

849
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,260
something about the timing of it that is.

850
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,620
I like, like, you know, we haven't, we've never done an episode on them, but like you're hearing

851
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:18,580
like Wally Bogue, who was the guy who was at the golden horseshoe and like Steve Martin was very

852
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,380
influenced by him.

853
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:19,540
Right.

854
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,460
He was just a legendary Disneyland guy.

855
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:27,860
And like, I like hearing about these like legends that were not widely publicized essentially.

856
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,260
Yeah.

857
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:34,020
But in that, in some, in the like pre internet times, somebody who, who go, who you go to see

858
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,980
and who performs in front of lots of audiences every day looms pretty large.

859
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,460
Yeah.

860
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:45,700
And like, and also for a Steve Martin then where like there's no standup clubs exactly,

861
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:51,620
like you're maybe a standup in some cabaret, like general show that you could, so there aren't

862
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:55,780
like a lot of standups to go be influenced by.

863
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:02,180
So to him, like I drive, like I go up to Hannaheim and see this guy just demolish and be silly.

864
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,380
And it makes a lot of sense.

865
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,980
I don't know if this is more visual than audio, but you should be able to hear.

866
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,660
He gets whipped and then it's his response.

867
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:24,980
Oh, that works.

868
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,380
I know.

869
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:31,140
And his physicality, part of it is very, you know, kind of seventies campy on the edge of like,

870
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,420
I don't know about this, you know, it wouldn't fly today for sure.

871
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,620
But I think it's more innocent than all that, you know?

872
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,260
Sure. Sure.

873
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,380
Well, that's, you talk about playing to the rafters, what all this is.

874
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,860
And that worked off of a phone.

875
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,100
Yeah.

876
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,900
Onto a microphone that we weren't even looking at.

877
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,860
Like, oh yeah, that timing's funny regardless.

878
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,260
That's awesome.

879
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,620
Love learning about Bob.

880
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:59,940
And yeah, I don't know that this is like a whole, like it is more of a tent pole of theme park

881
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:05,780
worlds than you realize the Western stunt show and that they all have some of the same stuff.

882
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:11,460
And you usually probably got some like dynamite is thrown into a well and then either it's water

883
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,820
or it's like confetti.

884
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,660
The modern day theme park is built off of the Wild West.

885
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,060
I know.

886
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:21,860
That's just like the ground for almost everything that was laid upon.

887
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,460
And this one had quicksand in it too.

888
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,100
It had a quicksand.

889
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,380
Oh, that's fun.

890
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,740
Just another obsession of mine as a kid that I need to go into.

891
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:34,740
When you guys are really hurting for topics, we'll do quicksand at theme parks.

892
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,060
Wow.

893
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,420
Because I think this may be the only.

894
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:42,180
Wait, what is another, don't give it away, but what is another iteration of quicksand?

895
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:43,780
Single one.

896
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,860
Is there nothing at Disney like even in like.

897
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,700
Was there ever some.

898
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,260
A sign.

899
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,380
Indiana Jones or anything.

900
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:56,980
Yeah, like on big thunder or even the jungle cruise of like danger quicksand or there's not.

901
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,260
Yeah, I don't know.

902
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,660
Or like the old mine train through nature's wonderland.

903
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,060
I don't know.

904
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:01,940
I don't know.

905
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,300
Not off the top of my head.

906
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:03,940
Somewhere.

907
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:08,820
There's also something my, let me shout out a kind of local one, not local to here,

908
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,340
but like a regional one.

909
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:15,620
I remember going to a place called old Tucson in Arizona when I was a kid that my mom talks

910
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:20,260
about a lot still, because I must've been really lit up there that I think was a like

911
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:24,580
behind the scenes of movies thing, despite being in Tucson and it's behind the scenes

912
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,660
of Westerns, despite it's the nineties and nobody makes Westerns anymore.

913
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,220
But I think that thing's still kicking.

914
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:31,540
Really?

915
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,340
I had some of it.

916
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,580
So there maybe there's somewhere else that had a quicksand component or at least some

917
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,580
of these other things that we're talking about.

918
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:38,820
Yeah.

919
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,780
Looking old Tucson.

920
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,460
I feel like I actually do remember something on the old eighties tour.

921
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,740
Oh man.

922
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:51,620
Like right when you get on the tour around the lagoon area where they had filmed, like

923
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:55,620
they'll tell you like Killigan's Island and McHale's Navy that.

924
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,580
You're like what did they film there?

925
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,180
One establishing shot.

926
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,620
I don't know.

927
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:02,980
Yeah.

928
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,820
You know what's an old school tour thing that I love is just all the, I think it's

929
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,260
what became the battle of Galactica.

930
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:10,980
Battlestar Galactica.

931
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,220
Yeah.

932
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:11,780
Yeah.

933
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:16,020
And what probably now is where the Bad to the Future Simpsons ride is.

934
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,980
But it was just like you just go by a hill basically and I think they just release a

935
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,180
bunch of boulders and would just fall down the actual hill.

936
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:24,660
That sounds great.

937
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,260
Getting caught right before they hit you.

938
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:26,820
Yeah.

939
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,300
That whole tour originally started off was just so much random stuff, a burning house.

940
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:36,740
Then when they put the Battlestar Galactica thing in, I remember there was also a Battlestar

941
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:40,260
Galactica like Cylon shooting a flame throughout the house which they added.

942
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:45,220
Then they added Hannibal Animatronic in a Jeep flame throwing the house from A-Team.

943
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,660
Oh really?

944
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,060
It was.

945
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,060
Wait at the same time or it was replaced?

946
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,860
It replaced it.

947
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,140
Because that would be great if they were teaming up.

948
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,020
Hannibal and a Cylon.

949
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,180
Well it's the kind of odd team up that.

950
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,780
That is how Universal does it.

951
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,020
Yes which we can get into with this other.

952
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:05,860
Well yeah let's talk a little, let me really pronounce, I'd be correct to say Konan.

953
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,100
Yeah.

954
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:10,420
The Barbarian to separate from your current collaborator.

955
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:16,500
It took me a real time to go from Konan to Conan and now I can't go backwards.

956
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:16,980
Yes yeah.

957
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,620
Two dominant phases of my life.

958
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,260
Yeah right.

959
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,660
Yeah.

960
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,820
Yes yeah what looped largest in your childhood.

961
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:26,980
Yeah and then Schwarzenegger was recently on Conan's podcast.

962
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,620
Oh yeah right.

963
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:31,060
Conan and Conan and all of our heads were spinning.

964
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,900
We didn't know, none of us knew what to do.

965
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,340
What did he, what did he call Conan O'Brien?

966
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,060
Oh good question.

967
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,460
Because I feel like his regular accent.

968
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,020
I heard that.

969
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,620
Would lead to Conan.

970
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,740
I think he said Conan.

971
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,820
He did say Conan but I actually think because with the German you'd say like Conan here but

972
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,700
you go Conan.

973
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,060
Conan yeah yeah yeah.

974
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,020
It was just on co.

975
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,380
Austrian yeah.

976
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,700
I'm not entirely sure but I think he got it right.

977
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,420
Yeah yeah.

978
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:59,780
Credit to Conan O'Brien for taking over the name pop culture.

979
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,420
I know.

980
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,580
There was probably a while there where still he's having television success but he's not

981
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,660
the primary pop cultural Conan.

982
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:10,340
Yeah my mom still refers to him as Conan.

983
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,060
As Conan.

984
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:15,620
And I think we talked about this on the show that he had finally eclipsed Conan the barbarian but

985
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:23,300
the singer Conan Gray was getting more Google results than he was and like were we in like

986
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,620
are we on the cusp of a third Conan?

987
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,660
Oh no.

988
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,100
Well there was the scare of Detective Conan the anime.

989
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,780
Oh yeah.

990
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,820
Am I right in that?

991
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,460
I think so.

992
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:33,940
Yeah yeah.

993
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,380
So maybe internationally that has taken over but.

994
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:43,060
Conan Nolan was like a reporter for a while too but that never.

995
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,740
So whatever market he was in he might have usurped him.

996
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,860
But Conan the Barbarian.

997
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:52,740
Conan the Barbarian a sword and sorcery spectacular.

998
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,620
This thing was amazing.

999
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,500
What a name.

1000
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:00,340
Yeah absolutely and I was so glad you brought this up because nobody has and I can't imagine

1001
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,300
you got to do it Mike but it was definitely it was still there.

1002
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,020
This ran from 83 to 94.

1003
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,380
It ran in 94?

1004
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:13,940
Yeah yeah so I got to see it as a kid and it like it left a huge impact on me like because

1005
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:20,500
that's one of those like I had a really formative one for my birthday when I was seven which

1006
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:25,860
would have been in there and to be that close not to give it away but to be that close to

1007
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:30,980
a big fire breathing dragon and to have done Disneyland and like Disneyland's nice but

1008
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:34,740
it's gentle and like oh Universal is a whole other ball game.

1009
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,060
Yeah.

1010
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,020
It's dangerous here.

1011
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,780
It's gonna send you right into puberty.

1012
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,460
What you need for the transition.

1013
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,860
Mike do you watch this and like oh god if only I could have.

1014
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,660
Could have become a man watching it.

1015
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,540
Yeah yeah yeah.

1016
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,860
I've been less stunted today.

1017
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,180
Yeah I like all this stuff.

1018
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,860
I was not a Conan kid.

1019
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,940
I wasn't either actually yeah.

1020
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,660
Yeah me and I've never seen either film still.

1021
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,860
So yes I should I probably right either good right.

1022
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:07,700
Yeah I haven't seen them in years either it was more just like same thing with Waterworld

1023
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,500
and even Miami Vice but once they were stunt shows it was like I'm in you know.

1024
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,020
Yeah yeah it does not matter yeah.

1025
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,940
Yeah yeah and well some of the stunt shows is like the perfect that's the best version

1026
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:18,740
of the IP.

1027
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:22,420
Yeah yeah yes because it's live in person in your face.

1028
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:25,780
But it's all yeah this is very it's like watching it you're like

1029
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,100
this is all like the nonsense that I like.

1030
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:34,980
Like people are so true jacked people and dragons and fire and just a guy talking like this

1031
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,020
and all of that.

1032
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,580
So yeah I think I would have been pretty into it.

1033
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,500
I would also have been very scared watching it.

1034
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,380
Yeah I definitely was.

1035
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,220
I'm sure was happening yeah.

1036
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,180
Yeah what you can't get from watching it on YouTube though is

1037
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:52,820
the first of all you enter through what used to be the it's the facade of a giant castle

1038
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:58,340
because it was a Dracula's show comedy kind of like special effects show and they're prior to this.

1039
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:05,380
Yeah but what you don't get is the damp smell because there's like a water rain curtain that

1040
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:11,780
was amazing so the whole thing when you're sitting down there's a steady rain that's happening

1041
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,620
that's like opaque and you can't see through it and then when the show begins

1042
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,140
that part's like a curtain.

1043
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:17,700
Oh wow.

1044
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,060
They turn it off in succession so it just opens from the center

1045
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:25,380
and so there's like that wonderful theme park water smell like you know from

1046
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,140
Splash Mountain or the log ride.

1047
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,100
Or very ET.

1048
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:34,660
I feel like yeah I got you're like unlocking that obviously so because the universal had

1049
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:40,820
ET and then City Walk used to have this like rainforest store that had the same smell and

1050
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:44,260
water everywhere and mustyness and I didn't realize this too.

1051
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:44,500
Yeah.

1052
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,300
It's all over there.

1053
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:50,260
And you're sitting on and this was the same for all the stunt shows to this day even Water World

1054
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:58,340
these kind of like ridged aluminum benches that have a sound and a feel and you know.

1055
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,100
And yeah like the Animal Actors benches.

1056
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:00,340
Yeah.

1057
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,620
Like yeah just regular you're seeing a little kids baseball game.

1058
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:03,940
Yes.

1059
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:04,580
Or no you're on.

1060
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,300
Like bleachers.

1061
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:11,460
Yeah exactly yeah and there's you know there's wonderful stereophonic sound that you don't get

1062
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:17,220
anywhere else even in the movie it was never quite this clear and there's lasers already

1063
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:21,540
happening because lasers are so big in the 80s and lasers factor pretty heavily in this show.

1064
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:28,020
And like there's a lot of we'll discover as we talk about it I think there's a lot of

1065
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:36,100
theme park first certainly universal firsts but I like just doing a big recent property I think

1066
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:42,980
was a big deal at the time and kind of not exactly what they did and thus that involved

1067
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:47,220
a custom score by Basil Polidorus.

1068
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,500
Oh yeah who did the movie.

1069
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,460
Yes yeah and Robocop.

1070
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,500
Yeah the music is awesome in this.

1071
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:55,780
Yeah Robocop too so like that's pretty I don't think that had been done that like you get the

1072
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,660
actual people who did the movie to do this.

1073
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,100
And there's a big sense of anticipation I should have mentioned this with the Wild West Stunt

1074
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:07,700
Show too that there's always some kind of pre-show entertainment and in the Cowboy one

1075
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:12,900
it was a guy named Samir Kamun who's still alive and he would do Charlie Chaplin bits.

1076
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:13,620
Oh yeah.

1077
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,500
And I'm trying to remember what the Conan one was.

1078
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,740
Yeah I don't know yeah some like there's usually yeah some like goofy MP guy.

1079
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,420
There's like a gestury type guy.

1080
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:23,620
Was it?

1081
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:27,940
Yeah I mean there's a video I saw of it I'm not sure exactly where the main show starts and

1082
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:32,500
maybe that was actually part of the main show but there's like a gestury kind of guy who's

1083
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,220
like kind of goofing around a little bit before the show.

1084
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:39,380
But there's similar to the that you don't realize it's happening in the plant in the audience

1085
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:45,060
there's always yeah you're anticipating what it's going to be and then maybe you don't catch second

1086
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:49,140
one of the like comic relief guy coming out.

1087
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,900
So you're like only like 45 seconds in you go oh something's happening on a real

1088
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,340
awake because there's like laughter's moving through the crowd because it's happening in a

1089
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,140
specific part of the crowd.

1090
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:01,780
Oh yeah yeah so it's got to hit you and maybe there's a delay that's a magical little feeling.

1091
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:05,540
And there's something about this one being indoors where none of the other ones really were.

1092
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:05,780
Right.

1093
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:10,180
That it was climate controlled and it may be a little too cold and.

1094
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:15,060
Yeah yes you know what's weird it's a I discovered much like the amphitheater

1095
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:21,700
which started outdoor and then got enclosed this venue I think the seating was there so when you

1096
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:27,220
were there still as of a couple years ago it's probably the still the same seating setup that

1097
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:35,300
was outdoor pre 1980 which strangely was for a makeup demonstration show that happened outside.

1098
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:36,660
Really weird.

1099
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,740
So they really like the building around it.

1100
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:42,980
Yeah yeah yeah the castle was built we got the seats now let's just build a cat.

1101
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,420
Did that save that much money?

1102
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:45,940
Yeah really.

1103
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,740
Then I don't know.

1104
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:51,860
So that's not to be confused with they had an early special effects show that you could

1105
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:57,460
volunteer in and purchase a VHS copy of back in the days before most people even had VHS

1106
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,980
and it was like really expensive.

1107
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,660
Right yes insanely expensive takes.

1108
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:05,300
Like an airplane crash movie that they would shoot all these scenes from and then see it by the end.

1109
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:09,300
Yes was that have we ever talked about that before I've I've always I've just like in

1110
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:13,620
lists of everything they ever had seen I think it was based on airports.

1111
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:20,180
It was because volunteers would jump into tanks of water and things that really yeah and I remember

1112
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:27,300
being a grow to make a I know or do I think they swapped it I don't remember but I wanted to be in

1113
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,420
that so bad.

1114
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:34,180
Is the last thing they did like that the Star Trek thing where they would you would get like a VHS

1115
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:39,780
of like yeah maybe dad looking like an idiot wearing an outfit yeah I think so I think there's

1116
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,460
no more of those left.

1117
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:48,420
This this space turned into the special effects stages show yeah which my wife downstairs.

1118
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,620
Oh really as a host.

1119
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,220
Her about that or do wow oh I don't know.

1120
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,180
She hated it.

1121
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:52,980
Oh really.

1122
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,980
So much to memorize and she did it so infrequently that she'd have to remember.

1123
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:57,780
Oh yeah.

1124
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:03,620
Oh my god yeah and then actually on keys of the kingdom Mark McConville comes on and he talks

1125
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:13,300
about a night where a very wealthy couple from Asia bought out Universal Studios presumably

1126
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:18,900
he thinks because they Disney wouldn't let him so he could propose to his fiance or his hope

1127
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:23,140
is soon to be fiance they bought out the entire park every element of the park had to be on

1128
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:29,220
standby including Waterworld if these two people wanted to come just two people and do it but

1129
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:34,100
including the special effects show which he pointed out is an absurd prospect because if

1130
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:38,900
the two of them came in the way that the show works is that the they need a volunteer volunteer

1131
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:45,860
has to disappear backstage for almost 30 minutes so that would leave this fiance seated in the

1132
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,700
theater watching it by herself.

1133
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,940
Wow did it make it to them.

1134
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:56,180
I don't believe so I don't believe they ever went to a lot of it yeah.

1135
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:01,700
Oh my god that's crazy but yeah that was where that that's what it was just kind of inexplicably

1136
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:07,380
in a castle theater yeah and now the castle theater finally is gone it's been there since 1980

1137
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:12,580
and just got taken out this year right for the Fast and Furious coaster yeah.

1138
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,740
Oh that kills me.

1139
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:18,180
Yeah sorry to tell you sorry to break technology progress.

1140
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,140
For a roller coaster?

1141
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:19,620
Yeah.

1142
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,980
Fast Furious no less?

1143
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,660
It looks really it's gonna be awesome.

1144
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:29,060
You know what I shouldn't speak because I couldn't couldn't I can't stand the Transformer

1145
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,220
movies but that Transformer ride is awesome.

1146
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,100
Yeah there we go.

1147
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:32,900
It really is.

1148
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,500
I don't think I like it.

1149
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:41,220
I like we've had an on we've many times gone into the the war of is that better than Rise of the

1150
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,180
Resistance.

1151
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,220
The new Star Wars right.

1152
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,660
Which was a point Mike has named an on.

1153
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,980
You know that is a that's a good question.

1154
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:48,260
My argument is.

1155
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,260
You might be the first person to say it's a good question.

1156
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:55,060
Everyone thinks I'm insane but my argument is just that the Transformers ride even though

1157
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:59,860
I'm not a fan of the movies gives you everything you would want from Transformers and Rise of

1158
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,860
the Resistance leaves me wanting.

1159
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,700
Mike I might have to agree with you.

1160
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,100
Wow.

1161
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,380
I know that's blasphemous because people adore the Rise of the Resistance.

1162
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,380
The first time this anyone said this.

1163
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,500
I agree with me.

1164
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,820
Uncanny Valley element with Rise of the Resistance that left me cold where Transformers.

1165
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:19,060
I feel cold from it except for when you're in the spaceship with Lieutenant Beck that's the

1166
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,740
only warmth I feel on the ride.

1167
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,700
I agree.

1168
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:26,260
I agree and there's something about Transformers being uncanny valley like the definition of

1169
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:30,260
uncanny valley and that their machines but they're not trying to be humans.

1170
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:34,260
I was really thrown by Rise of the Resistance when you get into that first room of all the

1171
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:39,220
stormtroopers or you're in the little shuttle and they've empowered all the regular Disney

1172
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:45,380
ride operators to be Imperial commanders but like still have a Disney name tag which how

1173
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:48,420
they don't see the irony of the evil Empire.

1174
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,860
And it's like yeah like in the movie it's always like Lieutenant Hux or something but here it's

1175
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:56,020
just you know Commander Chad.

1176
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:56,820
From Maine.

1177
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:57,540
From Maine.

1178
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,300
Yeah yes and who's favorite.

1179
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,740
Favorite movie The Rescuers.

1180
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:07,620
Yeah that's no joke and that took me out in like actually to Disney's you know probablyest.

1181
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:14,500
It ruined the magic for me I hate to use those terms but I kind of want I want some old craggy

1182
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,020
man or woman playing these parts get an Agva Union performer instead.

1183
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:22,500
Letting I don't mean letting because like it's great that the regular performers

1184
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:26,260
or the cast members get to do that but when they're just kind of like

1185
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:30,740
just doing a work a day job where they're just like all right everybody over here and then

1186
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:35,780
some of them get too into it and it feels a little like actually dangerous in a way.

1187
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:36,420
You know like.

1188
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,900
I'm gonna hurt me in there I will be entrapped.

1189
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:46,500
Yeah that's true you know and I know I know Jason would agree on the Union front that the

1190
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:52,900
I mean that's a lot of the weakness of Galaxy's Edge as a whole is that the choice that like

1191
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:59,940
sure no the regular cast will get to do all of the we don't need to pay for stunt shows for example

1192
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:04,740
to happen in all of these empty spaces that were built only for stunt shows to happen.

1193
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:09,380
It's like a huge shell of disappointment each time you feel like you're being set up with

1194
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,700
something and it doesn't come.

1195
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,500
Yeah yeah I remember having a real moment.

1196
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,060
This is the first time yes anyone has agreed with me on this.

1197
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,180
Okay I'm with you.

1198
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:22,500
I don't think Jason would like tilt the scales I think he's more on my side but also on the

1199
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,940
side of chaos.

1200
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:25,380
That's true he loves chaos as well.

1201
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,420
This is a very chaotic opinion.

1202
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:32,980
It is but I think there's some behind some of my chaos there's some logic going on.

1203
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:33,860
I see it.

1204
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:38,020
Yeah and it's not just that I don't get to see my friends from the movies I like more.

1205
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:39,700
Meaning what?

1206
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:43,220
Like I'm like the whole thing is just based around the new movie.

1207
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:43,460
Yeah.

1208
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:48,260
The last three which I'm like why wasn't it all nine like why can't we include all of it

1209
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,500
but I'm just saying there's a heart that's missing from it.

1210
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,460
I agree I really agree.

1211
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:57,540
If it's the ultimate Star Wars ride which I don't think there ever will be a more expensive

1212
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,740
bigger scale ride they're missing something.

1213
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,580
It's missing something from it.

1214
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:09,620
I think maybe this opinion relies on a harder Star Wars fandom than I have.

1215
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,180
It's possible.

1216
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,900
Which is a low bar to me I'm not a super Star Wars person.

1217
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:18,100
I am too and maybe that's why I'm yeah because they went they took such pains to make that whole

1218
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:24,900
land kind of free from the the settings of the movies Batuu doesn't exist in the movies.

1219
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,140
Yeah.

1220
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:29,860
Anything like that but then you had to land so hard on this and then have nothing of the original

1221
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,500
trilogy in there.

1222
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:35,300
It's weird well and it's also though all the movies and the lander it's also like we want you to

1223
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,540
think about Tatooine.

1224
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:37,860
Yeah.

1225
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:40,980
We made a bunch of sand planets but they're none of them are Tatooine.

1226
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:46,180
And then Batuu is not Tatooine but it looks like it and you're like well what.

1227
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:52,020
Well it's not it can't be Tatooine because they need big cliffs to block the freeways

1228
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:52,740
and parking structures.

1229
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,900
Oh yeah beggars canyon I mean come on.

1230
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:58,260
There's places on Tatooine that could look could have like elevation.

1231
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:58,740
Yeah.

1232
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,900
Right I don't know I don't know the full topography.

1233
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:05,860
Mos Eisley area you're thinking yes it's there's like one story two stories maybe.

1234
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:10,260
But then again they're looking at Mos Eisley down from some perch of a giant canyon at one

1235
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,340
point when he says that's scum and villainy.

1236
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:12,740
Right.

1237
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:14,820
Look Disney I mean just we're here.

1238
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,220
Yeah but this is it.

1239
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:17,620
Yeah.

1240
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,380
It's not never getting last.

1241
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,100
Juncture.

1242
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:20,340
Yeah.

1243
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:20,980
That's it.

1244
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:26,900
I mean mainly I know that mainly what you bring into any discussion like this is a Dexter Jetster

1245
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:27,700
bias.

1246
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,460
I know how much you want Dexter.

1247
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:35,540
What would be better though would it be just sort of the general sand planet or at least

1248
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:42,260
having like a weird like Coruscant style like fake not fake the future 50s.

1249
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:42,740
Yeah.

1250
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:47,540
Thing with a diner and a big robot that had an apron and it would be nice if he got into

1251
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,620
the booth with you but I don't think that's possible.

1252
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:51,700
But that's what he does.

1253
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,980
Since Haunted Car Wash you want proximity now you want people.

1254
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,900
That intimacy I always talk about is what I'm.

1255
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,940
Stinky guys.

1256
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,900
Steaming cup of Jawa juice.

1257
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,940
I want him in those three movies.

1258
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:08,020
The big promise for me of the sequels was going to be that now we can see

1259
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:11,780
Han Solo and Watto or Dexter Jetster interact.

1260
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:13,460
That's what you wanted.

1261
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:13,700
Yes.

1262
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:14,020
Okay.

1263
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:15,220
You are losing me.

1264
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:15,860
I'm on record.

1265
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:20,900
Wait you thought you thought there was a chance of Watto in Force Awakens.

1266
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:21,380
Here's how I.

1267
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,340
With Han Solo.

1268
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:26,500
Well I don't know that I thought it was a chance but I thought that's obviously what I want.

1269
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:32,100
But I the world's coming together and I've gotten more fond of the the prequels as I've

1270
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,300
gotten older but I was obviously a little disappointed with them.

1271
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,340
But to me you go okay that stuff happened.

1272
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:43,060
Let's make that stuff cool now because there's a lot of cool ideas in those movies.

1273
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:46,580
So it's fun now to put them all together and see what you could kind of come up with.

1274
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:50,340
With better tech without the CGI that holds people back.

1275
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:51,460
Sleepy director.

1276
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,020
And the green screen.

1277
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,500
Yeah so you go okay let's see.

1278
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,340
One of our friends has said no no no it's minimalism.

1279
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:05,140
That's the excuse for why everything's kind of like plotting.

1280
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:08,820
So yeah when they completely ignored the prequels and the sequels I was not a fan of that either.

1281
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,620
But there's a lot of fun stuff there's a lot of fun stuff you could do.

1282
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:13,860
Yeah.

1283
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:15,620
And no.

1284
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:20,660
But again but to tie it back that I you know I guess I've always had this thing like like with

1285
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:26,500
Waterworld and Conan the Barbarian where like I don't theme but the theme park attractions come

1286
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:30,100
first and I know it's insane that that's the case with Star Wars for me.

1287
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:34,260
But it is which is why Rex is the top Star Wars character in my mind.

1288
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:39,780
I just I come at it from the literally I went on the ride and fell in love with the ride.

1289
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,100
I get it.

1290
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:40,980
Before the movies.

1291
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,260
Yeah oh really.

1292
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,220
Yeah yeah yeah.

1293
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:43,780
Interesting.

1294
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:49,300
No just the weird I mean because they're you know we're I must have done star tours before

1295
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,100
like special edition re-releases were out so.

1296
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,980
Rex got to me first what can I say.

1297
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,780
So those other those side characters Luke and Leia they're okay.

1298
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:03,620
Yeah they're not filling the blanks.

1299
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:08,980
But this thing I mean I loved this despite not knowing the mythology then not knowing it now.

1300
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:15,940
It's it's it's very exciting and you also get I mean you feel like real danger you feel real

1301
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:20,660
heat and maybe in more ways than one because this is a little bit of a sexy show.

1302
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:21,140
Yeah.

1303
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:21,780
Yes.

1304
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:25,700
If I could read from a newspaper review at the time.

1305
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,340
I love this.

1306
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:31,700
Youngsters will identify with the heroic Conan.

1307
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:36,100
Fathers will appreciate the near nude statuesque red Sonya.

1308
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:37,300
Fathers.

1309
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:40,820
Like this pushes you into puberty you know.

1310
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:41,860
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

1311
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,060
This made a man out of me.

1312
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,020
This is clearly.

1313
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:46,020
And wakes your dad up from a sleepy day.

1314
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:47,780
Yeah it's oh yeah.

1315
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:54,180
And then I actually when I took this screenshot I didn't realize how condescending the next

1316
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:54,980
sentence is.

1317
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,060
So fathers near nude red Sonya.

1318
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:59,460
Mothers will enjoy the choreography.

1319
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,020
Come on.

1320
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:04,340
You've got the most built man of all time.

1321
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:04,820
Yes.

1322
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,580
Conan the Barbarian and the mothers can't enjoy that.

1323
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,420
Yes let a mom enjoy that.

1324
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:09,700
Let a mom enjoy a beef.

1325
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:12,020
Most moms are not going home to a beef cake.

1326
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:12,420
No.

1327
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,540
Let them get it here.

1328
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:19,060
Now is a good time for me to talk about something I mentioned early on in that I scoured and scoured

1329
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,180
looking for it today.

1330
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,180
I hope it's not been taken out but I couldn't find it.

1331
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:26,980
It is a YouTube video that someone took on their home camera and it was like a mom like

1332
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:29,460
a middle western mom in from out of town.

1333
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:35,940
Conan the guy who plays Conan comes out in full costume after the show not as part of

1334
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:42,820
his job just to get a hot dog at one of the stands in the park and he's just talking to

1335
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:45,620
this mom so he's just talking to camera like where are you from.

1336
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,260
OK where are you.

1337
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:46,980
Where are you this.

1338
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:47,860
Where are you that.

1339
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:50,180
And you can tell he's kind of out there to get a little attention.

1340
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:51,060
Yeah of course.

1341
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,900
But he's you know she's like well what do you do.

1342
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:58,500
I'm an actor and you know blah blah blah blah and he's just there oiled tan little

1343
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:03,460
leather straps around his biceps and the whole wig and everything just talking putting ketchup

1344
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,140
on a hot dog out of a little packet.

1345
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:08,580
If I remember it correctly it's been a long time since I've seen it and I feel like this

1346
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:12,900
is how I did when I was a kid with the movie Halloween is that I've dreamed about it and

1347
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:17,460
it's changed in my mind that this may never even existed for all I know.

1348
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:19,860
No I'm certain it existed.

1349
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,980
I don't know all the details but I find it find the video send it.

1350
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,260
I'll look again when I get home because it was hard to find on my phone and I'll also

1351
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:29,380
send a link to the best Bob Rochelle video to you.

1352
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:30,900
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1353
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:33,140
we'll post it we'll keep getting the word out.

1354
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:36,340
He deserved to get recognized though so I understand that instinct.

1355
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:42,340
It's like yeah because we've talked about like anytime people do voices like for a living I

1356
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:46,340
feel like they do the voices constantly and I think part of it is because like I do the voices

1357
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:49,700
you need to know because and I get that because you're like.

1358
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,980
I am so fam I should be so famous.

1359
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:59,220
I agree that I do a little bit of work in that realm and I've been doing these zoom table reads

1360
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:04,580
for a show and all of those regular actors when we get on we have to do tech checks and they just

1361
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:08,740
are just doing their voices back and forth to each other unasked for.

1362
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:09,540
Yeah.

1363
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:13,940
It is like almost compulsive where I just kind of sit there going wow.

1364
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:15,620
Yeah it's amazing.

1365
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:17,380
I don't know if this is great or not.

1366
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:21,220
It's amazing but I think yeah I think part I in my mind part of it is just because like

1367
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:23,300
we do it and people don't know.

1368
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,100
So it's like gotta I gotta do it.

1369
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:31,140
And it's like I'm just a normal looking man or woman and then I can do this insane magic

1370
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:38,420
yeah showing us people like yeah like at least just their eyes expand and at most like cry

1371
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:40,100
depending on the character.

1372
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:45,380
Yeah well now speaking of magic trick the whole show starts off with Conan Conan.

1373
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:52,500
Conan speaking of being like just a puny little comic sidekick character coming in.

1374
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,780
And he turns east.

1375
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:56,020
You don't need to know the movies at all for this show.

1376
01:03:56,020 --> 01:04:00,260
He gets transformed into Conan the barbarian in the beginning of the show.

1377
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:06,100
Is that not a thing from the movies is that made up here that a little guy becomes big Conan.

1378
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:12,100
I think he's just raised I don't think so but they do do this amazing transformation

1379
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:16,180
where the little kid and there's like a wizard with him or something and he steps on this

1380
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:21,940
pedestal in the in the kind of downstage area and fog shoots up all around him in a tight circle.

1381
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:27,700
And it gets so opaque and by the time it goes away he's Conan the barbarian with the big sword.

1382
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:32,580
And that's so great and you know like the best thing about theme park stuff like this too is

1383
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:37,700
when the fog shoots all you can hear there's music blaring but all you hear is the like pneumatic

1384
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:43,540
that you smell the fog and it's like when the explosions go off you feel the heat and it smells

1385
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:49,060
like gasoline and yes it's great. Yeah that's the thing I hope never fully goes away from universal

1386
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:55,060
is the gasoline smell and something I liked about doing the tram tour was like every every time

1387
01:04:55,060 --> 01:05:01,220
really hit you in jaws like oh my god yeah it's just real and at night it was nuts yeah like god

1388
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:07,140
if it was a cold night the fire is so hot and it's so smelly it's so weird that there's no

1389
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:13,380
underselling how nostalgic that is to me I will feel that or smell it or see it and I am

1390
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:17,540
immediately transported back to my youth in the most wonderful way you know like there's good

1391
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:23,380
nostalgia and bad nostalgia and that is harmless wonderful just healthy nostalgia that I love.

1392
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:30,340
Yeah close to an explosion controlled explosion. What more insane thing could you do as a kid

1393
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:36,980
and it must have made you like want to be on film sets and like just like this tactile stuff

1394
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:42,420
which is like increasingly less and less in movies. And it would never be as satisfying as

1395
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:48,020
this thing that's pre-packaged for you they shot Masters of the Universe in the 80s in my town of

1396
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:53,940
Whittier and I went to see them film a little bit and it was part of it yeah in uptown Whittier

1397
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:59,700
and one of this should have been like on paper thrilled me and it was one of the like bad soldiers

1398
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:05,220
getting shot off a crate and they just it took so long and when you finally see it and then the

1399
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:11,460
sound effect was just like and he just kind of fell back into some boxes and it was so boring

1400
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:15,780
but that's why Universal Studios is so amazing because they just they glitz it up. Yeah yeah oh

1401
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:23,540
sure yeah yeah really spectacular in the moment. That film I believe directed by yes it is the

1402
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:30,020
person who put this show together a person who we try like to avoid talking about named Gary Goddard.

1403
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:35,620
Look it up everyone. Bad Googling to do. Director of Masters of the Universe also was more had more

1404
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:40,420
of a theme park career and was responsible for a lot of Universal show. Jurassic Park, The Ride,

1405
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:47,380
T2 is a figure whose name has to be mentioned once in a while but as there's a very bad thing

1406
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:54,500
associated with the guy unfortunately but so but he did he was part of putting this together and

1407
01:06:54,500 --> 01:07:02,260
the name Jay Stein who I mentioned earlier I think kind of a more traditional executive a real

1408
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:09,220
cigar chomping kind of guy who was set in his ways and the ways at the time to go back to the

1409
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:17,620
Wild West stunt show stuff, Universal's ways at the time were volunteers come up from the audience

1410
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:22,820
and you learn about movie making and that is not the show that anybody wanted to do with this. I

1411
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:27,940
think they were picturing what became the model of this kind of thing forever which is you're just

1412
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:32,820
fully immersed in the universe and there's no breaking of the fourth wall. This one it's a live

1413
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:39,380
blockbuster happening in front of you so apparently what happened was either that guy or some sub

1414
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:44,980
executive I think somebody said a very like the note-y kind of move it's like anticipating the

1415
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:49,860
note that then doesn't come or the guy thinks the opposite basically they were told like this show

1416
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:54,100
this is okay but they're gonna want something where like volunteers come up so make sure you

1417
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:58,660
get that in there and then the executive Jay Stein is reading their proposal and hearing about it

1418
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:03,540
and then he's like why are there people coming up from the audience that has nothing to do with any

1419
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:08,180
of this I don't want that in there like well we put it in because we thought we had to for your

1420
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:15,060
sake but that was this was a real like universal like a real theme park juncture point where like

1421
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:21,780
we can start departing from those things and just do a movie live on stage and I think there was a

1422
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:26,740
lot that was tough about convincing people to do this because there was a lot of money that needed

1423
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:33,300
to be spent literally the old another old cigar chompin universal guy Lou Wasserman oh yeah

1424
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:40,660
personally weighed in and said it was the finale of it was supposed to be three giant snakes and

1425
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:46,180
then it was costing too much money and it became one giant snake and then Lou Wasserman himself said

1426
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:51,300
people don't like snakes everybody's afraid of snakes don't put a snake in there and they said um

1427
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:58,020
the same size but it's a dragon yes go do it oh my god yeah weird odd calculation yeah people

1428
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:02,580
don't like snakes but isn't that what you and that is scare them with them and also from the movie

1429
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:07,140
yeah wouldn't you be scared wouldn't you be scared of a dragon as well like a giant snake isn't

1430
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:11,940
something you encounter the dragon is also like as close to a snake that's what could be and why

1431
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:16,900
the point is to not like snakes it's the scary villain at the end and yeah he must not have

1432
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:22,260
liked snakes I know or he was like Indiana Jones has taught the world that they don't like snakes

1433
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:26,500
yeah he's just seen the movie maybe yes that was there that was recent enough I guess yeah Raiders

1434
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:32,340
had just happened um but I think in general also with with all these guys with the cigar chompers

1435
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:39,620
it was like um I literally they said why should we spend all this money on this what could be

1436
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:47,700
of fly by night like is sure Conan did okay oh my god recently but like nobody's gonna remember

1437
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:54,100
it and you know what we have already are these monster properties and we have a perfectly good

1438
01:09:54,100 --> 01:10:00,900
Castle Dracula show with the monsters why don't we do some stuff with them or make a new show

1439
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:07,220
about the monsters and they had to convince them like well what's more exciting hey we made this

1440
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:13,860
Dracula show a little bit better or we have a new show based on a very recent big hit movie

1441
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:19,780
another big like universal juncture point I think yeah that kind of bit him in the ass with water

1442
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:27,620
world where now the show has far exceeded yes true and yet but it's like it almost is the main form

1443
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:32,580
of I mean guaranteed more people have seen that show than the movie yeah we've been probably we

1444
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:37,140
I suppose we've time uh talked about this recently they're building new show like water world is

1445
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:41,780
overseas they're building new water world stunt shows is that right yeah that's how popular it is

1446
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:50,260
where it's an entire land where like yes yes it's a land where where in China Beijing I think yeah

1447
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:55,220
yeah so there's like the world of harry potter and then there's water world presented as equals

1448
01:10:56,020 --> 01:11:01,140
um but anyway but let me now having said all that let me bring up a little about this castle

1449
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:07,220
dracula yes so what you saw you said you you or or just or were aware of it no I did see it as a kid

1450
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:14,020
I don't remember virtually anything I feel like I remember someone being stretched on a rack like a

1451
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:18,340
volunteer being brought in and they had a special effects rack where someone was tortured and

1452
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:23,620
stretched whoa is that does that ring a bell not that I saw but I also there's not a lot of material

1453
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:27,860
I don't doubt that that was a lot of like there's like a youtube video that has a little video and

1454
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:32,900
then stills but I don't I never looked into this one that's what I'm gonna do when I get home

1455
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:38,740
apparently um you know there was no a lot of the info I'm getting about the the history of Conan is

1456
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:44,740
from the book universal versus Disney by Sam Genoway which is a great book um but so and I

1457
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:49,700
think I'm getting this from that book as well that nobody made any bones about it was just like

1458
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:55,300
do you think you can help the castle dracula show people went to go see it they said this show

1459
01:11:55,300 --> 01:12:01,620
stinks this is a terrible show it only ran for two years all told I think came out of the gate

1460
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:08,820
a stinker very bad what years do you know 80 to 82 yeah I would have certainly gone okay okay yeah

1461
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:14,980
um I some things that we know about this show you're right there's only like five seconds of

1462
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:20,980
footage right um I'm not sure which part you're gonna bring up but I um do you know the celebrity

1463
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:26,180
component not the character who shows up who's unexpected because I'm talking yeah I like the

1464
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:29,540
character yeah you I don't know I think maybe I don't know what you're talking about let me

1465
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:34,980
let me say my thing this is kind of weird okay so one uh thing that sounds okay about the show

1466
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:40,100
there's a live dracula and live monsters and stuff and then also some animatronics there was a phantom

1467
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:46,020
of the opera evidently in this but oh yes yes rudimentary and I know what this is uh okay yes

1468
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:53,140
at least when this attraction opened the phantom of the opera was voiced by Paul oh my god oh that

1469
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:57,220
does ring a bell I was looking for it does that take you but do you remember that unmistakable

1470
01:12:57,220 --> 01:13:03,460
voice faintly they said that went away quickly though because it was so recognizable really so

1471
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:08,660
it might not have people out of it yeah Paul Lindish yes he couldn't really hide did they replace him

1472
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:14,180
with someone else known uh I think just a regular maybe just a regular monster a regular person

1473
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:18,580
wow but there you go I might have gone to the small window of time when Paul Lind

1474
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:24,340
there was the Paul Lind theme park attraction you had the dream of yours I got so excited when I

1475
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:28,660
read this yeah yeah sorry I missed and sorry nobody filmed it seemingly yeah is that his

1476
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:34,020
only theme park presence there's there's a on Spotify at least a couple years ago there was

1477
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:38,900
something called like Castle Dracula narrated by Paul Lind oh weird and he would just be like

1478
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:45,380
Renfield's Renfield and it was like played straight it wasn't like he was doing a comedic

1479
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:50,340
version oh I want to hear that I feel it was like 12 minutes long and he's just like reading a story

1480
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:55,940
and doing the dialogue that's amazing yeah I'm gonna kill you old devil it's the Halloween

1481
01:13:55,940 --> 01:14:00,500
special of course which yeah we have yet to cover on a full episode of the show inexplicably

1482
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:06,820
that's have you just revealed that you follow Paul Lind on Spotify yeah you get emails about

1483
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:11,940
any updates of Paul Lind's discography on social media years ago that that was one of my like top

1484
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:20,660
Spotify because it was really lining up with you here today yeah it was kids it was just his

1485
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:26,500
performance of kids from bye bye birdie okay yeah and then Castle Dracula wow maybe something from

1486
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:30,660
Charlotte's Web I don't know well you'll probably like Bob Rochelle's performance that sounds like

1487
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:37,060
I will yeah yeah yeah but the other thing I assume what you were going to bring up is that

1488
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:42,100
uh the the character uh gets involved because you've got it's it's Dracula it's the Phantom

1489
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:47,380
it's it's all of Universal's great monsters including the Incredible Hulk

1490
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:56,180
the loo for no style Incredible Hulk you know when your mind is like I don't trust my mind that

1491
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:59,620
I would have never in a million years thought you'd say that but then when you did I can't

1492
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:03,300
tell if it's power of suggestion or I'm going like yeah that does sound familiar I don't know

1493
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:08,900
I'm not sure it's and it's funny in the old like eight millimeter video or it's you just see a

1494
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:15,300
figure staggering out really far away and blurry so you're like Frankenstein right no no no Incredible

1495
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:19,380
Hulk can you send me that after we're done yeah yeah yeah absolutely we have to we'll do a link

1496
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:24,900
exchange for sure played the Hulk just went right on to play Conan too oh probably oh yeah yeah they'd

1497
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:31,700
have the bod absolutely um that's so insane you talk about uh property chaos especially given the

1498
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:36,980
marvel of it there was a time where Frankenstein and the Incredible Hulk would be hanging out

1499
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:42,980
they were like well they're both monsters so green monsters yeah so I guess he's scary and

1500
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:48,500
misunderstood he's not he's not unlike a Frankenstein happy yeah we're gonna have to

1501
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:53,220
rewrite we're gonna have to in an episode with Jason make sure that we say that out loud because

1502
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:57,700
we we know we'll get a big that's great big high laugh out of him on that one we talked about this

1503
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:03,620
briefly before we recorded but that universal is the grab bag of intellectual property where there

1504
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:09,540
was a point where you could get Lucille Ball, Shrek, and Harry from Harry and the Hendersons

1505
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:18,580
within a 10-foot radius yes you know walking around yeah yeah yeah um not not to summon uh

1506
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:24,820
a guy who everybody should talk about less but do you know that photo of Trump promoting

1507
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:34,500
the apprentice with a lineup of characters all dressed like him in his signature too big of tie

1508
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:40,500
no and it's this like absolutely insane some of the characters we've just mentioned they're all

1509
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:49,940
doing a your fire gesture and it's uh Frankenstein the um mummy the mummy uh Shrek and Curious George

1510
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:54,660
what a lineup huh that says it that's the vibe

1511
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:01,940
I just it's the mummy wearing khakis yeah no one else is wearing khakis

1512
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:07,860
oh oh you're right you're absolutely right yes I wasn't looking at the detail

1513
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:13,700
I wish it's a suit and a jacket and tie on top of bandages I wish Lucille Ball was in that photo

1514
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:18,740
though I know that would be the only way I don't keep Lucy away you're right you're right you're

1515
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:24,340
right there's also like Groucho and Harpo for a while and yeah Charlie Chaplin and yeah I wish

1516
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:29,940
that they would do this with just like current actors that just that a guy's not not playing

1517
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:37,620
the character just playing Chris Pratt I'm younger I'm Chris Pratt hello now that's probably legal

1518
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:42,260
because when you're a public figure if it's not intellectual property does his walk around as Chris

1519
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:46,660
Pratt I'm surprised they don't have look-alikes you know like on Instagram there's like a Jack

1520
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:52,820
Nicholson and a Bruce Willis who are just just living off of you're talking about sunglasses Jack

1521
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:57,700
yeah it must be the sunglasses Jack yeah why don't they just hire that guy I think that's a good

1522
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:05,060
idea yeah there was a when I uh the like graduation party when I uh got to officially become a tour

1523
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:12,980
guide there was a look-alike of the new uh then new host of the train tour videos Whoopi Goldberg

1524
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:19,300
and there was a moment where she was introduced and initially everybody thought did they get Whoopi

1525
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:24,900
to come to this party and then after two seconds oh and then you're just at the party and like

1526
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:30,100
I don't want to talk to what am I gonna go talk to a Whoopi Goldberg look-alike what do we do now

1527
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:35,940
and she seemed to be like by herself oh that's upset that really is a crossroads what do you do

1528
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:43,460
um very strange um but anyway yeah Incredible Hulk in this show and then here's some things

1529
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:48,660
I'm gonna pull this is from that book uh I mentioned Universal versus Disney maybe the

1530
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:53,860
most insane aspect of this and they say this show was bad that it had to be taken out uh um for the

1531
01:18:53,860 --> 01:19:00,100
climax Jay Stein wanted bats to fly over the audience members heads but that was deemed too

1532
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:09,060
dangerous so uh a guy Winnick I'm not sure their friend too um hired Ray Berwick to Ray Berwick

1533
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:15,220
you know the bird guy Ray Berwick to train a flock of little green parrots to fly over the

1534
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:22,980
audience's head who would be painted black using a special dye that's not good special is a I don't

1535
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:28,740
like special dye you're very special parrots you get a very special dye it's called spray paint

1536
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:35,940
yeah yeah I hate you line up um after three months of training it was time for a final run

1537
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:40,420
through at the proper moment the cage door was lifted and all of the parrots flew toward the

1538
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:47,460
stage took a hard left and flew out of the arena never to be seen again good good job escaping

1539
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:54,660
the only way are those the famous green parrots that live in like I love maybe yes in the Burbank

1540
01:19:54,660 --> 01:20:00,180
area yeah in Pasadena they're there all the time I see weekly yeah yeah yeah yeah oh my god I love

1541
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:05,540
to think those are the descendants of the Dracula's castle black parrots they might be that was the

1542
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:11,140
rebellion that was the planet of the apes rebellion oh my god they've got about life pick up my daughter

1543
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:16,980
and go look Glen theme park history they were very abused in the 1980s the only free now

1544
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:21,300
the only way that could have been better is if like the parrots like attacked the spray painter

1545
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:31,700
ate the spray painter to death I mean they managed to get a hold of the can spray it into his eyes

1546
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:36,660
right right right him to death in a nod to his was the birds universal picture oh yes

1547
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:41,700
yeah in the tradition of the property well then but then then the addendum to the story

1548
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:48,020
Burwick started over using pigeons oh and I think that happened because in the in the little clip I

1549
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:53,460
saw I saw little creatures go by and I thought did they have bats fly around I think that they

1550
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:57,780
ended up now did they have to be sprayed I guess they would right because they did otherwise just

1551
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:02,740
read his pigeons I think they did spray paint some fucking pigeons even black man's aren't

1552
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:09,700
really gonna read his bats so no gray pigeons ain't gonna work the body shape is vastly different

1553
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:16,260
why they just look like crows yeah at best at best yeah now everybody's like oh shit crows

1554
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:20,500
yeah they should just unleash crows on the audience aren't they also the smartest birds

1555
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:24,420
yeah although they're too smart to be stuck they would have turned they would have turned in

1556
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:29,460
early they would have killed the guy earlier yeah yeah and that's their entire initial audience yeah

1557
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:36,340
um so yes this had to be removed this sounds like one of the worst shows ever put together

1558
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:40,740
I wonder if anyone has a video somewhere that's the thing is they have to they're

1559
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:47,620
have somebody has yeah and it's just sitting there waiting there's like live we got I wonder

1560
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:53,060
if it's like there's there's what was it was it ucla where we got an email from somebody we did

1561
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:58,980
an episode about something called king koopa's cool cartoons which was a local like kind of bozo

1562
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:06,020
show hosted by koopa from mario illegally no licensed officially licensed not not illegally

1563
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:11,300
but cheap definitely cheap and like shitty looking where you'd show cartoons but there's only like

1564
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:17,460
very a little bit of uh footage online but we got an email that like at the ucla campus there's a

1565
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:22,900
couple episodes like in the library that you could like go and see and I wonder if you have to go

1566
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:28,980
so we have to drive to the library physically we haven't done this yet you don't have to you get

1567
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:33,700
yeah but I wonder like is there any other archive for like stuff like this or internally at universal

1568
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:39,060
do they have that's the thing is that the guy we have this researcher for with gorillian russ

1569
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:46,260
podcast and he I think it was him sorry he found archive footage of all the not stunt shows oh wow

1570
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:52,820
through the orange county register oh so maybe maybe there is but you you have to know that

1571
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:57,780
universal has archive footage of that whole thing you would think so I'm always impressed with

1572
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:02,980
universal seemingly not being as together as disney oh for sure in that way having worked at both

1573
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:07,460
and there were pluses and minuses but mostly pluses to working at universal because they were just

1574
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:15,860
like sure cool to whatever you said yeah that's great that's nice to hear yeah I uh let's uh give

1575
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:21,620
a little bit of love to this uh this giant dragon because that I mean it that's the star I really I

1576
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:27,060
like remember my seat I remember my perspective on it despite being very young it's it's an

1577
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:35,460
incredibly compelling uh visual uh 18 feet tall and had to rise up from 42 feet below and it comes

1578
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:43,620
out of this yeah the centerpiece pit yeah after the bad guy turns in to this guy yeah I forgot that

1579
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:51,700
part yes the uh the evil wizard and we're as mordor terris mordor so he gets killed because

1580
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:56,660
above the pit is a giant like double staircase up to this thing if I remember correctly and

1581
01:23:56,660 --> 01:24:03,460
conan they do this cool trick where he stabs him in the neck basically like with the big sword and

1582
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:07,860
the guy just kind of leans his head over the sword so it kind of looks like it's going through his

1583
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:13,620
neck and he pulls it out and then that terris mordor does a high fall flip into the pit and

1584
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:19,460
you think and then flame comes up I think yeah yeah and then you think he's won but no he's

1585
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:26,740
turned into this giant dragon then they do this amazing coordination where the dragon shoots

1586
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:33,380
lasers he also appears out of like a laser cloud or something and so conan has to be at certain

1587
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:39,220
points on the stage for that laser to line up and hit a pyrotechnic so that he can run away from it

1588
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:43,300
that's the other thing I love about these stunt shows is all the not the like dance or stunt

1589
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:48,900
choreography but the kind of blocking that has to be precision for both safety and reality but is

1590
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:53,940
always done by someone who's done it too many times to really care so they phone it in slightly

1591
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:59,140
so they have to do exact precision placement but their acting is not there you know yeah yeah yeah

1592
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:05,060
yes I remember conan being kind of energetic because also all the voices are dubbed so no one

1593
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:09,620
has to like phone in an acting performance vocally oh right so it felt a little bit more

1594
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:16,260
vibrant and still somehow very false that initial cry at the by the power of chrome is really great

1595
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:21,380
I okay this is I apologize for saying this but I had to rewind this just it was on my computer

1596
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:26,900
so the speakers weren't very good I didn't I kept not hearing the R when he kept saying that

1597
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:32,500
by the power of calm yeah yeah I ruined it three times I knew he wasn't saying that I'm not crazy

1598
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:39,460
but this is a sexy show yeah I was like he didn't say that it might as well have it sounded like

1599
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:44,900
you said yeah and I've heard chrome before yeah so I didn't know that but I was like what did he say

1600
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:51,140
there is a great behind the scenes video on the Conan's yeah spectacular you get to see them kind

1601
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:55,780
of like below the stage and stuff like that kind of yeah and the little cubby that kind of that you

1602
01:25:55,780 --> 01:26:00,500
have to fall into and like getting lifted up initially yeah yeah must have been such a cool

1603
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:05,220
I mean it's what you were chasing like making little snitch shows at home like the idea of this

1604
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:10,260
little like town or in this case a temple where there's like lots of this hidden stuff and little

1605
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:16,740
tricks and contraptions and that one is produced there's some um like personal behind the scenes

1606
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:23,220
video of the wild wild west stunt show where you get to see inside all that like facade and everything

1607
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:29,540
I want like okay I know that it's because it's a water show why the water world cast all goes into

1608
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:34,580
a jacuzzi between the shows I really wish this happened for all of them I know they all need

1609
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:39,940
rest jacuzzi feels good yeah any amount of physical activity so I wish there was just

1610
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:45,140
always even Norman Bates on the tour he just when he's not coming out yes there's nothing you can't

1611
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:50,020
see what's in the house throw a hot tub in there for that guy every eight minutes has to get out

1612
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:56,100
and towel off get a fresh suit yeah like whoever's playing Woody Woodpecker just without the pants

1613
01:26:56,100 --> 01:27:02,420
part on yeah first part of the the suit is still on dip in there rest your legs yeah that would be

1614
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:09,060
great yeah now this thing's so cool and also and then you got then you think about it um that the

1615
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:19,620
the finale of this it's like a human-sized villain who you think dies and then but then no no no

1616
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:25,620
turns into a giant dragon at the end and there's flames and lasers this is phantasmic before

1617
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:35,380
phantasmic right and it's even the same dialogue uh the line from the wizard is you must face me

1618
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:42,340
and all the forces of hell which is from that's literally from sleeping sleeping beauty and this

1619
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:49,940
was a thing like I'm like we'll put this in as a nod uh are they gonna allow the word hell to be

1620
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:57,300
and they recorded it with and without and nobody noticed at lawless universal so hell was mentioned

1621
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:02,420
so it got this extra kick of edginess I remember that and I remember as a kid kind of going

1622
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:13,140
at Disneyland Matt Gourley you you are grown up this is the puberty show this is stripping away

1623
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:17,300
childish things it's it's uh it's hardcore I learned a lot there

1624
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:23,140
where you became a man you know they do I was at Disneyland not not long ago too but Donald is

1625
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:29,060
still wearing a little devil outfit and I was kind of impressed by them yeah and people I don't know

1626
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:34,900
I don't think Disney acknowledges hell too yeah but it's a cute version of hell yeah I feel like

1627
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:38,980
in the old days that would have been they would have moral moral quandary and now they're just

1628
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:44,260
like Disney seems happy to piss off the right you know maybe maybe they're trying they're sticking

1629
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:48,740
it to the Santas with Donald's little outfit yeah which always brings me back in Disney's corner

1630
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:53,220
every time they lose me they they get me back in some yeah I know because during the strike you're

1631
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:58,740
like yeah fuck Iger the worst which is correct that's correct that's the right opinion to have

1632
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:03,220
but then he starts then on this then separately is the other issue where you're rooting for him

1633
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:08,660
against the Santas crazy confusing time I don't know if you legacy yeah yeah yeah yeah from the

1634
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:14,740
beginning always good stuff the most like melodramatically perfect place is probably

1635
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:21,220
the most complicated company in American history yeah maybe next to Ford I don't know there's I

1636
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:25,860
this is not the time to bring this up but I will bring it up uh there's somebody online who is sort

1637
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:30,980
of like insinuating that Bob Iger actually screwed Michael Eisner over and that there's secrets that

1638
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:36,500
haven't been revealed oh really like back to 25 years ago is that how he got to his place of power

1639
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:41,540
that's what I that's what I'm reading into from these tweets so I'm very interested to see what

1640
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:46,500
stabbed his back maybe he helped get him out the door when he was kind of asked yeah yeah how much

1641
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:51,460
do you guys go into Disney conspiracy stuff at all do you it depends what it is you're probably the

1642
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:56,260
conspiracy guy more so yeah to some degree why are you there's one on the top of your head

1643
01:29:56,260 --> 01:30:01,300
off the top of your head necessarily okay we covered a little just the like that you can't be

1644
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:05,860
pronounced dead in Disney is not true right yeah yeah yeah a lot of it's just not true

1645
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:12,420
there was one of the Disney podcasts I was just actually going through and they were listing all

1646
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:17,860
of these off and saying most of them are true but yeah those those things like those we don't I don't

1647
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:21,300
feel like I'm going to talk about those that often yeah these aren't conspiracies but recently

1648
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:26,020
there's been a wave of things where I've just been that are kind of accepted online vaguely as fact

1649
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:33,060
but aren't sourced such as Michael Eisner being the golfer in Soren if you've heard that one

1650
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:37,940
no I know uh yeah that's one of those that's and I believe I and that's the thing I would say to

1651
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:42,180
people you know it's credible for sure I mean yeah yeah but then I just started thinking about it and

1652
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:47,060
there's no real proof of it and when you think about like he's not gonna wait around while they

1653
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:52,420
do helicopter flybys and that's like a whole day of coordination and he doesn't like golf either

1654
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:57,140
yes yeah yeah the fact that there was no actual he would have yeah he would have talked about it

1655
01:30:57,140 --> 01:31:02,500
a ton that's a guy who loves the camera so I like the little ones that are even more maybe germane

1656
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:07,460
to this podcast like the turkey legs or emu legs these were all by the way these were all addressed

1657
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:11,380
on this podcast I just listened to and that's not true right not true yeah yeah I forget I gotta I

1658
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:16,180
mean they look like it but they're yeah they're not the other recent one has been that Space

1659
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:22,420
Mountain doesn't go that fast and that it's simulated via fans this is well it doesn't go

1660
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:27,220
that fast as fast as you think I think that's for sure yeah we're trying to figure out exactly what

1661
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:33,060
where this came from and what it means because there's no fans blowing like right next to the

1662
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:37,380
you can't see you see what the lights on there are no giant fans this much we know but we're

1663
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:41,380
wondering is there some other Jason's really be able to represent very fast you're more feeling

1664
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:46,100
like the centrifugal force in that ride than you are and the darkness itself is making you

1665
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:53,140
it's 35 miles an hour I think to fight to read amidst the centrifugal force those fans that have

1666
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:58,420
to it's got to be heavy duty fans yeah I don't think air conditioning is gonna do it yeah it

1667
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:01,700
would be have to be heavy duty air condition listeners have heard these things yeah yeah these

1668
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:06,180
are you've talked about this before yeah our micro talking I am certain it's my own conspiracy

1669
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:11,860
theory the goat is holding an actual live stick of dynamite with just a really really slow fuse

1670
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:21,540
has yet to go we haven't addressed that before less than millimeter microscopic amounts but one day perhaps in like 27 years it'll actually

1671
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:26,980
longest game of russian roulette or like musical chairs of course well we just need to keep an eye

1672
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:33,220
on it then whatever goes even an inch sure does probably um I well anything else about this uh

1673
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:39,700
about this show it's so aladdin to me too yeah oh yes going after the special item the odd the

1674
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:44,820
dragon's eye isn't there like also like a voice that's kind of yes the cave of wonders voices in

1675
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:49,620
this and then it's the same as like the live aladdin show and the movie where it's like the bad guy

1676
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:55,140
turns into a big right not a snake well he got jufar turns into a snake yeah but this is a dragon

1677
01:32:55,140 --> 01:33:01,620
so it was almost exactly the same that's true as well yeah yeah there's a real disney borrowing

1678
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:07,940
universal borrowing disney yeah you know cat chasing its own tail thing here yeah the room you too

1679
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:15,300
I feel like generally things like this I think this this helps kick off uh as I was saying

1680
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:20,740
recent blockbusters and you're feeling the heat and it's it actually seems a little dangerous

1681
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:25,540
and it's not a little kiddy thing like disney and they start disney starts doing a little more in

1682
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:31,140
this area and that that feels like it has to come from universal carving out that path is what

1683
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:36,980
universals feel is yeah because they around this time too not just really getting the hanging going

1684
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:42,820
too and they're probably losing a lot of teenagers and adults right right yeah I mean yeah seriously

1685
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:47,460
like I remember being was born and raised here and you love disney but you hit an age where you're

1686
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:53,220
kind of like ah disney's for kids yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah universal and magic mountain right when

1687
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:57,380
you're in high school and stuff that was the destination sure sure well and then and then

1688
01:33:57,380 --> 01:34:02,580
knots like had like a teen dance club and then disney was like we're doing it and then disney

1689
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:08,020
was like tamer and where's a little bit was that what yeah yeah yeah studio do studio k

1690
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:14,900
that's what i was just yes yeah in fact studio k was preferred um yeah yeah my sister was more

1691
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:22,260
of that age she was three years older and they would go there yeah oh wow wow the rumors are true

1692
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:27,060
um this yeah this thing this thing seems so cool vibrant memories of it also and then one other

1693
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:32,660
just the set is like immaculate and they kind of kept it they kind of other shows I think beetle

1694
01:34:32,660 --> 01:34:37,700
juice this was replaced essentially by beetle juices graveyard review which had been at more

1695
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:41,780
of an outdoor venue and they moved it inside they didn't really change the set I think the special

1696
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:47,060
effects stages had some of the set too we've seen all these other things also that were filmed in

1697
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:52,020
this venue because it was giant just flashing onto something really what it was on that note

1698
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:59,220
I forgot so you said that this went to 94 yeah in 94 I was on a game show called shop till you drop

1699
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:05,700
oh yeah I was shot inside and I remember going oh my god this is the Conan Conan castle what really

1700
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:09,780
it was in there it wasn't supermarket sweep it was the one that was on right after it people often

1701
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:14,180
oh yeah oh my wife's very fond of it she'll be so excited yeah they may recreate the mall the mall

1702
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:18,260
and that was inside the castle now that I think when we finished our episode we were just

1703
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:23,940
like typical universal like okay you're done and we just went into the park wow really sweet

1704
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:30,740
wait a minute and was that so was it just built in front of was that like uh like all the

1705
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:36,660
or was the Conan stuff gone I don't know I don't remember because that set was so high

1706
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:41,220
and you it's a game show so they were very particular about you being in the green room

1707
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:48,100
and when they brought you to set you took a very clear path so I can't remember if I saw the Conan

1708
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:53,620
set there or not but it definitely was in there but that is it is like a double decker set on

1709
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:59,700
yeah right yeah yeah okay so that made sense is like a yeah it's got like established seating

1710
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:06,820
and you can build high interesting how'd you do we we did really well wow normally it was a uh

1711
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:10,820
like a couple man and woman and they did a battle of the sexes week and it was me and

1712
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:16,340
Jeff Davis who you might know from um whose line is anyway and actually he's on keys

1713
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:21,860
oh wait from the in the office too that guy I think somebody else I don't think he was on maybe

1714
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:29,380
but he played Harry at uh Harry and the hendersons at universal in the 90s also worked at Disney um

1715
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:34,100
and he and I went on there and just like with I say this with no pride we just obliterated the

1716
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:41,460
poor other people wow one every guy we went on a trip to Rome wow we I got red leather shoes and

1717
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:46,580
a handbag from my grandma uh we just won everything you could possibly win on that

1718
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:52,340
show didn't know that you could pay taxes on it so we surrendered a bunch of it but oh I think I was

1719
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:58,340
confused I think there's a chip Davis and now I recognize now oh wait yeah it's not Davis at all

1720
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:04,180
okay then I'm totally wrong I've seen their friends before okay oh gotcha oh cool cool um

1721
01:37:04,180 --> 01:37:10,900
geez what a wow to walk the the hallowed halls of the hallowed mall of I love that game show too

1722
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:17,860
yeah yeah I'm incredible I have that on VHS yeah still to this day oh wow wow geez wait and you

1723
01:37:17,860 --> 01:37:22,820
and then you do mall walk in another pocket so like so that ties right into this did you have

1724
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:28,980
the mall interest then and did that make you want to get on that show no I think because there was

1725
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:32,260
no you didn't need to declare your interest for malls because they were just everywhere and that

1726
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:37,380
was just it wasn't a niche thing yeah yeah so I guess I did but I didn't know until it took they

1727
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:42,100
took it away like probably most people feel yeah yeah yeah a piece of your your heart is missing

1728
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:48,900
geez well uh yeah great great history in this place multiple great sets the other really quick

1729
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:54,340
just to tie it together too uh perhaps part of a link exchange also we did a thing on our patreon

1730
01:37:54,340 --> 01:38:00,660
we were alerted to something called cyber mania 94 that was in this right uh I believe so yeah it

1731
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:08,660
was this was a uh like a an award show for you know vr and cd roms and like oh my cyber stuff

1732
01:38:08,660 --> 01:38:13,940
and it was hosted by unbelievable I say that with no hyperbole the celebrity lineup is yeah it's all

1733
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:18,900
on there it's all online okay here's what I need you to send me the the Dracula show backup stuff

1734
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:24,580
this thing uh I'll send you a Bob Rochelle video and if I can find that Conan one of

1735
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:30,260
just talking to some lady yeah yeah yes please um cyber mania 94 is is unbelievable if the

1736
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:33,540
listeners if you haven't heard this on our patreon what if it was absolutely blew our

1737
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:39,620
mind when talking about it and it was filmed in here so it's all spooky setting but it's

1738
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:46,340
up but then it's all host Leslie Nielsen talking about the cyber wave and the hackers are the wave

1739
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:52,820
of the future is it on the Conan set or just in the oh my god um which I love because it's mostly

1740
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:58,820
a huge pit they just yeah yes or what they might use it it's somebody might fall in a pit I'm not

1741
01:38:58,820 --> 01:39:05,860
sure but then there's one part where he goes outside he's like I don't know doc brown shows

1742
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:09,700
up I actually don't remember why doc brown has anything to do with it basically he ends up then

1743
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:17,220
going into he has like a gun battle in the wild west stunt show set and he does the big finale

1744
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:22,260
where the set falls onto the buster keaton thing where the window is perfectly uh over him and he

1745
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:28,660
doesn't get hurt so there is this magical weird award show that ties together both of our topics

1746
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:34,340
today as well as Leslie Nielsen these stunt shows would show up in so many random places there is a

1747
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:42,340
kids singing talent show in Australia that then visited and did a whole musical number on that

1748
01:39:42,340 --> 01:39:47,860
set and then Bob Rochelle's in it in a while stuntman there was a show called out of this world that

1749
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:52,020
was like a syndicated show do you remember it was like a girl who would talk to her alien dad

1750
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:58,660
swing on a star yeah she got lost on the Miami Vice stunt show set they would there would always

1751
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:04,180
be these episodes of people getting lost on these stunt shows or whatever like yeah well because

1752
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:09,620
then you could just like do all the gags and you can just run you know a big fat liar was on the

1753
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:14,660
the flash flood it well that's yes big fat liar just does every trick on the universal back line

1754
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:20,740
i think it might have been days of our lives a soap opera that did like a whole week on the wild

1772
01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:51,940
i'm sure you can i don't know why i didn't think of you in the first place we had some

1773
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:58,820
really strange development process because it was originally an amazon audible show and we were um

1774
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:03,220
got this deal done but the deal took longer than a television show and we had this exec who really

1775
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:08,660
got it and knew of us and then he disappeared and our exec we replaced was with his former nuclear

1776
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:16,580
arm specialist who's like giving us notes and then ultimately we got out of that did our own thing

1777
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:22,420
with it and ended up better for both versions of it kind of tightened us in a little bit but also

1778
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:29,140
we went back and loosened it up so oh wow wow so we like i said now that it's kind of more on our

1779
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:34,580
plate we would really come look for things like this to talk about yeah yeah please i would love

1780
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:38,420
to when you've had great people on too i just heard taryn killam was great who we just got to

1781
01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:44,420
meet on here and uh molly hockey's so funny oh yeah yeah fantastic uh great story yeah yeah please

1782
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:49,060
please listen to my stalker yes yeah i was trying to remember if you brought that up on our show

1783
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:55,300
i think you might have yeah yes your story of like giving a friendly wave to somebody who came to see

1784
01:42:55,380 --> 01:43:02,500
you do improv a california adventure and then it becomes your nightmare uh so so scary yeah great

1785
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:08,020
great stories on uh on keys to the kingdom oh i also was gonna say if we oh wait so tell us

1786
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:14,980
so this should be called the wild west stunt show not the wild why okay yeah that's just single

1787
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:22,420
wild yes it still makes it a very long title and i was i was thinking how we i think we could maybe

1788
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:27,300
just go for the record of longest title yeah but then i don't want to bury your name at the end

1789
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:32,020
with that with credit so i i think because i think you want it right over first so i'm going to

1790
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:36,980
declare here i think maybe the episode should be called matt gorley presents the adventures of

cone and a sword and sorcery spectacular and the wild west stunt show so listeners you've already
